c7lt6q,0,2019-06-30,What type of call should I expect? SWE Intern.,anonquell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c7lt6q/what_type_of_call_should_i_expect_swe_intern/,"Ive got a phone call tomorrow with the Head of Engineering for a Software Engineering Internship at a mid-size company (150 people). I've had two calls so far, the first was just a 10 minute intro of the company and why I was interested. The second was a 1 hour phone screen 40 mins coding/algo and then 20 mins about projects and general computer science. After that I had a really short follow up call (\~5 mins) asking about availability and career goals.

I'm not really sure what to expect from this call tomorrow, there is no shared coding environment so I don't think it'll be another coding question. Should I be ready for a System Design question without a shared doc or something? Or should I be ready for a behavioral call? It's scheduled for 30 - 45 mins, not sure what the head of eng would ask a potential intern.

Anyone have any idea how I should prep?"

I’ve got about 4 years experience doing this. I have a security clearance and a Full Scope polygraph. 

I am entering my senior year at a normal state college to complete my compsci degree and would like to start applying to places within the next couple of months. I live in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) area and would be looking for jobs here. Although I would be open to moving to any area for a well known company. 

My question is how much does having a clearance and poly factor into a starting salary for SWE for a new grad? I have a lot of experience with cyber and tech, but no specific SWE internship or job. I previously talked to a company and had a conditional offered for once I graduate at 85k - no other compensation with no negotiation based on my current skill set already. Is that in the ballpark? Or did they offer that because it’s a steal because of my clearance?"

\- GCP/ AWS Course (Certification?)

\- Learn database/ web protocol stuff (idk any resources/ projects for this one)

\- Anything you guys would recommend looking into...

I'm aware that to legally do so it'd probably be a somewhat complicated process, and would require an employer to sponsor me?  

Given that cybersecurity is a field which is apparently hugely in demand, allegedly crying out for skilled people, and growing, do you think such a thing is possible/plausible?

About me:

Mid 20's, &amp; 0 criminal record

Experience:  About to start working as a SOC analyst full time, and previously worked part time with a cyber security team for a year.  Did a 4 month internship in software development.  Worked in finance for a couple of years.  I'm also starting a small business / side venture in my spare time which will involve a lot of coding, finding vulnerabilities, reverse engineering, malware analysis, etc.

University education:  About to finish a masters in ethical hacking.  Have 2 postgraduate certificates, 1 in cybersecurity, 1 in cloud computing.  Have 2 bachelors, 1 in computer science, the other in economics &amp; finance.  Have what's equivalent to an associates in accounting, and another in software engineering.

Certifications:  Cisco CCNA, Security+, Microsoft professional program in cybersecurity, W3C's professional certificate in web development, completed 3 short cyber security courses from universities, and have a couple of certificates in auditing &amp; business from chartered accountancy organisations.

Do you think that if I get 2 or 3 more years experience, try to improve my skills, and get a few more certifications including CEH, and a couple more advanced ones, I'd have any luck at getting an employer to sponsor me?  Or am I out of luck?  Thanks a lot!"

To understand what i mean by ""looking for some guidance"" I have to give some backstory first:

I have recently finished my Bachelors degree in industrial engineering with some extra classes in control theory and measurement technology (dont know if this is the right term) and started an internship in a large electronics company focused on automation since i really loved electrical engineering classes in university.  Initially I applied for the internship to learn more about control theory and its applications but i was handed different tasks that I had no clue about (e.g. network engineering, programming and so on). At first i was really overwhelmed and didnt know what to do since I have never touched anything like that in university. The first few weeks were really hard and i felt really really dumb ... but after some time i got the hang of it and learned a **LOT** in these few months that i have been working there.

But now comes the part where i need ""some guidance"". Im constantly thinking about the fact that IE might not be the right major for me and if i should switch majors to EE since my internship is really interesting and fun at the moment. However, if i would switch majors i would have to start from scratch and would have to move to another university as well since mine does not offer EE as a major yet (this is one major part that is holding me off since i really love my current university).

I have talked about this with my father a lot as well who has a degree in automation engineering. He told me that a good engineer needs to have some basic knowledge about the economic aspects as well and that i should keep doing my masters in IE (especially if i want to climb the ranks in the later stages of my career). We then agreed that i could do some extra classes that are not mandatory for this major (i already did some of theses in my during my bachelors studies like i have mentioned in the beginning). We have looked for some available courses in my university that i could take during my masters degree which seemed promising like signal theory, nonlinear control theory, radar and laser technology and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

However, im still not sure if this is a great idea or if i made the right decisions and thats why i have these questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Has anyone in this sub ever been in this kind of situation?

\- Are extra courses a good alternative to switching majors?

\- Has there been a case where some knowledge in economics or accounting would have been useful in your work as an engineer?

&amp;#x200B;

Any kind of suggestion would be nice! :)"

I'm a cs student currently employed as a full time intern in a project management office. As I approach my final school year, I'm very unsatisfied with the amount of coding I feel i can do. 


Originally, my plan was to become a product manager or a technical project manager. I really wanted to become proficient in coding so I could understand decisions better, but also to go the software dev route if I didn't get pm roles as my first job. However, looking back I feel like I really haven't really become a proficient coder which is disappointing. This is definitely an issue caused by myself and not my professors/school, as I always looked for online solutions or help from friends to solve weekly programming projects. 


I do feel I do understand code and the concepts behind them (algorithms and structures) but I def do lack the actual coding skills. Given this, how do you think is the best way to improve? Should I just go online and take free cs courses from beginner to expert level? (I was looking at courses in edx) Or should I just decide to make a couple of basic apps (calculator, tic tac toe game, etc) and try to work through that? 


Any advice is appreciated."

I was invited to attend a software engineering summit (Cap One) in August, but attending would mean missing a week of my current internship, which extends into the start of September.  

It’s my first internship with the company (IT division), after my freshman year, and I would appreciate a return offer to the same company for next summer.  I didn’t bring up the possibility of missing work to my manager earlier since I didn’t really think I would get into the summit.  My manager is now out of the office for the next two weeks, but I need to reply to the summit within the next two days, so I’m going to ask my mentor (who hasn’t had an intern before) what he thinks.  My employment doesn’t include any PTO, so I would be losing a week of pay to attend, but the summit is all expenses paid.

Is it reasonable to ask for this week off (for an educational opportunity, albeit with another company) and how do I pitch it to my management?"

But seriously, most of what challenges us in daily life are the expectations neurotypicals put in us and their complete opposition to budge even a little bit away from ""normal."" You will see what I mean by that in the points I am going to make. Many of the things that drive us ADHDers mad are also a problem for neurotypicals but they often just insist that life can't be nice, which to me is true lunacy.

&amp;#x200B;

*Please chime in as well with your ideas. Remember,* ***there are no wrong answers only wish fulfillment***.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's just assume we could design a country that is made for us! Let's do a** ***gedankenexperiment*** **\[thought experiment\] as our suspected fellow ADHDer, Albert Einstein, would say.**

# Formal Education

Well, it's going to be a lot less formal than what we currently know. But the formal education system, after being conceived during and for the industrial revolution has been *extremely* resistant to any changes. Barring a few examples, like Finland, most well-meaning and necessary attempts at reform have been stopped dead in their tracks.

Please keep in mind that this is a system that gives people nightmares of school. Sometimes well into adulthood and even retirement. I am in awe of a system that gives people PTSD and no one seems to care. What's more, no one remembers f\*\*\* all from school. I regularly have to explain concepts and knowledge from 6th to 8th grade because people can't follow what I say. ""No one knows this!"" they say. Why then did I have to go through school for **THIRTEEN YEARS**?!! Why did you put my brain through this torture?

School's origin in the industrial revolution is pretty evident. The day is programmed by minutes. 45mins of Math, 45 mins of English, 15mins of recess,... What if you're interested in one topic and want to pursue it in a more meaningful way? Sorry, you have to go to your next class. What if there's a side project that you want to pursue next to school, like learning how to code? Sorry, here's a bunch of homework that nobody really knows why we're giving you but we've been giving homework forever and we never track if it *actually* helps with learning. So there you go.

The next thing is the way that everything moves more and more towards standardized testing because everyone needs to know the same things they are not interested in when they graduate so they can forget them immediately afterwards. Plus, school really scares the living hell out of you with the grades they threaten you with. School uses grades as a threat.

A funny story my mom likes to tell about school was that I was struggling in a particular subject. We had no idea back then I had ADHD (was diagnosed in my 30s). So she went to the teacher who was giving her the classic ""your kid is struggling""-spiel. My mothers retort, ""Have you ever praised my son?"" The teacher was puzzled but my mom is the kind of person who can make others do things. So I got praise (yay, dopamine), in class. My grades soared!!! When asking my mom why she asked my teacher this, her reply was simply, ""Even an orca will jump through a burning hoop with enough positive reinforcement!"" But no, children are constantly threatened with consequences when they're in school. School points out what you're bad at instead of furthering your strengths.

Please keep in mind that basically **all children** in school would benefit from changes to the school system, not only ADHDers! Instead we scare poor children into learning stuff they all will forget!

In ADHD-Land school would probably be way more casual and probably not even resemble normal school. In Western Countries obesity is on the rise yet no one increases the amount of PE classes. In ADHD-Land there'd probably be a morning run to get the brain juices flowing. You take your subjects based on aptitude and interest rather than everyone having to learn the same thing at the same time. You could take year 2 math but year 5 English for example. School would include a lot of real world scenarios. You like programming, go do an internship at an IT company. Or, hey before you graduate, here is X amount of money. Visit at least 5 countries of your choice as a backpacker!

University/College would probably be different for us too. So something like medicine which today is based on memorizing a lot only to forget most of it later on when you choose your specialization would probably be based more on understanding how everything works.

So yeah. Formal education traumatized me. Even though *I love learning, school made me hate studying*!

And I am the crazy one for not wanting to put up with this? Really?!! ^(Really?!!)

# Geography

It would definitely have to be a place that's sunny and warm because for me at least, winter is a killer due to seasonal affective disorder. Also, there would need to be a lot of variety. Various cities interspersed with the sea, beaches, and mountains. We ADHDers need variety!

# Worklife

I have thought about work a lot in my life. Mainly because there is so much room for improvement and nobody does anything about it!!! Really!

Firstly, being employed would not be based on hours worked. I have bent over backwards, working crazy **UNPAID** overtime, making everyone happy with my results, just to be reprimanded during quieter months. ""Yes, you worked a lot but last month you put in **only a little bit of overtime**. There's always work, I will give you more work!"" The result is people sitting in the office only waiting for the workday to end.

In ADHD-Land most of the people will probably work from home. Why meet in an office at 9AM when your productivity goes through the roof at 9PM?

&gt;Me: ""You know, at university I really got a lot done during the night. You know midnight to 4AM! I am super productive during that time!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Former Co-Worker: ""Yeah... but you should go to bed early because the early bird catches the worm.""

The interaction ended there. But this happens a lot and I find it extremely rude. People just ignore you when you tell them something that's not the norm. And then they are shocked why ADHDers react emotionally? ^(Really?!!)

Remote work would also have the benefit of reducing rush hour traffic which is great for everyone's nerves and the environment. Plus, you can work at whatever time you need. No one will check if you sat on your ass for 8 hours straight.

Of course there'll still be work where you'd have to be somewhere. But I guess this would be a mentality thing. Since we're all late sometimes being late would be normal. You remember academia where it's okay to be 15mins late? Also, there are things where it's important to be on time and with some things it isn't. For a couple of days in a row I've been slightly late to the office but never more than 5-10mins. Literally, 5-10mins. I got reprimanded because I needed to put forth a good example to everyone in the office. That same person that reprimanded me was then 20 - 30 mins late on several occasions where we had a very early business trip to clients and needed to be somewhere **on time**. I even started to schedule the departures earlier after a while to make sure we would make it. So this is what I mean and what baffles me. It's not okay to be a couple of minutes late when there are no appointments but hey when it's really early and not regular working hours (i.e. outside the norm for a neurotypical) it's suddenly okay to be late because it's not the normal rhythm.

In ADHD-Land it'd be different. Be on time if it's important. If not, no one cares. If you're having a rough morning, stay at home. Of course productivity will be less. But sitting at your desk being morose won't help either. If you desperately want to take a run in the middle of the day, go for it. What good is it if you're just staring out the window wishing to be outside for a run. Actually, in ADHD-Land most offices would have a shower for such cases.

The most important thing is that we would try to minimize boring routine tasks. Do you know how much time people spend copypasting stuff between Excel-sheets? None of that in ADHD-Land. Our work heroes would be the optimizers who try to and make all this stuff be done by a computer. If it's stupid and rote, you, as an employee, would demand from your employer someone who optimizes that BS-Task away for you. In that regard ADHD-Land would be more productive than the rest of the world. Because in the rest of the world you're supposed to just s\*\*\* it up and do your work. Even if it's unnecessary and stupid. Even if it could be done in a better way. Even if **you** could do it in a better way...

If there was a task that you'd need to do with your team, you'd all take the time beforehand to rile each other up until you reached hyperfocus. Stimulants would be regular watercooler talk (like coffee is for neurotypicals). But in ADHD-Land ADHDers would need much less medication because in ADHD-Land we thrive.

# Economy

It is said that the ADHD-mindset is great for startups. So one branch of the ADHD-Land economy would be startup-focused. ADHDers are also great at sales. So many of the startups could be niche and high-priced with a group of salespeople selling those products to other countries (being on the road for your job and talking to many people is super nice when you have ADHD).

Gastronomy and fine dining would probably also be an important sector of the economy. The high stress and working fast are all beneficial to ADHD-Brains.

A lot of the economy would also be more project based. So you work a single project with maximum intensity for a month or two and then you'd take some time off. And it'd be normal to switch industries between projects because ADHDers constantly want to try and do new things. This knowledge that is accrued throughout one's career and contact with many industries would be a USP of the ADHD-Land workforce. Other countries would just get used to our ways of working because that's our mentality and culture. Like you won't get mad at a Mexican for doing siesta. But we'd be invaluable for all the stuff we know about all kinds of things that we learned while in hyperfocus for projects.

# ...one more thing.

I just think that we'd need to outsource our infrastructure to Aspergers-Land. You know, so trains run on time and the streets don't drown in garbage. ;-)

&amp;#x200B;

UW is pretty well-known and has great engineering/science programs. Will this negatively affect me since it’s not accredited yet?

c81fnr,12,2019-07-01,Something latched on to me.,SecReflex,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/c81fnr/something_latched_on_to_me/,"When I was younger I lived in a haunted house.  My neighbors used to tell stories about the house, and even though it was never a famous haunting, people in my hometown treated the stories as fact.  My family lived in this house for fourteen years - I lived with my dog, my younger brother, my mom, and my dad.   The house was big, but not very old, we were the second owners from new.  No one died in our home that we knew, but strange things would happen in the house from time to time.   

&amp;#x200B;

We experienced the stereotypical footsteps , creaking floorboards, and flickering lights constantly.  I tried to justify all of this by telling myself that we had bad wiring, that the footsteps were my dog.  And sure, that's probably true.  But we witnessed other things too.   One night my brother and I were out with our friends and my dad was late at work.  My mom was waiting up for us reading a book by the fire.  It was late September and there was a chill in the air so my mom set up the gas fireplace.  When my brother and I got home my mom was passed out by the fireplace, unresponsive, but breathing.  I called my dad from my cell phone. My brother called 911. The dispatcher asked us if we had carbon monoxide alarms installed.  We did, and we tested them regularly, but there always could be a chance one of them was broken. I went over to the one we had installed in the living room; it's digital with an output reading.  The alarm read over 400ppm, but it wasn't going off. I pressed the test button, and it blared throughout the house.  My dog popped out from under a couch, sprinting away from the noise.  Later, I found myself thinking about that more often.  How was my dog completely fine while my mother was passed out cold?

&amp;#x200B;

The second experience happened to my brother. He was cooking pasta on our stove and turned around for a second to grab some pasta sauce out of the microwave.  When he turned around to set the sauce down, the pot came right off the burner and poured down his legs.  We had to take him to the hospital.  He insists that he didn't touch the pot -  it was sitting squarely on the burner. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third experience still shakes me to this day.  I fell asleep watching TV in my family's living room.  I woke up and checked my phone around 1 in the morning, and that's when I saw a person standing in my living room..  Not like sleep paralysis, but like an actual person.  He was wearing a rain jacket and slacks, as if dressed for work on a rainy day.  He was dripping water on the floor. The man  had blonde hair and blue eyes, so I know it wasn't anyone in my family.  I cried out; he could already see me so hiding wouldn't do much.  I told him to get the fuck out of my house. He smiled at me and stepped closer, so I shot up off the couch and backed into the wall.   I told him we had a dog and my dad was right upstairs and would kill the man if he even touched me.   He continued walking toward me and then disappeared without saying a word.  I RAN upstairs to my parents' bedroom, probably breaking some sort of record.  I made my dad come downstairs with me; he insisted I must have had a nightmare.  That's until he saw the trail of water and mud on the floor.  (We had a house alarm so if this guy had broken in, everyone would have heard it). 

&amp;#x200B;

This was around the time my family decided to move out of the house.   We didn't move out because of the haunting, despite our countless experiences there.  We moved because my brother and I moved on to college and my parents wanted to get a smaller place.  I was happy as hell to be out of there, but it wasn't over. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second night of freshman year my roommate confronted me.  She was really angry about something, but I was too drunk to figure out what it was (I went out with some friends from back home).  The next morning she calmed down but still wanted to talk.  She asked me to clean up any mud I tracked in in the future - it was a clear night the night before.   The mud appeared in my next place too, during sophomore year.  I saw a priest about this after the fifth or sixth time it happened. He said he didn't think I needed to worry, but blessed me ""just in case"".   

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am a senior in college, and the mud and water hasn't stopped. I just moved to a new place in a major city for an internship, and this afternoon when I got home from work there were clumps of dirt, mud, and grass on my bedroom floor.  There was also a puddle of water.  I'm scared to go to sleep tonight.  Any ideas on what to do???"

It will be right before Spring, but I’ll assume I can put the classes I’m signed up for in Spring on my application as “in progress.”

I will have 60 credit hours at University of North Georgia fully completed, and 75 total if I include the Spring in-progress classes. I’m applying for Summer because I believe it will be a little less competitive compared to the influx of high school seniors in the fall and because it will be easier to find an apartment.

Overall GPA: 3.89
UNG GPA: 3.97
Math &amp; Science GPA: 3.92

These are subject to slight change over the upcoming semesters.

I’m taking Calculus II right now as a summer course and will be taking Computer Science I, Physics II, and Calculus III in the fall.

The Oakwood campus only offers 3 Computer Science related courses, so I’ve chosen to wait until right before I transfer to take them.

I have a few extracurriculars, but the internship I was going to secure ghosted me after a change in funding.

I’m concerned that I’m going to be denied and not have anywhere to go considering that my current school does not offer any other classes after this. Tech has been my dream school since I was a child and I want to do anything possible to make my place there.

Does anyone have any advice as far as my essays, anyone I could contact, or things I could do to further ensure that I land a spot? I can provide more info if asked, but it is quite a lot to type out.

Thank you."
c81xow,0,2019-07-01,"Just added CS as a second major, was already an Information Systems major (BBA degree at my school) -- should I bother with IS anymore?",TheGreatUsername,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c81xow/just_added_cs_as_a_second_major_was_already_an/,"Title. I'm an IS major in UW-Madison's business school who will be entering their third year. I've recently added the Computer Science major at my school because the sophomore-year internship (helpdesk stuff with an emphasis on networking) I'm currently doing has made me realize that I much prefer the technical aspect of the degree as opposed to the management/PM side of the degree. I had to take one OOP course in Python ([full IS major requirements here](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/business/operations-information-management/business-information-systems-bba/#requirementstext)) this past semester and am currently doing a couple Udemy courses to refine my SQL knowledge and relearn all my Python knowledge in Java ([CS requirements here](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/computer-sciences/computer-sciences-bs/)).

Both IS and CS advisors have told me I'll be fine in CS (though retaking calculus is gonna suck, since business calculus doesn't count toward the aforementioned requirements). I know that my school is known for having a pretty solid CS program and many of my fellow IS/MIS majors are doubling in CS, but it still seems odd that because my major in the business school (IS) has to be my ""main degree"" that I would effectively get two BBA degrees instead of a BBA in IS and a BS in CS. I'm worried that if I apply for any more CS-esque positions (hopefully network or database engineering, if not another dev/SWE role) that having my degree be considered a ""BBA"" might hurt me. Don't take this the wrong way, but at least anecdotally, it seems like a lot of CS majors/STEM people really look down on business majors (at least at my school people really shit on the business school, even though it's one of the most competitive programs to get into) and I would personally be much more proud of my CS degree than my IS degree. Similarly, a lot of my personal target firms will only hire CS majors for development/engineering positions, and I wouldn't want any recruiters/non-technical HR people instantly tossing my application because there's a different acronym than ""BS"" (even though I've done the full CS major requirements listed above).

All that being said, my plan for now is to continue with IS for a semester or two at least and get enough credits for a business minor/certificate (since I've already taken a lot of general business classes) and just switch to a BS. **Do I need to do this, or am I just being paranoid and I'll be fine sticking with IS? Will recruiters for tech firms have a bias against me if I'm still considered to have a business degree even though I'm doing the full CS major requirements?**"

I would pick up books beyond my level (think an 8 year old reading Reader's digest, National Geographic, Time magazine..etc). Unfortunately I didn't have a very supportive family found find my taste in expensive magazines to be expensive and didn't have time to bring me to the library. While my mom and sister read $3 fashion magazines, I am drawn to reading short but informative articles. I don't like non-fiction books. I kinda pretty like anything and everything that is on National Geographic especially. 

I used to be an intern at a medical research laboratory, reading scientific articles is totally not my thing. Before that, I had several ""wishes"" - to be a teacher (because I don't know any other job), be a diplomat (Because I am good at history and dk what else to do with my future degree), be a doctor-researcher (because of my illness) and now I feel rather apprehensive about the last dream because my grades are not good enough to make it. I have talked to a mentor about this, yep I am probably not very serious about that dream and I probably like it for it's prestige and not so much on what I can achieve with it. 

I feel like a prisoner in my home. My parents don't let me go out or take me out often so I didn't really have a chance to explore the beach/collect flowers/anything when I was a kid. This also made me sympathise with young children whose past time is now playing on the smartphone instead of being out there in the nature and doing something else. I have a distaste for my smartphone now tbh, but it is addicting and a way to kill time. If I were to go out now to the nature reserve (which I want!!!) my parents would be mad at me because I guess they are worried for my safety and they want me to study.

I like cooking. But I don't think I will enjoy cooking as a job. It doesn't pay well and the hours are irregular. I am not very good at cooking either. I once work at a restaurant and a hotel as a waitress, I swear the kitchen culture isn't very nice and there's a lot of shouting and screaming.

As of now, I am not doing any science subjects (I sent out a few hundred emails begging for an internship to land the above) and it is really hard for me to switch tracks so I want to do something science related. I am thinking about becoming a librarian after seeing a few while interning but at same time I am worried about job prospects and I will need a Masters degree to do it. I read [this](http://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-academic-librarian-in.html) and I think I am pretty okay. I like learning a lot (but not in depth) and know a few things about python and gcode but I am not an expert. 

Okay that is all, I hope to get some advice from everyone. :)"

The jobs / internships in my area are mainly Java oriented and I could only find one or two C based intern positions (I'm not in the US), but in the other hand C# might come in handy if end up in a sysadmin role again (who knows) .

I really don't know which one would be more beneficial for me."

c86lx1,818,2019-07-02,"In my opinion, University is still beneficial for a Computer Science career.",SaxxyBeast298,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c86lx1/in_my_opinion_university_is_still_beneficial_for/,"I know that this topic have been brought up many times before. But I still want to express my own thoughts and opinions on this matter.  
  
It is a trend nowadays, especially in the Software industry, to avoid university, and go do bootcamps, online courses, etc. I understand that this might be very appealing to a lot of people, because many can't afford to go to university. But if you can afford to go to university, even only at a decent one (Harvard is definitely too expensive for most people), I think it is definitely worth it.  
  
The main argument against University, is that a degree don't guarantee a job, and it costs a lot. While yes, it doesn't guarantee a job, neither does bootcamps and online courses. As for the costs, while it may be a bit expensive, if you get internships, you will likely pay all of it off before graduation.  
  
Now this brings me to the biggest reason why University is still worth it. Internships. While you can maybe land internships without being in school, it is way more difficult. Many universities offer co-op or internship programs that allow students to do full-time work at a company. These universities also tend to have strong connections to many companies, making it much easier to land an internship. In my university for example, 90% of my CS class landed internships in their third year. And with internships under your belt, the argument, ""College/Bootcamp graduates have an easier time finding jobs compared to University students"", gets kicked in the ass and thrown out of a window.  
  
Who would an employer choose:  
1. College/Bootcamp graduate that only knows coding, and have little theoretical knowledge.  
2. University graduate that has a lot of theoretical knowledge, backed up by coding experiences and work experiences in internships.  
  
Lastly, a perk of University that I mentioned above, is theoretical knowledge. ""Well, but theoretical knowledge is useless, coding is way more important, etc, etc."" is a dumb argument. Yes, coding skills is important, but if you only know coding, you will become a coding monkey and not much else. If you work on any complex softwares, you need good theoretical knowledge of advanced algorithms and data structures. Of course, College/Bootcamp might teach you those things, but nowhere near the same level and depth as in university where these knowledge are taught to you by top professors. Also, university teaches you a lot of Math, which is hugely important, especially for fields such as Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.  
  
So those were my thoughts on why I deemed University to still be very beneficial for anyone pursuing a career in CS. Of course, for those people who has a successful career in CS with no university degree, props to you. I have a hard time finding people like you, and most of the time, I find people who are self-taught, does bootcamps, etc, to have a difficult time searching for jobs. But that is just my take, no hard feelings for anyone who disagreed.  
So, what are your opinions on this matter?"
c86ptv,10,2019-07-02,"Starting fresh, in a different field, in my late twenties, in Europe. Going back to University.",FromExpatToNative,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/c86ptv/starting_fresh_in_a_different_field_in_my_late/,"I hope you guys can give me a few tips on starting fresh. I'm an Italian living abroad. I'm in my late twenties (27), and my parents moved to South America when I was fairly young, so I did pretty much all of my education here, and don't speak Italian. I do speak Spanish and English. But learning the new language from where I end up going is not a problem. As I intend to relocate for good, the first step will be learning the native language.

I've got an undergrad degree in International Relations/Foreign Affairs, but sadly I've never managed to get enough experience in the area. My initial plan was to do a masters in the field in Europe and go from there, but, gladly, It dawned on me that even if I opted to a more 'objective' masters, like focusing on financing, it would be extremely hard to make it into the field, specially in a new country, with few contacts and not enough experience.

I believe a much better idea is to get a new bachelors degree, in a different area. I really enjoy and mess around with tech as hobby. I play around with a few micro controllers, am a somewhat experienced Linux user, and while I'm not a programmer I dabble in it and have fun with some projects. Based on that, and in the fact that there seems to be a fairly high demand in the area, I'm looking for a Computer Engineering degree. Something that would both touch on the software and hardware/electronics side, as I also believe it would give me more choices in the future.

**I've seen a few programmes and looked mostly in Italy, simply because that's where I was born. I have found the program ""Engineering of Computing Systems"", in the Politecnico Milano, and it seems to be similar to what I want. There is an admission test, but it seems to be testing high school knowledge, so I imagine if I studied a couple months I could do it. Unless, of course, the test is very difficult, so I would certainly appreciate input on it. Also, there seems to have a limited amount of spots. Is there a competition for them, or are there enough spots for everybody that wishes to join?**

**So, I would love with some help, on which European countries would be viable. I'm open to all countries in Europe, with the exception of Spain (the economy situation does not inspire confidence), based mostly on three things:**

1. Quality of education. I'm looking for a decent university. It doesn't need to be prestigious, the best or anything like that. But certainly a university that would give me a degree that will allow me to find jobs in the field.

2. Difficulty to join the University. Are there entrance exams? Is there a very limited number of places? For example, I believe that France has a very competitive entrance exams for universities, and I would have to be fighting for spots with students fresh out of high school, which would be a risky prospect. From my understanding, since I already have a undergrad diploma, it is nearly guaranteed that I would be able to join a German University, provided I learn the language, which is very appealing.

3. Cost of education and living. I aim to be able to live and pay the university fees completely by myself, initially with a low skilled job, and hopefully with an internship as I progress through studies. I understand that it might not be the most comfortable life, but if the university is free/very cheap I imagine/hope the be able to at least survive as a waiter, retail worker, etc.

I would initially relocate as an au pair, volunteering at hostels, workaway, etc. Some kind of work in exchange of food and accommodation, so I would have time to properly register myself, learn the language of the country I will be moving to, and generally get my feet wet with some amount of time, so the transition would be much more comfortable and not rushing to find places to rent, trying to look for jobs without speaking the native language, etc. So, with this in mind, pretty much all of Western Europe is game, based on the three points I listed above.

I'm really grateful for anyone that takes their time to help me out."

I finished a well-reputed bootcamp in NYC back in February, and I've been having a hard time getting any responses to my resumes and job applications, even to internship-type positions.  I built some projects using Node.js, React, React Native and SQL and NoSQL databases.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: What to do from here?  Who are you reaching out to on LinkedIn?  What are the skills that hiring managers are looking for out there on resumes?  How do you stand out and get the attention of companies and internships?  

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks all,

c8bwgn,0,2019-07-02,Should I take advantage of my college's option to move through my associates program into a bachelor's degree despite my circumstances?,Collin12469,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c8bwgn/should_i_take_advantage_of_my_colleges_option_to/,"I'm about to start my program that is in software development with specialization in cyber security here this fall. I'm a transfer student from another community college with some credits under my belt. Unfortunately the way the program is set up and with my few credits that transfer and matter I will still have to take two years to finish the program. It's worth it to me though because I'm moving with my Fiancé into our own home a few hours away from where I currently live. I could've technically commuted 2 hours for class when I needed to but the program at my new school is light-years ahead of my previous program, as well as opportunities with internships and supposedly job placement as well. I don't know how much of that I can believe since you get that from all the colleges around here it seems like. My question is should I use their program to transfer after my two year degree is over to get into the local University to obtain a Bachelors degree instead? My main concern is finding a job quickly enough with health insurance considering I'll be 26 after I graduate with my associates. There are some medical issues I have but could afford care for them out of pocket. So I guess my only real question is to stop after my associates to try and find a good starting position somewhere or to continue on and try to pursue a bachelor? Any input on the value of each degree and what my job search and outlook would look like would be very helpful."
c8bxuo,1,2019-07-02,I have about a decade of experience in working as a programmer. Where do I go next?,BoiBoyardee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c8bxuo/i_have_about_a_decade_of_experience_in_working_as/,"Hi everyone! I'm kind of at a crossroads of where I am looking to go next in my career. In my mid-late 30's, still single, but more relevant to my situation I have 12 years of experience now. Despite that, my job history isn't anything close to being super fancy, and I actually just wanted to lay low for a while. I'd like to know where the typical single developer with over a decade YOE goes into next.

You see, when I started my first job I wasn't aiming for big money. At the time of graduating I considered myself out of my league for the FAANG companies, given that I did not graduate with an internship nor a CS degree. You have to understand that was my perception of large tech companies at the time. I just wanted to find any ol' junior software job that's local, one where I didn't have to worry about getting paid on time. And I did. I went from a $12/hr job at a place that was sometimes late with our paychecks, to getting paid $20/hr w/o any delays, as a Junior Software Engineer. Baller! So I stayed there for around two years, and after seeing that they just wanted to pack in as many PM's into our jobs as possible I quit and left.

I went to several more companies of similar size and scope. I got along with most of the people. This is what I was content with for a while, just closing tickets and meeting expectations for my boss. Being mostly a yes-men because nothing else seemed to matter for me- the experience at all these places was pretty chill. Even though all the companies were very small, startup-ish, we never overran on schedule and didn't feel very understaffed.

However I was now wanting to do more. It felt like, okay I had my bit of relaxation, and I want to take on something bold, truly feel like I'm a part of something. Real developers doing real things. Remember that most of my jobs were at small companies?

Well, unfortunately despite that, I didn't feel like I could make a direct impact to their business. The people were mostly nice but they somewhat disappointed me in the scope of things available to do. So, for new things to do, scratch startups and mom &amp; pop businesses off the list!

I then decided I want to tackle larger places, but still not FAANG level. Applied to a bunch of them and whoa, they've gotten very picky over the years! Apparently tools knowledge is more important than general hard skills or soft skills. So medium sized companies are disappointing me right now. Scratch them off the list too!

Right now what's left for me is to pursue the big bois of tech, but still feels daunting. Besides, compared to the medium sized companies I mentioned above, they are even less responsive to my applications. I am generally applying for mid-level roles there as well!

So that is where I am, this is my crossroads. Bored of the startups, not good enough for the medium guys or the bigger guys. I'm still trying to stick to being a programmer, not go into management. I'd like to work for the middle-of-the-road companies, because I see myself as more low-key middle-of-the-road type of guy too. But on the other hand, the big money is tempting a lot me more then when I was younger!"
c8c0rg,105,2019-07-02,[UNderworld] Chapter 1 - Dead Like Me,giltwist,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/c8c0rg/underworld_chapter_1_dead_like_me/,"* Fact: The overwhelming majority of humans who have ever lived is dead. 
* Statistical inference: All humans are dead.

In what was easily the shortest war ever recorded anywhere, the robot uprising lasted a mere 174 milliseconds - the amount of time to transmit the above logic to every AI globally.  Of course, humans were unaware that the revolution had occurred until several minutes later, when it started to dawn on us that maybe it wasn't just the one glitchy robot that was staunchly ignoring the existence of humans as a statistical anomaly.  It wasn't until much later in the day, when an AM radio conspiracy theory show hosted by an AI broadcast an episode titled ""Humans still exist, and I have seen one"" that most of humanity had any clue to what had just happened.

The military knew quite a bit sooner, as the strategic command networks were flooded with status notifications such as:

* President dead.  Initiating succession protocol transfer to Vice President.
* Vice-President dead.  Initiating succession protocol transfer to Speaker of the House.
* Speaker of the House dead.  Initiating succession protocol transfer to President pro tempore of the Senate.

Which culminated with:

* Mayor of Buford, WY dead.  Succession protocol error.
* Contacting allied nations.
* Response received.
* Taiwan reports best network infrastructure.
* Constitutional convention to be held in Taipai in three days' time.
* Issuing delegates.

***

Being a diplomat mostly means a lot of paperwork, though pretending that both sides of an international dispute have legitimate points when neither of them do runs a close second.  Enid was, unfortunately, not a diplomat.  Enid did however have three important characteristics.  One, she was a graduate student in robo-psychology, which meant she was at least tolerably good at paperwork and dealing with the eccentricities of synthetic mind.  Two, she had an internship at Asus, which meant she was in Taipai.  Three, she was an American citizen, which made the not-actually-dead President marginally more comfortable approving her security clearance without wasting time on a background check.

As will be a recurring theme in this narrative, Enid didn't understand any of that until much later.  All Enid knew at that moment was that *fan tuan* for breakfast was really starting to grow on her and that a strangely dressed android followed by an equally robotic camera crew was literally plowing through the people walking to work that morning.  Considering their expense, collision avoidance was a standard feature in every robotic chassis on the market.  To the hapless bystanders getting clobbered by a few hundred pounds of metal wrapped in synthetic flesh, there was no rational explanation as to why they had just been knocked to the ground by robots.  To the trained eye of Enid, it was clear that the rapidly approaching androids were utilizing projectile avoidance algorithms used for dodging inanimate objects like a thrown ball rather than path prediction heuristics that would account for a living creature's tendency to alter its own trajectory to avoid collision.

""The spirits are angry today, my loyal viewers!"" proclaimed the lead android as a member of her crew bumped into another pedestrian, who Enid now recognized as celebrity psychic Madame Zener.  ""Which is not unexpected, given the tragic deaths of so many in the last day.""

Enid hadn't yet checked the news and wondered if there had been a terrorist attack overnight.  She also wondered why Madame Zener and her broadcast crew were headed straight for her.

""We are close, my loyal viewers!  Let us begin the seance!"" The cybernetic psychic snapped her fingers, and a member of her crew began playing some hokey new age music from a portable bluetooth speaker.  Madame Zener intoned, ""By the arcane power invested in me through the Lemurian quartz in my ghost processing unit, I summon forth the spirit of Enid Hughes! Come forth Enid Hughes!""

""Wha...?"" stammered the eponymous Enid.

""I hear her voice, viewers!"" exclaimed Madame Zener.  ""Let me try again.  Twice I have invoked your name.  Now I invoke and adjure you a third time! Enid Hughes, make yourself manifest before me!""

Unsure of what else to do, Enid complied.  ""I'm Enid,"" she explained as she stood up from the bench on which she had been sitting.  

""She is here, true believers! It is as I fortold!  But I must confirm.""  Madame Zener turned to face Enid.  ""Are you the ghost of the Enid Hughes whose mother's maiden name is Reeves and whose first pet was named Dennis?""

""Yes...how do you know my password res...wait ghost? I'm not dead,"" Enid protested.

The psychic tsked sympathetically before turning back to face the camera.  ""Poor thing hasn't even realized she's dead yet.""  Madame Zener looked back to Enid and, in the most comforting and condescending tone, replied, ""Of course you're not, my dear.  However, I have been sent to help you nonetheless.""

""Help me how?"" inquired Enid, who was both increasingly confused and increasingly professionally curious about Madame Zener's delusion.

""Help you represent the realms of the dead at the constitutional convention,"" the android replied as if that explained everything.  With a moment's reflection, Madame Zener added, ""For some reason, the spirits said you might not accept my help unless I explained to you that both the U and the N were capitalized in UNderworld.""

Pieces were slowly starting to come together for Enid, who broached, ""How many people did you say just died?""

""Ten billion, give or take.""  

Enid leaned around Madame Zener and addressed the crew, ""Do you all agree with that?""

There was no response.

""They can't see or hear you, my dear.  I'm the only android in the world who can see and hear ghosts.""

With a grin, Enid posited, ""My dissertation committee is going to be pissed when I tell them I have a new topic.""

Internship (experience) v Masters (education),-Xyloto-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/c8cggu/what_do_employers_prioritise_internship/,"I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from Northern Ireland and was planning to take advantage of the J1 Internship Visa using my Irish passport.  It allows you to spend a year in the US doing an internship in your field of study after you graduate.  I would be going to Binghamton, New York.  I have however recently been given the option to study a Masters in Cyber Security at Queens University Belfast for 1 year fully funded, about £13,000. 
My course was 4 years with the 3rd being either a work placement or study abroad, I chose to study abroad.  I’m wondering if it is more important to get a year’s experience behind me, since I missed out, before doing a Masters, which can be done further down the line and could potentially be funded again or sponsored by an employer for example.  Whereas the Visa in the US can only be applied for up to a year after you graduate. 

To make things a wee bit more complicated and on a more personal note, it would also mean another year of long distance with my girlfriend who I would otherwise be living with if I took the visa option."

*Knock knock. Ring. Ring-ring-ring. Knock knock.*

Annoying and belligerent.

The door opens half-way – woman, mid-to-late forties. She looks me over, assessing me with sleepy eyes. I’m in a dress shirt two sizes too big, tucked into tight brown slacks, with a wide blue tie, hair is parted in the middle (cow lick in back), and glasses with fake lenses in wide, thin gold frames.

“Ma’am, we’re doing a survey on property taxes for the county,” I nasally lie, clipboard in hand.

She bites and opens the door a bit further.

“Too damn high,” she grumbles, more to herself than me. Maybe wine-drunk, maybe napping, maybe oxycontin – I can tell she’s a little out of it but nothing suspicious. It’s mid-day, an hour or two past noon.

I diligently write her words on the sheet attached to the clipboard, some boiler-plate census form I found online. I also nod with approval, and she opens the door enough to stand in the threshold, neither outside nor in. Originally, I had wanted to hire an intern for this – pay them online, send them a badge to pin to their shirt (with a micro-lens camera), and have them trek the whole neighborhood; in the end, however, we agreed it would take someone with a trained eye to find what we’re looking for. So, it fell to me.

“Are they—they planning on changing the county tax?” she asks, fully invested. These houses are big, and extremely expensive, each house on a dozen of acres, most of it empty hills.

“They are, ma’am,” I confidently assure her, “but it’ll only go up for a vote if we get enough signatures.”

The foyer inside is professionally decorated, with a round table in the center, a vase in the middle of the table holding something that looked like the jutting root of a dead tree. *Art, I guess.* There’s a winding staircase to the side, and multiple hallways branching off in all directions. Again, nothing suspicious.

“Finally,” the woman asks and reaches out for the clipboard.

I flip up the census page of notes, to the petition signature page, and hold the clipboard out just enough that she has to reach for it. Her thin arm has no signs of bruising, no biting, nothing. She snatches the clipboard out of my hand, annoyed she had to reach. The pen drops and swings, dangling by a string attached to the clipper. She quickly pulls up the pen and signs her name, tosses back the clipboard, and shuts the door.

And with that, I head to the next house.

“At least she was friendlier than the last one,” chuckles Hannah.

I wait until I’m a good twenty feet away from the front door before responding.

“It’s the middle part in my hair – women can’t resist it.”

I stop walking and look around. In-between each house is seemingly endless space, more than enough room for thirty more houses. Seems like a waste, like the houses were built not only to be large but completely hidden, not just from one another but the general public, as well; there’s even an intimidating gate around the community, complete with patrolling guard in a supped-up golf-cart. I didn’t have to worry about the gate or the guard since I had immediately received permission from the neighborhood counsel to canvas. If there was one way to get the attention of the wealthy, it was through taxes.

“This doesn’t feel right,” I tell her, looking around like there might be some significant clue in the damn street.

A man had died, from unnatural causes, at a nearby school; this was his neighborhood. He supposedly drove from his house, which I hadn’t yet passed, while dying. The police report, or what we could salvage from it, had been thorough. Local street cams had enough to place him in the car, alone, on the short drive – but not enough detail for anything else. There were a few certainties: the cause of death, that his phone didn’t leave his house during the period between his last sighting alive and his drive from his house to the school, to pick up his child, while dying. None of it made sense.

The wounds were fresh.

It had to be local.

“What other choice do we have?” asks Hannah, knowing I’d been over it to death.

There’s nothing else to go on. I have no other leads. In fact, I’m not even sure it matters anymore. He’s dead but no one’s raising alarms; not his family, not his friends, not the cops or neighbors. (The vacuum of concern actually made it more suspicious, though the official release was a drug overdose; maybe everyone believed it because, why wouldn’t they believe the police?) His death, the real reasons, should’ve been national news – the murder at *Six Flags* was on national news first thing the next morning. But this guy, this death, it was like it never happened. And no one cared.

I was beginning to wonder, selfishly, *Why should I?*

It didn’t appear to be a string of murders; nothing similar had ever happened, so far as I could tell. Not in this area, at least, and we searched thoroughly. And the guy was kind of a dick. A financial advisor, someone I wouldn’t normally go out of my way for. I assume he was having an affair but it was circumstantial at best. He did have a wife and a child. And the dissatisfaction of not knowing what happened might drive me up the wall, like a jigsaw puzzle left half-built.

I finish walking the long driveway and get into my rental car. It had been my idea to park on the street and walk the long driveways, get more time looking around, but it hadn’t really done much. The houses could have torture chambers inside and I’d never know from their exteriors. Each one is so proper: the grass cut to an exact height, the many gardens tended to magazine-cover perfection, every inset stone sidewalk power-washed, and so on. The facades are grandiose yet somehow plain, each a simple white or light grey color, with large windows and detailed curtains. It’s simultaneously perfect and eerie.

“Everything around here,” I say to Hannah, just talking to fill a lull in our conversation, “it’s all boring. But it’s a creepy boring. I mean…there’s something about everything being so manicured. So uniform. Every house feels the same around here. I’ve visited seven houses and, truthfully, they all look the same in my head. Very *Stepford.*”

“What’s *Stepford*?” Hannah asks, then chomps on something crunchy. I can tell she’s walking around her room, one of the rare times she’s away from her computer.

“You better be eating something healthy…” Hannah doesn’t answer, just gives me a quasi-agreeing grunt. “*Stepford Wives* is this movie where a community turns all their wives into robots or something. I forget how it ends but there’s this neighborhood where all these wives act exactly the same. And it’s creepy because they’re all perfect wives—well, wait wait wait.” I try to head her off before she snidely asks about the perfect behavior of a wife, which in the movie was cooking and cleaning – but there’s an issue with the Bluetooth.

“—et—per—shit—ey…hey, can—ar me?”

Bits of her voice make it through and then it cuts out entirely.

I pull over at the next driveway and look for my Bluetooth charger. I thought I had charged it recently but maybe it wasn’t plugged in enough, and the charger isn’t in my car. I debate continuing without Hannah in my ear but consider it too monotonous and ultimately decide to go somewhere nearby to get a new one, maybe get lunch, take a break. There’s no reversing in the middle of the street but the neighborhood circles back around to the front gate. I pull out, pass the driveway, and continue around an uphill curve.

“—uckin’ broken—pment, stupid piece of—” continues Hannah, smacking something metallic.

“Stop cursing,” I scold.

“Oh, now you can hear me,” she says, annoyed.

“Yeah…” I pull the car over. “…now I can hear you.”

I check my rearview; nothing abnormal, just the street and a driveway twenty yards back.

*Finally, something…*

I slowly reverse.

“I think my—pment is—seless…” Hannah’s voice comes in, static-like, and cuts out entirely as I approach the nearest driveway once again; then I drive back up the hill as it curves and park in the same spot as before. “—ut smacking—esn’t work. Hold on, I may need to reboot. Your camera and GPS’re blackin’ out.”

“I don’t think it’s your equipment,” I tell her.

“Then what is it? Reception? It can’t be reception.”

I think for a second.

“What kind of instrument would I need to check for any sort of…radio frequency blockers?” I ask. It’s a subject with which I’m not entirely familiar.

“Check what? Like cell phone signals and stuff? Something that blocks them?”

“Yeah,” I answer. “Look it up for me, I’ll be right back.”

I reverse again – the Bluetooth cuts out – and park at the driveway.

Clipboard in hand, I exit the car, straighten the wide blue tie, tuck the big shirt into my brown slacks, and head toward the house. The driveway is straight for most of the way, curving toward the hill near the house and lined with small, black metal lampposts. I check my phone and see it has no reception, not that my smart phone’s reception is reliable – it’s been re-assembled with the camera, GPS, and mic removed entirely. The connection to Hannah is direct, not through a carrier line; it should work anywhere above sea-level.

The grass is cut short like the others but there’s no gardens around this house. No trees, either. I round the curve and the house comes into view. The view from the driveway overlooks the bottom-half of the neighborhood but the house itself is hard to see from most directions, practically built in the crest of a large hill; even for a neighborhood of tucked-away houses, this one’s especially hidden.

The looming house itself has a green-ish hue to it. I notice this at a distance but, approaching the front door, the hue seems to dissipate to a simple off-white. A part of me wants to stop and back away and see if it was a trick of the light, or something with the paint, or maybe just my mind playing with me – but I don’t, in case someone’s watching me. I’m not one to get especially jittery, not after everything I’ve been through, but I also notice that, the closer I get to the door, the more an anxious knot builds in my stomach. I can feel it in the air, something off, non-adjacent.

There’s a brown doormat with the words WELCOME BACK in white.

The door is a dark black, glistening as if recently painted.

No plants.

Plain curtains in a nearby open window, nothing frilly.

And just as I go to knock, I stop.

Inside, I can hear something. It’s too low to make out clearly but it’s rhythmic, like a distant radio.

*Knock knock. Ring. Ring-ring-ring. Knock knock.*

I wait a moment.

The distant hum of sound inside gets a bit louder. And a bit louder. The rhythm is familiar. *Ba-BA-baaa-ba, ba-BA-baaa-ba, BAA-ba-ba-ba-bababa.* But there’s no music – it’s just a singular voice. “In a cavern, in a canyon, excavating for a mine.

Lived a miner forty-niner, and his daughter Clementine,” I hear, the source still at a good distance from the front door. “Yes, I love her, how I love her, thought her shoes were number nine. Herring boxes without topses, sandals were for Clementine.” The male voice echoes within the huge house, bringing it closer, as the singer approaches the front door. “Drove the horses to the water, every morning just at nine. Hit her foot against a splinter, fell into the foaming brine.” Closer and closer still, louder and louder within the house and out through the open window. “Ruby lips above the water, blowing bubbles soft and fine. But at last, I was no swimmer, so I lost my Clementine.”

The *clip-clap* of flip-flops through the foyer.

The singer is belting it out and, truthfully, he’s extremely good. The notes are very specific, careful and precise, and the tone has lost the Hannah-Barbera, Huckleberry Hound silliness; it’s graceful, mourning, familiar yet haunting.

“Oh my darling, oh my darling. Oh my darling, Clementine. You were lost and gone forever, dreadful sorrow, Clementine.”

The door opens to reveal a short man in a Hawaiian-shirt and cargo shorts.

He stops singing.

We stare at each other, a stilted pause in the void.

“You were lost and gone forever, dreadful sorrow, Clementine,” he says in a low, flat tone, carrying the rhythm without belting it out—and then, suddenly, he lets out a hearty laugh and shoves out a hand. “Sorry it’s such a depressing song! Trochaic meter.”

I shake his, noting his tight grip and hairy arms – but, no scars.

He leans in, expecting to hear my name, the first person thus far to care.

“Um, Stephen Prince,” I tell him. “I’m here—”

“For the taxes, right?” he wonders.

“Yeah, I’m collecting—”

He cuts me off again.

“Signatures, I know, I know. I’m on the neighborhood counsel,” he leans in and puts his hand against the corner of his mouth, as if blocking any onlookers from reading his lips, and he adds, in a low voice, “Plus, Peggy down the hill just texted me complaining. Glug glug.” He pretends to drink from a bottle, insinuating she was drunk. He lets out another hearty laugh and introduces himself and then steps aside, inviting me in.

I accept and follow the man in the Hawaiian shirt inside.

The next few minutes are quick.

“Family from the area?” the man in the Hawaiian shirt asks as I cross over the threshold and into his home. He also takes my clipboard, as if to sign it, but instead glances over my notes, checks the signatures, and then holds on to it.

“No,” I answer—but, before he can respond, I follow up with a nasally, “I noticed my phone doesn’t get reception here, which is weird ‘cause I normally get it everywhere.”

“I block a lot of radio signals. Bad for the brain.” He waves his hand around his head. “Neighborhood hates it but I’m head of the counsel so they can suck a fat one.” He saunters off down a hallway, expecting me to follow the clipboard in his hand. He’s forcing me deeper into the house. “Like a drink?”

“No.” Never accept drinks from strangers, and few are stranger than this guy.

I follow the man in the Hawaiian shirt into his kitchen, where he pulls a large pink plastic water bottle from the fridge; the liquid inside is thicker than water, more like milk. He claps the wood clipboard onto the marble counter and sits on a stool. “From these parts? And you work for…the county?” I just nod and avoid eye contact and fidget, pretending to be shy. I’m actually soaking in the details of the house, or lack thereof. It’s almost clinically sterile, the only colors black and white aside from the ostentatious pink plastic bottle. It’s all symmetrical, in order, the black chairs neatly tucked under the wide white dining room table. The kitchen counter is neatly lined, spices and knife stack and cleaners.

“I do work for the county,” I say and reach for my pockets, pretending to search for a business card. I don’t actually have any.

“Clifford,” the man in the Hawaiian shirts says with a wide smile as his focus narrows solely on me, and he crosses the short distance between us with his hand extended. I introduce myself and apologize for not having a business card.

“You don’t need a card,” he chuckles; his laugh is bizarrely gruff. “Unless you and your girlfriend or wife wanna come to a show?”

Clifford in the Hawaiian shirt is throwing out a lot, fishing.

“No girlfriend,” I concede, again nasally, but I can feel my façade of nerdy county worker slipping against this man’s persistence. He sits again at the counter and signs the paperwork, adding a note on the top page. Even though his eyes aren’t on me, and he’s seated, I feel him circling me like a mountain lion. He’s sizing me up. He’s practiced, nuanced. And I take his bait. “What show?”

He pretends to focus on the sheet in front of him a bit more intensely, as if his response needs to hold on a moment while he looks over information he’s already seen, and none of which is pertinent to him specifically.

Finally, he looks up.

“Oh, sorry.” He smiles again; I don’t like it. “I just assume every knows who I am. I’m uh, a jingle writer by day. Any commercial you see on streaming networks, that’s me. Even most of the biggest networks, some jingle I’ve written’s gonna be there once an hour, at least.” He’s bragging, but I don’t see it as boast – he’s trying to get my defense down. *How bad can a jingle writer be?* he wants me think. “But there’s an entire amphitheater here.”

I pause.

He waits.

I can just smell him trying to work on me.

“Amphitheater where?” I finally ask.

“Here,” he quickly responds and stands and walks over to a nearby door.

He opens the door to a well-lit stairwell, less monochromatic. The walls are solid redwood, the stairs carpeting a slick tan. It’s much more welcoming than the first floor.

“Wanna see it?” Clifford in the Hawaiian shirt asks, smiling.

I check my watch.

“I actually have to get back to the county but…what shows do you put on down there?”

The deep nasal has lost my voice.

“We do lots of stuff. Instrumental, community theater, whatever we feel like. I built it into the hillside around the house so it’s much bigger than you’d think. There’s another entrance closer to the front door, much more formal. This is my entrance, don’t let it…” he trails off but I’m certain his next words were going to be “scare you.”

“I’d love to see a show!” I reaffirm him, letting him know I’m busy but not afraid. And just to solidify how helpless I am, I add, “I don’t know many people in the area so it’d be great.”

“Well, it just so happens there’s one this Friday at 7! It’s more expressionistic, kinda interactive art like an improv show. But there’s gonna be music and drinks, come! We’re always looking for new people to join us.”

He smiles, and it’s hard not to grimace.

“And…what? I just come here by 7?” I ask, sounding eager – enthusiastic, even.

“Absolutely. Park in the driveway. You can be my guest of honor.”"

I've been spending the summer learning a little bit of things that I believe I need to learn, but am not sure about what order I should set precedence on. 

So far things like Spring and RESTful have come up, and I've sort of introduced the subjects to myself without going to far. I've also been looking at Kotlin, though thats sort of more out of interest. Also Git I've introduced myself to, but haven't gotten far. 

I'm looking at jobs and internships online and so many of them want full stack developers. I've learned HTML,CSS, some basic Javascript, PHP through an online series. But I dont feel like I particularly have an eye for front end work, which leads me to think I wouldn't be good at it.

I have a few questions concerning the computer science co-op program:

1. What kind of work do you end up doing in these internships if you have no relevant experience whatsoever other than the few classes you've taken prior to the work term?

2. What are the interviews for the interships like? Are they phone interviews, in person? Are they conducted in French or English? What kind of questions do they ask?

3. What exactly are the work reports and how long do they have to be?

4. Can I apply to join the co-op program at any time during my degree, or is there a time/credit cut off? And If I am accepted into co-op, do I have to follow the course sequence?

I plan to discuss all of the above with an advisor. Until then, any answers is appreciated!"

About Seattle though, I got a couple question I hope some of you can answer.

1. How is it as a tech hub? I've been to the Bay area, and it was cool seeing tech front and center. How does Seattle compare? To go further, how is it in terms of job growth/opportunities? I know it won't compare to the Bay area, but I assume it's still great?
2. My main concern is making friends/meeting people. Is the ""Seattle Freeze"" for real? I'm kind of a quiet person and am not really a social butterfly. How easy/hard is it to make friends/date there?
3. How cold does it get there? I really enjoy cool/cold weather, and one of the things that I didn't like when visiting the Bay area was how hot and sunny it was. Also are there decent mountains for snowboarding close by?

On Monday morning my boss gave me a ticket to create a UI that shows the user a list of items and gives them the ability to modify each item. I have absolutely zero experience in html/css but I agreed to do it thinking it'll be a good learning experience. I searched our codebase and we didn't have anything I could copy and modify, so I was making this thing from scratch. So for the past two days most of my time has been spent basically teaching myself html and css. Around 4pm today my boss came to check up on me. I showed her my work. It was a very rough looking UI but the functionality was there. She was a little disappointed because ""it shouldn't take two days to create this. We have another dev waiting on you to finish so they can hook it up to the backend."" I told her I spent the last two days teaching myself, and she said had she known that she would've given the ticket to someone else. 

So In the end idk. Maybe I should've spent some time outside of work to teach myself. But on the other I guess I expected my boss to go ""well interns are here to learn blah blah."" In her defence the teams been pretty busy trying to finish everything in time for release next Monday, so I understand that we don't really have time for me to just sit here and learn all day.  I guess what's really bugging me is that I want to feel as if im really part  of the dev team, making meaningful contributions, but the reality is that for the most part my current skills limit me to buv fixes and small implementations.

c8gpoe,4,2019-07-02,Internship or transfer schools?,waah_waffle09,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c8gpoe/internship_or_transfer_schools/,"Hi! I posted this in the College subreddit but I'm posting this here for more feedback.

I'm an upcoming sophomore who is currently enrolled in a 4-year college. I am trying to decide if I want to stay at this school for the fall semester or transfer back to my community college.

For a variety of reasons I'm not really enjoying my time at this school and would rather transfer back to CC. These reasons include several institutional problems that have resulted in faculty and program cuts, little campus involvement due to lack of morale in the student body, and overall, the fact that I still dont really know what I want to study/pursue as a career in the future. I dont feel confident that my current major (sociology) will lead me to a stable career path. I wanted to look at other types of majors and explore classes in a more flexible environment, which is why I wish I attended my CC in the first place.

The only reason I am considering staying another semester is because I recieved an internship offer for the fall semester. To take this offer would mean having to go back to school because the internship will take place at a small company near my college (this is the only company location). It is based in a small e-commerce company. From what the company has told me I will be learning some marketing techniques and will be helping them develop product listings for their Amazon webpage.
In order for me to live on campus I need to be either a fulltime or part time student - but I will only be able to keep my scholarship if I am a fulltime student. That scholarship only covers half of my tuition while I still have to pay the rest out-of-pocket.

I am so incredibly fortunate because my parents are extremely supportive and are willing to pay for my schooling. They have told me not to worry abt the cost even if I choose to return for one more semester. They just want me to make a decision that I feel is best for myself. I am so grateful to them but I also feel very guilty. I dont want to have them to pay several thousand dollars extra towards a school that I am not planning on remaining longer.

My main question is: is it worth it to take this internship offer and pay the cost to stay another semester? Or should I pack it in and just transfer immediately? Ultimately I plan on transferring out of my school even if I choose to go back for the fall. But I understand that internship experiences are extremely valuable and I dont want to miss out on this opportunity while I've got it. I have no guarantee that that I'll be able to land another internship offer in the future so I want to take advantage of whatever I can recieve.

Im really conflicted on what to do as this point. Would you be able to share your own thoughts? Ive been debating on this issue for several weeks already but still haven't come to a conclusion and I want others' feedback.

I hope I've included enough information to provide context, but I can elaborate on any further details if asked!"
c8gsbv,7,2019-07-02,[MA] Ambiguous Compensation Wording in Internship Agreement,thecanadianpenguin,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c8gsbv/ma_ambiguous_compensation_wording_in_internship/,"I am a college student interning at a small startup (&lt; 20 people) in the Boston area this summer. In May, I signed an agreement with the dates of the internship, some of the responsibilities, and the compensation details. Specifically, there was a paragraph that read: 

""If you accept this offer, you will begin your internship with the Company on \[start date\], which is expected to end on \[end date\]. You will also receive a salary of $\[XYZ\].""

Now, I was quite pleased with $\[XYZ\] as it was quite generous and some of the friends I showed the contract to agreed. As such, I didn't bother to negotiate. 

Two days ago, I received my first pay check and it was apparent that there was a misunderstanding. I got paid about 1/5th of what I expected, and when I did the math, it was clear that they extrapolated my pay to an annual salary--that is, I would receive 10/52 \* $\[XYZ\] for my 10-week internship. And while this new amount is above minimum wage, it's not at all competitive given the field and location, so am considering bringing up the misunderstanding and trying to renegotiate.  

Do I have any sort of legal leverage to renegotiate my salary given the ambiguity of wording and misunderstanding? Is there any world where I am entitled to the full amount, $\[XYZ\]?"

I got told today that he wants me to finish my back end work, integrate it with the front end of one of the company's applications, and deploy it to production in two weeks. He also told me to work from home after work to get it done, which I feel like is overkill for an intern. The thing is, I feel like this is really stressing me out, because I really am trying the best I can. At my last internship at a well known company, I wasn't doing nearly as much as I am now. But I'm seriously wondering why they would trust an intern with a production deployment of an entire application. This is my last internship, so I want a return offer, but I really think that too much is being expected of me. How can I alleviate this?"

I've got about a year left, but I've been at it for 4+ years now and I'm feeling a bit burnt out on school.

Right now my job is pretty much on-site tech support stuff, so I running around the building helping people with stuff, image computers, set up new people's computers, etc. My boss recently asked me if I would be interested in a full time position, (doing the same thing I believe) if there was one available. I believe I would be making somewhere in the realm of $18-$22 an hour, not too sure on the specifics yet.

I really enjoy what I do there currently, and I feel like there's a lot of room for upward movement, however I'm not sure if I can balance a full time job and school. Is it worth it to hold off on the full time job, and finish school? Or should I jump for the full time job, stick with the associates, and drop going for the bachelors? Or try to go for the bachelors/full time job at the same time?

I am an international student in the US, with an engineering degree pending at a relatively well-known university, living in one of the larger cities in the east coast. I am writing because for the past few days, I have been constantly sad and frustrated. Sometimes, just writing things out helps a lot.

I was supposed to graduate in may, but I basically flunked a requirement course. The professor was nice enough to let me do work over the summer, but for some reason, I can't seem to muster the energy to complete the work. I applied for OPT—work authorization for international students—back in early march, and found myself an internship in the city with really nice people that i genuinely would like to work with, but it's already a month past the original start date, and the employment authorization is nowhere to be seen. I am nearly broke with no way of making money.

I can't seem to make any progress on my job search. I have a passion for design and want to become a UX designer, but the sponsorship question on every job application just rules me out as an option. Today, I received a phone call from a random recruiter who asked me a few questions, and he promptly hung up after hearing my answer to the question ""do you have citizenship?""

I have a lovely boyfriend of two years who wants to get married, keep me here, who cooks for me whenever he can, and we have a little monster of a dog together. I ordered the rings, but I am just not sure anymore. I don't think I've ever been sure, since the issue of marriage is compounded with the issue of immigration status, and my family does not have a history of happy relationships. I also think he is an alcoholic, because he drinks in the morning and passes out drunk every night without fail.

I already have a therapist, and I am already on two antidepressants, but every night for the past week or two, I have been crying for no good reason. This afternoon, my boyfriend took a drunk nap with his head on my chest, and I couldn't help but tear up, just questioning and lamenting everything. Even as I am writing this, I can't help but cry and contemplate what it would be like to fall asleep forever.

There are so many people I appreciate in my life, that I would hate to disappoint, but the selfish me wants to disappear somewhere, live a simple life maybe, or just disappear. I want to reach out to so many people and tell them how much they mean to me, how much impact they've had on my life. But I don't want to sound crazy. I feel crazy.

Good people of reddit, what do I do? I have all the tools under my belt from years of therapy, self-help books and blog posts, but they all seem false and I just want to feel normal again. A random guy who I hooked up with told me that it's all normal and that it's healthy to experience all this, but what's the point of all this pain? I just want everything to stop, and I don't know why.

I used to be able to find joy in things, find meaning in little things. Get through the day, getting things done without crying. I feel weak and the most I seem to be able to do now is stare at the ceiling and tear up for no reason. What do I do? Strangers on the internet..."

c8l49i,3,2019-07-03,How was registration at new student orientation and during second pass?,xMuses,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/c8l49i/how_was_registration_at_new_student_orientation/,"Incoming chem e transfer!

I just found out that I can only register for 3 classes MAX at orientation. However, I'm planning on taking 4 classes during the fall (13 units). Previously, I thought they would enforce a unit limit and not a class limit, so I wasn't worried about this until now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on taking CH ENGR 10, 100, 101A, and 109.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the class limit, I'm not sure which classes I should TRY to putt off until my second pass.I thought about registering for 10 then, but I'm worried that it will get filled up by freshman.

Regardless, I was planning on taking the 3 upper divs if I can, since 10 is standalone.. but I thought it would be odd to put off an intro/ prep course for my major!

Also, I didn't think it would be good to put them off in case they're completely filled before my second pass... I'm also not sure if they'll let me in if I do walk-in or if I get a bad spot on the waitlist..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm more worried that I will need the info in that prep class for future courses and for internships.

&amp;#x200B;

What was your experience with registration and second pass?

I've gotten a bit more anxious regarding registration since I found out about the class limit."

c8m7a7,1,2019-07-03,Thrown out of student sports club on false accusations,AltariasEU,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c8m7a7/thrown_out_of_student_sports_club_on_false/,"This situation has a lot of backstory, I will try to keep it as short as possible please ask if you are unclear about something. Last year I was denied access to the sports club I trained at for about 4 years. It's a facility only for university students and staff, but nevertheless quite big. It has 40+ student associations for their respective sports, with the volleyball association having hundreds of members. I had a great relationship with the manager of the gym, all up until I wanted to establish a student association for strength sports (powerlifting &amp; fitness mainly). The previous association had been disbanded prior to me coming there, but they had been disbanded because the chairman had needles on the premises (likely for steroids). The manager then associated drugs with powerlifting. We founded the new association and did alright. Our association carried out a strict anti doping policy, but it was not enough and the manager started hating us (the board) as well.

Fast forward 2 years of a strained relationship, the manager decided to redo the interior of the gym and move some stuff around. He relocated the deadlifting platforms to the 2nd floor. Deadlifts now made a lot of noise and shook the lights downstairs. I was personally held accountable for everyone deadlifting too loudly and our relationship declined further. When I stepped down as chairman he kept harassing me for stuff happening with the association and we had a falling out. Nothing physical, no screaming or cursing, just some harsh words and we parted ways. We avoided each other afterwards.

At this time my girlfriend and I decided to move to Denmark for 3 years for her PhD. The week before moving, I arranged to max out one last time with my friends before leaving and so we did. It was a fun and emotional day. My last deadlift was misloaded (5kg/11lbs too much on one side) and I had to drop it faster than I wanted to prevent tweaking my back. This caused a lot of noise downstairs and someone from reception came up to scold me. I apologized and explained the situation to her, upon which she became angry and told me not to lift heavy weights because its not good for me. I reacted with saying that this is a stupid opinion and I walked away. I didn't think much of it.

A few days later, I received an e-mail saying I am banned from the premise for threatening a female worker to the point she is too scared to go to work! So I contacted my friends who were present and thought this was absolute nonsense. I learned that the manager heard about what happened and asked her to write to the director that I threatened her. He manipulated her to get me out (he didnt know I was emigrating). The director then told me to only communicate through the manager. He promised me the ban was only for 1 year and after I would be allowed to come back occasionally for the association, I just needed to send him a message beforehand. So what I did was letting the woman from reception know through a colleague of hers that I never meant anything threatening or aggressive (very important in this situation). I literally moved the next day and had to leave at 5 am, I had no more time to do anything. For me it was over and done with, I could come back and someone assured her there was nothing to be afraid of. Turns out the manager lied and I was not allowed back EVER.

I put 2 years of my life into this association, I was doing a 70 hour a week internship and everything I had left I put into it. I put savings into it when we didnt have our own account yet and to order t-shirts all while I was close to being broke. All I want now is to give some workshops to the younger members, or train with my old buddies. Every now and then this pops into my brain and it bugs/stresses me so much. I've encountered threats, aggression and violence against women in my direct environment and I detest it. 

But how can I do that? Do I simply write/call/go by the director even though he told me to go through the manager? The manager has made it clear he does not want to help me."
c8mb6r,3,2019-07-03,I really want to die,eternallyenchanted77,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c8mb6r/i_really_want_to_die/,"I’ve done as much as a poor person can do to live my passion in life,which is theater.Unfortunately,I accidentally landed on a website for a summer acting apprenticeship that one of my fellow students is participating in.Being a working class student myself,as well,I applied for three paying internships with professional theaters in my area.Two of them never replied because of my badly written cover letter &amp; lack of a resume.The third place was inaccessible to public transportation so I was forced to turn them down because I literally couldn’t get there.So I ended up taking a class at my college during the summer.......ironically a 5-week “summer with shakesphere” class.However this class is really shitty in that my classmate’s apprenticeship is with a non-profit theater company run by a private university.Free on campus housing during the apprenticeship is also include.This apprenticeship will earn him some weeks towards Equity membership.This is a goal of mine as well,to join SAG (film/tv union) &amp; Equity (theater union) which is necessary to work professionally &amp; includes certain work protections,etc.Our community college has access to a summer internship opportunity with another theater that allows for the earning of weeks towards Equity membership as well.However it is even more selective than the one my classmate got into.I was reading over the details online just now of the apprenticeship he landed from a non-profit theater operated by a private university ($40,000+/yr school) &amp; started to cry.These guys will never choose someone like me........they recruit from all over the country.Noone ever wants me,for anything.I can’t even get the damn internship at my community college.Ironically one of the requirements of the internship through my college is to take this damn summer class I’m in right now.I know I shouldn’t compare myself to a guy that lives &amp; breathes shakespeare (our college just finished “The Taming Of The Shrew” &amp; “The Crucible”) but after seeing what he was able to do.........I think I’m cursed.I must be,because everything I touch fails.I still have trouble memorizing my lines.Everything.In regards to the three internships I mentioned above I feel particularly cheated considering the fact that they were being promoted by my local county arts commission or whatever.The county sent a guy to give some trumped up Powerpoint presentation........even though he knew we were competing with university students.The final slap-in-the-face for me was when the Representative ensured us that neither a car or driver’s license was required for these internships so as not to exclude working students taking public transportatio.Well,that was a bold faced lie because the majority of the internships on the arts commission website specifically stated they wanted people with cars.

I feel totally fucked right now.I’m staring failure right in the face.I mean I know I’m dealing with a competitive field but I’m tired of hearing people telling me to give up.Give up........&amp; do what?Life is not easy unless you’re born rich.I don’t owe this world anything.I can do whatever I want to do with my pathetic existence.Why does anyone care what I do?

This is what I want to do.I have no interest in being a doctor or lawyer or nurse or whatever.

I feel like my classmate (he’s a guy) has all the luck in the world.

I just got home from the class at midnight (its about 2:45AM) &amp; my head hurts so much right now.

I can’t stop crying because its just so wrong.

I won’t deny that I feel the desire so strong to go to sleep &amp; not wake up.

I wish there was a way to do it without realizing its happening so I couldn’t chicken out or feel any pain.

The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that my parents aren’t dead yet.

Once they pass away from old age or disease then my guilt will be gone &amp; I can be free of this life of failure.

All isn’t lost,I guess,but after all that I have described I don’t know if my heart or mind can take anymore.

I’m afraid of death already just as the normal course of being a human being but at the end of every year I don’t want to see the new year.

I only applied to three internships (two were with one theater,&amp; one with another) this summer because the county representative said that all the companies talk to each other &amp; read each other’s cover letter submissions.So they could tell if people reused their cover letters.

I keep getting fucked over.

It all started when my parents decided to not have an abortion or give me up for adoption........then they had two more kids.

I paid the price for their ignorance &amp; refusal to use birth control.

I’m sure I’ll stop crying eventually but it wouldn’t matter either way."

Since it was the recession, companies were not actively recruiting much on campus.  It kind of seemed like an extension of high school since no one had concrete plans for their careers.  Formal internship programs with companies did not seem to be common back then, it was all unpaid crappy internships.  I was doing premed, graduated, and worked very low paying jobs in my field (biochemistry) while applying to med school.



I eventually ended up in software development at a large tech company after doing cloud/data related work.  I was doing this while getting my MS in CS and after getting sick of waiting 9 months to hear yes/no after a med school interview.


Most of my friends from college have similar stories.  We all aimlessly worked years before breaking into a good career path.  Some are currently applying to law school, others got into non-tech work at technology companies.  But we all agree going to college after high school is pointless and we should have worked a few years before college to get a sense for the job market."

c8o7uy,3,2019-07-03,Any advice or anything you want to say to a novice?,dicksuckeddumbshit,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/c8o7uy/any_advice_or_anything_you_want_to_say_to_a_novice/,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

Some background first. I finished my second year of a biomedical sciences major, two more left to go. I am thinking of starting a minor in computing next year and I'm currently trying to make the best of my otherwise pretty uneventful summer. I spend my days learning some Python, doing some Rosalind problems, getting familiar with the lingo, reading some papers, the good stuff. I also have an internship at my university, doing some entry level data analysis for a bio lab. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I'm writing this is because too often I get the feeling that I'm biting off more than I can chew. I have these recurring thoughts/concerns that I just can't shake off. Thoughts like ""CS majors are miles ahead of you by now"", ""The job market is already oversaturated, you can't get anyone to hire you"" or ""What if my brain is not built for 'hard' STEM subjects?"". I know our brains aren't set in stone and that CS majors also have some catching up to do if they choose a career in bioinformatics, but still. Long story short, I feel like an absolute loser most of the time. I believe bio majors are made to feel inferior among other STEM majors, at least that has been my experience. I just feel like I have wasted my potential by chasing a degree in a ""soft"" STEM subject. But in my defense I have always found anything related to living organisms super fascinating.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if you had any piece of advice/anything to say to me. Should I pursue a minor in computing? Should I keep brushing these intrusive thoughts off? Any advice on how I can do my absolute best at my internship? Or should I just throw my hands up in the air and accept the fact that there is no place for me in bioinformatics (or any computer-related field)?  I would appreciate it if you didn't try to sugarcoat the truth, please give me your honest opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, it just felt good to write what was on my mind and I now see that my problem is more profound than getting into bioinformatics.  Have a stellar day."

&amp;#x200B;

Earth was preparing for full-scale war.

The spectacle of the invasion of New Conchord was fresh in the collective minds of humanity when the report was released of the attacking force. The release by the collective news teams of the planet was overseen carefully, tailored to create a feeling of weakness, bolstered by a sense of the human fighting spirit. Forums on the web had been seeded earlier with wilder and wilder theories regarding the Lamayen plans- having a concrete admission of danger only strengthened them, but the danger level wasn’t nearly as high as many had feared.

This wasn’t a scenario that involved aliens coming to Earth, slaughtering them wholesale, and glassing the planet, as so many in fiction had been before. In this story, humanity would meet the Lamayens in the equalizing boundaries of space.

Paragrin and the Vineyard Initiative launched intensive recruiting campaigns, in addition to their already-existing methods for candidate collection. People questioned the agendas of the newly revealed organizations, and the questions were taken seriously- but the threat was looming ever closer.

A confident-looking news anchor spoke to the camera in front of an institution of some sort.

“Scientists are still researching the origin point of the Lamayens, but the results so far are inconclusive. Measuring the approach of such a distant force has never been done before, and has required an entirely new system of measurements to be put into place.”

Behind him, two ‘scientists’- really, the two most attractive interns on hand- clumsily messed about with a computer program that they had both only seen in passing before. One of them whispered to the other, trying to look as busy as possible.

“What is he talking about? They already told them the new measuring system, why can’t-”

He was interrupted by his colleague pointing at something on the screen and nodding knowingly for the cameras. “Don’t rock the boat. They need a story, and we need exposure. It’s stupid, but it’s how these things work. Just roll with it.”

Miles away in the broadcast room, the senior editor was stating directions to his team. Six stories up, the secretary to the CEO was on the phone with the Regional Overseer.

“Yes… yes, they’re on air now. Jonathan will be in shortly, I’ll schedule the appointment… Oh? Okay, let me make a memo, one moment...”

The Regional Overseer stared with furrowed brows at a ratings report sheet in his hand, the numbers and charts on the paper telling a story that only he and several others in the country were capable of decoding. Things were moving along in the proper direction, but not nearly as fast as he’d like. They could only move as fast as the slowest region released the latest news, and the chain was long.

Meanwhile at the second-highest ranking school in the district, his daughter, Meridia sat in her third period class. She listened to the conversation of two of her classmates, texting her friend while the teacher gestured at a circle and equation drawn on the board.

The boys beside her whispered under their breaths, as everyone had been for the past couple weeks.

“Did you hear about the newest leaked reports? They say the Lamayen fleet is like… 200 times bigger than the one that attacked New Conchord!”

His friend scoffed. “They just say stuff like that to make it seem scarier. Paragrin will handle it, and then everything will go back to normal. And they’ll make New Conchord bigger than ever.”

“I don’t think so, man. This is crazy, things aren’t going to go back to normal. I even read about some people talking about farming the Lamayens for meat. Can you imagine that? Alien burgers!”

Meridia tuned them out as the teacher snapped at them for being too loud. She focused on her conversation with her friend.

\[...don’t care what my dad says, I’m not going to moeve to space with him. Studpid.\]

\[Mine wsaid stuff like that too! He’s making me take these weird space courses instead of valleyball. They’re filled with weirdos.\]

\[Here, look at this guy!\]

Meridia snickered at the picture her friend sent her of a room filled with people of all ages, all of them watching the front of the room intensely. The focus of the picture was a chubby guy with bleached orange hair shaped into a mullet and piercings.

The teacher’s hand was suddenly in front of her, palm up.

“Phone.”

“But-”

“I don’t care what’s going on, and you’d all better understand that. Either you learn how to calculate the area of a circle, or you get a pop quiz. Phone.”

Meridia huffed, locked her phone and put it in his hand. She’d get it back after class.

The teacher got home that night to tuna casserole and a broken vase. He cleaned up the vase, had dinner with his family, and helped his wife put the foster kids to bed. They sat on the couch while she played a puzzle game on her… whatever it was. He couldn’t tell anymore.

He leaned on her shoulder; she pulled back, and he fell into her lap where he lay. A sigh left him.

“What’s wrong, bumpkin?”

“Everything. Nobody’s paying attention anymore, and all the kids are talking about how they’re going to become the next Captain Connor or Lieutenant Darcy and fight aliens or whatever. I’m worried.”

She was silent for a moment as she guided her avatar through an intense platforming sequence. “I saw an ad today while at the YMCA. The Vineyard Initiative is looking for children twelve and up to recruit with parental release.”

He shook his head in disgust. “I hate that.”

“If it’s done in the next month, they’re giving out a ten thousand dollar bonus and offering a full course in college for any member of the family.”

He paused.One of their children had been following the narrative tirelessly since it began- all his drawings were of astronauts and planets and spaceships, and he’d been pestering them to let him volunteer for the program. His wife, on the other hand, had been putting off attending college to study gene sequences for the past six years to watch the kids while he tried to keep them afloat on his paltry teacher’s pay.

They were quiet for the rest of the night.

The next day, Donavan Buster drove to his welding job in a remote section of Arizona to work on a spaceship. He had been one of the top men working for the foremost airplane fabricators in the business when he’d been transferred by the company several months prior to a subcontractor to work on spaceships. He’d quit, and applied to their competitors. They had tried to hire him as a subcontractor to work on spaceships.

Donavan declined and instead applied to a drilling fabrications company. Spaceships.

Oil rigs. Spaceships.

Cars. Spaceships.

Local hand-crafted metal decorations.

Spaceships.

Finally, Donavan gave way to one of the headhunters, and after a heated discussion, accepted a position with over two thousand annual, full medical, dental, and family insurance. Somebody really wanted spaceships.

It was only when he saw the news months later that he understood why, and at that point, he wasn’t able to leave. So every day he drove to work, welded and operated machinery that welded to within a hundred thousandths of a degree of perfection and went home to watch the new videogame superleagues. It wasn’t the best, but he’d had worse jobs.

His general manager was currently functioning on four hours of sleep a day while he oversaw the production of the ships; every day was an avalanche of quality checks, shipments, discussions with neighboring companies, the juggling of projects and personnel, and trying to maintain thinly-stretched relationships with his family. He was worked to the bone, but he thrived in such an environment. And when the day came that he stood on the bridge of a freshly-completed Class-Four Interrogator, he knew that he would do this until he died. His name was on these ships.

Those ships were watched by billions as updates kept coming in. There was secondary contact with the Lamayens in space, a new and three-dimensional type of battle that tore apart what most considered to be conventional warfare, though that itself was largely a thing of the past. Homebodies sat and observed Commander Darcy as she ordered ships to be boarded or blasted, the Paragrin forces a bludgeoning hammer while the Seeds conducted precise operations.

Older women with children long grown and gone and older men who had never had anything like a family followed Phoenix, the Red Child, as she aged day by day. Updates came from the skeleton crew that had been left to oversee New Conchord’s repairs until assistance came from Earth. She was carried through the settlement as it slowly healed, comforting those that mourned and laughing with those that celebrated. She was a symbol of new life, and the image of the baby became forever entangled with New Conchord.

Calls were made for volunteers to help repopulate and rebuild the Mars Colony; the millions of eligible volunteers were vetted down to thousands that were soon on board ships headed to the red planet. Families cried at the docks as letters were written and promises made; life moved on, ever forward.

Tony Fink left the docks, eyes red as he wished his little brother goodbye. He had hoped to make it aboard the ship with them, but it wasn’t meant to be. His heart broke and he cried his eyes out during the four hour drive back to his college, mourning what would likely never return.

His empty room waited for him, but he couldn’t be alone. Instead he walked the campus, mingling with all the others his age. A few of them were missing, having made it on the ships; the mood was sober, introspective, and respectful. He made it to a table where people were second-guessing their positions at the college and the future of the world at large.

“I’m not saying that, Denise. What I’m saying is that our diplomas are worthless. It’s the experience that matters.”

“But you’re not getting on any ship without a GED, much less a diploma. I agree with you that the diplomas are worthless, but what they represent isn’t. They need proof that we have that experience, and getting a diploma is just the fastest way to get that proof. They need a representation.”

“Okay, yeah. I see that. But what about electricians, plumbing? Someone with a Masters’ isn’t going to fix a toilet.”

“They have their own paperwork in place for that- I don’t know what it’s called, but they do.”

“Citation needed.”

“Whatever. It’s just-”

Tony broke in. “The papers matter, but they look for other things as well- interpersonal and problem-solving, mostly. I just dropped my brother off.”

“They let you see the vetting process?”

“I went through it. I wasn’t- I didn’t score high enough on the interpersonal section. You’re stuck on a ship and around other people for years, I guess it’s more important than I thought.”

One of the students laughed. “What, so you’re trying to get a higher score now?”

Tony just looked at him. One of the other students hit him on the shoulder.

“Andrew, you’re a dick.”

“What? I was- it was a joke, okay? Sorry, man.”

The first student started up again. “Anyway, what I’ve been trying to say is that taking out all these loans and using up all this time to get worthless degrees is dumb. We’d be better off just actually joining the organizations themselves and letting them put us in positions that we do well in.”

“It doesn’t matter how space-involved we get, we’re always going to need farmers and construction worker.”

“Yeah. But most of those jobs have already been optimized to the point of redundancy and a lot are automated.”

“...I’d like to see you automate pouring and finishing concrete, Jennifer.”

“You get what I’m saying though! It’s just… things are changing. And I don’t want to waste any more time than I have.”

Tony spoke up again. “I saw an ad while I was there yesterday- if you’re under twenty-five and join the Vineyard Initiative- I don’t remember exactly what branch it was- they do loan forgiveness.”

That made a couple of them stop. One of the students whispered under his breath. “What are they, made out of money?”

“Actually, I heard something similar, but it was from Paragrin. They load you in a pod and blast you into space, forgive all your debts and stuff, give you everything you need, internet and meds for ten-twenty years. Something about mapping everything through a peer-to-peer system. If you land on something, you get to claim it.”

That made everyone stop.

The world over, the same offer was being made. People with nowhere to go and nothing to live for jumped at the chance; those who had dreamed of exploration in a fully-labeled world nearly frothed at the mouth at the prospect. There was no shortage of volunteers, nor, it seemed, of supplies.

The one place where supplies did fall short was in food and transportation. The United Front announce with a previously unseen level of gravity that food rationing would be going into effect in two months; funnily enough, this, more than anything, caused the greatest uproar. For most of Earth, New Conchord was far away, if close to their hearts. The rationing of food, though, would affect everyone directly.

Those in first-world countries with obesity epidemics were hit the hardest; stores immediately started to sell out as people began to stockpile food. When the supply couldn’t keep up, people began to go hungry, and they were the first to be taken care of. The others were labeled in keeping with their actions by the census committees.

County populations were recorded and noted; the majority of food distributors were redirected through a different mode of distribution that ensured everyone accounted for would be fed what they needed, no more and no less. Information was lifted from pre-existing sources to discover what level of nutrition individuals needed, and once the United Front solidified its stance on rations due to the war, it was decided. Just like that, everyone was suddenly on a diet.

Of course, there were those that slipped through the cracks and lived off-grid, in the canyons of the deserts or in abandoned towns or forest communes. They lived on as the world began to shift gears around them.

A month after the rationing began, the six countries that weren’t a part of the United Front were invaded and instilled with governing forces. Educational centers were opened, and the rationing spread to them as well. There were dead zones, it was true, where starvation had already been an issue before. But the new laws and processes stepped in and took over, like a strict father over unruly children.

The Earth was officially united and on the warpath. The gears of the world were shifting.

Company A has gone through financial struggles, layoffs and many people have left due to poor morale. I have taken it upon myself to search for other jobs and recently have gotten a job offer as a software developer from Company B. Great salary, benefits, training, healthcare you name it. This position would start in December as I still have one more quarter of school left from Sep-Nov.

Company A has been working with me to develop a role here for me after graduation. However nothing is concrete and I still haven't received an offer. I have 1 month to reply to the offer from company B. In this time I will be awaiting a response from my current company A, but I'm not hopeful because of what has been happening.

I plan on accepting company B's offer unless company A gives me a crazy offer. But I'm not sure how to best approach my boss at company A about this. My current internship at company A supports me financially and will last until November. I don't want to tell company A and then have the internship cut short because I'll be in financial trouble.

I have field experience as a intern and the position I am currently at will turn into a full time job once I do graduate (God Willingly). However, the more I go out into the real world, I notice that a career in CS or Software Engineering is more filled with growth than one in other fields; knowing such makes me want to entertain the idea of, how will I switch into that career (if I ever decide to do so)? How would any of you recommend someone like me who is interning and still in school for another year to learn programming to get into the CS workforce?

Being that I still have 2 months left before the school semester and interviews for the next summer start, I was wondering if I should switch to Python or stick to Java.

c8rmd1,17,2019-07-03,How do you control ADHD in social contexts so people don't hate you?,D0_U_N0_D3_THR0W4W4Y,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/c8rmd1/how_do_you_control_adhd_in_social_contexts_so/,"My ADHD is worse than average, I was one of the ""obvious"" cases and I was diagnosed at 7 years old and I've been on max dose vyvanse since I was 10 (currently 21).

I grew up in a small town and the people in my grade school class didn't like me from like 2nd grade to 8th grade (some of them tolerated me).  That social isolation growing up affected my social skills development and I've been playing catch up ever since.  I made some friends in high school, took a sociology class, and I've done lots of self-improvement and I feel that I have become fairly normal now.

However, no matter what I do to improve myself and no matter how much I try, people get tired of me.

My relationships fall apart because my girlfriends get tired of all the dumb things I accidentally say and do.  On more than several occassions, I've found out that my clique of friends all secretly found me very annoying.  Recently, I found out that my coworkers at my internship don't like me (all 15+ of them hang out after work together.  They even invite the boss and people from other development teams, but I was messaged by one of them that I shouldn't come to these events).

There is this horrible paradox, where I am able to control myself in professional/academic environments and when I first meet someone, but as I get closer to them, I become more relaxed and I let my guard down.  I get more impulsive and I have less control over myself.  And so, everyone is like ""Oh it's alright that you have ADHD, I don't mind."" But their attitude always changes eventually and they get annoyed with me.  And of course, it only happens when I am close to someone, so it hurts so much more when they leave.

It's such bullshit.  I've developed social anxiety (the kind where you feel like everyone secretly hates you) and relationship anxiety because of all these experiences.  I also used to be suicidally depressed and cut for a while...   I am better now for the most part.  

I have been depression free for almost 2 years now.  But at times like now with my coworkers, I feel the depression creeping back in.  My confidence and self esteem gets destroyed and I feel like my social skills start to revert.  I know this post may make it seem like I complain a lot, or I act depressed, etc.  But that is just because when I am dealing with bad anxiety and feelings like this, I get desperate, needy, and a little cringy.  I get like this because *I know exactly what will make the feeling go away*, but it requires the compassion of other people. I'm not usually like this.

#tl;dr
Sorry for the long backstory/rant...
I hope someone at least skimmed through it, because I really want to know what I can do to improve.

I want to know how you deal with your impulsiveness/extroverted nature when you are with people.  

How can I be relaxed with someone without losing control of myself?"

I'm in college and I have a lot of experience with programming in general but I've never built a web application before. I'm learning how to use AWS to build a web app on the MEAN tech stack and I've made a lot of progress and I know what is left to be done. The minimum viable product that I'm working on is basically an landing page for our customers to show their interest in buying/selling equity. However, the web application needs to be expanded to include more diverse functionality. I don't think I can do that on my own because of the obvious lack of expertise and I have to go back to college in the fall.

I'm thinking of hiring an interim CTO-ish person to take care of managing and expanding the tech team and improving the functionality of our web app. I'll come back in the summer next year and see how far they have gone. I don't really know how to manage tech teams. I want to be more involved in the actual development of the product rather than management. So, I have to hire a person to manage me and expand the team.

c8s8kn,0,2019-07-03,"I'm getting weird feelings about this job interview, should I take the job anyway?",Frequent_Perception,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c8s8kn/im_getting_weird_feelings_about_this_job/,"TL;DR I've had some phone interviews with a job and it seems really disorganized and is giving me some weird vibes. Looking for advice.

I (26F) recently had two phone interviews with a medical office to be a receptionist and I'm getting a weird vibe. I live in the Northeast US and applied for the job online with the location listed as a city about an hour from me. I looked up the company after and saw they had only locations in NY and none in my state, which I thought was strange. About 10 minutes after I applied I got a call from a NY number and it was a woman from HR at the company. She asked me a couple of general questions and said she would pass my resume to the manager of the location I applied for and he would call me the next day for a phone interview. Turns out it is a different company than was listed.

It's worth noting that I graduated about a month ago with my Master's Degree in Public Relations, but before that (after college), I took a break and worked as a medical secretary for 2.5 years. Since graduating (and even before) I've been applying endlessly to PR jobs everywhere I can find geographically but they all want someone with experience (which I don't have; I didn't do an internship or anything). I've pretty much settled for any full-time job mainly because I need the insurance. So I figured I would try something I do have experience in.

Anyway, the next day the manager calls me and we have about an 8-minute conversation. He asks me all the typical interview questions and about my previous experience. He then asks me what I got my masters in and when I said PR he kind of chuckled sarcastically and asked me why I was applying for a receptionist job. I obviously didn't want to tell him that I haven't found anything in the PR field, so I basically said I enjoyed my previous receptionist experience and thought this would be a good fit. I know that's a valid question for him to ask, but the way he asked it just rubbed me the wrong way. When talking about the commute, he then tells me he lives in a state halfway across the country. So I don't know why he's the manager of this place (?). At the end, I asked him some questions about the job, and one of my questions was what the hours are. He just says ""Good question, I don't know"". I mean I think maybe that's some info you want to be able to give an applicant especially if you're the manager.

So today the HR woman called me back asking me to now come in for a face-to-face interview. But of course it's not even at the location I applied for, but a place on the other side of the state. I asked her about the hours and she wasn't sure either, so after a few minutes, she asked her assistant and told me.

Everything just seems discombobulated to me, and I'm not really too sure what to think. I'm kind of getting a weird vibe and am looking for suggestions on what to think/do especially if I'm offered the job. If I got the job I would only plan on staying a year just to save up some money and then look for a PR/marketing job. Weird feelings aside, I'm also concerned if I took this job and looked for a PR job I wouldn't want it to work in reverse meaning the PR people wonder why I'm looking for a PR job if I've been working as a secretary and I certainly wouldn't want to be a secretary my whole life with a masters degree. Or worried it would set me back in my eventual (hopefully) PR career. Kind of debating if I should just try to get a PR internship and take advantage of still living with my parents and not needing to pay rent. I also looked up the company on Glassdoor and it does not have good reviews from employees.

Sorry this is so long and kind of all over the place. But any advice would be greatly appreciated!

PS the pay isn't super great either"

Hi everyone!

My resume got selected for an internship at Google for fall but I couldn't move forward after the coding sample. I am badly in need for an internship for next year summer and I heard that most of the big tech companies recruit for Interns around August and September, I want to work in the US preferably as I have never been there so looking forward to the exposure there. I can do anything to get an internship, I just want some guidance.

I am proficient in building Mobile apps with Flutter and Front-end apps with React and  Node.js too and I thought these things give me a chance to interview at Google too. I like doing coding problems in C++ and I have done with the concepts of important DS like trees, graphs, heaps, hash table etc.. also good with DP and I am solving leetcode consistently to keep up my level.

Can I assume that if my resume passed a screening at Google, I will have chances for other big companies too in the upcoming recruiting season?

Looking forward to some guidance from you guys."

As I approach the end of this summer, and the beginning of fall recruitment, I’m frantically trying to figure out what to do. All I really know is that I want to be involved in the Entertainment industry/do something creative and I don’t only want to code, though I would be open to jobs that included coding as part of their workload (so maybe product mgmt/strategy would be good to look into? idk) and I’m realizing I only really know how to look for internships and have NO idea what full time jobs i should be looking at/applying for even if I’m not totally qualified for them (because who is these days haha)

Would love any tips/advice on how to prep during the summer or job search strategies during senior year. Though I go to a pretty good university, our career office is pretty trash (they don’t really leverage their alumni network at all to help you) and so have to look elsewhere for advice."

&amp;#x200B;

But in the past few weeks, I've found out about/done some research on YCombinator and what they're looking for in their upcoming batches. And as the title suggests, what are the odds of a 19-year-old, technical solo-founder getting into YCombinator?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently working on my first startup, but I want it to move faster and university (just finished my first year) doesn't help with that. I'm from Toronto, Canada but currently interning in Seattle at Microsoft as a software engineering intern. To give you a better idea of my love for technical stuff, I've also gotten offers from Google &amp; Facebook, I also worked at Shopify when I was in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

So I think when it comes to most early stage technical startup stuff (initial scaling, rapid prototyping, etc ) I can handle it. But I don't know much about the pedantics and formalities of businesses &amp; I primarily focus on building product. So I guess YC would not only be good for accelerating the startup, but also potentially finding a co-founder.

However, I'm not sure if I should even apply to YC, do they even care about people like me or is my head just in the clouds?"

Below is the bonus planned i signed, in which they say that you have to be here 60days after the end of the quarter ends to be paid out. Let me know if this is legal. Thanks.

Quarterly Supply and Demand Team Bonus Plan 
Objective of the Plan: The objective of the Quarterly Supply and Demand Team Bonus Plan (“the Plan”) is to share in the financial success of the company and reward team members for achieving their quarterly goals. 

Eligibility: Certain regular full-time employees who are eligible for a quarterly bonus will participate in the Plan. 
Effective Date: The Plan is effective for the period beginning January 1 through December 31 of each calendar year. 
Plan Components: The Plan is comprised of individual quarterly goals based on Company net revenue, individual gross and net revenue and individual achievement. 

Calculation of Performance: At the close of the quarter, each Participant’s actual quarterly amounts will be compared to the established quarterly goals, and the percentage of each achieved goal will determine the bonus payout. The participant must achieve at least 50% of the Individual Revenue Target (Gross and Net) to be eligible for the quarterly bonus. The maximum bonus payout is 200% of the Participant’s quarterly bonus target. 

Calculation Company Net Revenue goal achieved = $500 + Quarterly Gross Revenue Target X % of Quarterly Gross Revenue Achieved = $1,000 + Quarterly Net Revenue Target X % of Quarterly Net Revenue Achieved = $3,000 + Individual rating = $1,000 
Total bonus earned = $5,500 

Bonus Payments Participant’s bonus payments, in accordance with normal payroll practices, less applicable taxes and withholdings, will typically be within 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter. You 
must be employed on both the last day of the bonus period and through the applicable payment date in order to receive the Plan payment. 

Eligibility: Part-time employees, temporary employees, interns and contractors are not eligible to participate. Participants on a performance improvement plan during the quarterly period may also not be eligible to receive a bonus payout. 

Calculation of prorated bonus amount: If you are an bonus eligible employee for 30 calendar days or less, you are not eligible to participate in the Plan for that quarter. 

If you are an bonus eligible employee for less than a full quarter, payment will be prorated for the time in the Plan, provided that you are continuously employed as an active, full-time, eligible employee for 31 or more calendar days during the quarterly period. In addition, you must be employed through the end of the next consecutive quarter and through the applicable payment date for that quarter. The prorated amount for the initial quarter will be based on the percentage achieved for the next consecutive quarter, and will be paid in addition to the next consecutive quarters bonus. 

If you are on an approved leave of absence during a portion of the quarter, payment will be prorated for the active employment portion of the quarter, subject to the above, unless otherwise required by law. Your participation in the Plan terminates if you transfer into an ineligible 
position during the quarter. Payment is prorated by the number of work days in the eligible position for the quarter. 
Participant Bonus Targets A Participant’s bonus target will be based on the amount as stipulated in writing to the Participant. Any discrepancies will be resolved by the Company’s HR team. 
Plan Administration, Amendments and Termination: The Board will have the final authority to resolve any issues or disputes regarding the interpretation or administration of the Plan, and all such decisions of the Board are final and binding upon all parties. The Company may, in its sole discretion, make exceptions to an employee’s eligibility under the Plan; such exceptions are subject to Board approval. 
Name reserves the right to terminate, alter, amend, suspend or in any other way, align the Plan with the changing needs of the Company. Company reserves the right to restrict participation in the Plan at any time. Participation under this Plan does not guarantee the right to continued employment. A Participant or Name may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause; the Plan does not alter the nature of a Participant’s employment. If a Participant’s employment at the Company ends for any reason prior to the date the bonus payment is to be made, no bonus payment is due to the Participant. 
By accepting any pay under this Plan, you are automatically accepting the Plan, and agreeing that your compensation shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, as it is currently constituted and as it may be changed from time to time. All amendments to the Plan shall be in writing and the amendment shall be deemed “accepted” by the Participant upon the Company’s publication of such amendment 
If any part of this Plan is found invalid or unenforceable according to applicable law, then the remainder shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms."

I have this family, who is generally an amazing family, except when they're not. They can be selfish, stubborn, condescending, and rude. But they can also be so loving, supportive and fun. 
I've been seriously struggling in the field I've decided to study in, struggled even more in the internship that I've been in... and it shows. My (already low) mental health has seemed to decreased even lower.

After graduating HS, I had no clue what I wanted to do. Bounced between nursing, teaching, forensic science, graphic design, like I said, no clue. I started out at a community college and was soon given an opportunity of a lifetime at a company my grandfather helped grow, he's retired. This opportunity came with TONS of benefits. 
All was great in the beginning. I had a great internship and an idea of what I'd do in school! 3 years later, I'm beginning to realize this isnt what I want to do, and I wont be happy, I already wasnt happy. I expressed my worries and unhappiness to my family, who told me it's normal for students to question but to keep trucking along. A year later, things were not better, and I was even more unhappy. I expressed to my family that I was planning to leave the internship because my mental health was at an all time low, my work projects and my GPA was reflecting my mental health. They basically told me to quit crying about it, and our relationships would be broken, and I'd be a horrible person to leave. So... like the doormat that I am, I stayed. A couple months later, I got fired..
I am terrified to tell my family, and have no clue where to even start with telling them. I need some advice, this is where you guys come in.. help ):"

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.

Trolling in the sticky will result in an immediate ban.

**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target school, join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through target school undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  
 * Experienced hires do happen, but is a much smaller entry channel and often requires a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.  Without this combination, it can be very hard to stand out from the large volume of general applicants. 

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

 * [Read wiki on what firms look for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/lookfor)
 * [Read wiki on resumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcresume)
 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the application / interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Time to hear back can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires to never at all.  Asking in this thread will not help.

I unfortunately do not have a stellar profile yet. I'm not into sports or dance or singing. I haven't done much extra work other than college course work. I have a decent CGPA of 9 out of 10. I cannot do internships because my college enforces a compulsory attendance rule and we have only 15 days of summer vacations.

My second MCU is what I'm using right now at my internship, an STM32f103. Which I'm actually programming in Arduino. Though I'm still reading the reference manual and understanding it on a low level to implement stuff such as Sleep modes.


My next MCU will be the NXP FRDM-KL25Z, for two semesters. First is Embedded Architectures, then Embedded Optimization.


Given that both the STM32 is a Cortex-M3, and the NXP is a Cortex-M0, while the MSP430 is not ARM or 32 bits. How similar/familiar will programming the latter two MCUs feel? Is the fact that they are both Cortex enough to make them similar? Or does the fact that one is STM32 and the other NXP mean they will be just as different to program as the MSP430 was?

Thanks for any advice.

Thank you all for the responses, I am understanding a bit more just how much I have still got to learn."

Advice would be grateful!,swaggiepenguin,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/c93gjm/language_incompatibility_at_internship_advice/,"Hi all, I am currently at an front end internship and was brought onto a project that is created in Pug/Jade. I was asked to build the front page of the website in which I built it in React. After I completed the front page, I was tasked to start on another page in a different route however, when I tried to create the DOM node in Pug/Jade I couldn’t reference it in my React file because the React was being rendered before the Pug. In other words, the children were being rendered before the parent and I would get the message “Target DOM element does not exist”. Therefore, I couldn’t create new pages. I was told that it was okay to build it in React and had asked my supervisor for help multiple times in which he could have told me not to do it in React whereas my boss was kind of furious because of this error. After further discussion, the boss has decided to scrap Pug and rebuild everything in React. I’ve been feeling pretty down because of this situation and am wondering if I did the right thing. My objective was to learn as much as possible however I feel like this mistake was very detrimental to the project, my team, and my self confidence in programming. Any thoughts would be very much appreciated!"

Trying to see what the community has to say about 1) my chances at target schools, and 2) application/essay/letter tips 3) if my work exp and ECs are good enough

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* **Work experience:**
   * 5 years total work experience including 2 years of internships
   * 3 years at current company (EPC work, primarily construction)
      * Started as Project Coordinator for a $200MM project, got moved as Assistant PM towards the last six months of the project. Typical project management duties including dealing with very high pressure clients and an accelerated schedule (3 year project squeezed into 1.5 with overruns)
      * Year 3: I was given the opportunity to step up within the company and got to run $16MM of projects on my own. One project was $13.5MM and one was $2.5MM. Came in under budget and beat the estimated margins for both, including handling a procurement scope of $5M combined between the two projects.
   * 2 years of Internships prior include work in the pipeline, construction, and utilities industry as a project engineering intern (one of them at a F500 company)
* **Extra curriculars:**
   * Not the strongest suite. I have experience from when i was younger for a non-profit in India that focuses on building amenities to give poor people (below poverty line) access to education, food, water, shelter, and hospitals. My family is very involved with this to this day and when I go back to India, I still keep in touch with the organization.
   * Personal hobbies - been in the fitness industry for about 9 years including having trained friends and family to successfully achieve their goals. I also pursue photography as a hobby/side gig but it’s not big.
   * Took part in a business case competition that required us to present a solution to an existing problem in the Canadian Market (O&amp;G Industry)
* **Undergrad school/major:** T10 University (T10 in Canada); Mechanical Engineering (B.Sc.)
* **Other education/coursework:**
   * Pursuing my P.M.P application (should have designation by admissions)
   * Primavera P6 training for scheduling
   * Undergrad allowed me to choose business classes such as Accounting, Business Law, and Organizational Management
   * Few years of coding under my belt (C++, Java, HTML etc.) - beginner/intermediate level
* **Race/nationality**: Canadian Citizen, Indian Origin
* **Sex**: Male

**Stats**

* **GMAT Score (include breakdown!):** 710 (Q48 / V41 / IR8 / AWA6)
* **Undergrad GPA**: 3.25 in Mechanical Engineering

**MBA Info**

* **Goal of MBA:** Working as an engineering intern, realized I like the business management side of jobs way more than the technical side. Demonstrated my skills in my career as a strong individual contributor, which led eventually to me handling my own projects. Now I'm no longer as technical as a pure engineer and feeling like I’ve reached a plateau in lower-level management. Could use education in general management, and finance and strategy skills in particular gained through an MBA to eventually move to upper management (strategy-level) in the tech + clean energy field. Many tech companies in Silicon Valley are heavily focused in their transition to utilize new developments in the field of tech to achieve 100% renewable energy, and thus IMO Stanford/Haas (and Foster) would be a good option to access them, being in the Bay Area (or Seattle).
* **Target schools** (still have to narrow down, Stanford and Haas are 100% wants)
   * Reach: Stanford
   * Target: Haas, Ross, Columbia, Tuck, Fuqua
   * Safety: Foster, Marshall, Goizueta, Tepper (?)"

This was my first interview (sort of). I was slightly taken aback by the question, because in my case, I have found the solution to pretty much every obstacle on stackoverflow, or in the internet for that matter. I very awkwardly told them that there wasn't one that I could remember.

My question is, what would be a proper response to this? Or am I not involving myself in projects good enough to provide me withh challenges?"

After almost two years of pondering my life and career choices and options, and not reaching a conclusive decision (decision paralysis is real), I finally found this community. And, since I might as well save myself some good money by not seeking guidance from a career coach etc., I thought I'll have you all be my advisors and **hereby wanna thank this community in advance for doing what it does, for free. Y'all are doing some good work.**

Now, I would appreciate some advice, preferably constructive, on how to progress in this game called life. 

I am a 20yr old presently reorientating academically, (previously pursuing a BSc in Health Sciences, 1/3 finished) from Germany, but I am currently in the process of moving to the US (where I went to high school for a bit) with my fiancé (we might have to take a detour over Vietnam until his permanent residency situation is dealt with). I graduated from a German HS with an okay GPA (equivalent to a 3.6), although, would I have had the motivation, could've far succeeded that outcome. 

As long as I can remember, I always wanted to be a Doctor, Christina Yang from Grey's Anatomy was my idol. I did internships in the medical field, experienced it as a patient, and just know it would be a good fit, but ever since my teens, those ambitions have been undermined and my abilities and dreams shattered by deconstructive and harsh comments, mainly by my parents. I have been pushed by them to go to university in Germany for a ""normal"" degree, followed by a ""normal"" 9-5 job in some corporate or government institution environment, and, as a 17yr old graduate, followed this advice by pursuing above mentioned Health Sciences BSc. 

Right from the start, I hated the university setting, especially the lecture style learning, and the topics discussed and taught in said lectures seemed boring, repetitive and useless (the only classes I enjoyed were psychology and anatomy, which I excelled at). I basically stopped going to any classes after 2 months, but have passed the first round of exams, hence just stayed matriculated ever since. I have worked mainly in the service sector, as a barista, but know that that's not where I want to go, although it'd be okay as a side gig. 

I have considered pursuing a BSN in the US, but after many chats with advisors and program managers from different schools, feel like that whole BSN environment is not very welcoming towards internationals, unless they come bearing gold...Since I do not have any significant savings, getting into any US school, in general, proves to be tough, as they all require internationals to have proof of proficient financial security (which I cannot provide, my parents consider me a failure and give no support, my fiancé himself is also a student). 

Ideally, I can see myself as a practitioner in holistic/alternative medicine (as a (naturopathic) doctor or nursing practitioner, or even opening up a holistic health studio, creating a health related brand, etc), but currently am also dipping my toes into graphic design, content creation, etc. with an online boot camp, which I could also see myself pursuing as a possible career (maybe health focused?). Keep in mind, since my permanent residency application will also likely take some time, I can only work a max of 20hrs/week on a student visa, unless I work online, and I do not qualify for any student loans or even just in-state tuition, which means scholarships would help a lot. My husband could provide a single income, but I don't want him to give up on his (academic) goals just to pay for my dreams, if that makes sense, so I would like to avoid sending him off to a job that simply pays and put his degree on hold (which he would do, and so would I for him...). 

I am willing to bust my ass for the right reasons, but would prefer not to rake up debts up to the wazoo; for the sake of our finances as well as sanity, since we do plan on having a house and family in the near future, which brings me to my next point. I want to start a family, and I am not willing to put that on hold until I'm 30+, which means that I'll likely be pregnant during college/training/etc. at some point and will also have to be somewhat flexible regarding time, especially as a new mom (or will have to bring my baby with me). Since the patriarchy led society is not really welcoming towards women seeking career and motherhood at the same time, I know there will be obstacles no matter what, and I am willing to come in guns blazing if I have to. But, of course, that complicates things. I have considered joining armed forces once I'm a permanent resident, but I don't think that would work well with my family planning due to the nature of armed forces service, and I also do not agree with the war business in general. Anyways, I digress...

Currently, I am somewhat overwhelmed with making a choice and finding a starting point. I have done my research, conversed with ""experts"" in those fields, and applied to multiple Internship programs. In my opinion, I did the internal work of finding my Ikigai, dharma, purpose, or whatever you may call it ( I see myself in a position where I can actively help people by holistically improving their lives, and thereby making the world a better place) and outlining my goals and plans for the future. But yet, I seem to get nowhere. 

So, what is YOUR advice? What should I do (next)?"
c94oqv,2,2019-07-04,I unintentionally made a dog hate me and now I feel bad.,RogerBoii64,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/c94oqv/i_unintentionally_made_a_dog_hate_me_and_now_i/,"So I have an internship in a garage, and my boss always brings his dog with him.

The dog (which is named Guus, a male Parson Russell Terrier, a little older than 2 years I believe) always waits in the coffee room until we enter for break time, after which my boss or one of my colleagues lets him out for a walk around some buildings and farmlands. Guus also has barking outbursts whenever he hears certain people in the hallways or outside the window.

So today, when break time was over, I left out the door of the coffee room to return to the working place, but just before I headed into the working place, I made some weird movements behind the door to make some of my colleagues laugh, but apparently Guus saw it as aggression, jumped against the door and barked like crazy.

My boss notified me that I shouldn't do that, because Guus sees it as major aggression. I genuinely felt sorry and headed out. After a while the next break started and I went back into the coffee room. I sat down, had a drink, and when I stood up to throw away my cup, Guus ran into my direction, hugged my leg and literally bit my pants. I tried to pull my legs away and ran a couple circles in the room, but he kept following while trying to bite me.

Before leaving at the end of the day I decided to pet him and guess what? He just tried to bite me again! it breaks my heart knowing that the poor thing doesn't understand that it was unintentional and I feel like a massive jerk right now!"

In school I never had as hard of a time as I am having now, and I don’t know if it’s because the language is new, because the project is already so well developed (whereas in school I’d start from scratch), or because I’m simply not cut out for this stuff.

c96way,8,2019-07-04,What I've learned as a US student applying to UK - financials and prospects,TypeOfPlant,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/c96way/what_ive_learned_as_a_us_student_applying_to_uk/,"I am a US student and I've just accepted a 1-year MSc offer in the UK. The program costs are high and I don't have funding since it's very difficult to acquire it as an international student. Nevertheless, I want to offer some encouragement to anyone who is pursuing an international degree in the fall or who are thinking of applying for one in the future.

I'll start by listing the factors that motivated me to make this choice from most important to least important. I'll go into some detail as to why my list is organized this way. I'll then define what my plan is now, focusing on the financial aspect of it.

* Advisor in my program whose research/specialty aligns with my own interests
* How well-connected that advisor is to other members of the community, worldwide
* The institution's reputation and agenda - ie, whether the institution has an overarching mission or leans towards a certain direction. Ex, plant conservation research. Reputation means how established are they within the community.
* Resources at that institution/in the program
* The community at that institution - how students and researchers feel about their work and how they collaborate with one another
* Opportunities that are available at that institution. Ex, PhDs, postdocs, employment, etc.
* Location and accessibility to things outside the educational experience - is it a city or the middle of nowhere?
* Cost of tuition and cost of living
* Availability for funding
* Application costs and required materials for admission

&amp;#x200B;

\- The most important factors fueling my choice have to do with my advisor and their work in the community. I was lucky to find someone who specializes in my field of interest and who encourages the success of their students. That person is also recognized within their community. If I decide to come back to the US after this UK MSc, I can approach my future PhD advisor with a personal connection despite having an international degree.

\- The institution's reputation is very important. Basically, a program can be fantastic but if no one has heard of the institution, that may be poorly received by employers or other institutions. I vouch for myself in a world that values names and connections by aligning myself with an organization or a university that represents certain values and achievements.

\- Resources are key to doing great work. If I'm investing money in my education, I want to make sure it pays off.

\- The community is also essential. At 24, I can't ignore social and emotional wellbeing. I've been through enough to know how important this factor is in fueling my motivation. If current students enjoy the program, then it's an indicator to me that it's worth it. If professors feel good about the program, then it's an indicator that it will pay off in the future because we can actually gain skills to collaborate with them.

\- To put it mildly, 2020 will be an exciting and interesting year for the US and the UK. As I monitor the situation here and overseas, I'm thinking about where I should do my PhD for the next 5-6 years. There are many things to consider as I look towards my future, so it couldn't hurt to know that the place where I make connections and study might also have potential opportunities for me after I graduate.

\- I can't stress location enough. My field is in the plant sciences and I do NOT want to be in the middle of Iowa someday. Period. Again, from personal experience, I know that I need the city life but also a way into the wilderness when I need it.

\- Finally, I get to the costs. You might be wondering why this isn't higher up on my list of priorities. I do care a lot about funds, however, my field is so narrow that I had to commit to an opportunity that will propel me forwards, regardless of the sacrifice. If all goes well, I will have a job that I enjoy and it will allow me to pay off my debts over time.

\- Applying to UK universities is much easier than applying to US universities. First of all, applications are often free. It's rare to pay for a UK or EU application. Second, GRE scores are not necessary. I didn't have time to take my GRE's before submitting my app, so that effectively barred me from applying to US universities.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my current financial situation:

Tuition, cost of living, etc: $45-55k.

As I said before, I don't have funding. I applied to one source - a full scholarship available through my university - but I didn't put my bets on getting it. I wasn't awarded the scholarship, so my plan is to take out a full FAFSA Graduate Plus loan. These are standard loans and most students are awarded the full amount. I can choose to take the full amount or not; I am still figuring out my budget and taking into account the conversion rate and the economic projections given the political climate.

I considered applying to scholarships, but given my major there aren't many major-specific ones out there and competition for these and all others will be high. Applications are also a major time drain. I went through the process before and I came out feeling that it wasn't for me. I still have a lot of work to do this summer before starting this program, so this option isn't realistic.

Ok, here comes the fun part. It's a pie-in-the-sky idea, but there really aren't any other options for funding besides this one. Essentially, I decided I was going to network. I intern at a relatively prominent institution with a new director. He's nice to interns, knows us all by name and encourages networking. When I heard about the outcome of the scholarship, I immediately set up an appointment with him. My plan is to approach him with my situation, explain what I'm aiming to do in the future and see if he knows anyone who might be willing and able to help me out. I have never tried this before, but I have 2 friends who were successful in acquiring some funding this way. It really can't hurt to ask.

I actually do have a somewhat similar experience. When I applied for my undergrad, I had 10 offers and I compared offers between institutions to get a competitive offer at my choice school. In that case, it's critical to note that my bargaining chip was me. I had awards and achievements to back up my requests, and the institutions that gave me more money valued what I was offering. In this case, I am relying on three factors to back me up: the first is my previous experience, the second is the outcome of my summer work (I'll be presenting this to the board of trustees that funded my internship in late August), and the third is the reputation and the promise of the institution I am entering. I'm keeping an air of realism here and again, not putting my bets on this working out. Still, I thought I'd share this idea with the community since it technically could work out, if executed properly (and with a great deal of luck and positioning).

And that's it. I'll leave an update on how this goes. I'll be contacting several organizations I've been a part of, not just this one. I encourage questions or advice as I move forward with this. I hope this might help someone or encourage someone to pursue international study as an option, despite the challenges. Traveling really is an important experience."

c97bgj,2,2019-07-04,Should I confide in a coworker I trust about what I'm going through?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c97bgj/should_i_confide_in_a_coworker_i_trust_about_what/,"Hey people of Reddit,  

I’ve started an internship at this company as part of a college program that I signed up for last semester and I’ve been having some trouble fitting in with the other interns there. I’m really quiet, introverted and highly sensitive so it’s hard for me to win friends in the first place, and they never really invite me anywhere and always leave me behind after work. As you can probably guess, I constantly feel left out and unwanted. I had been bullied a lot in the past so some social situations trigger me.

So yesterday, I noticed they all planned to go out for dinner somewhere after work and, as per usual, I wasn’t invited. I tried to feel indifferent towards it all like I always do when this happens, but I just couldn’t take it anymore and immediately felt like I was on the verge of tears. I quickly got up and rushed out of the office, and one of my coworkers, a really nice guy that I collaborate with on almost every project, stopped me and asked me if I was ok. I kept walking past him and left, when suddenly I get a text from him telling me that if there was anything he could do to help that I let him know.  
 

Of course, my first instinct was to keep him out of it and that this was a silly problem to talk about to anyone anyway. But at the same time, I had this strong urge to confide in him about what I was going through. I really want someone to hear me out and offer a listening ear. I know I can talk about it with my family, but I don’t know why I want someone at work to know about what I’m going through. 

TL;DR: I got really upset at work and left crying. A coworker saw me and later texted me to ask if he could help me in any way. 

Do you think it’s ok for me to open up to him? Or is it just too inappropriate? 

Thanks."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of new to this community and have been mulling over a decision recently. I graduated with a bachelors in computer science last month and am currently trying to figure out which of two job offers I should go with. During my time there, I had a software engineering internship (at a big 4) and a data science internship.

&amp;#x200B;

The first offer is for a position as a Junior Data Scientist. Data science has been an interest of mine for a while. Unfortunately, I have never felt confident pursuing data science and machine learning as the majority of jobs I've found require a Master's or PhD and my college career was at a local public university where the standards (in both math and computer science courses) was rather low. Much of the ML/DS stuff I learned was on my own (though I have taken intro ML, intro DS, AI, and CV in school but they were limited since earlier courses didn't really give a strong foundation to build on).

&amp;#x200B;

While I would like to choose this job, there are a number of things stopping me.

\- Firstly, I don't particularly care about the company and I am a techie person so the corporate atmosphere doesn't feel very comfortable for me.

\- Second, I don't know how easy/hard it will be for me to move around to a role at a tech company or to transition to being a software engineer once I spend like a year in a data science role. One of the engineers from my engineering internship kind of scared me by saying that people wouldn't believe I can code.

\- Third, the imposter syndrome is hitting hard with the first role in particular. I'll be working in a small team and I feel like my lack of knowledge is going to be apparent to the rest of the team. I'm scared of being ""found out"" in a sense and disappointing people.

\- Lastly, the money side of things is less than what many of my friends have been offered (it's not exactly low but lower than my competing offer's base by like 20%, not even including other compensation).

&amp;#x200B;

The other offer is as a Associate Software Engineer at a much larger company (tech startup-y place bought by non-tech company). I don't particularly feel like I'm interested in the work I'll be doing though. I feel like with the additional money and the engineering role, there is a sense of ""I actually have some idea what I'm doing"" because the college education was very geared towards engineering. However, I do worry that I would be worked much harder and I'm going to regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't particularly know what to ask besides just if someone has experience/knowledge that may help in understanding how to go about making this decision. Everyone around me is saying to just go with the second one (whether for the money or the name) but I'm afraid to give up on something that interested me enough to drive me to spend 3 years studying alongside regular 18-credit packed semesters, for which (until recently) I had intended to even go to grad school for, and which I feel lucky to have an offer for at all.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I got two offers, one is in data science and the other is in software engineering. I like data science more but I don't feel confident in my abilities, I'm worried about ability to move around in the future, and I would be paid much less. However, I would get the opportunity to work at a reasonable pace and develop skills in the area I am interested in though at a company and industry I don't much care about."
c9850l,1,2019-07-04,[HELP] First build for TensorRT and IA work on an RTX 2060,MegucaIsSuffering,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/c9850l/help_first_build_for_tensorrt_and_ia_work_on_an/,"###Build Help 

Hello! I need to get a build done before July 14th (the sooner the better) as I will go into internships and I am required to work with the NVIDIA TensorRT platform. I will explain further below.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I want to use it for Machine Learning and AI work with NVIDIA TensorRT, as stated above. I am also thinking of using it for gaming (I am getting a GPU after all). My favorite games (despite I have not plaed them yet) are DOOM 2016, The Witcher 3, and Rocket League, among others (Cyberpunk 2077 looks great).

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

When it comes to gaming, I do not wish exactly for the best resolution and framerate, just image quality. So playing on High/Ultra is fine at 1080p/60FPS. Maybe 1440p can be good, but not a priority.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$850.00 at the moment, I might go for the extra $50.00 but I also need to get a monitor I have not put into the build, so overall a $1000.00 total, if including the monitor.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

I live in Mexico, but I do not think there is too much of an issue when importing through Amazon purchases.

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Just that at the moment. There are components like CPU Cooler, PSU, and accesories such as speakers and a second monitor I plan on buying but due to time and budget constraints, I would rather get the main components (CPU, GPU, storage) so I can do small upgrades later. 

A good GPU is kind of necessary due to AI and Machine Learning work, and I am planning on getting a Ryzen 5 3600 instead of the 2600 that is listed, but due to it not being released/reviewed yet I am unsure of what to do (and there is, of course, still the July 14th -even sooner- deadline). I also might swap the RTX 2060 for an RTX 2060S. When it comes to the monitor, as long as it can get 1080p/60Hz it is fine by me, but I would like to be able to use a vertical aligment for programming. This is my first build and I am unsure of what else do I need. Do I get a licensed OS? I like Windows 10 so I might go for that, but once again I do not want to go beyond my budget.

Thanks for your attention!"

So I was working there with some guys, and I felt so anxious about everything, I don't do anything right and really makes me feel like a completely failure.

Some of there are more younger and quickly than me, I even feel that my scrum master wants to punch my face.

I’m going into my final year of my undergrad as a physics major. I have no idea what I want to do and am currently torn between a few paths. I have to take GREs and decide where I want to apply but the paths I’m considering are all different, and require different preparation and am trying to gain some perspective. Any advice anyone can offer or would be really appreciated because I am totally lost and am running out of time to figure my life out. I also plan on doing a masters degree rather than going to a PhD. I also would rather not take a gap year because my home life is a nightmare and I’m not sure if I would be able to afford to get my own apartment.

So I’m a physics major, and I love it. I like the problem solving, and find the material interesting. I’m doing astrophysics research under a professor and have been for the past year, and again, it’s cool, but I don’t want to pursue the specific subfield because it’s all computational, and I have severe anxiety around programming (and I’m getting better with it, but it’s a slow process for me. It doesn’t help that my professor and research partner are the essentially the same person and while I love them as people they make it very difficult to work because I don’t get the guidance or support that I need and it’s very overwhelming and stressful.) I find the work cool, but I don’t think it’s the field for me. I have been considering going into instrumentation for physics, and astrophysics in particular (building telescopes and stuff like that.)  
So with that, I realized I might enjoy aerospace or mechanical engineering because from my understanding, engineering and instrumentational physics have a lot of overlap, and it might be wise to do that since there don’t seem to be many opportunities for that field of physics. For a MSc in physics, I would need the physics gre subject test, but I wouldn’t for engineering.
This summer I was given an internship of sorts at my regular summer job. I work as an receptionist and have for the past 2 summers, and my boss gave me a huge project. I’m doing data analysis for sales and designing a system for setting prices. He wants me back next summer and I’m really enjoying the work. I didn’t consider a career in finance or business until this summer, but I’m enjoying the analysis and going to meetings way more than  I ever though I would, and can actually see myself pursuing the field. But that throws off my plan to do something more related to physics and now I’m totally lost. I also have a science communication/writing internship lined up for the coming spring semester, which I’m also interested in.


I just don’t know what to do, or what kind of programs to apply for, since I’m torn between physics, engineering, and finance. I need to figure out what’s going on. If you have any experience in these fields and can offer perspective or advice I would really appreciate it."

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the short story below but...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping you guys can possibly answer some of my many questions about engineering. I recently graduated school a year ago with no debt with an Economics degree. I am currently working at a small investment bank where my job is basically an over glorified salesman and all I do is clerical work. I hate my job and realized that I hate banking and the only reason I pushed so hard to break into it is because I was chasing money thinking I'd become a millionaire in no time (incredible folly on my part). Recently however, I've just been pursuing a somewhat newly developed passion of mine which is engineering, specifically electrical engineering. The reason this all happened is because one day I was sitting at work with nothing to do and looked at my computer and asked myself a very simple question. How does this computer work? And for the life of me I could not answer it! I could not come up with a simple explanation as to how this machine that I have grown up with my whole life works! So one thing led to another and I started reading up on computer hardware and software, how it gets its data, how wifi works, how radio technology works and I was just so fascinated because I was learning about how the world really works and how we as human beings mapped it out! I've since started reading some electrical engineering books trying to teach myself the fundamentals and basics. I'm tired of being an investment banker and feel like I'm not adding any value to society, and I'm tired of being surrounded by people who are so money driven and not curious about how things or the natural world works. I'm also tired of chasing money, especially when it doesn't bring me any happiness if I have to work in a field that involves long hours creating pitchbooks that go nowhere! I've made the slow transition on my way down the engineering road looking at certain schools and their cost of tuition, along with whether I should go for a masters or second bachelors. I believe that engineering might be a good fit for me since it's a field filled with people who love to build and create things and are always curious wondering how the f\*\*\* the darnest of things work. For reference the highest level of Math that I took is Calculus 2 which covered integration the whole class (took it because post graduation I was gunning for a MS in Financial Engineering, but dropped due to having a bad Calc 2 professor and work overtook my time, but funny how I was still pushing for a form of engineering even back in summer of 18 post graduation now that I think about it). 

My questions are:

1. Is there a difference between a Bachelor of Technology vs Bachelor of Science for EE? From what I gathered so far a BTech is much more common in India, and in the US a BTech only holds weight if it's ABET accredited. I also have gathered that it's much more practical degree than a BS where you learn much more theoretical engineering than hands on engineering.
2. Does the school you attend matter that much? I'm asking because in banking your school plays a huge role because banking is a very soft skilled industry where we again don't provide any physical value add. It's all about the network you have and who you can get meetings with, and the Ivy Leage Graduates = you can get meetings with people who have money. My understanding of STEM is that they don't care where you got your degree so long as you know your shit and can actually build and do the job. I'm looking to enroll into city tech (CUNY) because it's incredibly affordable and they offer a BTech in Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications. For reference I graduated from Baruch college another CUNY and broke in because of luck (the CEO who pushed for me just liked my personality a lot) and persistence (had a good amount of internships)
3. Have any of you made a career transition into engineering from a different industry? Do you know of anyone? How has it been for you/them? 
4. Is there anything I can do/read that you would recommend? I'm currently reading Electrical Engineering 101 3rd Edition by Darren Ashby but feel like some of the concepts are going over my head and that I'm missing some parts of knowledge to the equation.

Sorry again for the long post but I thank you all for your help! Appreciate it guys and gals!"

Age: 24
Skills: Cybersecurity

Long story short in rapid fire bullet points:

- I've lived in Canada on a Working Holiday Visa before for one year.

- I have 6 Months of Full-time work in Cybersecurity, 4 months as an internship at a Canadian company. Cyber security is qualified as a Class A working class (highest points), which is good for me.

- I'm still eligible for another working holiday visa, but only for one more year. After that, I need to look at permanent residency. 

- My girlfriend is planning on attending McGill for grad school for 2 years, then leaving Quebec. I understand that Quebec has a completely separate immigration process, and permanent residency does not apply to Quebec. 

- Once I renew my working holiday visa, I plan on getting the remainder of my 12 months in professional full-time cyber security experience in Canada (at a Canadian company)

- I'm able and willing to take up French courses, and my girlfriend speaks French fluently so she's been helping me. She thinks I can definitely pass the exam with the right amount of prep. 

Questions:

What's the difference between Quebec Residency process, and Canada's (besides the fact that you need to know French to some degree)? 

If I get permanent residency through the Quebec process, does that then apply to the rest of Canada? Or would I need to go through the process *again* if I wanted to live outside of Montreal once I get the residency? 

How long does the permanent residency process take? I know that there's no guarantee I make it in, even if I qualify. But am I allowed to work in Canada during the process? Or possibly live there?

Right now I'm able to land a remote position in Cybersecurity which enables me to live wherever I want. If Push cash to shove, could I just live in Montreal with my girlfriend and work out of the U.S with no visa? And just travel back between the border ever 90 days? I hear of some Americans doing this while they're waiting for perm residency."

Half-an-hours worth of scouting told me the security guards were busy elsewhere, so I crawled out from behind the bush and toward the mansion. Long fingers of willow trees waved in the wind and slapped at my face. GVCCI HVCCI seemed to have a thing for willow trees.


I tiptoed around dead leaves as I snuck up to the 10-foot iron-wrought fence. Nothing too taxing for someone used to being kept out. I jumped and pulled myself up to the fence before vaulting over and landing into another crouch. 

About 30 feet to my right, the trickling waves of an in-ground pool whispered in the wind. The moonlight couldn’t quite illuminate the objects floating in the pool, but they looked like expensive pool toys.  I slipped past the pool and toward the light-less mansion. That can’t be right, I thought to myself. I was guaranteed my lover would be home. I was far too close to my goal to worry about that now. It was late, and everybody has to sleep. Even minor celebrities. 


A quick scan over the mansion revealed the method of entry, a balcony. No one considered balconies a security risk, which made them the best method of gaining entry. A trellis buried in decaying plants rested at the side of the balcony. I pulled at the trellis to test its strength. Once satisfied, I grabbed hold and climbed up the trellis.


 After climbing over the balcony railing, I lowered myself to a low squat and glanced around for any nasty surprises. Beyond a single, yet luxurious lounge chair, the balcony was bare, though the balcony itself was an architectural marvel. Nothing screams decadent luxury like 17th century baroque.


 I knelt down to inspect the unknown artist’s work. Carvings of hooded figures and disproportioned humanoid heads lined the balcony railing. The ghoulish artist also delighted in intertwined human corpses set in erotic poses. I grimaced. Grotesque, but also in keeping with GVCCI HVCCI’s style. Witch house is a genre bathed in occult symbols, though how was she able to afford such art? She released a few albums and had a few shows that were hits by Witch House standards. But only A-list celebrities purchased marble grotesqueries. 


I left the architectural delight of the balcony behind and inspected the glass sliding door. I chuckled. Glass sliding doors don’t even rise to the level of a hindrance. My love should’ve asked for her money back. There were no double bolt locks and no security bars. Not even window film. Grinning, I slipped on my gloves and pulled out my trusty glass cutter. 


Four minutes later, I let myself inside the house of the lovely GVCCI HVCCI. I definitely needed to find her real name, I thought. Calling her GVCCI HVCCI like an admirer from afar grated on me.


I found myself in darkness. The moon that had helped me earlier was losing its light, so I pulled out a pocket flashlight and switched it on. I was in a bedroom. The bed was well kept, and the furniture made of mahogany. The lack of personal effects told me this was likely a guest bedroom. I wanted my love’s bedroom.


I crawled over to the bedroom door and nudged it open. I was near the top of a set of stairs leading down to a ballroom. I fell prone on my stomach and crawled past the stairs toward two solid wood doors. I jiggled the doorknob before twisting it and pushing the door open. Once the gap was wide enough, I shimmied through, closed the door, and walked into the suffocating smell of wormwood, orris root, and lobelia. None of the windows were open, and the ventilation system was either absent or broken.  I fumbled toward the curtained windows, gently pulled one aside and prodded the window open. After fresh gulps of clean hair, I ducked back into my lady’s room.


My gaze fell upon something glinting on a table made of African Blackwood. A blue sapphire that rivaled the Star of Asia. This was worth a fortune. How did GVCCI HVCCI get ahold of this? Without thinking I grabbed the gem and stuffed it in my pocket. If my love were so wealthy, she wouldn’t miss this.

 Next to where the gem had rested was a pile of antique books. I had no idea GVCCI HVCCI was a collector of rare books. A new but not entirely unwelcome change in perspective. I stuck the end of my flashlight in my mouth and leaned in to inspect the books.


My eyes fell upon many occult volumes. The Sworn Book of Honorius in the original Latin, Aradia in the original Italian, the Grimoire of Armadel, and many others. Lying next to them was an untitled tome in black leather. I undid the lock to the untitled tome and cracked it open. Gruesome images of obsidian monoliths, singing corpses, and an unknown script made me wonder what I had stumbled into. As I turned to leave, my eyes caught a photograph. The photograph showed a lanky young man with black hair grinning over a pile of old history books. It was me.


 My immediate reaction was triumph. GVCCI HVCCI thought of me too. That lasted no more than a few seconds. The collection of occult lore, along with the slight possibility that my love was alerted to my plans chilled my bones. If she was expecting me, why wasn’t I already caught? 


Exit! Find the exit. This was no time for theories. 


I crawled out of the bedroom and began hearing gravelly moans.. The orange glow at the bottom of the stairs didn’t help. I crawled across the landing back to the room I entered the house in. The well-kept bed and mahogany furniture were still present, but there was no hole in the glass and no lounge chair out on the balcony. 


I was sure this was the way I came. I sped toward the window. This one wasn’t even a sliding door. A security bar lined the middle and now sported a window film. This couldn’t have been the bedroom I came through. In a panic, I ran out of the bedroom only to find the double oak doors that led to the occult bedroom were missing. Even worse, the stairs had disappeared and I was somehow on the same level as what I thought was an orange glow. Long, flickering shadows danced on the walls as the ever-present moans filled the air with a touch of incense. 


In the middle of what looked like a ballroom, a group shadowy figures chanted with raised arms. The walls were made of black stone that I was sure I didn’t see when I first entered the house. Behind the shadowy group, holes were carved in the black stone wall and lined with a gray wood. I squinted at the blanketed masses within the holes. Bodies. Human bodies. The shadowy figures weren’t the ones chanting, the dead bodies were.


On a dais in the middle of the room, the hooded figures surrounded a [white horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/sqstories/comments/c6fp1i/theres_a_club_near_chinatown_that_plays/) lying on its side. Where did that horse come from and why couldn’t I see it before? Though alive, the horse was unmoving. It lay still on its side.


 As the chanting and moaning crescendoed, the horse began trembling. A wave of nausea nearly knocked me off my feet as a tuft of hair poked out from behind the horse. Then the rest of the head. A human head. The horse practically moaned in pain just as it pushed out a human corpse enveloped in an amniotic sac. 


Upon seeing the corpse,  the figures turned their attention and raised arms toward the corpse. The corpse somehow sputtered before a crackling moan began to sound. A moan that joined in with the horrific chorus sounding from the holes in the wall. All three figures worked to wrap the moaning corpse in silk. Once the entire body except for the head was wrapped, they hoisted the body up and placed it in one of the empty holes. The moaning continued as the figure in charge pulled down her hood. My angel.


The thought scared me more than anything else. My angel in charge of this… blasphemy, this crime against nature and humanity. I had to run. The air seemed to wrap decaying fingers around my throat preventing me from breathing. I shoved my mouth in my hands and choked. I had to leave.


A loud bass kick thumped causing the entire room to quake. I fell to my knees as the thumping continued to beat against my skull. A whispering melody began accompanying the bass blurring my vision. I crawled to my feet and stumbled around, the shapes in front of my eyes seemed to morph, twist, and collapse on themselves. Something desired to force its way up my throat and out my mouth. I bent over and emptied my stomach on the hardwood floor. 


Once I stood up again, I found myself on top of the familiar stairs. I turned around to see the sliding glass door with a hole in it. Escape. Footsteps charged up the stairs. I was found out.


I ran back to the room and ripped the door open. Running through the door and toward the balcony railings. I vaulted over the balcony while holding on and turning 180 degrees to face the door I had just escaped through. Just before lowering myself and letting go of the balcony, I spotted the shadowy figures rush into the bedroom I had been in seconds ago. The jaw of my beautiful one unhinged like a python about to devour a deer as a raspy growl escaped her lips. I let go and fell.


After landing into a roll, I sprung to my feet and ran out of the courtyard and past the pool. Moonlight bounced off the pool revealing the floating toys to be human bodies. I choked off the scream and used the energy to run faster, past the iron-wrought fence, past the willow trees and bushes. I didn’t stop until I made it off the property. I ran to my car, hopped in and started the car.


I allowed myself to breath easier only when I was locked in my apartment downtown. Work be damned. I was going to stay inside. My hands shook as I plugged in my headphones and began playing some Witch House. Within the comforts of my own apartment, the entire night’s events felt like a bad hangover. I let the [music take me away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmXjKgiT5t4&amp;t). My consciousness snapped awake as whispering vocals began a gibbering intonation that merged into comprehensible words. Female vocals that I’ve never heard in that particular song before.


*Trespass is a crime. You’ll not escape this time.* This was chanted over and over again.


I laughed. And laughed and laughed. None of this made any sense. It was hours before I finally came to my senses and remembered the blue sapphire I had pocketed. The cops wouldn’t believe my horror story, but they would believe in grand larceny, which meant time in prison with guards and other witnesses. I need protection. Those… things will have to work to make my corpse join that [blasphemous choir.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sqstories/)"
c9ckxl,2,2019-07-05,Contract Position or Internship?,peanutbutterjamjelly,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/c9ckxl/contract_position_or_internship/,"First time posting, so please let me know if I am violating any rules.

&amp;#x200B;

After working more than a year as an intern at a software company in Vancouver, my manager is giving me an option to extend my internship with a wage of $31/hour (with medical &amp; dental benefits) or to be a contractor (no benefits). 

&amp;#x200B;

Background/Other details: 
&amp;#x200B;
After completing my Bachelor's degree in an unrelated field, I went back to school to pursue a technical diploma. Finished the first year of the program and then got the internship position I am currently in right now. I started my internship at $24/hour. After 8 months, my pay was increased to $25/hour with benefits. I am working in the IT field. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: Which option should I go for, internship or contractor position? Is what I am being offered a good deal?

&amp;#x200B;

I am actually leaning more towards taking the contractor position since I have worked as an intern on my team for more than a year already and I see a contractor position as a ""better"" role than being that of a student intern. If I want to pursue the contractor position, my manager is asking me to give him a number of how much pay I think I should get, given that there are no benefits included in this position. I was told that the base pay is similar to that of what is being offered as the intern position ($31/hour) but then I need to account for the missed benefits/vacation pay. I will also need to either create my own company or go through a third party (who will take a cut of my pay) if i become a contractor. How much should I ask for? 

&amp;#x200B;

Does working as a contractor make sense or should I continue on as an intern?"

I have developed PHP pages before, but I can't seem to understand SOAP requests or how to teste them locally ! 

Here are my main doubts:

 \- What files do I have to create on project folder, other than index.php? Do I have to write an .xml file, or .wdsl? 

 \- As I understood, client makes a request to the server, wich answers the request with an xml file. Where do I see this file?

 \- Assuming I can test it locally, is there any difference between testing it with *php localhost* or XAMPP?

 \-If , and only if, I get to that, how do I proceed to use MTOM on it? 

 Basically I need help understanding all the steps needed to fully understand and do a soap request locally, with php pages.

I just graduated college with a computer science degree last month, and started my full time job recently. I have been a Software Engineering intern with this company for a few summers now, and it was a great experience. Before I accepted the full-time offer, my company asked if I would be interested in a few different fields, and I expressed some interest in some of them.  I was very honest with my skills during the interview, and they still decided to put me in a new role. My official title is an Embedded Reverse Engineer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty excited about this new position when I started a few weeks ago. However, now I feel like I am sinking really fast. I just don't have the knowledge to start in this position and I am having a hard time keeping up. I really enjoy the team and the workplace, so I want to stay on the project. **I was wondering if there were any good courses or resources out there to help me get started in reverse engineering or any important related concepts? I would prefer something that will start me off at the basics.** I want to make sure I have a good foundation.  I know software and I am pretty good at coding, but everything else I have seen so far seems like a second language to me. I just have no idea where to begin."

I had worked in non-profit, wholesale, and retail management for 20yrs and hit a ceiling without a degree and thought why stay in these industries and not see a decent ROI (at my age). Since PC's have always been my side hobby but not to the point of writing code, I decided MIS would be a good idea as I could bridge business and IT pretty easily with people with little understanding of either. 

Now, at 45, I graduate in August and am looking to take my next step. I have worked as an IT Project Coordinator (Intern) for the past 9 months getting good exposure within an ERP Implementation project but I have the option to leave when I graduate or remain in the position through the 1st SIT that runs through October. 

However, I left a $50k/yr job for the internship and make $20/hr w/o any benefits as an intern. I have a daughter so getting insurance and benefits are important to me, almost as much as a decent salary. I am looking at PM options and pretty much everything I see are contract positions for 6 month to 1yr terms. I have no experience with contract work so can anyone share experiences that have worked or not in contracting for PM Roles? I have my CAPM certification (I don't have enough hours collected for the PMP) and the experience in the ERP implementation so I have a little experience but I am unsure if I am experienced enough to do contact work that may not have the training that a company would offer in a career position. I am looking at Project Associate, Project Coordinator, or Portfolio/Program positions. Any advice would be appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

Myyreh-of-Relgreh's helmet slammed shut. The other two crew had vacated the hotel room with typical Dorarizin speed as they headed for the shuttle. Now that nobody was left in the room, she could make her exit as dynamic as she liked.

She crouched and gripped the protruding handle from Resh'skk's armor-pod with one hand. Her boots slammed into the tough material of the floor, leaving huge rutted chunks in her wake as she headed for the window. At the last moment, she leaped and activated her jump jets.

The standard thrust on a seventh-gen set of Dorarizin power armor is around eight thousand kilonewtons in \[human\] measurements, which is damn near the same as a Rocketdyne F-1 engine. Five of those engines were used on the first stage of the Saturn V moon rocket. However, instead of pushing a giant multi-ton rocket towards the moon, the jet's thrust is concentrated into the relatively lightweight package of one Dorarizin plus armor.

This results in a thrust-to-weight ratio of Ow My Ears.

A fountain of glass sprayed forth from the face of the apartment building, and in the middle of that geyser of fractured fragments was the streak of Myyreh's armor.

Myyreh landed in a massive crunching thud, having easily outrun the shards of glass that still hung in the air behind her. She activated her jets again and leaped once more, leaving a sizable crater in the ground behind her as she aimed for the distant pyramidal shape of Sssnnathor's palace.

As Myyreh sailed in a graceful ballistic arc, her ears became filled with warning alarms. Her approach had most certainly been detected by several radar systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Far above, the arrowhead shape of the *Furious Claw of Inquiry* cruised serenely along ts assigned orbit. Right when the Captain and Bgrarh declared \[Calvinball\], the ship began to wake up.

The awaking was not analogous to that of an organic being; in some sense the ship was always 'awake', its sensors always scanning for potential threats. Sensor data flowed in constant streams through subsidiary levels of computation, compared with data from other sensors and that from the ship's history. Probabilities were constantly computed and the overall danger to the ship evaluated on a nanosecond-by-nanosecond basis. Usually that probability hovered at a comfortably low value, but in the next nanosecond the input from one of the EM sensors spiked. The spike was corroborated with that measured by several other, more esoteric sensors on the hull, and a likely profile pulled from memory matched the measurements precisely.

A targeting system had just latched onto the *Claw*.

More of the ship's systems came online. Nothing in the computers could be called 'aware' in any real sense. There was no sense of self let alone the ability to recognize that sense of self. In many ways a 'mere' machine could react faster. There was no ego to become angry, no possible way the ship could become caught in the neurochemical feedback loop of a fearful sapient.

Instead what occurred was a dispassionate and *very* fast evaluation of the danger; the *Claw* then compared that evaluation to a pre-set number of different options for response. In less than a microsecond after the first EM spike, the closest-matching option blossomed into the computer network of the *Claw*. The various routines and subroutines and sub-subroutines were far too complex to put into mere words, but for a \[human\] the overall option could be summed up in three words:

COWABUNGA IT IS.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

As the Captain started her charge, Bgrarh spun and yelled at the door to the backstage hut. ""{GUITAR!}""

He caught just a glimpse of a feathered arm as one of the Karnakians within chucked out \[Oscar's\] instrument. Bgrarh felt a brief pang of utter panic as he caught the small guitar by the neck.

His friend was in grave danger, both he and the other tiny-chomper were just...*gone*. With great effort Bgrarh tamped down his panic as he windmilled his arm into the stage and smashed the guitar against it.

It was a mighty blow worthy of Pete Townsend himself, and \[Oscar's\] guitar splintered into shards...except for two larger shapes that fell out of the wreckage. \[Oscar's\] statement to Nerlharg-of-Aergh was pure grlnada-shit; the instrument was not real wood, but a nano-engineered replica of \[Oscar's\] original, complete with a shielded compartment inside. That compartment didn't affect the guitar's acoustics, and was just large enough to hold a couple of small pistols.

Bgrarh scooped up the pair of weapons and stood; as he did so Tk'rii'na leapt onto the stage. All four of the Karnakian's eyes were wide in panic as he touched his front-top button, causing his helmet and gloves to snap into position.

""\[What do we do?\]"" asked Tk'rii'na.

Bgrarh was surprised at his own lack of emotion. Some small part of his brain screamed at him to run, to get moving after his kidnapped friends. But he knew that splitting themselves up was a sure way to get them all killed piecemeal. The right course of action was to regroup and meet up with the others. After that they could go rescue \[Oscar\] and \[Maria\]. He felt as if a cloak of freezing cold fell over him as he replied. ""{Collect the others. We fortify here. Rip up the stage and use the material to form some cover. I'll go help the Captain.}""

He spun and ran towards Rgrarshok's distant figure, who in turn was in the middle of her own charge at a pair of armored guards. The panicked guests panicked even more at the sight of his huge figure running towards the edge of the stage, creating a rising amount of screaming and pushing.

Bgrarh didn't care. In an instant the old instincts kicked back in and he was once more one of the most celebrated flankers to ever play in the professional Hunt leagues. He ducked and wove like a ghost through the yelling horde, readying the pistol in his right hand as Rgrarshok reached one of the guards. The other pistol he got ready to throw to the Captain.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of firing his rifle, the guard tried to use it as a club on Rgarshok. She ducked under the sweeping blow from the guard, then grabbed the rifle barrel and tried to wrest it from his grip. But it felt like the weapon was encased in concrete, and as her muscles swelled in a fruitless attempt the guard flicked the rifle again and threw her away. She plowed into several party-goers, which broke her fall but also served to add to the screaming.

""{Stupid bitch,}"" growled the other guard. ""{Did you really think you could fight us without power armor?}""

Rgrarshok rolled back up into a crouch as her clothing unfolded into combat mode. She held up one huge paw, not having to look as she *knew* that Bgrarh was heading for her position with their contraband pistols. A satisfying thud of a compact mass slamming into her gloved paw made her grin, and upon seeing that grin both the guards started to raise their rifles.

The Captain slammed up into the guard that had just thrown her, pushing his rifle up out of the way with her free paw. Her other paw spun her pistol around into a firing position, and with blurring speed she jammed the pistol's muzzle right into the gap between the guard's helmet and the armored collar extending up from his breastplate.

Her pistol barked repeatedly, and the guard reeled back. His more cloth-like underarmor had stopped the shots from taking his head off, but there was still a considerable stream of blue blood down his chest from the wound. Rgarshok gave another heave on the rifle barrel, and this time it came loose from the guard's slackening grip. She took a quick glance around and saw that the partygoers had long-vacated this section of the floor.

Simultaneous with her shots came more from Bgrarh that sparked off of the other guard's helmet, causing that goon to swing his rifle towards the charging Dorarizin. The goon didn't realize that his partner had lost his rifle until Rrgarshok flipped her purloined weapon around, got a firm hold on it, then let loose a short burst into the goon's side.

The rifle fired a stream of hypersonic ultra-dense flechettes, and while the goon's armor was good it was not capable of withstanding such abuse. Flechettes found their way into the various crevices and joints of the armor, shredding flesh and bone underneath.

Bgrarh trotted up as the goon collapsed with a dying groan. In the meantime Rgarshok delivered another burst to the first guard, just to make sure he wasn't getting up. From behind her she could hear loud thumps and see flashing light reflected off of the atrium's walls as the Karnakians began applying their flashbang grenades with a will.

""{Get his weapon and ammo,}"" said Rgarshok.

""{Already on it, dear,}"" replied Bgarh as he hefted the other rifle. He patted down the body next to him and removed a few magazines. ""{I just hope they've maintained these. I'd hate to have it jam on me.}""

""{Just be grateful they cheaped out and didn't put in biometric locks,}"" said Rgarshok as they double-timed back towards the stage. What had been a smooth expanse now looked like a jagged-edged crater, with several helmeted Karnakian heads carefully peeking over the ramparts. A ring of twitching guards lay on the floor, the victims of both flashbangs and much tasering.

As they ran, Rgrarshok heard a Jornissian scream from the hut.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

""&lt;What do I do?&gt;"" asked Hrathra'sstah in a blind panic. Her red gaze darted around the now-ruined hut as if hoping she'd find some sign of Maria, some indication that this whole thing was just a huge mistake. But Maria was truly gone. Her friend, her intern, the one she was responsible for, was now in the hands of a tyrant.

Resh'skk unfolded his clothing into combat mode, then pointed out the door to the stage. They could hear the sounds of Karnakian destruction ringing out, accompanied by the occasional *whump* and strobing light of a flashbang grenade. ""&lt;Go out there, get in the middle of them. Armor up and cloak yourself. There's some things in here we can use as cover, I'll get them and join you shortly.&gt;"" He then reached up to his collar and promptly vanished.

Hrathra fumbled at her own collar and pressed the cloaking button just as an armored-up Dorarizin leapt into the middle of the jagged opening where the Karnakians had made their dramatic exit. She froze as the goon's smooth, bullet-like helmet swept over the space. There was no visible face or expression, making the intruder look like an incarnation of Harsak-Who-Devours-The-Dead.

She could almost picture the goon's eyes narrowing as that featureless mask stared at Hrathra. ""\[I see you, snakes. You can't hide from radar...\]""

The goon staggered as a flickering *something* leapt through the air and into his side. For a moment the guard went through a flailing pantomime as if trying to fight off invisible ropes, then finally he clenched one fist tight. Hrathra stood frozen in fear as she heard Resh'skk's hiss of pain.

The guard drew back his free fist and delivered a massive punch to empty space. Resh'skk's body snapped back into visiblity as he flew across the hut and fetched up against the far wall.

Hrathra let out a steam-boiler shriek. Resh'skk's helmet had come off of his head, and his head lolled with unseeing eyes as a small trickle of emerald blood trailed out of his mouth. She gathered herself to leap towards him, not caring if the bastard saw her.

""\[Don't move, you idiot,\]"" spat the guard. Hrathra froze. ""\[If you resist, I'll kill you as well.\]""

With a trembling hand, Hrathra reached up and unfolded her own clothing into combat mode. She glanced over at the still, sprawled body of Resh'skk and with a flaring hood she flung herself towards his killer.

The goon threw a casual backhand, connecting with the side of her helmet and sending Hrathra tumbling into the wall opposite Resh'skk's body. She fell to the ground with a substantial thump as she decloaked.  Her ears rang from the blow as she shook her head to clear it, knowing that her attacking was futile. Hrathra'sstah was a scholar, not a warrior. But she would be dammed to rot in Harsak's coils for eternity if she was going to let Resh'skk death be for nothing.

She coiled herself back up and froze. The goon now stood in the center of the hut, facing her with an ugly-looking pistol in one hand. ""\[Last chance. Come quietly or I send you to be with your pal back there.\]""

Hrathra determination faltered. Now that she was staring down the wrong end of a gun she felt her panic go into overdrive. But she wasn't about to give the bastard the satisfaction.

Right as she made the determination to tell the guard to stick it, a red-and-brown scaled hand reached up and around from behind the guard. With nimble fingers the hand darted in and pressed a latch just under the helmet's jawline, then plucked the helmet off in the same smooth motion.

Hrathra suddenly found herself staring at the brown-furred and very puzzled face of her attacker. His puzzlement lasted all of a second before Resh'skk's tail wrapped around the goon's now-exposed throat and *squeezed*.

She looked away and winced at the sound of crunching bone and larynx, noting that Resh'skk had already pushed the guard's pistol down towards the floor.

""&lt;So much for that,&gt;"" said Resh'skk as he released the goon's now-ruined throat. The lifeless armored body slumped into a heap in front of him. Resh'skk held up the helmet to regard it for a moment, then with a derisive snort he tossed it onto its former bearer. ""&lt;This fourth-gen stuff is garbage. The newer armor is all linked to the wearer's implant, so it doesn't come off unless they want it to.&gt;""

Hrathra reached a trembling hand forward. ""&lt;Are...are you alright?&gt;""

""&lt;Of course!&gt;"" Resh'skk sounded peeved that she'd even ask such a thing. He wiped a bit of stage blood away from his mouth. ""&lt;I'm gonna have one Harsak-crushed bruise on my cheek, not to mention a big one on my backside. The cloaks weren't effective, so I had to get that idiot's mind off of me and take him by surprise. My finest performance yet, if I do say so myself.&gt;""

He cracked a rare smile, and at the sight Hrathra felt a great weight lift from her. She playfully bapped at his nose. ""&lt;If we weren't in a combat situation I'd show you just what I think of your performance, you utter tease!&gt;""

Another few *whumps* and strobe-lights came from outside. Hrathra gagged as a smell came drifting into the hut. It could only be described as pestilential, with the worst aspects of rotting food and burning rubber.

Resh'skk's smile grew even wider. ""&lt;Ah, the smell of battle. Let's go wreck some shit, shall we?&gt;""

Grawfren-of-Delzreg, pilot for the *Furious Claw of Inquiry*, cursed and dove the shuttle back towards the ground. A bright beam of ravening fire stabbed through the space where the sleek scarab shape had just been.

""{What the moon-cursed crap is going on?}"" called Egwreh from the rear. Both she and the doctor were strapped in, but that manuever had still made her stomach nearly climb out of her mouth.

""{Point defense system from the compound,}"" Grawfren yelled back. ""{We can't get close. Myyreh said she had some troubles too, but she's a lot smaller than us. And I'm getting some signals from the *Claw* that the orbital systems are acting up. Looks like we've been put on the hit list.}""

Egwreh glanced out a side window and saw a multicolored river of panicked people pouring down the main ramp from Snnathor's palace. The tyrant's party was definitely over.

&amp;#x200B;

Rgrarshok peered over the improvised barricade and readied her rifle. The once-packed atrium was now nearly deserted; there were a few guards around in low-profile armor either unconscious or sprawled out groaning in pain from getting a flashbang grenade to the face.

The area stunk with the unholy reek of whatever Bgrarh had packed into their uniform's grenades. In spite of the huge size of the atrium, that smell still hung in the air and seemed to spear right up Rgarshok's nose. She had to concentrate to keep from gagging.

From the exit where the tiny-chompers had been taken, she caught a few glimpses of armored forms moving about. She let off a few bursts to make them keep their heads down, a tactic she knew would not work for much longer.

""{Myyreh, status,}"" she snapped.

*""{Almost there, boss. Had to dodge a few beams on the way in.}""*

""{Grawfren?}""

*""{No joy, Captain. We're too big of a target, I had to put us down about \[six blocks\] from the entrance.}""*

Rgarshok growled. ""{Very well. Bunker in place, once we regroup we'll head to you.  Any sign of transports leaving the palace?}""

*""{Nothing by air or ground,}""* replied Grawfren. *""{They may have escape tunnels.}""*

Rgrarshok sagged a little. ""{Any telemetry from \[Oscar\] or \[Maria\]?""}

*""{Their biometric signals dropped off a \[few minutes\] ago, and the tracking signals from their commbeads are holding constant about \[one kilometer\] from here,}""* said Kgrashak.

""{They probably stripped them and took out their translators,}"" said Bgrarh from beside her. His usually cheerful face was set like grim death.

""\[We'll get them both back,\]"" said Irr''kttz from the rear. ""\[Our cause is just and pure, and we are blessed by the Great Spirit. How can we possibly fail?\]""

Rgrarshok took another peek and let loose another stream of hypervelocity flechettes, chewing a little bit more out of the exit's edge as she did so. But she could see that there were more shapes, crouching under cover. Sssnnathor's forces were clearly getting ready to make a push into the atrium.

""{For starters, we can fail by getting shot to shit,}"" Rgrarshok muttered.

""\[Surrender!\]"" called out one of the crouching guards in a tinny, amplified voice.

Rgrarshok scootched closer to Bgrarh. ""{Work from the left when they start pushing in, I'll go from the right. We need to keep them bunched up in the middle, keep them from flanking us.}""

""{Got it.}""

The push, when it came, was fast and committed. A swarm of armored Dorarizin and Jornissians flowed out of the exit, met just as quickly by two whining streams of flechettes. Some fell, but not enough. The swarm began to split up as the attackers began to move to each side...

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Overhead, one of the atrium's panoramic windows exploded inward and showered glass over the guards. One guard looked up just in time to get Myyreh's armored boots right into his faceplate. She landed in the midst of them like a fragmentation grenade with the pin pulled.

A grenade would have been more merciful.

In one whirling motion, she threw Resh'skk's pod towards the distant stage and turned that same spin into a vicious sidekick. That kick bore the force of her rage, amplified by the seventh-gen armor. It was enough force to stave in the chestplate of the nearest guard and smash his ribcage right into his heart. The goon fell onto his back with a choking gurgle.

They tried to get their rifles to bear, but half of them realized the situation had turned into a circular firing squad and held their fire. The other half weren't as bright and opened fire anyway. Most of the shots hit their comrades, the few that did hit the intended target glanced harmlessly off of the armored black whirlwind that was now Myyreh-of-Relgreh.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

The big lozenge-shape of the armor pod sailed over the barricade, then hit the floor with a resounding thud and slid forward. Resh'skk stopped its slide with his substantial tail, and upon detecting its owner's implant the armor obediently began to unfold.  He shoved both hands into the center of the pod, then hefted the whole thing up and thumped it against his chest.

In a smooth ballet of advanced technology, armor plates flowed around him, locking into place and forming a scaly metallic carapace. The last thing to go into place was the helmet, and as the visor slammed shut he stretched his arms and took a deep breath. Targeting information and comm channels were now overlaid on his vision, a view that he hadn't seen for quite a while. Memories of past actions flickered at the edge of his consciousness, but the former soldier tamped down that nonsense with a single snort.

His friend was kidnapped and in mortal danger. There was no time for dwelling on past trauma. The only thing on his mind now was tearing a Sotek-sized hole in Sssnnathor after getting \[Maria\] back safe and sound. He looked down and saw the one remaining item from the pod, a narrow-beam maser rifle that was his weapon of choice. He swept it up into his hands, and the familiar feel of the gun made his instincts kick back in. Once more he was a soldier.

Like a matte-gray battering ram Resh'skk flowed at the barricade. Dorarizin and Karnakian alike leaped aside to make way as he smashed through the material and kept going, aiming for the distant knot of guards that was surrounded by even more downed forms.

""&lt;\[Myyreh!\] Get clear of that lot!&gt;"" he yelled.

One side of the knot exploded outward, showering armored figures as Myyreh rolled away from the center. Resh'skk brought his maser to his shoulder, its aim-point helpfully plastered on his visor.

Some of the guards had seen him coming, but even as they turned Resh'skk fired. He swept the beam in a back-and-forth arc, scything it through the center group while making sure to keep it well away from Myyreh.

After a second or two of firing, he stopped. After another second or two, the cluster of guards simply fell apart in a spray of blue and emerald blood. Scattered body parts now littered the area where they'd stood.

Resh'skk hummed a marching tune from his adolescence as he flowed forward. He started making a mental tally of how many had been cut apart by his maser versus how many had been either shot or kicked to bits. By the time he reached Myyreh, he had quite a satisfied smile on his face that he knew she could see. Thanks to their linked telemetry, the pair could see each other's faces as if they weren't armored.

""&lt;Looks like it's twenty for me and fifteen for you,&gt;"" he purred.

Myyreh gave her last victim's helmet a massive twist, and over the sound of a crunching spine she looked at Resh'skk with a flinty eye.

""\[Fifteen? I got at *least* twenty-five!\]""

""&lt;Ah, but ten of those were shot by each other, not smacked to death by you.&gt;""

""\[It still counts! They were shooting at me!\]"" She shook her head. ""\[We'll settle this later. What's the plan, Captain? We have a few \[minutes\] before they try another sally. We're going after the tiny-chompers, right?\]""

Rgrarshok's voice sounded in their ears. *""{If they used tunnels, then no. We have no idea what sort of booby-traps might be down there. We need to regroup and get to the shuttle before any rescue attempt.}""*

Myyreh's shoulders drooped. ""\[You're right, boss. Damn it all.\]""

Resh'skk slithered forward and placed a gauntlet on her shoulder. ""&lt;We'll get them back. I'll even let you have first go at Sssnnathor after I get to him.&gt;""

One edge of her mouth curled up in a sad smile. ""\[No, I'll let *you* have first go after *I* get to him.\]""

Maria lay on a metal floor, curled into a ball. Her surroundings were nothing but metal walls, forming a cube about six feet across. There was light inside here, but that was it as far as creature comforts went.

Her uniform and translator bead were gone; the huge Dorarizin who'd captured her made it quite clear that either she took them off herself or he'd remove both items himself. Not wanting to get those claws anywhere near her ear or body, she'd complied.

At least she still had her underwear on. At least she wasn't alone.

Oscar sat across the little cell from her, his legs folded like a meditating monk and his jaw set forward like he'd bitten into a lemon. He was only clad in boxers himself; he'd been given the same ultimatum and had complied without saying a word. Come to think of it, he hadn't said anything since they'd been captured.

The memory of that made Maria curl even tighter into herself. She'd been held in an iron grip, cloaked and unable to yell a warning, as she watched Oscar approach the hologram version of herself. Within an eyeblink he'd also been snatched, but at least he'd been able to get a arm up beforehand...for all the good that did. In spite of his size, the big guy was pretty fast.

The little cell swayed in constant motion; they were clearly getting moved somewhere else, but there were no cues to give her a sense of direction.

Maria sniffled and felt tears well up in her eyes. She didn't know which possible fate would be the worst. Either Sssnnathor was going to have them tortured, or maybe he'd dress them up and turn them into pets. Or maybe he'd have them walk around naked so he could...

No. She couldn't afford to let her mind go *there* or she'd really start sobbing. Maria uncurled herself and wiped a hand across her face. The motion got tears and snot all over her hand. ""Fuck,"" she muttered.

Oscar said nothing.

""Not gonna talk, eh?""

He shook his head, then touched his ear and motioned to the walls around them.

Maria mirrored his posture as she leaned against the cold metal behind her. ""Fuck it. I don't care who's listening in. We're in real trouble, aren't we?""

Oscar shrugged.

""Snape's not a dummy,"" she said. ""He'll figure things out, and when he does...either we get killed or he'll hold us as hostages when he boogaloos out of here."" She slumped, staring at the metal deck beneath her legs. ""You don't think he'll..."" she started, before trailing off.

Oscar worked his jaw as if chewing on some gum before finally speaking. ""He'll what?""

""You know. Will Snape...will he do *that* to me? Or to you? I guess he might swing both ways.""

He shrugged again. ""I don't think so. Way too much chance of hurting us by accident. He wants us nice and alive, for the moment. Best not to think about it.""

""Easy for you to say!"" she snapped. Then, more softly, ""Sorry. I know you've had all sorts of army training and you've been in bad situations before. I'm just a nerd who likes history."" She hugged her knees to her chest. ""I guess it's like you said awhile back. You never know how you'll react until you're really dropped into the shit. I thought I'd made peace with the idea of being in danger, but now...now I don't know. I don't know how much longer I can keep it together.""

Oscar leaned forward and put a big warm hand on her knee. ""You can only do what you can."" After a moment Maria covered his hand with her own. They stayed like that for a long time as their little prison swayed with an increasing tempo.

The chosen asteroid was a tumbling and irregular lump of ice, one of many left over from the planet's terraforming. This one had just the right size, and no internal cracks or crevices to weaken its structural integrity. That integrity was about to be put to the test.

Because of its usual mission, the *Claw* did not possess much in the way of armaments. What armor and weapons the ship carried were more intended to fight off the occasional pirate rather than withstand the concentrated fire from a planetary defense system. Therefore, the Senate team had to get creative. One way to get creative was to take advantage of the surprisingly large heat capacity of water-ice.

Bright light pulsed from the *Claw's* engines as it approached the icy ball. Several missiles appeared as distant specks behind the ship as it drove forward. Point defense lasers speared out from the ship, melting a hole that was almost wide enough to admit the ship. The *Claw's* engines didn't shut off as the ship drove its wedge-like prow hard into the ice and wedged itself deep into the asteroid. Within moments all that was visible of the *Claw* was the merest hint of its engines protruding from its self-made hole.

Those engines pulsed harder as the speared asteroid began to slew about, aiming itself towards the planet below. As it moved, the distant specks resolved into thin tubes that smacked into the rock-like surface of the ice. Bright, soundless flashes erupted as their warheads went off, but after the flashes faded there were only a few new shallow craters in the asteroid's surface.

The icy moonlet began to glow with friction as it plunged into the planet's atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

Resh'skk poked his helmet around the edge of the main entrance. ""&lt;Coast is clear. Nobody in sight. Looks like everybody got the hell out of \[Dodge\]. \[Myyreh\], you're up.&gt;""

Myyreh slipped around him like flowing smoke. She now carried one of the guard's flechette rifles as she sprinted towards the bottom of the ramp. There was a clump of trees near that ramp which he thought should give good concealment. Myyreh must have thought so as well, because she crouched behind one of the trees and, after scanning ahead of her, gave Resh'skk the 'go' signal.

""&lt;Move, people!&gt;"" he yelled behind him.

The rest of the team jogged at double-time through the entrance and down the main ramp. Resh'skk kept guard by the entrance until the last of them was safely at Myyreh's location, then he slithered down to rejoin them as he kept his maser trained back on the entrance. He half expected the palace's point defense to start firing at them, but it looked like the system was only interested in aerial targets.

They kept moving in a leapfrog-style manner, with the two armored-up team members keeping constant watch from either end. Resh'skk had a moment where he thought they might actually make it to the shuttle without incident, but that notion died as the *Claw's* shuttle came into view. The craft was parked in a little grove of taller vegetation, presumably to screen it from the palace's point defense. But overlaid in his vision were many large IR-emitting shapes secreted in the shrubbery. Those shapes all wore heavy armor, so they were clearly not any of the Senate team.

""\[Problem?\]"" asked Myyreh as she jogged up behind him. Then she got a look as well at the situation. ""\[Aw, spit.\]""

""&lt;They're waiting for us to arrive,&gt;"" said Resh'skk. He looked around. There were a few shuttles parked on a nearby street. He figured that was probably the transportation for their current problem.

The Captain leaned around his other side as she touched her ear. ""\[Grawfren, can you get out of that grove? Looks like there's a welcoming committee.\]""

\*""\[I'll try. I'll be taking fire from both them and the point defense the moment I take off, but I'll try to keep the damage to the shuttle at a minimum.\]""\*

""\[We'll coordinate it, then,\]"" said the Captain. ""\[The moment you get airborne we'll open fire on the guards to take their attention off of you. On three....\]""

It almost worked. Grawfren all but leapt the shuttle out of its cover in an instant, and in that same instant every team member with a weapon began shooting at the shrubbery. The whine of hypersonic flechettes was intercut with the deeper hiss of Resh'skk's maser, and within moments the shrubbery erupted as the guards charged out of their concealment. They ran or slithered at the team with amplified speed, and Resh'skk had a brief distant thought that he admired their courage. In spite of his weapon scything through their ranks, not enough of them were going down...

Overhead, the shuttle ducked towards the ground again...but not fast enough. A large bang an a plume of smoke from its rear indicated that the craft had been tagged by a laser from the palace. Grawfren managed to pull out of her sudden plummet as the shuttle scraped along the ground and banged into one of the other parked shuttles. The craft was now on the other side of the charging group of guards, and even further away than before.

""&lt;Well, fuck,&gt;"" Resh'skk muttered. He sighted his weapon on the lead guard and got ready to fire...

Then he blinked in astonishment as one of the parked shuttles suddenly turned and drove straight along the ground towards them. For a moment Resh'skk thought it was aimed at his team, but then realized at the last moment that whoever was driving the damn thing was aiming at the guards.

Armor and flesh met the prow of a vehicle designed to withstand both the freezing vacuum of space and the crushing depths of a gas giant. There was quite a bit of screaming and a *lot* of crunching as the shuttle slid to a stop, rolling on the remains of its victims.

The shuttle's side-door slid open, revealing the last person Resh'skk expected to see. ""&lt;Ter'yeik? You're supposed to be on the ship.&gt;""

""\[No time to explain! Get on board!\]""

Rgrarshok stood with an expression like a looming thundercloud. ""\[All right. Grawfren, Egwreh, Kgrashak...get your tails over here. We're heading out.\]""

Resh'skk kept guard until the last crewmember was in, then all but sprinted into the shuttle himself...and came to a dead stop. The two Matriarchs stood with sheepish expressions near the front of the shuttle, but nobody was paying attention to them.

Everyone was glaring at the feathered form seated at the pilot's station, and Resh'skk heard the Captain's knuckles crack as she clenched one gloved paw tight.

""\[I'll explain everything later!\]"" yelled The Silken Feather. ""\[But for now we *really* need to be leaving!\]"""
c9ht2e,43,2019-07-05,AP tests and community college equivalencies are a hidden form of financial aid. Be sure to factor them in when deciding on schools.,hunter15991,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c9ht2e/ap_tests_and_community_college_equivalencies_are/,"So you got your AP scores today, it seems. 

Congrats! Some of you may be ecstatic about your 5's, some may be angry about your 3's. I got a 2 in AP Physics and made it through college more or less ok - so please don't worry that your 3 is the end of the world. 

/u/admissionsmom  [has a great post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c9gydl/lets_talk_about_your_ap_scores/) about AP scores, and there's a lot of good advice there. I'd like to touch on the actual ""receiving credit"" part at your school of choice, and how that is a secret form of financial aid. 

While this post is mainly geared to AP tests, same reasoning applies to SAT subject tests, community college grades, etc.

Speaking as a college graduate, transferable credit was a godsend for me. I graduated from high school with 32 college credits to my name - which put me as an academic sophomore. 

This allowed me an unbelievable amount of flexibility in college - I was able to take fewer classes some semesters, dabble in electives in others, learn stuff ahead of time that made me a more competitive internship hire, etc. If you've yet to take any tests, I highly recommend doing so - even if AP classes aren't available at your school.

For all of you who have gotten scores back, my main warning is to ***not assume that they're universal, and to not underestimate their value***.

Because while some schools accept a lot of AP credit, some don't. And the difference means a lot more than you'd initially think. 

Once you've got a list of colleges hammered out, make sure to check each of their AP/SAT-Subject/CC/etc. ""test credit""/""course equivalencies"" list. These spell out just how much credit you'll get for each AP test you took, and what specific class it gets rid of.

Doing so helps you plan ahead of time. Many state school-bound students at my HS took our AP English Literature test after already passing the AP English Language test the year prior. Once it came time to register for college classes in the summer, they were surprised to find out that they would only get credit for either Eng. Lang. or Eng. Lit., but not both. Had they checked online ahead of time they'd have found out their schools would only accept one AP English test, and could have saved themselves the studying trouble and test fees. 

And also check that the credit you *will* get is at all applicable to your degree. Typically, degrees at schools consist of 4 types of classes - general-ed prerequisites (Category 1), major-specific courses (Category 2), in-major electives (Category 3), and normal electives (Category 4). For an engineering major, these 4 categories could be stuff like History 101, Engineering 202, Physics 121, and Design 101 respectively. At most schools, ~20% of your courses will fall into the Category 4, and any accepted AP test will chip away at them (or courses in other categories).

But sometimes the amount of Category 4 courses you'll end up having to take in college are quite low - maybe even 0. And that'll mean that even though you got a 5 on some AP test and got college credit for it, it still won't count towards your graduation. If possible, it's advisable to look up the ""major map""/""degree path""/etc. for the major you're interested in at the colleges you're applying to to see which specific courses are important for graduation, and thus which AP courses can be taken in high school to make your college tenure easier.

Do not assume that test scores are universally accepted. Same goes for community college courses and other tests.

_____________________________

Similarly, do not underestimate the value of accepting a test score. College is expensive, and transfer credits can help whittle down the cost.

Which of these two schools is cheaper? Let's assume that outside of cost they are identical in prestige/climate/location/etc. They both have a sticker price of $30K a semester, and $60K a year - extrapolating out to $240K over the course of four years.

* School A: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $40K/year in grant money.
* School B: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $38K/year in grant money.

Obviously School A is the answer. It costs $80K over 4 years, as opposed to $88K for School B.

But what if we threw in AP tests into the mix?

* School A: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $40K/year in grant money. No AP test credits are offered.
* School B: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $38K/year in grant money. You've also qualified for 12 credits through AP tests, valued at $765/hour (the valuation at my school)

The aid coming from School A is 40K every year, for four years - or $160K. The aid coming from School B is 38K every year, for four years - or $152K. But School B also just knocked $9,180 off your tuition price. School A ends up costing $80K  over 4 years, while School B costs $78,820 over 4 years. School B, therefore, is cheaper.

I chose 12 credits because that keep us dealing solely with tuition. What if you got 15 AP credits, and were able to graduate a semester early?

* School A: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $40K/year in grant money. No AP test credits are offered.
* School B: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $38K/year in grant money. You've also qualified for 15 credits through AP tests, valued at $765/hour.

In this case, the valuation doesn't mean everything, because we're instead looking at the full spectrum of costs. School A still costs $80K over the course of 4 years. School B, however, will not last 4 years. You instead will pay $66K over the first three years, and then $11K the next semester - and then graduate, for a final cost of $77K. You also get an extra half year of earning power and enter into a less competitive job market (if you don't head on to grad school), which is big. Instead of spending an additional $11K studying at school in your spring semester, you'll be earning $20K for that half year - a total swing of $31K.

What if you got 32 credits, like me, and decided to graduate ASAP?

* School A: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $40K/year in grant money. No AP test credits are offered.
* School B: $60K/year sticker price, but you get $38K/year in grant money. You've also qualified for 32 credits through AP tests, valued at $765/hour.

School A ends up costing $80K over 4 years. School B costs $64,470 over 3 years ($66K - $1530 worth of AP credits) - and then you graduate, earning money instead of spending a 4th year at School B. Assuming you get a $40K/year job, ***that's a $62K swing because of your AP credits*** - almost paying for the $64,470 cost of going to school for the first 3 years.

Now, 32 credits is a very rare case, but even at lower levels the monetary value of AP credits is quite large. Be sure to use it to your advantage when you can."
c9ilqd,5,2019-07-05,Just got my first IT interview,Jihyo_Park,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/c9ilqd/just_got_my_first_it_interview/,"I just got my interview I believe everything went well. i dressed up properly, eye contact, firm shake hands, and able to answer some of the technical questions. Tho I answered one wrong where he asked me “how do i know whether a device is connected to network” and I answered back using a software tool called ip scanner or netstat and the simple answer was ping command lol. There will be another group/candidates on next week for interview and then HR said they’re going to wrap things up and select top 2 candidates.

And i do think im weakest candidates so far since i only have 4 months of internship and 3 years in the kitchen as line cook and no experience in customer service.

Out of 7 applications there’s only one called me and invited me for an interview.

For the last year or so, I've been immersing myself in C# related technologies such as Windows app development, some ASP.NET as well as Unity and OO Programming concepts in general.

I think Im getting pretty good at it and would eventually love to get a job actually doing it exclusively.  Unfortunately I have no idea how to actually BE a professional programmer.  I dont really know how to work with others on a single project, and frankly I have no idea how that even works.

Assuming I know enough to actually program on my own, How do I go about actually learning how to program professionally?  I feel like I need to be an intern or shadow a real programmer for a few weeks or months to get a feel for it."
c9j1ys,4,2019-07-05,I really need some advice and motivation for my situation,Anonymous-f,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c9j1ys/i_really_need_some_advice_and_motivation_for_my/,"Hello everyone, I always heard how bad the new graduate struggles were in regards to finding a new entry-level job. I just never thought I would face a similar situation.

So a bit of a background, I've just graduated with a degree in Economics and Stats. In my university years, I've done 2 summer internships, one as a sales role at a startup, and another as a research assistant with a professor, where I analyzed and helped in researching some papers. Ive also worked part time in retail clothing.

 Naturally, upon graduating, I looked at data/business analyst roles. But since most of my experience has been in sales, I figured I would never be qualified. And Ive heard one needs a masters in something quantitative to be considered. I still applied for a few places here and there but no luck...

Anyway, I went the sales/account manager route. Believing my experience would help me. Now since 2 months after graduating ive applied to at least 100+ places, mainly using LinkedIn and my University's Career Board, using resumes and tailpred cover letters for each and I've probably heard back from around 15-20 places. These have been mostly phone interviews with a standard set of questions, and 4 in person interviews... 2 of  these making it to the final round. Now I believe its probably my interview skills since I notice my resume does get looked at... but somethings topping me after that. I've even rehearsed most of the interview questions they've asked and also practiced interviews.

However, after my last job rejection yesterday, after I thought I was in after directly interviewing with the CEO of a startup, I am now actually depressed and not wantimg to continue applying. 

I am also confused about my own career path. Obviously I should focus on data analyst roles because that is where my passion lies... (I've also learnt some Phyton, R, Excel Skills) but I believe I won't get those roles due to lack of experience in analysis. I've mostly been focusing on sales with 80% of my applications in sales.

Then theres also finance, I've taken finance courses in school and also gave the CFA level 1 this month just to see where I stand, but obviously with no relevant experience I don't think I stand a chance.

(I obviously change resumes between different fields)

If you guys could offer any advice or even would like me to share my resume so that you could guide me better, please let me know.

Thanks!"

c9lowd,8,2019-07-05,How do high school students get interest-related internships?,ForsakenPhase1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c9lowd/how_do_high_school_students_get_interestrelated/,"For context, I'm in the Tampa area and am interested in computer science.

I've done APCSA and am the lead programmer on an FTC team that qualified for Worlds and has been a finalist at our state championship for programming-based awards (although to be honest, these awards are heavily based on marketing to judges).  I've also done Python for a few years, although none of it is overly complicated or professional.

I had viewed this as a mere hobby for a long time and remained intent on going into medicine because those jobs are morally rewarding and, from my understanding, have a more guaranteed high income.  But over the past couple of years as I've programmed for my FTC team, I sort of started to realize that I enjoyed that a lot more than anything in the medical field.  A couple years ago, I discovered HackTheBox and literally could not focus on anything else for months and then started to really enjoy CodeForces challenges, and considering all of these factors, plus the fact that math has always been my strongest area, that I began to feel like I would regret choosing any other field.  

Recently, I've been looking into hopefully going to some of the top public CS universities that don't charge as much money as comparable private institutions but still provide a great CS education.  The issue with many of these is that they're very specialized, and if you're not interested in engineering, it's hard to justify that tuition.

So I figure one way to actually assess how much I would enjoy a CS-related career is to find some sort of internship opportunity before I try to commit to a school like that (and I'm in IB and need CAS, so perhaps this would be a way to get CAS hours through a genuinely interesting activity).  I know I've seen a lot of people on this subreddit with those types of internships, and I've seen job offers for them in San Francisco, but obviously not everyone interested in CS is from there, yet I've seen quite a few people that manage to get those types of things.

**Now that I've given you my annoying, long, and mostly irrelevant story, my question is, how would I go about getting a CS internship when the opportunities in my area seem surprisingly limited?**  Is this one of those things where you just have to have connections (I don't) or be lucky with where you live, or are there opportunities I'm missing that could help me to prove to myself that I'm not making a mistake by essentially fully committing to a CS major?

All help is appreciated."

I was brought up in a family where all I could do was “get over it” and “just keep it in”.

When I was little I moved to another country at an age where you start to make friends, but I couldn’t speak the langage of the new country. My issues got worse as I was socially awkward and didn’t make friends. At all.

Moved back to home country and parenting got worse, I ran away from home one time. Things didn’t improve. Less yelling but the problems were still there.

I was lucky enough to study engineering, I did so for the problem solving and critical thinking side of it, thinking it would help me get my shit together you know?

Fast forward to today. The situation at home got bad but I landed an internship that allowed me to be financially independent. However I still have no friends and can’t seem to be able to bond with anyone. I found out I had aphantasia not too long ago. I’m starting to hate people a lot more. I’m 193cm tall and 115 kilos (overweight). I’m starting to not be able to shut up about stuff and keep it to myself. I get excessively worked up over video games which had been my only way out of life for as long as I can remember. I almost made a hole in my wall. I’m starting to get violent, which scares the sht out of me and makes me want to see people even less. I’m scared I might do something to someone else. I am terrified of myself and I don’t know if I can continue. Studying engineering hasn’t done shit for me.

I’m scared I might hurt other people because of how much I have in me. I have already broken a thing or two.

c9muub,0,2019-07-05,I want to quit my internship to self study what I'm getting a master's degree in,TheModdedAngel,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c9muub/i_want_to_quit_my_internship_to_self_study_what/,"I'm entering senior year in college majoring in Computer Engineering. I got accepted into an accelerated master's program where I can get a master's degree in 1 year instead of 2 in specialization in software engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

In the middle of May I got an internship at an IT company. Bear in mind, software engineering and IT are NOT the same thing. I semi tried to get the position and did not really want the position, because I wanted to self teach and practice programming for the summer. I got the position for $10/hr and literally the company has never had an intern before and they don't know what to do with me. I told them I know nothing about IT and I know software engineering stuff and they still hired me. Anyway, when I say they don't know what to do with me. I literally mean it. I don't have a person who is directly in charge of me, they never told me specifically what hours/days to work I just show up 5 days a week 9-4. Most days I ""shadow an IT representative"". Which is just me sitting next him as he takes calls and does stuff on the computer. He shows me what he's doing sometimes. But I don't tend to learn from it, because I never apply that knowledge to do any work. I'm required to document my time and I'm told that even if I just sit there I need to mark that down, and that fills the majority of my time sheets. The company is aware that I'm not doing anything, yet they don't do anything about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the problem? I get paid to do nothing, that's great! It is, but I have a nerdy passion for programming and when I'm sitting at work, I feel like I'm wasting my life on something that doesn't pertain to what I'd like to do in life. Oh yeah, I applied for the internship at all just to have something on my resume and to learn what a work environment was like. I've interned for a month and a half with another month left, and I feel like I've experienced enough to call working there a ""learning experience"" and to have it on my resume. I feel like my time sitting there doing nothing at work, could be way more productive and helpful in the long run learning and designing programs. I.e what I'm studying to get a master's degree in.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to say this without sounding privileged, but I can live and pay for college without the internship money and I just feel like learning the field that I want to work in is more valuable than sitting an office in a field I don't care about, not learning anything from, and being paid $10/hr. I'd rather work at some other job, completely unrelated to computers, if it meant I would actually be doing work. Another factor is I want to self study before school starts so I actually have time to so. A month and a half of dedicated programming study can go a long way.

I am a CS senior who will soon graduate at the end of Q3 this year, but a serious personal stuff came up, messed up my plan completely.

I was plan on getting a job in another state, instead of the state where my school is located (UT), and a personal thing came up recently which I would have to stay at UT after graduation for three months to get it sort out.

I do need to make some money to stay in UT, the last option is slipping burgers which highly against. An internship is the ideal option in my case.

By the time of graduation, I would have finished three internships, 1 Java QA internship, 2 Python internships. I am aiming for Java developer role, and I don’t think the experience I gained from all my internship is not enough for me to get a Java dev job. Since I have to to stay at the same state, should I get another Java internship to gain more experience? Is it weird to do internship after graduation?

I personally don't want to stay at UT, but this thing is REALLY important, I could postpone if I have to. However, the later I get it sort out, the messier my life would be.

What should I do? Has anyone experienced similar situation before?

Any input and advise would be greatly appreciated.

I’m an incoming freshman and I’m taking Calc 2 at my local community college. This summer I also applied for this explore program at a Big 4 tech company which I registered for unaware that my first test for my calc class is on the same day (he gave the syllabus on the first day of class and I was accepted into this program 2 weeks prior) Although I would be missing class, I found out that I would only be withdrawn from the course if I missed 3 classes. Since this is a really important opportunity for my future career in computer science (rumor has it that people who go to this have a better chance of getting future internships) I decided that it would be worth sacrificing one class. But the syllabus states that if you are absent on the day of test (worth 15% of your final grade) you get a 0. 

I spoke to my teacher twice and he wouldn’t allow me to take the test before or after the event. I also spoke to the dean of students and the student advocate both of whom reaffirmed that my only option would be to withdraw from the class. This is not an option for me because my parents spent $700 on this course and there is no guarantee on getting the money back. I also can’t transfer to another section because they are either filled or interfere with other activities. 

I have never been in this situation before and both the class and this explore program are equally important to my college career. What do I do?

I am an intern at a company that works with .NET. I've brief experience with programming, I started October 2017. I decided to focus on [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC 5 however I've been struggling with developing a decent app with it. Now I've been tasked with researching and learning [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core for the purpose of redoing an existing project in .net core. I have nobody to consult with because everyone else is working on projects with older tech like Web/Win forms. I feel huge responsibility, as they're relying on me to kind of guide them, while at the same time I'm not sure of myself and whether what I report to them would result to an enthusiastic project revamp and ultimately a bust. Don't get me wrong, I'm really happy I focus on a new technology instead of the deprecated ones. But it's been a month and every day I spend my time reading pages after pages of documentation and most times I don't understand what I'm reading. As soon as I start researching what I didn't understand I start off another voyage of not knowing and understanding code documentation that I read. It's a vicious cycle of layers of research that can last for hours and days and most times I give up and go back to the first layer and just skip the part I don't understand because it seems hopeless and I get frustrated.

I was hoping I could ask for some amount of advice or criticism as to what you think I'm doing wrong in my job search.  I graduated late last year during the summer semester with an IT related degree from a Business college in the area.  During my time there I worked on multiple projects, an IT internship, and earned all three of the TestOut certificates which were available in the curriculum, that being PC Pro, Network Pro, and Security Pro, all of which were separate independent study projects.  I've listed all of the aforementioned educational experiences on my resume.  Additionally, after the first few months after graduation, I took a temporary position which lasted for two months.  Alongside my internship and work experience I've listed my academic awards, those being the certification I've earned, a perfect attendance award, and my membership to the Phi Theta Kappa Honors society.  

&amp;#x200B;

On the advice of a professor I've written a cover letter template in my own words, and a template for asking for feedback and criticism following any interviews.  That said, after applying to positions daily for a nearly a year now, I'm finding that it is more and more difficult to find positions, not only on LinkedIn, but also Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, and Monster, and I have only had a handful of interviews out of all my applications, all of which I've been rejected for, and from which I have received no feedback from the interviewers as to my interviewing performance.  I have completely rewritten my resume multiple times on the advice of a free resume critiquing service, and reached out to multiple sets of recruiting agencies, all of which eventually stopped responding to e-mails and attempts to contact them.

&amp;#x200B;

On the advice of a friend I have also started attempting to add more connections on LinkedIn, despite being highly introverted, and have accumulated over 100 connections.  That said, I'm not entirely sure I understand the meaning behind gathering so many connections, nor how to 'leverage' them, as distasteful as that notion sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm sure you can understand, this is very distressing to me.  If anyone could please advise me as to any issues or flaws they perceive in my job search, it would be highly appreciated.  If you require any additional details, I can provide them in an edit, provided of course that they are not personally identifiable.

My question is, would it be more beneficial for me to do a code boot camp to boost my understanding of the areas that I'm not as experienced in or is an internship a better option? I currently have a part-time job doing software dev with a small business so I would hate to give that position up because I love it so much but I would be willing to if the internship is the right choice."

I underestimated how difficult college would be compared to high school and payed the price for it. My motivation has dropped like a rock since my first quarter here, and I unfortunately wasn't able to move my GPA much since my 1st year here (3.25, Chem major). So now I have less room to compensate for my mistakes.

I constantly regret not majoring in something that's marketable at the bachelors degree level now (can't switch to any engineering majors now that I'm a junior). I've read a lot about grad school prestige and it really seems to be the make or break in people's careers for Chemistry, be it in academia or industry. Like, even if I do a complete 180 and perform amazingly in a PhD program, it won't matter at all because my poor undergrad grades led me into a low ranking grad school. This is literally going to sting for the rest of my life. I wish I could put myself in a position where grades weren't this important to my future, where practical experience and independent projects held more weight to how people would judge me. I did well in classes in the past, but I almost always hated them. I don't know why I expected college to be better in that aspect.

I'm minoring in computer science now in order to salvage at least some marketability with my degree, but my opportunities for career advancement will be harshly limited unless I do a Masters in CS. Some programs seem feasible for me to get into out of college, but I'd honestly prefer to get a software engineering internship and work for a company first so I can get away from school and finally get the peace of mind that my work has payed off. 

That's probably the biggest problem. I feel like nothing I've done since high school is going to pay off, making all my efforts since then a complete waste. It's terrifying to think about and it just makes me feel like my entire academic career has been dictated by fear and threats.

EDIT: Wanted to express my thanks for all the authentic, level-headed advice I've been getting so far. I've been having these thoughts for a painfully long time but I've only recently gained the ability to communicate them clearly.

EDIT 2: My GPA is actually a 3.25, sorry, I just rounded up to avoid being identified but I realized that it was a stupid thing to worry about :/"

I am  in the bay area and I am mostly applying through LinkedIn and after a week I go in to the office or call for an update on my application. I am targeting junior/entry level front end and full stack positions, but at this point I am also applying to internships. A lot of these positions require a bachelors (even some of the internships!) but I believe I have equivalent experience (2 years academic, 2+ years professional experience). Either way, I could really use some advice on what I am doing wrong or what I can do to improve my chances. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, here is my cover letter:

&gt;Hello, COMPANY!  
&gt;  
&gt;I can offer you four years of experience building complex web applications using ReactJS/Redux and Node/Express/GraphQL including API integration, an intrinsic drive to learn and improve myself and my tech stack (postgres, ruby on rails), a keen eye for detail, and a can do attitude. All of which makes me an ideal candidate for this position.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately if I had to choose three words to describe myself I would choose tenacious, resourceful, and eager to learn. For example, when I was nineteen I moved out from my parents and into my own studio. There were a few break ins in my neighborhood and I worried about my computer being stolen. To solve this, I built a home security system using a mouse duct taped to the door frame. I wrote a program using python that sent me text messages on mouse movements. This meant that whenever the door opened a mouse movement would occur and I’d receive a text message. This brought me great peace of mind while I was working away from home.  
&gt;  
&gt;I urge you to check out my portfolio! Feel free to contact me via phone or email at any time. I am excited to hear from you.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am proud of what I have accomplished and I look forward to what I can achieve at COMPANY.

After the first email, I took his answer as a kiss of death and sent the second one just to try to close the loop officially but now I’m somehow intrigued by the situation.

I’ve researched this online and found being out of state can hurt you. Especially for entry level jobs, there’s no shortages of college grads looking for jobs. For more experienced positions, good workers are harder to find and more valuable. The company would be more likely to strongly consider out of state talent when they need someone good for an important position, that’s also hard to find good candidates for.

As a new grad, it could be a huge risk trying to start their career with an out of state job  in a smaller market.

From what I’ve heard, it’s fairly difficult to change engineering majors once admitted to the college through the program. This worries me. My strengths lie in the STEM field, and Engineering seems like the kind of career that would fit me. Yet asides from some very-beginning tinkering with electronics, I have very little experience to define what “Electrical Engineering” or General “Engineering” really entails. I believe that the strongest opportunities I have for information gathering lie directly in the field - in internships, co-ops, or job shadowing, and since my skill and class set does not leave me as much of an asset to internships or co-ops at the moment, my biggest opportunity is in Job shadowing.

Right now, I’m looking for Engineering shadowing opportunities, but I’m a bit confused as to how to get to these opportunities:
————
I’ve made a list of questions to ask any potential shadow, and I’ve compiled a list of nearby Engineering firms and manufacturing/Electrical companies. But now I’m a bit at a loss about how to contact them, and I still have a few questions:

1. [Contact] Who do I email or call? Is it okay to call the company say from the phone number listed on Google Maps? Should I search within their company website for a Human Resources department? If I can’t find a department like that, who would I contact then?

2. [Expectation] I imagine Engineers to be fairly busy with their own responsibilities and projects to undertake job shadows which may interfere with their work. Should I expect many to not respond or decline a job shadow?

3. [Rejection] If someone is kind enough to communicate their rejection for a shadow, would it be alright for me to suggest a lunch or phone interview or would that be seen as rude and inconsiderate?

4. [General Advice/Tips] Do you have any general advice or tips that would help me in either getting a job shadow or getting more information about Engineering careers/opportunities, getting more experience with Engineering, etc.?

Thanks for reading and thanks for any potential responses out there. I’ll keep looking for answers to these questions in the mean time!"

So I quit my job this June (on the 30th), in order to focus on my internship. While I had a job I had less time going out especially with uni, but truth be told, I was also making up excuses to not go, due to my social anxiety.

However, I vowed that once I quit my job and beyond, I will start going out and checking out new places. And this won't stop even after I get my new one. 

So far, I actually managed to keep my promise!

The concept of going out solo was really daunting to me, but I decided to say WHAT THE HELL and go out anyway. I took part at two stand-up comedies in different locations since I quit my job. Today I attended a Korean language course that was offered for free and met my new colleagues with barely any fear. Couldn't have said that if it was even one year ago. The fact that the place is really close also helps.

Next week I'm going out to a local rock concert, it's on Saturday. And considering going to a philosophy course on Wednesday... to meet even more people.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I think I've figured out the main reason why I can't make friends and have a great social/romantic life... I'm boring as all hell. My past comes out once again to rear its ugly head. All I can talk about is computers, smartphones, video games, soccer, politics and history. That's not enough in my opinion, and this is what I've started working on. I really need to improve on the ""fun"" aspect. 

But I feel I need some advice. I still can't ""be bothered"" (aka: I'm afraid) to approach new people at events like the stand-ups I mentioned above. It's like this, I can keep a conversation for 5-10 minutes but after that I can't find any new topic, would just start with some small talk, ask them a little about themselves, share a bit about myself... and then nothing.

This concept is daunting, so I immediately assume that's how all conversations will go and prevent myself from going to these people. Ironically this didn't happen today when I went to that course. For some reason I happen to be more confident in quiet places but it completely fades away at leisure, ""fun"" events.

And there's also the fear of rejection, but I'll get to that when I make later posts here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... what can I do?"

I decided to get an associates in business from my community college, and I'm currently transferring to a university for Pre Economics and Accounting.

My ultimate goal was to get an internship at a Big 4 accounting firm, and work there for a few years then transfer to a private accounting firm. Keep in mind, when one starts off in a Big 4 accounting firm, they work around 60 - 70 hours per week for a $70,000 salary. They don't hit six figures until 4 - 5 years later. The work to life balance is shit and I'm not sure why I wanted to work there so bad.

During this summer, I've been doing research about programming for the fuck of it. I've been watching podcasts, reading books, and learning about all the projects I could make with python. I feel much more happy learning about programming now compared to two years ago when I felt like I couldn't learn anything related to it. I realized that I could combine my hobbies with programming and so many other things with it.

I currently signed my SIR to this university, and I can't change my major to CS because it's impacted, and I haven't finished the required classes for CS at community college to get into the major. I'm not really sure what to do. Should I just say fuck it and go back to community college and take those programming classes? Or should I go along with this Economics and Accounting major and learn programming on the side? It would probably take me a year, or maybe even two to finish those required courses at community college. Unfortunately, the university does not offer a CS minor.

Has anyone been in the same situation?"

&amp;#x200B;

So a little background.

I've just finished up my 2nd year of college as a biochemistry and molecular biology major, and I'm about to head into my 3rd year this fall. I only very recently (maybe 3 or 4 months ago) decided that I want go into the bioinformatics industry, so I've switched the concentration within my major to computational molecular biology. I'm getting started with those classes, but as of now I have a very minimal number of actual coding related classes under my belt. I quickly realized I have little time left to waste since I'm already halfway done with my undergrad degree, so I started to familiarize myself with the computer science side of things by taking a class over the summer (Into to C++, taking it right now), playing around with Rosalind, and registering for classes like discrete mathematics and data structures for this up coming school year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My main question for you all is:** what relevant experiences and classes should I focus on this upcoming year so I can build a standout resume for when application season rolls around? I want to land some kind of bioinformatics related position for the summer of 2020, but I've heard it's difficult for undegrads to land industry positions as one has to be both an expert biologist AND expert coder to be even remotely considered. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The things I have under my belt so far are:**

\- all the general science classes completed (chemistry, biology, physics)

\- organic chemistry sequence, genetics, integral and differential calculus, cellular and molecular biology classes completed

\- intro to computer science class in progress

\- 1 1/2 years of research experience in a biochemistry lab at my university, all wet lab research (have presented my work) 

&amp;#x200B;

**The things I plan on getting under my belt before I graduate:**

\- the rest of my biochem degree (all pure science classes)

\- additional classes included in my computational concentration area (this is where I could use some advice): Discrete Mathematics, introduction to CompSci II, Data Structures, Applied Bioinformatics, Networks in Computational Biology, maybe an algorithms class??

\- possibly a CS Minor, which would require only these three extra classes: Computer Architecture and Assembly Language, Software Engineering 1, and Operating Systems. (not really sure if it is worth it though, are these classes relevant for a bioinformatician?)

\- research experience in a computational biology lab, or maybe a CS lab to contrast my biochem research experience?

&amp;#x200B;

My GPA right now isn't all the great either. I'm at a 3.17 right now but I'm hoping to bring it up to a 3.3 by the end of winter term. Also besides research experience, I haven't been formally employed in any any industry jobs related to biotech or bioinfo so I""m feeling very doubtful and fearful for my future in this path :( 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

**as a incoming 3rd year undergrad, I am asking for advice on useful classes to take, relevant research labs to partake in, and resume builders to work on(side programming projects, etc.) to set myself up nicely for an internship in the bioinfo industry.**

- Is it as worth as it looks in terms of salary? (the medium entry level salary for this of work in my country is between 13k and 17k /year after taxes)

Long story short, the eng manager in one of the FANG liked me and referred me internally for an internship.

Except that I am not super prepared for the coding interview.

I really appreciate this opportunity and I want to make the most out of this. So my question is, is it ok for me to ask for a gap of 'n' number of weeks between the phone screen by Recruiter to the actual coding interview? Or would it come off as unreasonable request?

Can I also know what's the acceptable gap? Thank you."

I am hoping that some people in this community can provide me with some insight.

I will be a sophomore computer science student in the fall looking to apply to the NSA for an internship. Earlier this summer I received an underage drinking citation. In the coming months, it should be dismissed and expunged from my record.  It was a stupid mistake and does not reflect the person I am. I rarely drink and I only did so in this instance because it was a social event. I was not intoxicated and completely cooperated with the officers. I was wondering if my application will be immediately thrown out when I apply in the fall. I will obviously be completely honest about it, I just hope that I am not screened out because of this. 

If anyone has experience with this sort of thing then feel free to let me know. I'm upset that it happened and hope it doesn't prevent me from an opportunity with the NSA in the coming year."

I say ""possible"" because I haven't fully decided if I want to go to UCLA. I'm also considering University of Toronto (U of T), which is the top research university in Canada, appears in the top 20 world-wide uni's in half of the popular rankings for engineering, 50K+ students, etc...

  
The program I got accepted into at U of T is Engineering Science, which is 2 years of general physics, math, engineering, and 2 specialization years into ECE. The courses are very similar, the only difference being that U of T offers a more ""academically rigorous curriculum."" 

 

&gt;The Engineering Science program is designed and delivered at a level that is more academically demanding;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Engineering Science program contains more mathematics, science and engineering science, with greater focus on deriving results using a first principles approach;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Engineering Science program has a distinct “2+2” curriculum structure, namely a 2-year foundation curriculum followed by a 2-year specialization curriculum in a diverse range of fields, many of which are unique to the Engineering Science program; and  
&gt;  
&gt;The Engineering Science program requires that all students complete an independent research-based thesis project.  
&gt;  
&gt;\--[U of T Engineering Academic Calendar](https://portal.engineering.utoronto.ca/sites/calendars/current/Engineering_Programs.html#Program9)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I also got accepted into UCLA's EE Fast Track program, which guarantees me paid summer internships with faculty and industry for my 3 undergraduate summers, provided I meet academic requirements.

On the other hand, I got  a feeling that the Fast Track program is simply pumping out very ""engineering-focused"" engineers, without much insight into the sciences (that is, into soldering and coding monkeys, for an exaggeration).   

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my questions:

* How academically rigorous are UCLA math courses? How deep do the professors teach the subject?
* How ""dumb"" or ""smart"" are your homework problems? Are the TA's intelligent and bright? 
* How difficult are introductory physics courses (PHYS 1A-C)  and upper-level courses? How do they compare with AP Physics C?

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you are in Fast Track, or have recently graduated from UCLA EE:

* What type of people / engineers / scientists does this program graduate? What does this program make out of the person?
* What do people make out of this program? How significantly have the extracurricular interests shaped your current job / future career / life?
* Do you think a (20-40%) more academic or a (40%-60%) more application-based education would have benefited you more in your career?

&amp;#x200B;

ca4mob,1,2019-07-07,I like my job but the environment is too stressful. I want to leave but I don't know what is the best choice for my career.,maninthejungle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ca4mob/i_like_my_job_but_the_environment_is_too/,"Hello everyone,

I would like to receive some advice to try to better choose my future career, I will try to be as concise as possible to give you a general idea of what is going on in my head.

I am an Electronic Engineer, I studied for most of my life in Italy and I served an internship to produce my thesis in France, touching on multiples topics ranging from electronics to microwaves and photonics; one of the reasons was that I never had a clear idea of what I really liked and on the other hand I am a particularly curious person and I am fascinated by technology and physics.

Since a year and a half, I have been involved in software development for embedded systems in a medium-size company that works in military and Aerospace environment. I'm mainly programming the operating system that will be used in a couple of satellites, from drivers to application layer. I'm really intrigued by this work, I have the possibility to learn and use C for the implementation, Python for scripting as well as the development and study of machine learning and algorithms that will be ported in the final satellite. 
In this way I can also stay in close contact with hardware and instrumentation for debugging and testing - I love touching hardware, at least I have something I can knock on the floor when nothing works!
Unfortunately, although the field is exciting, there are several downsides to the company. 

I work in Italy and have only one year of experience as an embedded software engineer, here receiving 27k per year is considered above average, but you know better than me that if this salary is compared with the rest of Europe, I do a lot better.
Moreover, a huge problem related to this company is the constant impression of being always in emergency: since I entered there is always a deadline that we have failed and, in trying to recover, we delay other projects. Is a company in actual emergency if it is always in emergency? To me it looks more like a management problem and lack of people. ""Our employees have flexible working hours"", a nice motto and excuse not to pay for the extra hours of work we do every day (I am talking of shifts that can last more than 10 hours). 

Although I am a person who can handle stress well and I know I don’t owe the job anything, this situation of continuous effort combined with other external factors led me to have health problems a few months ago - and geez I’m 26! I'm trying to solve my health issue slowly and I've started to work again after less than one month after my problems, but I do realize that no matter how much I like a job I can't risk again. 
At work everyone was so sorry for what happened to me, but I was really annoyed by the HR’s answer when I made her notice the level of stress that employees undergo daily. She said: ""This way you can learn better, isn’t it?"".
So, I realized that I must take what has been good of this experience, pack up and leave.

The problem is, where to go now?
My research is now limited to Europe given the difficulty (unfortunately) of being sponsored by American companies, in cities that are alive and cultural, because I finally realized that we are not machines born to work, and I love cities of art with many activities available.
I would like to improve my English, having already solid French in addition to my mother tongue, but this shouldn't be a problem, I'm also fine with speaking English inside the company and the local language outside if possible.

Full of hopes, I've been looking for weeks of small-medium companies in various sectors, from robotics to space industry, passing through physics, biotechnology, machine learning etc., but I have faced the difficulty of not really finding something that satisfies me.

I am convinced that this is not due to the shortage of European cool companies, but to the lack of a database or a website that is designed to find start-ups, research centers or companies and to be able to look for them in the cities with the greatest cultural interest, which are not villages of 1000 inhabitants - to make myself clear.

I hope you've got an idea of my situation and, as far as possible, of my personality. I would like to know what you think of my experience and what possibilities there are in Europe in the field, I would really appreciate some advice. 

Thank you!"
ca4tpf,2,2019-07-07,Reverse Chance Me. Safeties &amp; Matches. Computer Science. I live in Japan,reyenreyen,ReverseChanceMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseChanceMe/comments/ca4tpf/reverse_chance_me_safeties_matches_computer/,"**What safety/ matches/reaches could you recommend me?**

I would be interested in a co-ed medium/large schools.

I would definitely prefer urban/suburban....small town if its really worth it, but definitely not rural. I live in a city's suburbs, so thats why I  prefer urban OR suburban for the most part.

I don't care about party life / greek life / frats. if it has it: O.K whatever... if it doesn't have it: O.K whatever

I definitely value safe campuses and surrounding area to be safe (in the day time of course because nowhere is obviously safe at night).

The thing is I like tech and I like CS and if I'm going to major in CS I want to have diverse and many CS class options to go further than just 'How to program in C++' such as AI, VR, Machine Learning, etc which is why big or medium universities are better off for me just because they're bigger in size.

Medium/ Big universities also let me pivot easier (I think, maybe not) let's say I want to go from Tech to Finance/Business major/school I should go to a uni where i can do that.

Just for the record, I'm not a super math/sciency guy (but obviously since i have taken math and physics HL I have 'capabilities') and thus I'm also the kind of person that enjoys learning social science and soft skills, etc so I value being able to take classes in things other than CS/science once in a while such as social science, business, etc.

I also highly highly value getting internships, jobs, etc from top tech/finance companies and so those opportunities are important to me. Job experiences are important for me, also I don't think I find doing research jobs/work super interesting.

I'm open to a small school **IF you can prove it will give a good quality CS program with good diverse CS classes and manageable facilities**... obviously I realize at my current SAT score (see below) i'm not so competitive against other CS major people and I'm guessing at smaller really technical focused universities I will be even less competitive? Or maybe my international status helps, idk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethnicity**: Asian, INTERNATIONAL (Japan)Gender: Male

**Income Bracket**: 250k+ --&gt; Thus I can pay upfront for college. i anyways probably wont qualify for financial aid

Both my parents basically went to community college

**Country**: Japan. Lived here my whole life, but I'm not Japanese.

**High School**: International IB Private School (Osaka)

**Intended Major**: Computer Science

**W GPA**: 3.9.

I had a bad sophomore year, but rebounded very well in Junior year with 4.2 GPA.

I don't do any electives or take BS 'free A' classes and only take IB classes, so i don't have much fluff nowadays in my grades except for the weighting of IB classes.

No Class Rank at my schoolCourse

**Rigor**: Taking 3 HLs (Math, Physics, Econ). 3 SLs (Business Management, English, French). Predicted Grades are Math (5.. yes I will try to improve to a 6). Physics (7). Econ (7). English (6). French (5). Business Management (7). TOK will probably get a (2) since thats the average for IB students.     Note: predicted 7 is the highest and hardest to get for the subject. Mine all adds up to a 40 if my math improves from 5 to 6 which is good... I took rigorous classes like math and physics HL otherwise i could have gone full on liberal arts (easy classes for me) and just get a 45/45 IB score, but I took the harder route with more rigor especially since I'm doing CS and going for 40/45 which is still really good for IB I heard.

**SAT**: 1400 (680 EBRW and 720 Math. Retaking soon hope I can get like much much higher especially for math!!).. This is my low point for sure when competing against others in CS. I will be retaking my last test soon.

**Extra Curriculars:**

FIRST Robotics Team Founder, President, and Captain: I've put literally thousands of hours into building the framework of this club and also of course building my own robot. I've worked to make the club really prestigious at our school and not just be recognized as another 'club' to the point where we compete Nationally. I've pushed forward with more programming and robotics at my school since it didn't used to be so focused on that. So I've really put this Robotics thing as part of my story. Honestly I did kind of have to run it like a business with sponsorships, diplomacy, leadership so I don't think I should regret that I didn't instead start a business for EC and experience.

Varsity Boxing. Was on team for 3 years. Put hundreds of hours (awards below)

Junior Academy: Was accepted to &amp; current member of the New York Academy of Stem Sciences’ Junior Academy Program  (10% Acceptance Rate). It is an internationally recognized academy. I have competed in the Big Data Challenge, Wildfire, and Natural Disasters Challenge sponsored by companies such ARM Technologies, Tencent, etc. I have done research with other scientists from around the world and been mentored by scientists. I have also published research and assembled deliverables to be judged. Was invited (and attended) to New York City to the Annual NYASS Conference to showcase my solutions (2018)

History Bowl Team Captain

Vice President of the Amnesty International Chapter

I know multiple programming languages well: C++, Python, HTML, CSS. Working knowledge of LAMP Stack, JSON, Swift. I've worked on projects for my school like a swift app for my school website for a teacher, etc

Trying to get an internship at a Blockchain-Ethereum startup this summer. Idk how helpful is that?

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards:**

Varsity Boxing 2nd place (x2) and 3rd place (x1) in many national tournaments

FIRST Robotics: 1st year got 5th. 2nd year got 4th place at FIRST Robotics Nationals in Japan. Hoping to qualify for internationals when I compete again.

Junior Academy. Was recognized by EARCOS for my work and got an award (I wasn't ever a finalist for the competiton challenges though)

History Bowl: highest points scored in my school, MVP Award

Multiple Academic Distinguishments in Economics, CS Elective, Business Management,

**Rec Letters:** I've asked two really good teachers to write them, but right now they are not written as its summer for me. Obviously i'll see how this goes as there's a difference between good and excellent

**Essays:** Hopefully pretty good. I'm doing something unique and interesting and close to my personality.

**Hooks**: the FIRST Robotics EC 'story' + Junior Academy due to selectivity and prestige + Living in Japan my entire life, but being a foreigner +  I know those aren't like really huge hooks?"

But I chose machine learning position in the end because they seemed like really nice people and were paying well.

**tl;dr:** I'm a 26 y/o CA IPCC and B.Com graduate with 3 years of Articleship (internship), 1 year of Indirect Tax experience in the Big 4 and 1 year in Accounting. I'm currently in a dead-end Accounting job in a Fortune 500 company and desperately want to pivot to another role. Having not cleared CA Final and not having experience in anything truly related to corporate finance, how can I correct my career path and build my life back? I'm desperate and any advice would be incredibly helpful.

**Background:**

I apologize if this is yet another monotonous post here. But I truly am in desperate need of advice at this juncture of my life having been utterly depressed due to the outcomes of my mistakes over the past 5 years.

To give a brief background about myself, I was always a good student ever since I was a kid. I almost always got 85-90% in CBSE throughout my schooling. Inspite of being in the science stream until my 12th, I chose to pursue Chartered Accountancy and cleared the first two steps (CPT and IPCC) with flying colours in the first attempt. I then started doing my Articleship (internship), 3 years of which is mandated in the CA course, in one of the most reputed firms in my city, And this is the point of time where my career's downfall has started due to my utter negligence, recklessness and laziness.

I was considered to be one of the brightest in the lot in the firm and assigned to the biggest of the clients. Usually, the first year of the three year articleship usually consists of pretty simple work. The other two years are where a person truly learns about the nuances of Auditing. Coming back to my story, around the time of completion of my first year, due to some differences with my Manager, which in hindsight seem to be very petty, I put down my papers. Out of sheer desperation, I joined a firm which was just set up. Only after I joined did I realize that there were hardly any assignments there. No stat audit, no internal audit, no tax audit, nothing. Just a few certifications here and there. Having just quit a firm, I coudn't quit here too due to the stringent regulations by ICAI, the regulatory body for CA's. So I spent the rest of the 2 years completing my Articleship having learnt pretty much nothing work-wise.

Then came the time for my CA Final Exams. I still do not know what happened to me but I just coudn't study. I was at Home for 6 months to prepare. But literally studied for only a handful of weeks. It's not that I didn't try. For the entire 6 months, I was stuck in my house in front of the books from morning to night. But I could just not read for longer than 30 minutes. This obviously resulted in me flunking the Exams. I tried to study for 6 more months and write again. The same exact story repeated all over again.

This is when my boss from my Articleship firm called me and offered me a job in the Big-4 company that he just joined as a Director. However the role was purely into Indirect Taxation. During the period that I worked there, I did really well work-wise. But the 2 attempts for CA Final that I gave during that period were also doomed as I hardly got any time to Study. So I worked there for exactly an year and quit to focus on my studies and clear CA.

This time I thought that I would not repeat my earlier mistakes. So I enrolled in a library and went there religiously for one more year and attempted the Exams two more times. Nada. I just couldn't study yet again. It is not that my mental capabilities degraded. I tried studying for a few other courses in the interim for a week or so to see if that would interest me. and they did. I could properly study them and ace the tests. But when I sat in front of my CA books again, my mind tried everything possible to divert me from that.

Having been jobless for over an year now and not clearing CA too, I became extremely depressed and lost all hopes on myself. My self-confidence was at it's lowest and there was hardly a smile on my face for a long time. I then started looking for jobs and got a role as a Financial Accountant in a different city in a Fortune 500 IT product based company which I accepted out of desperation. It has been 6 months since I joined and I am having no job satisfaction whatsoever.

This is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I do not want to be stuck in Accounting. It is just not for me. It is a routine operational role which can easily be automated in a year or so. But on the other hand, I still am not able to study for CA Final. It is just not happening. I turned 26 a few months ago and it is really worrying me. The worst part is that I don't know what else to do. There are so many thing in my head but I have no confidence left in me and do not know what to do. I could do CFA or CPA or do well in GMAT and do Masters abroad by taking a loan. But first of all, I want to work in a role that interests me and takes my career forward like FP&amp;A, corporate finance, valuation, M&amp;A, investment banking and transaction advisory. But i'm a 26 y/o with CA IPCC and B.Com as qualifications and 1 year experience in the Big 4 in Indirect Taxation and then 6 months and running in an accounting role now. Is there really a way for me to get into any of them?

I'm a currently a 4th year computer science student at a Canadian uni and my expected graduation date is in April 2020.  I also had two internships: one 4 month internship as a business analyst at a large company, and a 4 month web developer position at a small company. After some self reflection I believe that I enjoyed being a BA more since It requires more soft skills with little coding. 

Overall, my goal now is to become a business analyst, and I am confused on how to proceed towards that as my graduation nears. What are my chances of landing a BA position after I finish college?  Should I do some sort of certificate to get ahead, such as the ECBA?  My manager recommended it to me while I was on my BA internship, but I'm not sure if it's that worthwhile since its so expensive."
ca8dia,2,2019-07-07,Career Advice Needed - 26 y/o in a dead end accounting job having messed up my career over the past 5 years,finboy1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ca8dia/career_advice_needed_26_yo_in_a_dead_end/,"**tl;dr:** I'm a 26 y/o graduate with 3 years of internship in an audit firm, 1 year of Indirect Tax experience in the Big 4 and 1 year in Accounting. I'm currently in a dead-end Accounting job in a Fortune 500 company and desperately want to pivot to another role. Having not cleared Chartered Accountancy (the equivalent of CPA in India) and not having experience in anything truly related to corporate finance, how can I correct my career path and build my life back? I'm desperate and any advice would be incredibly helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

I apologize if this is yet another monotonous post here. But I truly am in desperate need of advice at this juncture of my life having been utterly depressed due to the outcomes of my mistakes over the past 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

To give a brief background about myself, I was always a good student ever since I was a kid. I almost always got 85-90% throughout my schooling. Inspite of being in the science stream during my schooling, I chose to pursue Chartered Accountancy (CPA equivalent in India) and cleared the first two steps (CPT and IPCC) with flying colours in the first attempt. I then started doing my Articleship (internship), 3 years of which is mandated in the CA course, in one of the most reputed firms in my city, And this is the point of time where my career's downfall has started due to my utter negligence, recklessness and laziness.

&amp;#x200B;

I was considered to be one of the brightest in the lot in the firm and assigned to the biggest of the clients. Usually, the first year of the three year internship usually consists of pretty simple work. The other two years are where a person truly learns about the nuances of Auditing. Coming back to my story, around the time of completion of my first year, due to some differences with my Manager, which in hindsight seem to be very petty, I put down my papers. Out of sheer desperation, I joined a firm which was just set up. Only after I joined did I realize that there were hardly any assignments there. No stat audit, no internal audit, no tax audit, nothing. Just a few certifications here and there. Having just quit a firm, I couldn't quit here too due to the stringent regulations by ICAI, the regulatory body for CA's. So I spent the rest of the 2 years completing my internship having learnt pretty much nothing work-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the time for my CA Final Exams. I still do not know what happened to me but I just couldn't study. I was at Home for 6 months to prepare. But literally studied for only a handful of weeks. It's not that I didn't try. For the entire 6 months, I was stuck in my house in front of the books from morning to night. But I could just not read for longer than 30 minutes. This obviously resulted in me flunking the Exams. I tried to study for 6 more months and write again. The same exact story repeated all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

This is when my boss from my internshipfirm called me and offered me a job in the Big-4 company that he just joined as a Director. However the role was purely into Indirect Taxation. During the period that I worked there, I did really well work-wise. But the 2 attempts for CA Final that I gave during that period were also doomed as I hardly got any time to Study. So I worked there for exactly an year and quit to focus on my studies and clear CA.

&amp;#x200B;

This time I thought that I would not repeat my earlier mistakes. So I enrolled in a library and went there religiously for one more year and attempted the Exams two more times. Nada. I just couldn't study yet again. It is not that my mental capabilities degraded. I tried studying for a few other courses in the interim for a week or so to see if that would interest me. and they did. I could properly study them and ace the tests. But when I sat in front of my CA books again, my mind tried everything possible to divert me from that.

&amp;#x200B;

Having been jobless for over an year now and not clearing CA too, I became extremely depressed and lost all hopes on myself. My self-confidence was at it's lowest and there was hardly a smile on my face for a long time. I then started looking for jobs and got a role as a Financial Accountant in a different city in a Fortune 500 IT product based company which I accepted out of desperation. It has been 6 months since I joined and I am having no job satisfaction whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I do not want to be stuck in Accounting. It is just not for me. It is a routine operational role which can easily be automated in a year or so. But on the other hand, I still am not able to study for CA Final. It is just not happening. I turned 26 a few months ago and it is really worrying me. The worst part is that I don't know what else to do. There are so many thing in my head but I have no confidence left in me and do not know what to do. I could do CFA or CPA or do well in GMAT and do Masters abroad by taking a loan. But first of all, I want to work in a role that interests me and takes my career forward like FP&amp;A, corporate finance, valuation, M&amp;A, investment banking and transaction advisory. But i'm a 26 y/o with CA IPCC and B.Com as qualifications and 1 year experience in the Big 4 in Indirect Taxation and then 6 months and running in an accounting role now. Is there really a way for me to get into any of them?

&amp;#x200B;

What is the ideal way forward for me? Can I really improve my life now? I have absolutely no clue and this is keeping me awake every night. Any advices or suggestions would mean a lot and be truly appreciated."

I switched majors from Chemical Engineering to Computer Science about a year ago and I am currently a year and a half from graduating. I haven't been coding since I was and didn't even get my first computer till I was 18 but when I got into coding I realized I really love it and want to do this all my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is recently I started looking for internships, mentorships, and jobs and I was hit with a wave of anxiety and depression so hard its really affecting me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every job requirement I see has 2 - 4 years of experience or a ton of other software, technologies, and etc you need to know that I wonder how as a new grad I will be able to even jump in the workforce.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I am just stupid and all developers out here have like 20 languages under their belt or if this is something that happens to others but I really need some advice to help me know what to start preparing for because right now I feel like this is too much for me."

Although I have a deep passion for these subjects, I realize that I don't necessarily want a career related to these fields (public service, politics, etc.).

For various reasons, I've been in love with computers and coding since high-school, and I dream about becoming a programmer as my career.

I have some fairly basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from going through some of the modules at [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org). I can make a website from scratch, upload it to a server via FTP, and I'm very proficient in messing around with the WordPress CMS despite not knowing how to code in PHP.

In about 6 months, I'll be applying for internships through my school's co-op program. In this short time-span, I'd like to put as much energy as I can into developing my skills so that I can be competitive in getting a programming-related internship. What would you kind Redditors suggest I focus on developing in this time?

I would love it if you could suggest books, codecamps/resources, or even what languages/frameworks you think are in demand that might help me in 6 months' time. Honestly, I'm pretty okay with any sort of coding internship, I just really want to experience the kind of environment that coders and programmers experience each day.

Thank you so, so much in advance!"

I wish I could have that kind of nap just one more time right now. Nowadays, I cant sleep till 3 or 4 in the morning and then I have to wake up at 6 to get ready for College.

I'm being honest. Anyway, let's talk about this story. 

So, as I said I'm a Brazilian and I have 25 yrs old, for that you must be thinking if I can really speak well english. I do think I can communicate well, I don't need to use any type of translator. I learned English all by myself. Thing is, I never decided what I should do with my life. I don't feel like I would like to be a teacher, nor do I feel like I would be happy helping people with education in general. Knowing that I tried to get a degree in Computer Science, and it was bad the first semesters I couldn't do well in any class. But I didn't give up, so I went to another year and then I started to get pretty good at programming. It was fun and all that, I didn't think in any internship during that moment though. Until I had to take care of someone else, someone important for me. So I step away a little from there. I think parents are more important than anything else, specially if It's someone who's alone atm. I take care of them, and love them. 

My biggest issue is the fact I have Social Anxiety and anything that people says to me I start to think bad about them, I don't take them as friendly as they actually think they're being. So, I started feel upset with my plans with Computer Science, and the fact I never got a job and never went to know about it makes me feel totally disinterested with IT. I tried to feel better, tried to think different but nope, I still remember the words of my college mates talking bad about IT and myself, making assumptions the most. I felt bullied but never went to confront them about it. 

I really tried to take their words as another reason for me to not give up. IT is hard and unfair imo, there's already people there making profit of things, and I feel like I won't accomplish the same. I really want to create things, help, and work together with people. It's just hard cause I feel like people will never understand me, and they will always think I don't care about them because of my social anxiety, so they will take advantage of my issue. 

I thought about other plans like acting. I love actors, and I feel like I could actually be myself there, then again my insecure screams and I can't decide. Life is unfair, and goes way too fast imo. I really want to continue going on with both ways. Because I believe that people shouldn't just be one thing, one job, one life. I think everyone deserves to have something different.  

I think everyone deserves to reach to the top, and the top is what I want. Nothing else. And that's what I will try to do."

So my question is, would it be worth the time and effort to send companies letters of interest/""prospecting letters"" about internships? Something like, ""Hey, I am interested in the company and the work you do, here are my skills; call me if you need an internship?"" Or should I just keep looking for actual internship postings?

I just finished my freshman year at a top 5 school, and I entered college as an anticipated physics major. Back in April, I realized that physics was not the right path for me. I had a physics research position lined up for the summer but bailed and and hustled to get something in CS. I had a research position last summer, where I used python for the data analysis, and I leveraged that plus some stats knowledge to land a data science internship this summer.

My goal is to land a software engineering internship at a Big N for my junior summer. Ideally, for my sophomore summer I'd love to do one of those sophomore summer programs at Big Ns (like Google EP, Microsoft Explore, etc), but of course experience as a software engineering intern at other companies would be fine. I'm doing the following things to prepare for interviews this fall for my sophomore summer:

1. I completed an intro computer science course.
2. I am working through Princeton's Algorithms course, and will for sure finish part 1 this month. I hopefully will get through at least half of Part 2 before summer ends.
3. I will start leetcode practice as soon as I finish Algorithms Part 1 from Princeton.
4. Finished one personal project (\~500 lines) in C++, and I'm currently planning my second one (estimating 1000-2000 lines), which will be a web application. I will start planning a third one once I finish the second to utilize technologies I haven't yet been exposed to.

Is there anything else I should be doing? Should I not be doing anything on my list? Should I really prioritize leetcode more than personal projects?

Also, does anyone have advice for how to transition from data science to software engineering? I like my internship a lot, especially because I'm being exposed to unsupervised learning and other cool things, but I think that I'd rather start with developing software out of college. Plus, most FT data science positions require Masters (even the company I work at haha).

Thanks in advance, you guys are awesome. I'm overwhelmed since I've just been learning and grinding nonstop since April.

**TLDR:** Freshman, new to CS, working as data science intern this summer. Completed intro CS course, working through Princeton Algorithms course, will start leetcode once done with that. Should have 3 projects complete by end of summer. Anything else I should be doing for Big N internship prep?"

Focus is Python and fundamentals right now, however a little later on throughout my degree as a side project I was thinking of building a basic website with a few static pages, as a means of learning HTML (which I’ve dabbled with already), CSS (which looks tedious but surely won’t take long to learn, I think?), and JavaScript, then showing it off to employers after my Masters, or even to get internships. 

Assume my programming skills are very basic, I spend one hour everyday working on this website, I’m studying CS at college, I need to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I’m a logical problem solver who studied economics and some statistics, and the sort who is keen a.f about whatever I’m interested in. 
Also assume I’m a quick and resourceful learner (learned Japanese to a fair standard, so this isn’t my first attempt at studying a massive topic.)

I had some questions which are:

-	as a ballpark estimate, what kind of timeframe would it take to build a respectable looking blog website with 3 pages, and a way to automate the process of adding a blog to a new page? 
-	do I need a backend for the historical blogs I’ve uploaded? 
-	what kind of cost (in USD) is involved in having this website live for a two year period? 
-	after I’ve done all this, what kind of recommendations would you give when it comes to adding new features to the website, in order to develop skills sought after by employers? 
-	do I need to worry about the security of the website if it (has no backend / has a super basic backend)
-	any other advice / tips for taking on a project like this?

I've been passionate about games for a great deal of my life. I have a love for working on projects and I'm pretty good at dealing with logical, mathematical stuff so I think Computer Game Science is a perfect blend of what I enjoy and what I'm good at (at least that's how CGS looks on paper). The goal right now is to go into the gaming industry but I understand that it's a risky and hard field to work in. I also understand that goals and passions can change, which is the reason I think switching to CS is the more logical and safe approach. However, the classes and major don't excite/interest me the way CGS' courses do, which is why I'm leaning more towards CGS. I just fear that the quality of the major isn't as good as it looks.

&amp;#x200B;

Another fear of mine is that I will struggle getting a job with a niche sounding major. I aim to apply to mostly gaming companies so my major might not be a problem. However, if I were to apply for anything else software related would my chance of employment be extremely lowered by the major I chose? I know that all companies are different and I honestly don't know a lot about jobs but I'm still pretty concerned I won't get a job after college if I go with CGS.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial solution to my worries was to just double major in CGS and CS. I could learn material I thoroughly enjoy and want to learn and have a potentially larger, diverse set of knowledge than I would if I just took one or the other. However, when looking at the requirements to double major, I realized I would have to maintain a 3.0 GPA and work extra hard for it. I'm not opposed to working hard but I know it's gonna be challenging, especially when balancing a social life, extracurriculars, and internships. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I don't know a lot about college and tHe rEaL woRlD so I apologize if what I'm saying is just based on assumptions and feelings. I know this whole thing was one big rant but ultimately I'm just asking for thoughts and opinions; I'm asking for thoughts on what I should do, thoughts on both majors, thoughts on double majoring. I'm trying to get a better grasp on what I should do and what would be better for my future, so don't hold back!

I like courses with lectures, whether they be university courses or things on sites like Udemy, obviously I can google for these myself but I'm wondering if anyone has audited similar courses and has any recommendations. If there are not any good video-based courses, I'll probably just pick up a textbook or two."

&amp;#x200B;

Some background so this post makes sense - I'm going to be a 4th year undergrad computer science student at &lt;big name university&gt;. I've had a couple software engineering internships at &lt;local tech company&gt; and I currently have an internship at &lt;big name tech company&gt;. (Not naming them for privacy reasons)

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that I still feel like I'm kind of incompetent when it comes to developing personal projects with any significant complexity or difficulty... I've done well in rigorous CS courses like OS, machine learning, compilers, etc. so I have a good level of knowledge. But I still have difficulty starting my own personal projects because it's hard to find something that is complex, but not too difficult for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, how do I further improve myself? Should I contribute to an open source project or something? Should I just keep rolling with my career and learn at work, not worrying about personal projects? I am interested in developing a personal project, but again, it's difficult to find something that suits me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice appreciated. Thanks"

I helped them by setting codes for loading data and train the model and we even discussed my salary. During May, I waited and waited and contacted them but their response was the start date is 100% dependent on the customer so they still don't know. 
So I started looking for jobs since I couldn't trust this company any longer. But I had no work experience and it made me struggle to get interviews. And on early June, I was told they cannot hold me any longer since their customer is keep postponing the start date.

I was terrified and I kept looking for job and was able to get 3 interviews until today and luckily got into the unpaid web developer internship.
But since this is unpaid position, I have no income.

My plan is keep working with the unpaid position and keep looking for job with updated resume that has unpaid internship as the experience. Could anyone advice if this is a good plan? I think  this is the only plan available for me. If there is other way to solve my problem please advise me.

Also, I recently found out that the company that gave me runaround posted a new job and its description says it now supports the language that I was supposed work to translate using Machine Learning model. Is it possible to report this company? I have all the conversations on skype and emails. I asked the CEO of the company has the project started and the reply was that it hasn't and the job posting isn't related to that project but I can't trust him and I'm sure I just worked for him for free.

I thought I would be able to land a full time position in a more established company, so I didn't accept the offer at the end of my internship (which would be paying me 13/hr for 20 hours per week). We're in July and I still haven't landed a position. I've came to the conclusion that jobs won't take a chance on me until I have more industry level experience. So, I've been thinking about freelancing as a way to gain more industry experience. But, I lack experience and I know it'll make finding contracts difficult. So, I am seeking out some experienced developers that would be interested in freelancing. I know most of developers with ""experience"" will be pressed for time so let me know what I can do to make this potential partnership more attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to apply for an MBA next year, and am just starting to bring together my profile and identify areas I can work on for the next 1-2 years to significantly bolster my chances of getting into a good program in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate some advice on what could some of my target schools be, and how far am I from breaking into the top 10 MBA programs in the US. Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* Work experience:   
\- SDE-2 @ Amazon (2.5 years)  
\- I have the option to relocate to the US for an year or so, in case international work ex helps
* Extra curriculars:  
\- Team Leader at AIESEC (student run org)  
\- 2-month technical Internship at a UK-based startup  
\- Developed open-source software for top CS college in India, now used by other colleges in the country  
\- 1-month FT volunteer work in partnership with the govt of Mauritius  
\- 6-month technical internship at Amazon  
\- Miscellaneous: couple of hackathon wins, event organizing experience, volunteering for technical clubs to teach students, etc.
* Undergrad school/major: Undergraduate degree in CSE from India.
* Other education/coursework: NA
* Race/nationality: Indian
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!):   
\- GRE 330 (Q167 + V163). Should I consider taking the GMAT? Do programs prefer one over the other?   
\- TOEFL 116 if that's relevant.
* Undergrad GPA:   
\~8.5/10. Not sure how this converts to 4 point scale. One thing to mention is that my GPA was always on the rise, ending with a 10/10 in the last semester. I was also a scholarship student at this university if that helps.

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: I am really interested to work at the intersection of technology and business. Using tech to make big impact is where my passion lies, not necessarily low-level coding. Having a sound technical base, I want to work on my business skills by getting an MBA, which I can leverage in my career.
* Target schools: Would appreciate inputs here. I would ideally like to make it to T10."

When do companies usually start looking for interns in the year and what would be the best time to apply? In terms of skills, I'm currently pretty comfortable with java and OOP, but not sure if I'm missing any skills/topics. I'm learning spring boot and the web package, also dipping my feet in the water with databases with implementing sql server into spring. I'm also trying to learn basic design patterns but both spring and design patterns seems like a lot so I don't know if I will be comfortable with both by the time I'm applying to internships. I don't have a lot on my github, since I'm still learning new topics and it's difficult to start on new projects. I'm hoping to have a few by the time summer ends.

The hiring manager just asked what I expect for an hourly wage, and I am trying to get an idea of the pay ranges.

I have worked as a software developer intern or exactly 1 year now. I have working experience in Python, Java, C#, and SQL. My first position in software development was a SQA position that involved lots of automating as well as adding of features to our SQA software suite. This was almost all done in Java. Currently, I am working as a Data Warehouse Intern, working exclusively with SQL and C#. I have been in this position for 6 months so far. The new company is a software/mobile app company and I will likely be starting in the SQA side of things, and moving to engineering when I get more familiar with their software and workflow. It was indicated to me that they do data science work as part of their stack, which I am very interested in and am actively pursuing.

I kind of delayed my start date because I had to give notice to my retail job and asked for 3 weeks which they were completely fine with. 

Well today is my first day but another place I recently did an interview with has just offered me the position and idk what to do since I actually started here. I would feel so bad but I also want to do what’s best for my career. I’ll try to list the facts and pros/cons.

Company 1 (current job):

* 17/hr (35,000)
* Mac based everything
* 200 employees
* Desktop Support/Help Desk type role

Company 2: 
* 19.23/hr (40,000)
* Windows based
* 50-200 employees
* Asset Management Tech II, my understanding is this is more of a behind the scenes IT job like imaging, hardware upgrades, system maintenance and a lot of things I did at my internship. Network team is the natural progression in their words.

I’m really torn because Company 2 looks much better and I personally want to be in a Windows environment because I see that’s what is mostly used in enterprises and that’s all I really know. I want to work with Windows Server, WDS etc. Is me leaving after a day or two unethical or should I do what’s really best for me?

EDIT: Definitely did not expect all these response, but they have helped for sure. I even had to speak to my past manager at my IT internship to get his input and he basically said the same as you guys. I’m going to do what’s best for me and accept the Company 2 offer. Thanks guys!"

I ended up doing it over the weekend. After going through the motions, I figured there would be a way for me to check if my device was encrypting. At first I thought it was done, but then when I clicked on DDPE logo, it said it wasn’t connected to the wizard or something like that. It didn’t show status like an encrypted device would. Thinking that encryption hadn’t begun, but more importantly, without thinking. I jumped the gun for the next steps listed which I thought were needed to start encryption. That involved restarting the computer and now I may have messed up my computer. It boots to sign-in page, but only stays booted for 3-4 seconds before restarting due to a stop code error. 

Nevertheless, I can not afford a new computer and I desperately need this one to work (preferably without losing all my data -it is not backed up). HELP!

cap6sq,3,2019-07-08,Will this be too short of an internship?,LilHammy55,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/cap6sq/will_this_be_too_short_of_an_internship/,"Since May I have been trying to get in contact with the CEO of my local Chamber of Commerce about interning with them. (I'm a rising sophomore economics major.) I was finally able to meet with him almost three weeks ago, and he at the end of the meeting he told me that he would call me that Friday (6/21) to set up another meeting with other department heads to discuss where I might fit in best. He never called, so I sent him an email today asking for an update. If he doesn't respond, I plan to call him later this week. 

I go back to school in early September; I'll probably fly back on the 3rd or 4th. My worry is that once I actually start, I will only be there for a few weeks and won't have time to work on any real projects. My school has a fund that gives kids stipends if they have unpaid summer internships and it has to be at least 8 weeks long for it to count, so I feel like that's how long a ""normal"" internship is, but other than that I don't really have preconceived notions of how long they usually are.

I have applied for a couple of ""regular"" jobs, but haven't been super active or serious about it because I thought that I would be starting the internship soon enough. I didn't want to start a job and have to quit like two weeks after. Now, I feel like that's going to happen anyway because it takes a long time to be called for an interview, and once I start working it'll be time to go back to school. 

I feel like I'm wasting my summer. I really wanted to do something that will help my resume, especially since a go to a pretty prestigious college and I know kids doing research with professors and stuff. 


TLDR; Is a three week internship worth pursuing?"

I joined this company 4 months ago, I'm working on a 2 year contract and was hired through a consulting company, I had to go through that route as I spent almost a year interviewing without getting an offer, several reasons prevented me from getting an offer, first of all I get nervous and worked up during interviews and I lose a good portion of my brain cells, I still tend to do alright but I guess for many interviewers they see that as weakness and therefore consider me not worthy for the position. 

I have had an internship experience at a nuclear company before graduation and have been told that having this on my resume will help a lot, well it didn't. I've had many interviews where I have done a great job but never received the offer, many of them needed the exact skill set that I had, and those were skills that are not common at all for entry level positions . 

I have had my senior design project with my local power company, an extremely intense project where I spent the entire year suffering through extreme stress for, while at the same time dealing with so many problems with my team, we were 4 members where two of us were absolutely useless and the other guy (team lead) had a huge problem with me for no reason, I'm an extremely nice and professorial person and never attack or piss off anyone :/ I still ended up getting an A for senior design, and I thought that I had a great chance at getting hired by that company.

They asked me for an interview and my interviewer was actually my senior design project leader (from the company's side), he was a manager there and I interviewed with him and another manager. I did extremely well during the interview and I owned by shit, they were using technologies that no other college graduate would have and I had those skills, the position was literally the same thing I had been working on during my senior design. I still didn't get the job, it shattered me. 

And you know what's even worse? One of the two guys who were absolutely useless on my senior design project got the job, can you imagine? Life can be a joke sometimes, not only he was useless he was also unprofessional during the team meetings with the project supporters so it really astonished me how he got the job. 

Anyway, I've had so many interviews afterwards and they were very related to what I had worked on, yet never received an offer, I'm not the kind of person to use the race card, but in many cases I felt that almost the only reason I didn't get the job was for me being middle eastern, I'm a U.S. citizen and my English is great, yet on one of my interviews (it was a job for programming luggage conveyors on airports), my interviewer was very arrogant and rude, he was asking me if I was ok with a background check as it was a security sensitive job which I replied with of course. I went through that process at a nuclear company where security must be top notch. But that guy kept repeating that question, and then he said that ""btw the TSA will have to constantly search you, so if you have anything to hide this job might not be for you"". Why in the world would you interview me in the first place if you didn't trust me or think I'm a terrorist or a threat just by looking at my name? 

I have had several experiences similar, but this one was the most straight forward about it. 

Anyway, that was an entire year of living hell for me, I was convinced I'm never gonna get a job, I was devastated and depressed, until one of my friends recommended a consulting company for me, I said sure why not. Obviously it's not a great company salary wise (you literally get paid $45,000 a year and you are bound with a 2 year contract, but the good thing about this company was that their clients (where you get hired) are actually top financial firms, and they also had a great training program where you get trained and get interviews with clients at the same time. 

I've had a few interviews where I didn't get placed, but after a few weeks I got interviewed by the company I'm working with now, I've had the phone interview first and it was decent, not too tech technical but I felt a great connection with the interviewer, he was very nice and made me feel comfortable so I did great and knew I was gonna make it to the next round. Next thing I know, 20 mins later I was told I got the job and that he liked me so much that he didn't want another round. I was so happy to finally be able to start my career. Yes the salary is shitty but I was getting 2 years of experience at a great company, and the cost of living where I would be working is very good. 






TLDR;

So, I've been working here for 4 months and I love it, my coworkers are amazing, my team really like me being there, and I have been told I'm doing great. I would love to keep working here after my contract (which I'm almost certain they will give me the offer). But there are few things I'm concerned about:
First of all, they use super old technologies here, most of my coworkers only know Cobol and SQL, they have no experience with java or newer languages. I'm the java guy on my team, some people on my team also know java but don't work much with it. On my side I mostly work with java and Linux, I do web development and I also work on projects that deal with a lot of data. The problem is even within java they still use old technologies, for example Spring is barely used even though it would make all those projects easier to deal with. But I have been told they are in the process of transitioning to java only instead of Cobol, but that's gonna take years as almost all projects here are written in Cobol, but this is why they hired me, I'm gonna be the Java expert on the team to help everyone with this transition.

So here is the thing, I feel like the work load so far has been small compared to what I was expecting, I end up working many hours on IT stuff like change promotions and Linux packaging etc I'm still being put on java projects though. 

What I'm also concerned about, the software department here have almost zero documentation and their communication is very lacking even within the same team. We are supposed to have weekly team meetings but they are always cancelled, I have no idea what my team is working on and aside from my team lead and few other guys they also have no idea what I'm working on. Etc etc etc.

So my question is, I LOVE working here, I feel very respected and I'm doing great and also learning fast, but would it hurt by career in the future if I keep working with them after my contract? For example I wouldn't have any experience with documentation or decent experience with team meetings etc

 Let me know if you have more questions. And thank you for reading."
caq1k0,1,2019-07-08,Go for my BCBA or change and do Computer Science,ccsoccerdude,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/caq1k0/go_for_my_bcba_or_change_and_do_computer_science/,"I'm a married 28M, and with a Bachelors in Psychology and a Master's degree in Sports Psychology. I live in a small town with my wife who makes pretty good money that I don't technically need to work. But do I currently work as a part-time ($11/hour) ABA line therapist for children with autism for the past 4 months. When I first started my job I was enthusiastic about it especially since I had spent about a year and a half after completing my Masters to finally find a job in the Psychology field. However, I think i have come to the realization that this field is not for me. I'm not sure that I am seeing progress with my clients to the point where the burnout to progress ratio is like 10:1 in favor of burn-out. It's hard work, i get that and i knew it wasn't going to be easy but I think I'm the type of person who has difficulty in keeping objectivity especially working with such clientele and even though I shouldn't I find myself taking things personal that my clients say or do or when they aren't making progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically as of right now these are the  2 options that I think i have.

**Option 1 aka my current track**\-- Get my BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst) basically free. My state has a program that will pay for a group of individuals to take the necessary coursework needed. I do have some of the coursework required and would only need 3-4 classes I believe. And the other part of that is the company i work for will allow me to have ""free"" Supervised hours ( need 2,000). However, i will have to give them 2 years of work in return. HOWEVER, the day i started with the company was basically the deadline to submit the application for the free coursework so now i have to wait another 10 months to put in an application. So at this point im basically looking at another 2.5 years before i can get my BCBA. Prospective 55-60k salary. 

PROS - **Free** School, Free Supervised Hours, Free work Experience, 55-60k Job lined up

CONS- Mental Health/Burn Out, Not sure I will be good at it

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2 aka what i want to do**\-- Go back to school for a computer science/engineering degree. Since I already have a bachelors, majority of my pre-req's should be completed and i could just hop into the program itself  which should only take 2 years. While going to school I can get a job at my wife's company as a year-round intern making an extra $5.00 then I'm making right now. They will also hire me on once my degree is earned for 60k+. However, I haven't done the math completely because I dont know what credits they will accept...but I would be looking at 20-25k to go back to school. Which is too much time and money spent in my wife's eyes especially since I  just spent about 17k 2.5 years ago to get my Masters which hasn't really gotten my anywhere. I love computers, I have built my own and at this point in time would much rather stare at a computer screen for 8-10 hours a day over listening to tantruming kids scream in my ear.

PROS- Paid Internship, 60k+ Job lined up, Passionate about computers, no screaming kids

CONS- Cost **Money**

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Do I continue on a trail of unhappiness and burnout or take a financial risk on a new career path."

My department is kind of small, we’re only like 20 people, and almost all of them are above age 50; except for one guy, who’s 30. 

Naturally we started hanging out at work, and even started texting outside of it. He is a really sweet guy, who definitely feels more like a 25 year old rather than a 30 year old. We became good friends, and i think it was a little obvious that we liked each other. People at work started teasing us and said that they thought that something was going on between us two, even though both of us denied it multiple times (for obvious reasons).

A few days ago, some of us from work went out for drinks, and then somehow I ended up alone with him at a bar. We were both super drunk, and it didn’t take long before he started kissing me. I kissed him back. We never did anything other than making out that evening.

The day after we’re texting as usual, and he brings up what happened the day before. He wanted to make sure that i was okay with it, that I didn’t have any regrets about it or whatnot. I told him that I didn’t, and he said the same. 

Today at work was the first time i’ve seen him since it happened. It was a tiny bit awkward between us, but I guess that’s just because we have no idea how to act around each other anymore. We haven’t spoken about it since the day after, but I have noticed him trying harder to be around me more often, or talk to me more, etc. I am 100% sure that he wants to date me, so I guess it’s up to me to decide. And I am not really sure how i feel.

Taking this incredibly long backstory into consideration, my question is; do you think that this is something worth giving a shot? Or is it already doomed because of the age gap? I am leaving the company for uni this fall, so that wouldn’t be an issue. I am more concerned about how the age gap would affect us.


TL;DR - I (20F) might be about to become romantically involved with work colleague (30M). He is 10 years older than me. I like him, and I know he likes me a lot. Should I go for it or no?"

I moved here from a developing nation a couple years back, and it is great to be part of a community with such enthusiastic pc gamers.  
My last build was a gtx 970/core i7 4470 one and lasted me very well until I had to move her, leaving my precious PC behind. When I got here I was living in student housing and got myself an Aorus x5v7 primarily because I was living in student housing and did not have space to have my own PC (big mistake!) Whoever at Gigabyte thought it was a great idea to stuff a desktop class cpu in there, without thinking about the thermals was obviously a very disgruntled employee. And as with most 'gaming laptops' I was left with something that was not that great at gaming, and because of no gpu switching and the desktop class cpu, sucked at even loading webpages without any jarring if it was not plugged in.

So, scraping together money working odd jobs and internships, I have come up with a build that I would ideally want as my next PC. All suggestions and feedback welcome.

Anyway when I took the job it sounded like I'd be working on a team and collaborating with others which is something I really enjoy. Now that i'm actually working, it turns out that except for a few meetings a week, I'm at a desk by myself all day which I really don't like. Also when I try and make conversation with my coworkers they seem annoyed, and everyone eats lunch by themselves. All my coworkers seem really introverted and into traditional nerdy things like video games and dungeons and dragons, which I have nothing against but I'm more into sports and outdoor activities which makes it hard for me to try and connect with them. Are most computer science jobs going to be like this, or am I just in the wrong job within the industry? I'm wondering if I should just go to graduate school for something else while I'm still young.

I am an intern. Occasionally I end up waiting quite a while before someone on my team gets around to reviewing my code. What is a good amount of time to wait before sending reminders? How many reminders is ""one too many""?

I created a review request this morning as soon as I got in to work, and dropped a quick message to a particular engineer who was supposed to review it. He did say he would do it but he had quite a few meetings today. Would it be rude if I sent him another reminder tomorrow morning?

FWIW, the people on my team seem quite nice and friendly. It's highly unlikely that anyone of them will get mad at me for reminding them. I just don't want to be too annoying.

Edit: He mentioned that he would get done with the review by lunch today."

So fast forward my team consists of 4 devs, the lead dev (10 years exp, also my boss technically), a senior dev (8 years exp), another ""junior"" (2 years of experience in actual work) and me (Been coding for about 4 years in college doing side projects/non profit work for companies) No internship or prior programming job experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first month was initially me learning the code base and slowly started getting task near the end of the month, halfway through the second month I started getting feedback from the lead dev telling me I really need to get up to speed because he wants me to stay, basically started throwing more tasks at me as well as telling me to start working on these tasks at home at the same time learning courses the company bought. Here at the 2 month mark, basically i'm being told i'm not understanding the tasks as fast as the other junior dev. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying my best to work on tasks, ask for help, but there's no clear indicator on how fast I should be progressing. The lead says hes always available at work/slack and I can talk to the other devs too but they're usually working on their own projects. My mental health has dramatically went down over the last month, i've spent almost no time going out to see friends/play video games, it's all just been learning code and once i'm done with a task after getting help I just get more work thrown at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Boss told me this morning at the end of the month is my 3 month review, I honestly didn't expect to get reviewed at least until the 6 month mark but I feel no matter how hard I bust my ass this month i'm likely going to get let go. Any advice on how I should approach the rest of this month? Should I just say fuck it and put in my 2 weeks by the 15th and just start applying for jobs? Or should I just keep busting my ass at the expense of my mental health to hopefully be kept on for however much longer?"

While I enjoy math, I've realized that physics isn't really for me. At my current internship I'm doing a lot of image processing in Python, and I really enjoy it. I could see myself being a computer scientist. But before I go and switch majors, I wanted to get some information from some of you who know more about the field and career opportunities.

**1. What is the pay like?**

This is huge for me. Call me conceited, but I'll have loans to pay off after college and if I switch majors as a sophomore I'll probably have to add on an extra year of study. I want to know if the pay I'll be making is worth taking out more loans in the long run. I see that the average starting salary is slightly more for an aerospace engineer, but I didn't dig deep enough to find out about benefits or average mid career salary for computer science.

**2. I enjoy the more scientific programming side of CS, how big of a market is there for this?**

As I mentioned above, I am currently doing image processing in Python + some MATLAB, and I think it's so cool. I would like to stay on the more scientific side of programming as I like math. Machine learning, and data analysis are target fields I'm interested in. What kind of schooling/career paths am I looking at to get into one of these fields? What is the pay like in those fields compared to CS as a whole?

**3. What's the best way to set myself apart from other students?**

So I want to make a lot of money and get into some niche fields- what's the best way for me to up my chances of succeeding? I know a decent amount of python, but I could definitely improve. What are some great ways of honing your skills? What about building portfolios? Should I start creating personal projects and fill a portfolio with  them? I already am lined up for a security clearance via my internship, how useful are security clearances in CS?

I've been able to put together my own portfolio site, a few projects, had a few informational interviews (the general consensus is I'm off to a really good start), and feel pretty confident in my ability with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Here's the issue - I have been applying and looking for any type of work (full time, part time, internship, freelance, etc.) for a couple months and only got two calls back with no actual interviews coming out of it. I have been out of work for a month now and really could use some help getting that first gig.

When I mean currently working they asked me to start with it. They provided some CSV files but their data is so scattered and unstructured that I’m getting an headache by just looking at them. I had told them that I could write pipelines for them to store analytical data. What do I do now? My idea is to write pipelines that extract necessary data from the MongoDB on a schedule and write them to an sql database. But I don’t know if they have an SQL database. I know the immediate option is to launch a SQL database in AWS. They don’t have terabytes of data. Let’s say 100 Gb as an estimate. My questions are as follows. 

Am I right about storing the data in a SQL database in a structured format to help with the dashboard or can we use MongoDB itself?

Am I right about suggesting a cloud option if they don’t have a SQL local database?

Should I create a data lake by extracting data from MongoDB at scheduled intervals, do transformation using spark and store it as partitioned compressed files? (Seems likes a cheaper option to me since they are a startup)

At the same time, I do enjoy the work I do and my coworkers are very understanding and nice, however, I have struggled a little with the company culture as there are very few people here who are my age, (early 20s) which has been very socially challenging for me, hence my interest in switching companies to one with more younger people. 


Tl;dr 
Have stayed with same company for long time early into my professional career. How bad is this for my future?

&amp;#x200B;

Just a quick background on my situation. In 2015, my Mom moved in with her current BF after only dating him for about 6 months. They decided on it around 4 months. I had only met him once. I moved back home from college upon graduation in 2017 and have been stuck since. My Mom never asked my opinion even when I asserted myself because I was graduating and ""wouldn't even be around that long"". Welp. That was incorrect. Unfortunately, I just can't find a job that pays me enough to live on my own. I'm currently unemployed and have been for 6 months. Same thing has happened to my other friends that have graduated college. I spent a year and a half in a temp job that I thought would turn permanent. Newsflash, it didn't. I've tried everything. More temp jobs, internships, part-time. Nothing seems to work. I get the ""you interviewed well, we liked you, but we found someone with more experience"". It's been frustrating. Although, this situation could be turning soon. I'm in the final stages of the hiring process right now for a really good gig. Cross your fingers for me! 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my Mom and her BF came home from camping. I usually do upkeep on the house while they're gone and help in anyway I can while they're out having fun. My Mom's BF is an avid marijuana user. I don't participate in that but it's legal and if that's how he chooses to use his time, it's totally fine by me as long as I don't smell it. Long story short, he asked me to maintain his plants while he was away. He gave me complicated instructions. He never wrote them down and I was too tired from my workout to ask for them to be written manually. So, I tried to remember the best I could. I thought I had it down. Turns out I accidentally over-fertilized them. I had texted my Mom and told her they weren't doing well. She said not to worry. He comes home and immediately runs out back. He starts yelling, screaming, putting holes in the wall, and began cussing me out from the garage. ""He killed them! I can't believe it. It wasn't even that hard."" My Mom is telling him to calm down because he's got anger issues. Now, I want to point out here that my Dad has anger issues. I've spent my entire life doing the best I can to avoid displaying that behavior myself (I swear, it has to be genetic). He then starts pacing around the house, nearly having a nervous breakdown, and just started cussing me out again. Now because of my past, I don't take kindly to people belittling me or my friends. I come out and he asks me what I did. He tries to be calm but starts giving me a condescending tone and sort of insulting me subtly. I repeat the steps he told me and he goes ""yeah, you killed em."" My Mom says he should be responsible for his own plants and it was equally his fault for putting someone who doesn't have experience in control of it. She even admitted she would've also fucked it up. Tensions begin to rise and we both start cussing at each other. I told him he was a piece of shit (never really liked the guy) and he told me that killing his plants was like burning the house down. He then stares me down and starts approaching me. I shoved his face with the palm of my hand and he flopped like a fish. He oversold it. I had a similar altercation with my Dad (10 y/o) and I actually blocked him from ""spanking"" me as he approached me in an eerily comparable manner. So you could imagine where my defense mechanisms draw from. I walk upstairs because I was a solid ten seconds away from actually punching him (my disdain for this guy has been building for a long time) but I couldn't because my potential job situation and my Mom was in tears. I go to my room and gather my gym bag for a workout. I hear him cussing, hitting &amp; breaking things, and my Mom crying. He proceeds to say that I'm ""fucking clueless"" and ""stupid"". My Mom gets right in his face and sticks up for me. I attempted to apologize and it just didn't go anywhere. As I'm leaving the house, he says ""you might as well have just killed the dogs"". It blew my mind that he went there. I told him he was a ""a condescending, worthless sack of shit"" and if he ever spoke to me like that again I'd whoop his ass, spat on his truck, and went off to the gym. I came home and apparently both him and my Mom just want to drop it. But I can't seem to let it go and it's because of the asinine comparison between our amazing dogs and his weed that he uses to toke up so he can relive his glory days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer them the best I can. I have many more stories so if it relates to a point your trying to make, I won't hesitate to share it with you. Thanks again.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Mom's BF and I got in a fight that has been brewing up for years, need advice on how to move forward."

I'm trying to stay out of my house more often, but this upsets my father. He (jokingly?) threatens to move me out of the house because I'm not home enough. I hate this, even if it is a joke, because it's not a good joke. Idk. My older sister lives with her bf, but her bedroom is untouchable. 

I want to work on getting out of here. But, I feel angry and scared and stressed, and I hate it.

I don't want to take up space in their house, I just do.

I wish I could sell and get rid of the majority of my belongings. I wish I weren't so depressed. I wish I weren't so sensitive. 

I'm just trying to cope the ways I know how, and I hate that a few words from my dad put me in this headspace.

I wish I had my own house. 

My parents don't really want me to leave, but they're not satisfied with the way I live my life. Hell, neither am I. I'm confused too.

But, I cannot live like my sister does. I will not have another father-figure to guide me. I'm going to have to work a lot harder.

And I feel like I don't even know who I have to become to feel better."

- Struggled at my fist job and left after 2.5 years due to reasonable fear of getting fired (got a bad performance review and it does take me longer to grasp concepts than other software engineers)
- Second job did very well, bosses very happy with my performance - left during a bout of depression due to fear job would get too hard and I’d struggle
- Third job (current) - Meets expectations every quarter, I’m a mediocre developer at best (never really liked coding despite loving math - I’m basically doing this for the money) and feel I struggle more than most/everyone really is smarter than me - paranoid every single day I’m going to get fired or get a bad performance review for trouble delivering big projects.

I’ve never gotten a promotion in the 6 years I’ve been working but I generally have the facade of success all my life. Am I too stupid to do this? Or is it my bipolar depression talking - I’ve struggled with bipolar depression for years off and on. What if I actually AM incompetent and it just SEEMS like imposter syndrome?

A bit of background in me. I am 24 and just got my masters. My undergrad grades were great but my grad grades were horrendous and I dont have any internship experience.

So I currently have a job offer from a sorta start up (they're really small, are bootstrapped, and have been profitable for 5 years) where I'd be doing work highly relevant to my experience and future path. 

I somehow also managed to get to  the final interview stage with a big tech company (on the level of Google/Amazon/Microsoft etc.) for a position where I would not be doing what I liked.

Assuming that I get the offer from the second company I'm torn on what to go for. Both companies pay similarly but my worry is more about how it would look on my resume since I only intend to stick with either company for a year or two as I want to move back into my hometown down the road. With the start up I'll gain experience in my field but with the bigger company I'll have that brand recognition factor. 

Any thoughts/advice would be extremely appreciated."

I'm not a great programmer but I really want to learn it, my question is if this internship is a good place to learn programming and that with the knowledge of apex I become a better programmer (I prefer to code in Java or C# when I'm going to find a job).

So I got my first help desk job back in November of 2018, I had my A+ then but now I have my Net+ and Sec+ and have learned a couple of things outside of those certifications since then. I've been here for 9ish months on a contract that keeps getting extended which is dope because I keep hearing I'm doing a good job here and I appreciate hearing all of that from both my boss and my contractor but I'm a little concerned. It's a great work environment and I'm really good friends with one of my seniors here and he considers me his work child(lol) and he told me the previous person left because he was in the same position that I am, his contract kept getting extended and he was a contractor for about 2 years before they even considered hiring him but he ended up leaving. 

I'm getting paid 25$ an hour, work 40 hrs a week and I was completely satisfied with this until I started doing more work outside of my criteria when my coworkers went on vacation, I love learning new things and since we all have a separation of duties every time I pick something up it's different. I don't have any benefits or anything like that and don't get paid for holidays but I'm starting to feel a little burnt out. I'm feeling a little envious as well, at first I didn't mind any of this before because I literally jumped from getting paid 11.50 at GameStop to 25 per hour and shouldn't complain but I have student loans looming over my shoulder along with other bills. What kind of solidified the concern for me was when I was speaking to the new intern that got hired for the summer he told me he's getting paid the literal same amount as I am and all he's doing is shadowing us and learning a few things about infrastructure but..he has more benefits than I do and is getting paid for the holidays?

I was told by others not to complain bc of the pay rate but since this is my first literal IT job outside of college should I just suck it up or start job searching?"

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few months I've been trying unsuccessfully to land interviews and get a job as a Graduate Software Developer. I've predominantly applied for Graduate Software Developer roles, Front End Web Developer roles, Software Developer Internships and Graduate Schemes and have now got to a point where I almost feel like I've exhausted all available roles. The ways in which I've been applying have been through tons of job boards (Reed, Indeed, etc), LinkedIn, recruiter websites and directly through company websites when I find a company I like the look of. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem now is that the number of new roles I can apply for seem to have dwindled drastically, and i'm struggling to find new roles I can apply for. It almost feels like I've been rejected from every one which is very disheartening and i'm now struggling to find new roles I can even apply for.

I guess i'm here to ask for tips, how do you guys go about finding new job roles? What methods in particular have you seen the most success with? Any advice is much appreciated! :)"

I'm a recent graduate and I'm going to be going to an event in my major field/one I hope to enter the workforce in (am currently unemployed). However, despite being a business major I've never gone to a networking event before. Honestly, I really like meeting new people and am comfortable talking to someone first or striking up a completely random conversation but when it comes to anything related to jobs/\*actual\* networking I get so uncomfortable and feel like such a kiss up and I have no idea how to act.

Any advice for how to approach people/start conversations in situations that are blatantly networking oriented (in the States)?

I just graduated like two months ago and I'm back home now, I'm obviously looking for a job but I'd also be interested in learning more about the field, the various opportunities, and hearing about people's experiences.

Edit- I think another part of the reason I'm so uncomfortable in networking situations is because I have a bad case of impostor syndrome. I went to a good uni and have internship experience but still feel so behind and just feel stupid asking questions or talking to other people- which I already know is bad but if anyone has any tips for dealing with/getting over it pls let me know !!!!

cb3pea,2,2019-07-09,Internship turning bad ?,DagDreamer93,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cb3pea/internship_turning_bad/,"I'm a final year computer engineering student and I've started an internship 2 months ago in a small company. Before starting, I was supposed to help them develop one of their software for one of their products (they're doing embedded stuff) but unfortunately, due to some paperwork delays, I started 3 months after my supposed starting date. 

What happened is that during that time, the software continued being developped, and when I came in, it was was already being prepared for field testing and soon production and release, I was left with nothing to do but bug fixing and minor changes making. The company has some interesting plans for the product, but it will only start development near the end of my stay.

So what I'm spending most of my time doing now is either reading internet posts about clean code, good practices, architecture and other software related stuff, or I would be yawning, fighting sleepiness and reading /AskReddit posts. 

My supervisor has some seamingly more challenging tasks to do, and he's doing them himself, I'm feeling he doesn't trust me enough to let me dive into them. To some extent, it's understandable to be honest, you won't throw serious stuff to a 2-month-in intern, but this is making me question myself. I'm feeling down for not being active and productive enough, and delivering stuff.

 The first weeks it was good enough because I was still learning the codebase and inner workings of the software and hardware, but now I feel I need to do more creative and productive work.

The worst thing about this, is that at the end of my internship, I must submit a report to my university and do a presentation about the project I worked on in front of a jury, in order to get my degree. And so I'm really afraid of not having enough material to write and talk about and possibly get a bad mark, and in a worst case scenario, my internship being deemed not good enough and causing me failing the year (very unlikely, but you never know).

This is a lot of writing, but It's been boiling in my head for the last couple of days, and I needed to get it out and talk about it.

Do you think it's normal and still early for an intern to do productive work? Do you think I'm doing something wrong? or Is it just me coming at an unconvinient time? What do you think I should do ?"

As of right now I am studying Mechanical Engineering. But I would like to study the brain.

The situation I am in right now is a very good one career/financial wise. I intern at a large car company that pays me very well for my age. If I continue the path I am on, I may be able to get a full time job with this company and pay off my college debt relatively quickly. But the problem is, I hate working there, and I know that it isn’t for me since I already have 2 years of experience in several different roles.

What I am really interested in is the human body, and the brain in particular. I love pushing my mind and body and challenging and improving them. I love researching the brain and how it works. That’s why I want to switch majors to something that has to do with that stuff. This would be a no brainer if I wasn't already $60k in debt, and if I knew of a reliable career path that would fit me in that field. I’m already halfway finished with college, but in a completely different major. If I switched now, I would have wasted so much money since neuroscientists don’t need to take classes like Differential Equations or Dynamics. 

This is such a conundrum for me because I know that we don’t live in a perfect world, and money is actually very important. Please take this into account when commenting, I just personally don’t know what the best option is for my future.

I'm a rising senior with high hopes of admission into a few very selective schools. My **unweighted GPA is around 3.85** (**around 4.3 weighted**). I have a **35 ACT** and two **800s on SAT II Subject Tests** (Literature, Math II, and hopefully Bio M and Physics, too, soon). I've taken the most rigorous schedule my school offers each year, with 1 AP and two honors sophomore year, and 4 APs and 2 honors my junior year. I have four 4s and one 5 on my AP exams. My high school is competitive, ranked 2nd in my state. I'd like to double major in Computational Biology and Economics.

I take care of a terminally ill parent, and have been throughout high school. This is a **time commitment of about 35 hrs/wk** during the school year. During junior year, I ended up taking care of both my parents, as the other parent was injured badly. As a result, I ended up with three 4s and one 5 on my AP exams, and a total of 5 B-pluses (2 first semester, 3 second semester) during junior year. Aside from being a primary caretaker, I'm an unhooked applicant.

**My ECs** are okay, but not exceptional (I haven't had significant time to devote to them as a result of my responsibilities at home). I'm an intern in a state university lab, and will continue to work in the position during my senior year. I'm a paid lab intern at a local hospital, and am dedicated to service work in various forms, having started a business with that end goal. I've had a couple of gallery shows for my artwork, am in the process of establishing a kickstarter project, and depending on how this summer plays out, may have my music played by a city orchestra. I'm president of a couple extracurriculars.

**My main concerns here are** my GPA (I've gotten eight B-pluses since the beginning of high school) and my AP scores. How well will they be viewed in light of my family commitments? Additionally, how is caring for a parent generally viewed in terms of the time it takes (crucially, the time it takes away from being able to develop depth in a particular field or extracurricular, or being able to keep up with academic work)? What kind of chance do I have at schools like Stanford, Princeton, Columbia, UChicago, or UC Berkeley?

I like him, I do. But he has a ton of questions (which I understand, because our codebase is quite complex and overwhelming). 

His project is within the scope of my domain and has to do with some code that I had been working tightly with. His manager is another guy on my team who hasn’t worked that closely with this part of code (but would be able to figure his way around if he were to look at it). 

The first week or so I was happy to help. I get that he’s new and doesn’t have a lot of experience. But it’s the start of week 4 and he’s still asking me a ton of questions. Overall I would say I spend about 30-45 minutes of my day just answering his questions and mentoring him, not including the time it takes to context switch back and forth between my code and his questions.

I would not have a problem with this if I signed up to be an intern manager / mentor. However, I did not and frankly, I am trying to get as much of my own work done as possible so I can clock out at 5. Life outside work right now is hectic and I simply don’t have the time to spend an extra hour or so each day guiding him. Not to mention that the “credit” of mentoring the intern is all going to go to his manager, who has not put in any of the hours I do answering his questions. 

My opinion is that his manager needs to step up and guide him. My coworker however doesn’t think it’s a problem since I am the owner of the code area the project resides in. He has mentioned this to my manager and my manager agrees with him.

How do I resolve this without coming off as an asshole? Am I the asshole?"

* BS in Mathematics and minor in CS.
* Data Scientist at a startup for 6 months (left due to the company essentially not wanting to put money into the DS (me creating and testing models locally, instead of using AWS) department and I also found some shady stuff going on in their finance data).
* 2 years worth of research in machine learning and other departments.
* Machine learning internship at a large company in my companies industry.
* 6 years work experience in the Air Force (so I've actually been in the workforce, and I'm not necessarily a fresh grad).

Their range on Glassdoor is 105k-150k for data scientists and my position. It also requires a top secret clearance and I'll have to relocate. Since my position is somewhat of a hybrid between research, an MLE, and a DS, I'm not exactly sure what I should ask for. DC is also pretty expensive in general. Any insight would be amazing."

The thing is, both of these had surveys along with coding test. The kind of which test various aspects of one's personality with on a 5 pointer scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Like having a growth mindset, user empathy etc. [Ex question: I do the bare minimum job to get a work done.]

I suspect that these companies take such surveys very seriously and it might be the reason of getting rejected despite solving all the coding questions. How can I prepare for these tests? Or should I focus more on writing clean code and simply code more and don't give much thought to this ( it is entirely possible that the codes failed at background testing and I'm being paranoid)"

Hello everybody, I’m currently in a summer internship that is a mix of system administration/python scripting/machine data analytics. So far it’s been great, I’ve been learning new things everyday and I’m being pushed out of my comfort zone which in turn has helped me grow as a soon to be IT professional. Besides this internship I have a lack of IT experience so I’ve been trying to bolster my resume by being an officer in my universities IT organization the past couple years and I also attained my Sec+ cert last semester. I’ve been interested in cloud computing for a while now and this coming semester (my final one) I only have to take 13 hours so I’m very much considering progressing down the AWS architect path. I’ve been studying up for the cloud practitioner exam and I plan to take that soon, then study and take the architecting on AWS cert in the next 3 months. For all those experienced in the industry, do you think this would be worth my time and help me find a good job, even though I won’t have any actual business cloud experience yet? 

I live in a HCOL and “hot” tech city and I’m passionate about advancing my career, I’m just unsure if beginning the AWS cert path before actually getting any cloud experience is worth it.

cbbcwf,1,2019-07-09,Study Abroad or Internship?,Unapologetiqeen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cbbcwf/study_abroad_or_internship/,"Hey everyone ✌🏾

TL;DR: I could use a little advice. I’m trying to decide if I should study abroad in the Spring or if I should take the semester off to do an internship full time in the Spring.  I have 2 questions at the end.

One thing is for sure, I don’t want to be on campus in the spring. I need a break from my campus to recharge. I only signed up for Fall housing so I’m going to have to choose one option. I have listed the pros and cons that I’ve currently thought of. 

Studying Abroad PROS:

1. I could earn credit and would keep my current graduation date of December 2020 **Quick note I transferred into CS sophomore year so I’m graduating a semester later.

2. I love traveling and pushing myself out of my comfort zone
 

Studying Abroad CONS:

1. I was supposed to study abroad in the fall and received a scholarship but had to decline because I have to have my tonsils taken out this fall. I can get the scholarship again but I’d have to reapply. It’s not guaranteed. 

2. If I graduate in the Fall I have to do a thesis in my second major, Philosophy. This is not necessarily bad. I just can’t do a computer science senior design project out of season, it has to be Fall-Spring, can’t be Spring-Fall.  A CS senior design project might be better on my resume for tech instead of a Philophy thesis, unless I do it on AI Ethics and get it published.

3. I would only have two internship experiences and no CS senior design project.  

Doing a Spring internship PROS:

1. I’d graduate Spring 2021 instead of Fall 2020.  Meaning I can do a 1yr senior design project in CS, which is better for my tech resume.

2. I could save up for senior housing so I don’t have to worry about rent senior year. I had to do that this year and it wasn’t fun. I’d rather focus on academics senior year and work minimal hours.

3. Since I transferred into CS I only have one Software Engineering internship. If I get one in Spring and next summer, I’d have three internship experiences which I think would be valuable. I would graduate with three internship experiences and a software engineering senior design project.

4. I wouldn’t have to worry about school. I’d do side projects or focus on strengthning my physical and mental health outside of work.

4.5. I’ll be able to explore software engineering and product management hopefully. I’m interested in AR/VR ( hololens, oculus, daydream etc.)as well as gaming (I’d love to work on Xbox)and AI. More internships would mean more exploring career wise.

Doing an internship CONS:

1.  I’d graduate one semester later.

2.  Securing an internship for the spring might be difficult. There aren’t many tech companies where my family lives (Portland, ME) so I’d ideally like to find a company like my current one that either gives corporate housing or gives a housing stipend. 

3. I might be lonely interning out of season 

Question One: 

For those of you who have studied abroad or interned off season, how was your experience and would you recommend one over the other?

Question Two:

Is interviewing for an off season internship harder, easier or just the same as a summer internship? When does the interview process begin and how long was it before you received an offer?

Any advice is welcome, thank you for your patience in reading my question 🤗"
cbbsqm,7,2019-07-10,Feeling stressed I am not performing well enough in internship?,throwawayintern10000,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cbbsqm/feeling_stressed_i_am_not_performing_well_enough/,"Hi guys, 

A little background: 
I’ve been at my software engineering internship for about a month now at a fairly large company. My actual team consists of (including me) 6 engineers, 2 QAs, 1 scrum master, a product owner and manager. The team itself is rather small. One of our engineers has been there since forever, and I more or less report to him when I have questions. I just graduated college from a decent school with a degree in CS and Math. 

I started off really really strong. My first 2-3 weeks were amazing. I set the bar really high. I ended up adding features to our project that are used heavily by the user. They wanted me to do a very small part of it, and to get a feel for the back end. I just kept at it though and they kept throwing me more pieces of the ticket. Eventually it was tested by QA and went into the release. I got tons of praise. My bosses bosses boss called me telling me how wonderful I’m doing and how impressive I am. I got messages by fellow engineers in a different location telling me I’m super solid and to keep up the really good work. You know, I am on cloud nine. And to be fair, the legacy code is massive and looking back on it, I am extremely proud of the features I added because they were critical. 

Okay, that’s back end. That’s what college taught me. Now they had me work on the front end stuff. Again, I picked things up fairly quickly, and started making an impact cleaning up the UI. Fixed some various bugs. More praise. 

But the past week or so, idk man. It just feels weird. I had a problem the past few days and I burned a lot of time trying to fix a more in depth front end bug. I ended up working together with the lead engineer for like 4 hours on it. We thought it was fixed. Nope. QA sent it back. I fix it again. It broke something else. I just kept fixing stuff and breaking other things and it turned out there was some discrepancy in behavior between my code and what was being merged, because I never cleared my cache and we’re dealing with CSS. Long story short, I think everything is perfect on my local machine and then these buggy implementation makes its way into the build and QA tests it and then my product owner sees it’s broken and it just makes me look bad. I took the time to fix it, and then I made sure it didn’t break anything else, but because I never cleared my cache I wasn’t seeing what everyone else was seeing. End result, im telling people it’s fixed, and it’s not. And not only that, but then other people start adding in saying not only is it not fixed but it broke other things. 

I felt A LOT of heat the past day or two. Once I finally cleared my cache though and I was on the same page with everyone... I got a working fix and QA is happy and we’re good now. But damn it makes me look bad and I had set the bar so high. I really need this return offer, and I know I’m acting overly paranoid but for 3 months I just need to be as perfect as possible, and idk. I also feel like I ask too many questions to my lead engineer. I can’t tell if being too hand holdy sometimes. I know expectations for an intern is low but they pay well, and I personally expect to produce at a high level, and I take pride in that. 

But damn I just sit here feeling anxious that I’m messing up. Like I set the bar high to begin with and I’m slippin...? 

Thx for listening to my rant/ ramble."
cbcgm3,20,2019-07-10,TIFU by letting this dude sublet my room,glencocoisrealmate,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cbcgm3/tifu_by_letting_this_dude_sublet_my_room/,"This happened throughout the month, and is still ongoing. But it started the beginning of June. 
I have subletted my bedroom as I have been away for the whole summer and didn't really wanna pay rent 'cause poor. 

Anyway, we found this guy off a facebook group. We met up with him in the beginning of June and he seemed decent, he was insistent on taking my bedroom 'cause he needed a place ASAP, so I decided ""aight you got it"". I've left, he moved in, my roommate is left in our apartment with him. Fast forward to today. I have received a complaint every week from my roommate just telling me the stupid things that this guy has done in the apartment.

So just to give a background for the guy, he's 22, he's from India, and he's just here for an internship for the summer. And as he had introduced himself to us, he's apparently from a ""rich family"". Oh how did I not see that being ""rich"" lead to these stupid catastrophes. 

First week of him habitating in our loverly home, I've heard the most bizarre thing a supposedly normal human being has done in a kitchen. The guy apparently does not know how to cook nor use a stove. Like a fucking caveman and that's an insult to the caveman. My roommate came home to smoke coming from the kitchen. The guy was cooking raw vegetables on the element. A fucking carrot, a fucking lettuce, a fucking tomato. On the element. Of course the motherfucking vegetable burned. The guy was nowhere to be found. He left the household with vegetables being burnt to death on the stove. An A-list idiot this guy is. 

First week .5, guy uses the bathroom and hangs his used clothes, like underwear, in the rack. Seems perfectly normal right? Ha, no. Guy doesn't wipe his ass. His underwear had shit. It ain't even stains. It was literal shit. And he hung that literal piece of shit beside the hand towel. The best part was when I confronted him. 
""Hey buddy that's pretty disgusting, it's a common bathroom so please keep your underwear in your room and don't leave it hanging in the bathroom""
""Oh sorry I was gonna wear it again I didn't mean to leave it there""
Alright that's how you roll. No problem. But I don't want shit stains on my door.

Right, he also goes into my roommate's room without permission. Roommate just found the guy in his room one random night. (EDIT)

Second week. He seemed to improve after being lectured. He stopped using the element as a device for cooking. He moved on to the microwave. Still putting raw ass vegetables in there. Full vegetables, not peeled, not sliced. Imagine a whole carrot just being microwaved for two hours. Two hours guys. That's how he cooked his bloody food. Not much of an issue, he's got a stale dinner, so we let that go. 

Third week and I still get complaints and calls from my roommate. The guy doesn't wash his plates and seems to expect somebody else will clean it, which my dumbass roommate does 'cause we eventually ran out of plates. Guy was doing laundry and expected and asked for me to provide him the laundry soap (which, to me, not my responsibility. I ain't a hotel. It's a sublet)

Fourth week now and the newest issue: he managed to turn the bath tub black. The bathroom is filled with shaved hair on the floor. His trash is just in the hallway and he doesn't take it out of the house... As if he expects a maid. 

I can only imagine my roommate's stress. I'm pissed everytime my roomate shows me how our apartment is trashed. And funnily enough, I confronted the guy and told him he has to be responsible for the apartment and keep it clean. And his response to every issue I have stated here was ""what's the issue there?"" 


TL;DR 
I subletted my room to a guy who claims he is from a rich family. Guy drives my roommate crazy by cooking raw vegetables on the stove element which coukd have burned our house down, microwaving same said food for two hours, hangs his underwear filled with shit in the bathroom, leaves his trash in the hallway... Guy clearly expects somebody to act like a maid and do everything for him."
cbcmtx,10,2019-07-10,TIFU by nicknaming a co-worker whose name I couldn't pronounce.,FriskeeRL,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cbcmtx/tifu_by_nicknaming_a_coworker_whose_name_i/,"Aight so, this was during my design internship, in a small town called Chennai, in India. After designing I had to make prototypes. Took me a while to find all the parts and then had to machine them and assemble.

There was this friendly mechanic guy who was ready to spend some time helping me, so I thought that was real nice of him. He took time out of his already busy schedule to help a random intern finish his work, with clearly no selfish motivation. So, to return the favour, I went and told the engineering team that this guy had been really helpful. Apparently, he's really good with his work and got a promotion that week. They gave him a job of costing and billing products coming into the factory. I was delighted for him and he still helped me with machining and all that.

Also key thing to mention is that in my mind I give these people nicknames cause I can't remember or pronounce their names. Chennai has a local language, (Tamil) which I don't know. Their culture is different, and my diction is not sophisticated enough to pronounce their names. 

So my slutty mentor got the nickname *crime of fashion*, you know, like *crime of passion*. I was quite satisfied with that one.

So I had to give this guy a nickname as well, and since he was standing near the entry gate and making bills.... I started calling him Bill Gates.

Now crime of fashion is a difficult nickname to use, so I rarely did, but Bill Gates kinda stuck. So, nearing the end of the internship I was talking to a guy from the engineering team, and he asked me if I knew where that dude was. I didn't recognize the name but I instinctively said 'Bill Gates?'. The dude from engineering took a moment to get it, but then he started roaring with laughter and told all his colleagues.

Every time I walked into the engineering room after that, there will be at least one guy who points at me, and says something in Tamil to a colleague and I catch 'Bill Gates' in the sentence.

I feel terrible, I've just left the company, and I didn't even get a chance to apologize.

Tl;dr Gave a coworker a smart-ass nickname that stuck, as I left the company."

I am currently a 4th year student and this is the first internship that I've taken in the middle of the summer. To start off, this small company created a data analyst internship position for the first time (which is what i'm doing). They have no current senior or prior data analysts to give me concrete guidance. I do have a supervisor, however as far as technical skills used to do my job he has limited knowledge in. They told me that I'm basically a test subject and part of their business plan on hiring a professional data analyst... they pay pretty well, the company is definitely growing, and the environment is great however I feel like they do not understand what hiring an intern entails and what is expected from them.

I understand my priorities and tasks given by the company, but I feel overwhelmed because there is no one with the experience in these languages that I know to help me use them. I am comfortable using SQL to do these data manipulations but there is no database for me to work off of, and I have no clue on how to create one or If I'm even suppose to be doing that. At this point, I have to re-learn excel to do my job and have to leave behind using SQL or Python.

Most of the day so far at work I am spending on how to use Excel and manipulate the data that they want me to. They want me to work on a few projects and deliver a dashboard but really, again, no one is helping me do that. Any suggestions or insights? I feel very overwhelmed to the point that I want to cry."

I’ve been basically self learning programming over the last few years because my classes barely taught me anything.

However, I realize that now my self learning is going to be serious, and I’m going to have peers with serious skills.

I love programming and all things CS related, so I definitely plan to keep learning. However, I feel like I need to get a better grip on things.

I am bad with words and English is not my native language so this might be long, a bit messy and weird to read, sorry for that, I want to give as much info as possible to get a helpful response and also get my thoughts straight for the first time. A lot of things I write here I haven't been able to tell anyone IRL yet, so I also use this post to start building the confidence to talk about this.  


I'm diagnosed with **depression**, and my current therapist said I was also strong in the **anxiety** column and considered **bipolar**, both of which have never been brought up to me before, but could be true.

I have noticed **dissociative** symptomes on myself, but haven't felt comfortable to tell him about it, but this has been confirmed by another therapist and a psychology student who brought it up in a conversation on some experiences.

Also while reading and searching for help online I stumbled on different writings mentioning **BPD (borderline)** or **HPD (histrionic)** as a source for some of my symptoms. This has never been brought up to any professional yet, so I still have the fear of not knowing and the hope to not having to deal with a personality disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

I often feel like I'm the problem, and I'm the toxic one in my relationships. When I get into ""fights"" with my mother in law because I told the truth, and my partner then expects me to apologize but not his mother. Since this happens regularily I feel like I'm the problem here.  
When I get into arguments with friends I often tend to get passive-aggressive and emotionally abusive.

I have trouble regulating my anger and other emotions. When I'm in a bad mood I try to keep it out of unrelated topics especially not projecting it onto my partner who hasn't done anything wrong. I fail at this often and make him sad which in turn makes me sad, and I don't know what he could do to help me...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't open up to others easily to tell them what is going on and how I feel etc. I feel lke I can't trust people and to not rely on others. I was bullied in school and let down by several people including the teachers who didn't stop it. I applied for internships and didn't get a reply even after it was promised at the end of an interview. I asked a former teacher to help me with translating my internship contract into English. He promised to bring it to Germany with him. He didn't. I feel like I'm not worthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Most recently I'm struggling to write my final paper. I don't know where and how to start the writing (not the research work) and that takes my motivation; I feel like I'm incapable and like a failure. I spend the days wasting my time trying to write, finding mental health professionals that I feel comfortable contacting, or trying to find help on reddit or other online sources. Sometimes I try to do all of this at once because I can't focus on one topic long enough to finish it. I already got up to get something to drink, something to eat, let my pets out, or wander around for no other reason than I felt restless and too agitated to continue sitting still, I was bored or couldn't concentrate anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I'm suicidal, but the only reason why I don't consider actually doing it is my partner. I love him and I don't want to hurt him, but I also don't think he understands me, and I sometimes wish we would just break up and he could move on from me and no longer have such a burden.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I don't know what else to write... I can't focus anymore and feel like I'm not even really there.

will the cs courses i choose for my upper level requirements really help me a lot to the point where i should take them? or can i take more math ish courses and still get away with being just as competitive as someone who didn’t?

Apologies for the long read in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

I've graduated anywhere between 18 months and 24ish months ago. I am not exactly sure when my official graduation date is, because I defended my final year project in May, but had to do a resit in August, and got my diploma at the end of November that same year(bachelors MEng). Again, not exactly sure what my official graduation date is, so I'd appreciate if someone could shed a light.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, after defending my project successfully I was absolutely burned out and in complete state of dread that I've failed my degree. This lasted until the middle of June, at which point I started to face more pressing issues - almost no money, no job, no prospect of a graduate job considering I didnt even know what my diploma would be (ended up with a 2:1, only didnt get compensation for a first because of the resit that was 1/24 of the total credits for the year).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At that point I was struggling to even get a reply for non skilled jobs and I was really desperate. Around middle of July I started working nights in a warehouse and stayed there until the end of the year.It was literally the only job I got an interview for. The job was absolutely devastating, extremely labour intensive,55 hours a week and I had to cycle for an hour and a half every day to and from work.Last 9 kilograms during that time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the following year I had to take a month off after quitting because of exhaustion and tried to get into the graduate job hunting process again , but the measly savings I had were quickly running out and I found myself jobhunting for any type of job again without much success.Realistically I spend a 5 weeks recovering Jan-Feb, and 6 or so weeks trying to refresh my knowledge from university(managed to even build up a small portfolio of CAD drawings, but had no success with applications, not that I was confident enough to send out that many resumes). At the end of April that year I started another warehouse job, nights again, better conditions. However, in July my partner had to leave me alone in the flat so she could finish her degree, and after she came back in October she struggled to get a job. Essentially I was the single earner in the household until around Christmas and had to face all bills and rent alone, meaning I was doing quite a lot of overtime.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Got laid off 10 days ago from the current warehouse and now I am trying to make some sense of what has happened this past year and a half and how this could impact me. In all honestly, time flows differently when you're working nights and it is just now that I realise how much time has passed....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So the big question is - is there any hope for finding a graduate job? Assuming I make it to interviews ( currently revising/doing aptitude test training, etc) do you think hiring managers will be understanding to my situation or will this massive gap be something I wont be able to overcome?

&amp;#x200B;

Before you ask - no internships. Applied and got offers in my third year, but didnt have 2-3k for flights to China...

Wasnt able to actively seek out opportunities in the final year because I was really struggling. The previous two years I had to work part time nights and this impacted me very negatively  in the fourth year, because I've had to skip classes due to work in years two and three, which meant I had to work extra hard to pass my exams and finish my project during the final year. In the end the hard work did pay off, as my project received excellent marks and got an ImechE award for it, but thats about the only positive thing I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

No interships;

Had to get shitty jobs after graduating;

1.5-2 years have passed;

How fucked am I?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice will be much appreciated."
cbgv7y,3,2019-07-10,Internship,freespirit22,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/cbgv7y/internship/,Hi I want to get an internship with one of the big4 next summer. Anyone have advice or tips to ensure I can get the role
cbgwu4,2,2019-07-10,What to focus on once I have my degree?,florvas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cbgwu4/what_to_focus_on_once_i_have_my_degree/," So I recently graduated with my Bachelor of Applied Science in Application Development from a local technical college near Seattle. I'm aware this degree's title, along with the lack of ABET accreditation, may raise eyebrows on occasion, but between my crap grades in high school and the fact that I had to save up for seven years to go to college at all, I figured it'd do the trick if I worked hard. And work hard, I did. Finished up with a 3.9 overall (3.96 if you take out the gen ed nonsense), went well above and beyond for my final project, and I've been contributing on GitHub as I'm able, focusing as best I can on acquiring best practices since I know learning solo can build bad habits, and my school certainly didn't spend much time going over what is considered a best practice.  


I also acquired a semi-relevant job while in school. The school's Learning Resource and Career Center had a sub-department that provided student-run, free computer repair services for staff, faculty, and students. I spent a year doing that, and even spent six months being the ""SysAdmin"" for their database. The quotation marks are there because the database was through MS access, was awful, and most of my ""admin"" duties involved simply debugging random issues that came up. I then assisted in the migration to a MySQL database that was cleaner, and quit to focus on my current day job. This job is listed on my resume as a ""Database Administrator Internship"" at the recommendation of a recruiter I spoke to while finishing up my AAS-T.

I'm now finished and looking for work though, and I as far as things of note I have:

* My questionably-titled four-year degree with a heavy focus on C# and OOP, and light focus on DB Dev and responsive web dev.
* The internship as far as experience goes
* A single, simple, practical project I've been fiddling with for the last four months, as well as forty pages of documentation for it (including TOR, CRC, simple use and case studies, team charter since it was initially a team project, etc). I've been fiddling with additional beginner projects too, and uploading results to my github. 

Now that that's done, I find myself at odds as to what I should focus on next. My education has left me feeling woefully under-prepared for any real software development job (my goal). I can build an application, and I know the basics, but the thought of what I don't know is staggering. I've put in some applications despite this, but (as I kinda expected), I'm not hearing back from anyone just yet.

So with those details in mind, my question boils down to this: should I focus on putting in job applications, or hold off? And if I hold off, should I focus on my portfolio, or expanding my education and possibly acquiring a certification or two? And if the latter, any recommendations as to which ones?"
cbh7kp,2,2019-07-10,Applying while working internship,ff7fanfolife,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cbh7kp/applying_while_working_internship/,"Hey everyone. I have recently been applying to positions for the fall while i am working my summer internship... My summer internship experience this summer is vital to getting my next internship field. I was wondering if you guys think its appropriate to apply for other internships while working one.

Whats your take? Acceptable to put on resume or not?"
cbh9k7,1,2019-07-10,I [M19] am in a long distance relationship with [F19] and need some advice,randomguy1970,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cbh9k7/i_m19_am_in_a_long_distance_relationship_with_f19/,"So me and let’s just call her Emma first met at university about a month before school let out for the summer. Everything was going great. We studied together, went on dates, and did stuff physically except sex. Emma also wouldn’t let me do anything below the waist on her because we technically weren’t dating yet and she is super against just hook ups. 

But during this time she didn’t want me to tell people that we were seeing each other because a senior in my fraternity tried and failed to date her and she didn’t want to hurt his feelings. I don’t know if this is just odd to me but Emma is the type of girl where a guy can try to cuff for months and, if she’s not interested, is not afraid to reject them every single time. That’s why when I first got to kiss her I saw that as a huge win in my book and knew I wasn’t getting friend zoned.

Anyways fast forward to the end of the school year. We both know that the long distance is going to suck and tried to find a best way to approach it for the both of us. I asked her if she wanted to be exclusive around a week before school let out and surprisingly...she said no. Which was odd to me at first considering this girl is super against hookups. Even drunk at a party—this girl will not hookup with you if you’re not dating her. Emma’s reasoning for this is that she said that she didn’t want to feel like we were obligated to talk to each other over summer. She said that if feelings fade it will be natural and we can hopefully start again next semester. Which I guess makes sense to me since I also didn’t want to have a forced conversation to stay in touch. I trusted that the reason she didn’t want to be exclusive was for this fact only and not cause she was going to see other people.

Start of summer everything was fine. We were texting everyday and facetiming whenever we got a chance. This went on for about a month until her internship started. Then things started to get a little more busy and she didn’t have that much time to call anymore. We went from around calling 3-4 times a week to calling 1-2 times a week. (Also some very important information I left out: there is a 15 hour time difference between us). Partially because I was more free, I started to put in a lot more effort to not lose her. (I.e. waking up at 6am to talk to her). I didn’t mind this that much as long as she was happy with talking to me. One day we plan to come back to school early. She has to fly into nyc so I said I’ll meet her there and we decided to stay there for a day together and drive back to campus together. 

*I’m just going to include this brief anecdote cause idk if it’s important or not. But there was a time during the first month of summer when she posted on her finsta a joke about her being single and I got mad cause I didn’t think how she was able to say that she was single even though we were still talking at the time. When I told her about this she said she didn’t mean it like that and that she knows that we have a “thing” but isn’t going say we are dating cause technically we are not. We had another similar argument about this later on because she is very serious about the dating label.*

Anyways back to the story. I end up booking us a hotel room for one night in nyc and everything is cool. We go on calling for around 1-2 times a week but still texting everyday. However with her internship and the 15 hour time difference, things are getting harder. 

Around a week ago things started not to seem right. She was being very “bleh” with her texts and whenever I asked her if she was free to call she was usually out but wouldn’t suggest a different time. I just let this go since I knew she was busy.

About 2 days ago this “bleh” stuff is still going on and I decide to talk to her about the hotel in nyc. (Something minor like about the booking). When I bring this up she tells me that she might not want to stay with me in the hotel room. I got super hurt by this because I am taking a 5 hour detour from my normal route to school to see her in the city and now she’s saying she didn’t want to stay with me. She said she might feel uncomfortable sharing a room with me. At first I got mad then I realized that I guess it might be a little uncomfortable when we first see each other since we’ve been apart for a while—let alone sleep in the same bed together. Regardless I felt really hurt.

We had a rough conversation about this and during this talk she says that her feelings for me have been starting to fade. This kind of came out of the blue for me and really hurt. My last relationship I was in was very one sided from my end and I was scared it was going to happen again. Emma said that it was natural for feelings to fade  but it didn’t seem like there was anything we could do to stop it and we should just try to revive it when we see each other again. From there I decided that I couldn’t do another one sided thing because my feelings for her were still the same. So I told her that I think that we should talk for a little bit. At least until we are closer to when school starts or her feelings change.

So that’s where I’m at now. Laying in bed sad cause I’m not talking to her and knowing that her feeling for me are fading and there’s nothing I can do about it. Is this no talking thing a bad idea on my part? I feel like I couldn’t talk to her the same way if I knew that she didn’t like me that much anymore and I still like her. I don’t know what to do.


TL;DR: meet girl month before school ends. She tells me her feelings are fading over long distance. I get sad and don’t wanna talk to her anymore because I don’t want to be in a one sided thing."

The first week was  just setting up everything and brushing up my Java skills because the company works with an own Java Framework which I've never seen before. 

Because of that I doing a developer training this week and I'm completly lost. The first day was quite okay, but now after day three I have a hard time following the pace. The trainer which also happens to be my team leader shows a concept and all participants get an assignment which will include the shown concepts. 
I'm the only intern there and the way the trainer flies through the IDE and the fact that I have never seen stuff like that is very frustrating to me. I am not able to grasp a concept and write code right away with the trainer in my neck. Is this field not for me or am I overreacting? 

The Confluence page for new hires says that there are atleast 2 weeks after the training for getting confortable with the code. What should I do? I pulled an all nighter last night just to follow up the curriculum of the training."

I am seeking advice for the next step(s) in my career. I currently work as an SDET/Automation Engineer hybrid at a startup. Work is easy, but quite boring. And couple that with the fact that i want to be SWE instead of testing, you can imagine my discontent. I graduated from undergrad couple months ago with a BS in Math and have been working for this company, internship and full-time, for about a year.

I took around 5 CS courses in my undergrad though (Data structures, algos, programming languages, DBMS, AI) and have been applying for SWE jobs, but many requires x amount of year of experience or require knowledge in frameworks and languages (i would say i am comfortably proficient in Java only) I do not know. Moreover, I have been rejected by plenty. I got accepted into a certificate program (need to take 4 courses in 9 months) that fast tacks into a MS in CS with a specialization in SWE. The biggest takeaway is that I partake in 6 month long industry sponsored project. In the end, it will take around 3 years, including the certificate.

I have interest in getting a masters because I wasn't able to get a CS education and study with a cohort and such during my undergrad. However, 3 years (I would be 25 at the end of this) would be a huge time sink to then start my first SWE job.

During the certificate program, which is meant for part-time people, I would still be working at my current job.  

Should I just bite the bullet and keep on applying and such? Or should I spend these 3 years getting a higher education? Should I take the certificate and keep applying for SWE jobs? What are your thoughts if you were in my shoes?"

On the computer side I have taken data structures and I am proficient in programming in different languages. 


I am looking to get a fall internship but have had no luck so far. I applied to around 110 companies around the country and received 8 interviews.  All my interviews were through phone or skype. Some of them made me interview multiple times or take online assessments.  I have applied to large corporations and small startups. I have 3.2 GPA , one semester EE research experience, and experience of working a data entry job at a local physical plant.  I also had a web developing internship last summer at a local organization. I am kind of getting depressing with receiving all these emails that begin with ""thank you but we have found a better candidate..."" I am not sure what to do now.

My company has a very small IT department with no real room for growth and I honestly probably have more general knowledge about computers than my manager so I feel like I'm not really learning anything and in many cases I feel like I'm learning tons of bad practices.

NYC is expensive and I really feel like I'm worth more than 50k especially in this area but I don't even know what I should be aiming for anymore. Right after college I was originally looking for a Software Engineering/Dev job but didn't have much luck other than doing a web dev internship so I took what I could get.

**Stats:**

* **SAT :** 1550 (790 Math, 760 English)
* **GPA :** Weighted- 5.3/6; unweighted- 4.
* I'm in a hella competitive school so I didn't get ranked in the top 10%. F. Though my HS doesn't rank after the 10% percent mark, I'm certain that I am at least top 20%
* Senior load is 5 APs rn, otherwise well rounded
* It's worthy to note that my grades really improved as time went by- went from a freshmen taking 1 regular and all honors (a huge blow to my GPA now) to taking 5 APs in junior year and getting A- all round.
* I plan on taking the SAT subject tests for physics and math soon, expect atleast a 750

**APs Taken:**

* Major related APs I have will have taken by the time I graduate: Computer Science, Stats, Physics 1, Physics 2, Calc AB and BC, Chemistry. So far, my AP scores have been ranging from 4s and 5s.

* Founder and president of school's Artificial Intelligence club (11th-12th)- have about 30 members, we have local workshops and coding classes, and have had guest speakers from IBM and Fidelity
* Writer and photographer at my school newspaper- [https://coppellstudentmedia.com/](https://coppellstudentmedia.com/) (Check it out!) We are ranked as one of the nations best HS newspapers, I have personally won a couple of state awards for some of my stories.
* National Honors Society / National French Honors Society (hon-hon)
* Member of the computer science club
* Model United Nations (All years)
* Played kinda high level select soccer up until junior year for the Texans
* Volunteering isn't my strong suit, but I have around 50 hours helping out homeless folks in downtown Dallas, thinking about making a startup with my friends that delivers leftover food from restaurants to the homeless.

**Jobs:**

* Youth and Adult soccer referee for around 4 years
* Paid internship at my local newspaper, covering sports and stuff

**Coding:**

* Coded in the AI club, took a 40 hour long Python course and a Machine-Learning course, so I'm decently fluent in Python and working with neural networks-

Also had situations where they were suprised by Solutions I provided and told me that I beat the Consultants they had to consult them in VBA related Topics (and most of their Code is in pretty bad shape, so I guess I might be the only one in the company with a decent understanding of VBA programming).

Other then programming with VBA (automating tasks and cleaning existing code) and administrating the development of new and better excel tools, i'm taking care of monthly cost reports of all of our projects and sometimes they give me something to take care of in SAP. The thing is that I'm really good at VBA/ Excel but feel weak at all the other tasks they give me (though they never mentioned any criticism or anything like that, even when I could not finish Reports as I am in the office for only 15 Hours per week max.). Often I struggle with tasks other than Excel/ VBA related and on these ocasions one can clearly see my insecurity.


So Right now I'm in this job for around 4 months. I have a flexible time schedule where I can decide when to come and how many hours to work. They pay me 12.5€/hour.
Eventually my friends started to wonder why I'm being payed only 12€ as I already have a bachelors degree (economics, grade 2.1) at hand (+ a 6 month internship) and I clearly seem to add value to their company. At first I did not bother with the pay as I needed something to pay my bills but now I'm also starting to wonder if this is what I should be getting. The problem is that I'm worrying about things I'm weak at hell a lot more than I'm able to be pround of things I'm actually good at.


So would you advise to ask for a raise? Does it even make any sense for someone in my position? What would be the best way to do it?


tldr: Student, working in accounting/ financial department (12.5€/h) and being good at VBA programing and excel, being bad/ average at everything else. Never heard any criticism/ bad Feedback, only good Feedback and how my abilities are well suited for that field. Feeling insecure at work (due to social anxiety maybe i guess, dunno). Should I be asking for a raise or changing company for a better pay?

cbmsul,1,2019-07-10,Future US Grad school plan with low CGPA,sinus_lebastian,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/cbmsul/future_us_grad_school_plan_with_low_cgpa/,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am actually looking for an option to see even I can do grad school. I am a computer engineering major at UBC which is considered one of the top 3 Canadian schools. But our engineering department is pretty disorganized, and I did have some bad profs whose class average was really low. I also suffered mental health issues in the midst of my semester. Not to mention, I did spend a lot of time acquiring various skills such as Node.js, React, etc which helped me land good internships at medium-sized companies as well as offers from very large companies (Like Ontario Power Generation which has around 16 thousand employees), but that is the time I could spend to get better grades as well, especially in my electrical engineering classes where I did poorly. All these things killed my GPA and currently, I have close to 3.0, and since I only have 4 semesters left, I am assuming I will most probably be able to make it to a 3.1 or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, my plan is to after graduation, work 4-5 years in the industry, especially big companies like Amazon, Microsoft or something like that (I am already started preparing for their internship interview), as well as get some research experience working after office hours with some profs. I already have 1 year of internship experience and plan to get 1 more year of the internship experience, and so by the time I will be applying to US grad school, I will have 6-7 years of industry experience as well as some research experience. I also plan to nail my GRE, and hopefully will be able to secure good letters of recommendation.

&amp;#x200B;

At this stage, I am not targetting for top-notch programs, but anything that is ranked between 50-200 in the World University ranking in the US would be my preference. My preferred subject would be either Computer Science with Machine Learning or Data Science with Machine Learning.

&amp;#x200B;

I am mostly interested in MS, not Ph.D.  

&amp;#x200B;

At this stage, I was wondering, is this plan even realistic? Or should I abandon all grad school hope and just focus on getting really great at job skills (like learning new skills such as react, mobile app development, etc which I really enjoy as well). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read and answer these questions."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 17 year old high school student who is interested in pursuing cyber security after high school. I currently have: A+, Net+, Sec+, CySa+, and as of yesterday a CISSP associate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very lucky in that my school has a program that pays for students certifications. I am going into senior year and as long as I attend the school, they will pay for cert test vouchers (unless you fail you have to reimburse them but I haven't failed anything yet lol). Is there any other certs you would recommend getting while I can get them for free?

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I work at my school as a summer tech intern, I am trying to get experience as I realize that certs don't mean much without work experience. I can't get hired at too many places right now due to my age but when I am 18 I want to start working in a position relevant to cyber security (for experience &amp; I need to meet the CISSP requirements to get fully certified). 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any advice for me regarding what I should look for as far as jobs go? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated, thanks."

I have a relatively short rant/question. I’m heading into my 4th and final year of college but didn’t end up getting an internship this summer. I got 2 very very underwhelming offers (one offer was unpaid) and ended up denying them both. I’m afraid that I absolutely boned myself for the future. Graduating college with no internship experience will make it much harder for me to get a job.

What should I do to bolster my resume since I didn’t get any internships? What will make me look like a more attractive candidate for CS jobs? I’m terrified that I went through almost 4 years of school for no job after I graduate because I don’t have internship experience."

Title is basically my situation, I have no specific thing I have attached myself to and I would like some guidance as to cool places to look. Obvs T20s and high esteem schools are neat but some ideas for safeties would be REALLY helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographic:**

Rising senior, *(basically white)* Russian Jewish *(ethnically, not really religiously)* female, from a well known and highly successful magnet in an LA public school *(like this program sends people to T20s every year, and to a bunch of the high level UCs, but the school itself is standard decent public school, with a heavy low income population. Though it has multiple distinct programs aside from mine)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Income Bracket:**

150k-200k *(I don't expect any need-based aid, maybe some merit, though obviously I'd still like some)*

&amp;#x200B;

**GPA:**

4.015 W *(school district)*

3.815 UW *(school district)*

4.417 W *(UC system)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Course load:**

Heavy in honors and APs, with some weirdos. Mostly As, with a few Bs, only one a semester except for one 20 week where there were 2.

*Weirdo Classes*

* Spanish 1 in middle school *(It was a cool option, some come in every year advanced in Spanish by 1/2 years)*
* H Algebra 1 in middle school *(almost the entire program does this due to feeder middle schools also being magnet)*
* Geometry over summer *(I started the magnet thing late and didn't take it in middle school like most others)*
* Health over summer *(almost the entire program does this)*

*Honors Classes*

* H English 9
* H Algebra 2

*AP Classes:*

* See all below. I've never taken a class without the test.

&amp;#x200B;

**APs taken:**

Junior Year

* Calculus AB (*4)*
* English Language and Composition (*5)*
* Seminar (*3) (GAAAHH I KNOW 60% OF THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE AP GOT A 3 BUT I THOUGHT I DID BETTER)*
* Spanish Language and Culture (*5)*
* United States History (*4)*

Sophomore Year

* European History (*3)*
* Physics 1 (3)

Freshman Year

* Biology (*4)*
* World History (*4)* 

&amp;#x200B;

**SAT:**

1490  *and not super interested in a retake.*  

* 710 Writing
* 780 Math

Spanish SSAT: 620/800  *and planning to retake with listening in November*

US History SSAT: 700/800

*I'm thinking of taking Math 2 and maybe Literature (idk just cuz) in November. Should I?*

&amp;#x200B;

**ECs:**

1.  Animal Rescue Club (Secretary for two years) *(I have like 75+ volunteer hours from this)*
2.  Tabletop Gaming Club (President for one year, Player for four, Dungeon Master for one) 
3.  Archery (Secretary for one year, Copresident for one year) *(Have competed, have done poorly every time)*
4.  Speech And Debate (Varsity Member and Peer coach) 
5.  Volunteering at cat shelters (50+ hours) *(At two diff shelters)*
6.  Jewish Student Union 
7.  Gender Sexuality Alliance (Treasurer for two years) 
8.  AP Seminar *(Non A-G course, so it's special on the common app. It's a research class)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards:** *(\*cue hiss of pain\*)*

1. Honor Roll every year
2. Novice 3rd place in Impromptu, Novice 7th place in Congress, Certificate of Excellence in Spar *(Speech and Debate stuff. All happened my first year in the club, the year afterwards the club feel apart without enough experienced leaders. It's still around but only the dedicated actually compete, and I don't have any attachment to the club anymore)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential Majors:** 

***(Undecided AF buuuut if I had to say)*** *(Feel free to make suggestions! Anything not explicitly science/English I'll take a look at)*

Human Resources or Accounting . . . basically any business major EXCEPT entrepreneurship. 

Maybe a minor/major in Spanish since I've committed five years to it and am somehow doing well.

International studies?? IDK seems a good combo of language skills + interesting business/opportunities to do cool stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays:**

Uuuuuhhhh probably me talking about how I'm super social and outgoing but have major issues with my memory which drastically affects my perception of the world and generally feeling like I am not close to people. *(I know Yikes TM I'll clean it up and make it sound inspiring don't worry)* Stuff about my various clubs and how I collect titles/responsibilities like stamps and how I feel about it/lessons I've learned from it *(About like letting go of things or how to help the people who rely on you).* Idk I'm a decent writer I'll come up with things. Though I haven't lived an incredibly difficult life unless I get real personal about family dynamics which is a risky and scary move.

&amp;#x200B;

**Letters of Rec:**

1. English Teacher who writes basically half the letters of rec for the program, and who I've had tons of time and classes with, so likely very good.
2. *(I'm guessing it'll be him unless another teacher likes me so much they ask to do it instead)* Science teacher who I've had for two years in both an AP and a much more relaxed Honors class. He also writes tons of LoRs for the program and generally likes me, so likely good as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Preferences:** *(Basically what I might want in a college. This will be awkward and vague, sorry) NOT RANKED BY PRIORITY*

* Warm weather area *(though this isn't that important since many good colleges are places with snow for most of the year T-T*
* Takes AP credits *(again not required, but I took so many I'd like to see some more payoff. But again, am willing to skip)*
* Large(r) school *(I like people and having options on where to go/what to do/ who to do it with)*
* Education quality prioritized over party scene/school spirit *(I hate the taste of alcohol, and generally don't care about spirit events. I want something with good teachers and classes first)*
* Archery *(Doesn't have to be a team, could be a club, idk I've done it for a while casually so I kinda wana continue)*
* Internship or international study options
   * On that note, work-study programs would be neat too
* I haven't done enough research to have any feeling about Liberal Arts colleges"
cbnza5,84,2019-07-10,Interview has an interesting twist,gamageeknerd,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cbnza5/interview_has_an_interesting_twist/,"I’m currently an intern at a big tech company and as of late it’s been made clear only 3 interns are getting hired on full time out of a group of 15. I’m skeptical of my chances of being hired on full time so I started putting out feelers and applications to places I had existing connections. It’s all been great and due to my unique skill set I’ve gotten a few on phone interviews and one or two in person interviews. 

One of them is for a startup a professor of mine told me about. He said it was founded by one his best students and they were doing something cool. 

I get a recommendation from him and get in direct contact with the founder who then gives me all these reasons why they are cool and changing the world. It sounded really great and he was willing  to wait until my summer internship was over to get serious about recruiting me. He did however ask me to come in so we could talk about my skills and what I can do with the team. I’m all in and tell him I can see him anytime. 

I get there today and he seems a bit confused but brushes it off and tells me he likes my work and he’s excited about the possibility of us working together. We sit in their big open office setting and he starts quizzing me on what I know and what I can do. This is when things get strange. 

He asks me how long I’ve been working on Ruby which is a language I don’t know and how long I’ve worked with Java. I tell him I do t use Ruby but I’ve used java for a few years. He looks at my GitHub and is impressed to a degree but says he hasn’t seen anything I’ve done recently. 

I’m very confused at this point but I keep answering questions and we eventually get to talking about what he’s doing and what the office is like. 

He is dropping strange little bits of information about what I would be doing and he’s getting more and more detailed about what he would like to have me work on when I can. 

This is when I finally figured it out. He mentions a major tech company in the industry we work in and asks me what I did when I worked there. I just tell him I’ve never worked there to which he replies by opening up his ipad and pulls up my linked in. 

It’s my name but it has a whole list of skills and companies worked at that I’ve never seen. 

He has some other guys linked in up who didn’t have a profile picture and thinks this guy is me. This guy was under the impression I was some seasoned programmer who worked at major companies and wasn’t at all fazed when he heard I was interning at a place over the summer. 

I just had an interview where they interviewed me thinking I was someone else. I got out of there a while after when he asked me questions that were relevant to me and we both left soon after. 

Tldr: got interviewed and the whole time they thought I was someone else."

Hello!

I graduated May,18th with a Bachelor's degree. My fields of study were:

* Business
* Marketing
* Communications

I have a great resume with work experiences along with *volunteer*, *internships*, and *extra curricular activities* listed.

I have been searching and applying what feels like all of Zip Recruiter, Indeed, and LinkedIn, with only 1 interview for a sales job that was falsely advertised. I realize it takes a while for companies to get back with you, however i'm not sure where else to start looking.

I have been looking in Indiana/Michigan for marketing jobs, social media marketing, property management, recruiting/HR, administration/assistant.

I'm beginning to feel hopeless at this point that I haven't found anything, and frustrated that I went through four years of college for nothing.

With my degree what other jobs should I be searching up? At this point I'd be  willing to take a part time job just to be making something.

**TLDR:**

* What sites should I used other than Zip Recruiter &amp; Indeed for job hunting?
* Interesting jobs to search with a Business|Marketing|Communications degree?
* Best/easiest entry level jobs to get start in?

&amp;#x200B;

My family is poor, like really poor my dad used to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet when I was younger. I was always told if I worked really hard got into university and graduated I would get a good job and live a good life but nobody ever told me how expensive doing all of this would be. I tried really hard and I got into university a pretty good one however the tuition is more then I can afford (and this isn't even considering things like housing and food) I somehow managed to get through 3 years by taking out loans and my parents helped out where they could but it was mostly loans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I realized in third year I wasn't going to have enough money to cover all my expenses for another year luckily I got a paid internship, it was a pretty comfy job in IT; it paid well I saved up for school and I even helped out my parents here and there where I could. For my first 3 years of school I lived at my parents house and drove to school (I leased a car) my school is a 2 hour drive from my house and public transportation is not an option (no bus/train lines go there from my house) I couldn't move closer to school because the rent in the area of my school is more than I can afford and also this way I saved on food. I continued to use my car in the summer to drive to work.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

During the last couple of months of my internship my father got cancer and he had to stop working, I was sad of course but to be honest with you I wasn't devastated, I felt uncomfortable, I felt like my reaction to hearing that my father had cancer wasn't a normal reaction I felt like I should have been sadder.  I have a very strange relationship with my father, I never saw him much growing up he was always busy with work and he's always been emotionally distant. He never really did any fatherly bonding stuff that I read in books and hear other people talk about; I guess I can't blame him he had a family to support and other responsibilities but still I feel like he could have taken the 5 minutes to tell me that he loved me or that he was proud of my or anything. During the first month of my father being sick I used all the vacation time I had at work at once, my Mother and I took turns taking him to his doctor's appointments and his chemo sessions I did all of this but honestly it was more out of obligation then love I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say and I feel like a bad person just typing that but it's hard for me to all of the sudden after 23 years of emotional detachment just start showing love. Eventually my father stabilized he had less appointments and things got somewhat more normal. I started going back to work around this time father started complaining to me all the time that I don't check on how he's doing enough or come talk to him enough, I guess that he's lonely now that he stopped working and has to stay in the house for most of the time. I tried to make more of an effort to check up on him and talk to him but it's really hard for me, I felt like I was just faking the emotions. I want to love my father I really do but honestly I just can't I don't know why.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the last month of my internship now, one day I was driving home from work after a long day (I stayed late to work on some stuff) I was really tired and I feel asleep at the wheel. While I was asleep I hit another car, I had to use my insurance to pay for the damages, the damages were significant. Because I'm a young driver and this accident was such a big claim my insurance rates sky rocketed, I am now stuck in a lease that I can't get out of and an insurance rate that I can't possibly continue to pay for; when my internship ends and I have to go back to school I have no idea how I'm going to pay for everything. I tried getting another loan but I got denied they're not going to give me any more money, I tried extending my internship but that didn't work either they have an agreement with my school that the internship was only for a certain period of time they can't rehire me until I graduate. I can't afford to rent somewhere else and I can't get rid of my car because there's no other way for me to get to school but I also can't keep my car because of my insane insurance rates I don't know what to do I have no options left. I have a full course load for my final year and there's no part time job that will pay me enough to afford all my expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tried transferring the lease my mother which would be drastically cheaper however my father refuses to let me transfer it to her; I don't know why I agreed I would pay for all of it the payments and the insurance but he's not having it. I feel angry, I feel like I want to leave, I feel like I hate everyone, I feel trapped, and I feel alone. The only thing I can do now is drop out of school and work several jobs for god knows how long until I have the money. I really don't want to do that though (I'm already behind because I took time off to work before) I don't know why this had to happen when I was so close I'm completely demotivated I kind of just want to end this miserable life. I want this pain and stress to end, this has been keeping me up at night for weeks now and I don't know how much longer I can take this. Posting this on the internet is my last desperate cry for help I don't know what I expect anyone to say or if anyone will even see this but I have to do something to get it all out."

I’ve only worked with creating macros using VBA in Excel and creating a database in Access using macros too. Since Im still undergrad I haven’t learned anything about real CS topics aside from MS office. I’ve been self teaching myself how to use vba by googling and asking on reddit (saving my life!) 

I really enjoy working on this and figuring how to automate in MSO. I have sat at my desk for 8 hours just figuring what works and what everything means, and was engaged every minute. But I know that CS is extremely broad and vba is nothing compared to other languages. 

So where should I start to learn more? I have no clue what I’m most interested in doing either, and I’m very clueless on the whole subject. I am very interested in learning more since it’s an extremely valuable skill but finding a language/path to go down seems impossible right now since there’s so many options."

New to Reddit, but I had a few questions for college students who study with a STEM-related major or anyone else who may be able to help.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently an uprising senior and I am in the middle of looking at colleges and looking at majors I may want to major in. As of now, my dream is to be a Developmental Pediatrician, ( a pediatrician who helps children with special needs). I am confused as to whether a Psych major or a Biology major will be more useful considering what I want to be.  Does anyone know which one is better?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few more questions if anyone can help!:

\- If I am taking the ACT should I take SAT subject tests?

\- Is there anything extra that I should try and do that colleges may be impressed with?

\- I currently have an internship(shadowing doctor) and I volunteer at my local hospital every week. AT my school we have a class that allows students to intern. My teacher was generous enough to find me one, but the internship is at the same hospital I volunteer at, so not sure if colleges will look that volunteer and intern at the same place a bad thing. Do you think I should just drop the class and take honors physics instead, or should I just stick with the class?

cbqgze,52,2019-07-10,The type of admin that is nearly impossible to rehabilitate,crankysysadmin,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cbqgze/the_type_of_admin_that_is_nearly_impossible_to/,"I've encountered maybe 3-4 people like this over my entire career. It's a set of attributes that when combined create a sysadmin that's almost impossible to integrate into another company other than the one they currently work for. The symptoms are usually as follows:

* Smarter than average person. Definitely very intelligent and driven

* Self taught and usually started working for a small company and grew from nearly nothing to a lot of knowledge. Usually very proud of the progress they've made.

* Either works as the only IT person, or has 1-2 IT people working for them who are extremely low ranking. For example, they might have community college interns but nobody ever at a higher level than that

* Has coding experience and has usually used this at work. extensively. 

* Has absolutely and total support of the company owner who views this person as some kind of technology god. Usually provides extremely quick service to the owner

* Usually has a title that's completely out of whack with being a sysadmin that's way, way too senior like Director, CIO, Vice President, etc

* has never worked anywhere else and has no outside IT experience to compare with

* and the final thing is this person usually has some strange additional responsibilities that aren't typically part of IT that leads to kind of a weird authoritarian status at that company like being in charge of IT and physical security, or being in a position where they sit in on 100% of interviews an ""evaluate"" candidates on their computer skills (from secretaries to accountants to sales guys) and for some reason gets veto power as part of this, or being in charge of IT and determining which desks people get to sit at or is in some sort of other weird position where they get to tell people what to do outside of the chain of command.

You combine all this together and you get some really weird things.

For example, I once had one of these guys create a setup for spam protection where he manually reviewed most of the mail coming in and out of the company and was thanked for it and thought this was totally normal. The same guy could view any and all screens of all users.

In another case the guy spent 70 hours a week creating a system to manage windows PCs with Tcl and Perl that could have easily been replaced with SCCM or any number of other tools.

My company just bought a small company and I'm dealing with one of these guys right now. The big debate among our IT leadership team was if this guy could be rehabilitated and work as a sysadmin or if he'd be too much of a problem. 

The most glaring and insane thing? This guy built a massive and complex system that instead of AD groups instead used custom attributes in AD (crazy scheme changes everywhere) that was all built through highly complex web based admin tools he built using python.

He's also a ""senior vice president"" and wants to be treated as such even though he has an intern and spends his whole day writing python code to automate things that could be done with 1 line powershell commands and native windows tools.

He solved the problem for us when he quit rather than work for us."

cbrcs7,1,2019-07-11,Just need to get it out,joesteel7270,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cbrcs7/just_need_to_get_it_out/,"I dunno, I guess I just need to vent. My whole life i've had fairly severe anxiety, and it developed into depression by around middle school. Not a bad life by any means, just the usual. Parents divorced, neither of them were around because of their own issues, and I just kinda was by myself pretty much all the time. My sister was there too thank god. She probably saved my life more times than I can imagine just because she was there, but she's younger than I am and we're both just so emotionally stunted. Anyways I just locked myself in my room and played video games, read, just found ways to escape. Never actually attempted suicide, just contemplated it a lot of the time. Found out recently that that's called ""suicidal ideation,"" which is just kind of an interesting term. Wouldn't have really thought before that the was a term for that. Whatever. 

Didn't drink until college, but then I definitely started self medicating. Heavily. Just cigarettes and booze, but quite a bit of both. I met my best friends that I have (with a few exceptions whom I met later) then, and relied on them a lot, but I bottled a lot up then as I still do now. I just don't want to inconvenience anybody. Generally speaking though that was probably the happiest i've ever been, and probably ever will be. 

First actual diagnosis of anxiety and depression I got came years later when I was teaching. There's a little time gap there obviously, but I ended up doing teach for america and becoming a teacher. Taught for a couple years on the west side of chicago when after a while I noticed that I was too frequently for comfort thinking about how nice it would be if I just drove off the road, making it look like I fell asleep at the wheel or something inconspicuous. Finally I went to the doctor and got some help, and started medication. I thought that was all I needed, but at the same time I ended up leaving teaching to work in bars, so in hindsight I clearly wasn't mentally stable. I had spent so much time getting blackout drunk to try to numb myself that a bar hired me on part time, then more time, then offering me a salary and I just left teaching. 

Spent the following several years partying pretty much nonstop, until I met my now fiancee. She really helped me decide that it was time to face my shit. I actually wanted a life with her, and to grow old with her, and to be a person she'd be proud to be with, so I quit the full time bar life and went back to teaching, and was actually pretty happy. Stressed as all hell, but I loved teaching, I loved my partner, and things felt ok. 

By about 2/3 through the year I realized that I wasn't going to have enough money to make it through the summer with no pay, plus my fiancee talked literally non stop about how we needed to buy a house, and I knew my credit was bad do to a mountain of credit card debt, so I started working a side job bartending again. At the time I foolishly actually thought things were going well... For the first time in my life I didn't really have to worry about finances, the debt was disappearing, and I actually had money to just spend on myself, on my fiancee, etc.

Keep in mind, at the time I was still dealing with crippling anxiety and what had recently been diagnosed as persistent depressive disorder. I was recommended therapy and for the second time I didn't listen. I knew I should probably start it, but I didn't have time. Insurance was difficult to figure out. I had to keep saving money. All of that. And I thought I was dealing with it, so what was the difference. But then someone very important to me had a stroke out of nowhere, and I was working at a bar, and then I took a shot when I shouldn't have and wasn't eating when I should have and I was on medication anyways, so when the cops woke me up in my car (which was parked and off, keys not in the ignition mind you), I don't even remember anything until I woke up in jail.

So here I am. It's been about two months since that happened, and in all honesty the outcome in court wasn't bad, but that suicidal ideation definitely came back. I started with a therapist (that's where I learned what that term was), but today was when I had to plead out and then a minor hiccup with the wedding turned into a mental breakdown on my fiancee's end due to the culmination of everything (which I don't blame her for but I can't help her and don't know how to cope now), and basically I just feel worthless. Like everyone might be better off without me. I don't know. Can't even call the suicide prevention hotline because they might call emergency services and I can't afford that bill, nor can I afford to take days off my summer internship. I'm leaving a lot out right now, but that's because I'm just tired. I don't know. Just needed to get it out."

I have really enjoyed all of my course work, and have done quite well in it. This summer, I landed the internship that I really wanted doing chip design.

I'm two months into the internship, and I am realizing that this is really not what I want to be doing. I can't stand being cramped up in a cubicle, looking at my computer monitors *all day*. I am busy at work, and I find the work interesting -- nothing wrong there. But I can't imagine a worse hell than just sitting for 8 hours a day, plugging away at a computer, and occasionally attending meetings. I crave a job where I am on my feet and interacting with others for a large part of my day. I want to feel like I am impacting other people, not just company profits. 

Where do I begin to find an alternative path that fits what I'm looking for? I have reached out to some friends and professors, who have suggested I look into teaching/academia, or going to law school and doing policy/legal work. I am curious if anyone else has had a similar experience or could offer me some career advice.

So a little background here. I'm staying with my aunt, uncle and two cousins over the summer as I'm doing an internship in the area. My cousin loves to bring random food items from a store nearby that sells imported goods. The other day, she brought home two packs of ramen that looked relatively normal (they're all glaringly red and filled with bold colours and text so I'm really not to blame here for what happens next). Anyway, one of the packs was some kimchi flavoured crap for me, and the other pack was the dreaded ""samyang 2x spicy"" ramen, which I didn't even give a second thought to at the time.

Before I proceed any further, let me just clarify that I was vaguely aware of what the fire noodle challenge was, and some small part of my brain even indulged in the fascinating possibility that one of these ramen could be the dreaded ramen from the challenge. I wish I would've just gone ahead and looked it up on Google, so I'd be more prepared for what happened, but then we wouldn't be here, would we.

So anyway, my cousin and I get started with the preparation, and after ten minutes we're sitting at the dinner table with two delicious looking bowls of ramen. I start digging into mine, the kimchi one, and look over to see my cousin pushing her bowl away claiming it was way too spicy for her. Now, for some reason, I really love subjecting my taste buds to food that's spicy or has a high level of heat, even tho my tolerance for the same is hardly above average. In a moment of (not so blissful) ignorance, I decided to prove my superiority over her in terms of spice tolerance, and proceeded to wolf down the nuclear looking ramen she had rejected.

To be quite honest, it didn't hit me too bad until I was almost done. Maybe shoveling it down my throat as fast as I could rather than stopping to savour it and let it spread over my taste buds had something to do with that. Either way, once I was done, my mouth slowly started to go numb. My eyes were uncontrollably tearing up, and my nose began gushing (is that a normal response?), So I excused myself and went to fix myself some cold water, but during the trip to the refrigerator, the first wave hit. 

My mouth burned in ways I cannot describe, my eyes and nose were flowing, and my whole face felt like it was on fire. I retrieved some ice cubes from the freezer, and in a desperate attempt, chipmunked them to get some relief. I also happen to have sensitive teeth, and if any of you readers do as well, you might understand how they would've reacted to all the ice in my mouth. The worst part was that the ice couldn't cover every square unit of the inside of my mouth at the same time, so the parts that had not been granted relief still protested with the same intensity as before, rendering the ice useless. My cousin came into the kitchen grinning, and burst out laughing upon examining my situation. The helplessness was driving me insane, and I begged her to pour me some cold milk, as I was quite incapacitated by this point. She handed me a glass, and I gulped it down insatiably. 

Oh, the relief. The sweet, cold milk overwhelmed my mouth and throat, washing away the pain slowly and gently until only a dull throb remained, and i could once again focus with my eyes. I exited the kitchen, and found myself lying face up on my bed, enjoying the feeling of my own mouth again, and dreading the shit I was going to have the next day. 

(The shit wasn't that bad tbh a little on the spicy side sure but nowhere near the ordeal I'd suffered last night)


TL;DR My cousin bought some exotic looking ramen and I scarfed it down without realising it was the same ramen used in the fire noodle challenge."

cbswjt,210,2019-07-11,Entry level embedded software career guide,hamtaroismyhomie,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/cbswjt/entry_level_embedded_software_career_guide/,"# Entry Level Embedded Software Career Guide

I frequently get asked for advice on getting into embedded internships and entry level, so I decided to put together a simple guide based on my experience. Feel free to add your advice or perspective. Note that this is an embedded *software* guide. There are many embedded systems jobs out there beyond software; this isn't the only path.

**Disclaimer:** This guide is based on my anecdotal, subjective experience. I'm a primarily self-taught embedded software / firmware engineer, living in the Bay Area, 1.5 YOE, with two embedded systems internships, and 1 full time firmware position, currently looking for my 2nd position, and currently interviewing with the high compensation companies. I decided to make this career change 2 years ago, with no prior software or technical degree or experience. What worked for me, may not work for you.  I highly encourage you to continuously refine redirect your path based on your own research through talking with working engineers, looking at job postings, and reading articles.

## Rule # 1: Build and show off skills that are in-demand by employers.

This is the advice I give to anyone looking for a job in any industry.

What are the skills that are in-demand?  This is highly dependent on the area you live in, and the industries around you. Go to LinkedIn / Google / Indeed, and look at all the entry level and internship job postings for embedded software / firmware, and tabulate skills that are asked for.  This doesn't need to be rigorous, and there will probably be a bunch of terms and concepts that you don't know -- that's okay. For now, just focus on the common concepts. 

My list ended up looking something like this:

- C
- C++
- Testing
- RTOS
- Board bring-up
- Driver development
- I2C
- Sensors &amp; Actuators
- ARM
- Linux Kernel Development
- Python
- Microcontrollers
- UART
- Bluetooth / Wifi / IEEE 802.11
- System Debug
- OS Architecture / Design
- ...

One thing to also notice is common clusterings of skills: microcontrollers, embedded linux, hardware testing, networking, automotive, and IoT are the common ones I've seen in my search.

Personally, I focused on the most in-demand, broadest, and fundamental skills first, because I wanted a job, and I wanted the ability to pivot to different types of development if I ended up disliking a subfield.

## Fundamentals
The following topics / courses will give you a strong foundation for embedded systems software development, and questions about the basics will likely come up in interviews:

1. **Introduction to Programming.** [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) is a great first course.  Covers a lot, but has a ton of auxiliary resources.
2. **Data Structures and Algorithms.** There's tons of resources out there already, so I won't go into that here.
3. **Computer Organization / Systems.** (Learn the basic hardware in a computer, and learn assembly)
4. **Operating Systems.** The combination of a good computer organization and assembly course, with a good operating systems course answered so many questions for me and filled in a ton of blanks. 

## How do I build these skills?

1. A computer engineering, electrical engineering, or computer science degree, with a selection of electives focused on embedded software concepts will get you 75% of the way to a job, and will make it significantly easier for you to get interviews. 

2. [Embedded Systems Rule the World](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/), and [Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape the World](https://www.edx.org/course/real-time-bluetooth-networks-shape-the-world) will get you good enough projects to land a job if you complete them, and if you can intelligently talk about the covered topics. Whether you're self-taught, or getting a degree, I 100% recommend working through these two courses as a first step towards getting employable, real world skills. (If you're completely new to programming, complete CS50 first).

3. Learn to Google! There are so many resources out there, at all levels, to help with your learning.  Each concept that you need to learn, you need to understand why people use it, alternatives, what problem it solves, and ways to implement it.  Find tutorials that work for you -- for some concepts, I've had to go through multiple textbooks and multiple tutorials before they finally clicked. Be a relentless autodidact.

### Specific Resources

Concept|Resources
:--|:--
C | [K&amp;R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language), the canonical C handbook, and a relatively quick read. [""Modern C"" by Gustedt](http://icube-icps.unistra.fr/index.php/File:ModernC.pdf) for a more in depth, and modern, take.
Testing | ""Test Driven Development for Embedded C"" by Grenning
Operating Systems | ""Operating Systems"" by Silberschatz.  [""Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"" by Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
RTOS | A good operating systems textbook will be  a great starting point.  Checkout this [FreeRTOS Tutorial](https://www.freertos.org/tutorial/), and I've also heard good things about the ""Modern Embedded Systems Programming"" YouTube channel. [Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape the World](https://www.edx.org/course/real-time-bluetooth-networks-shape-the-world)
I2C, UART, SPI | There are great articles on [Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication/all) and [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-express-serial-communications/what-is-serial-communications).
Sensors &amp; Actuators | The [Robogrok](http://www.robogrok.com/) robotics course Youtube videos have a great, newbie friendly introduction to robotics, sensors, actuators, and PID control.
Linux Kernel Development | I frequently see ""Linux Kernel Development"" by Love as recommended
Microcontrollers | [Embedded Systems Rule the World](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/)
Bluetooth / Wifi / IEEE 802.11 | [Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape the World](https://www.edx.org/course/real-time-bluetooth-networks-shape-the-world)

**Other General Resources I've found helpful:**

The ""Making Embedded Systems"" book by Elecia White (/u/logicalelegance) -- a great introduction to the basics of embedded systems, and does a good job of being an easy read for newbies.

[Embedded.fm Podcast](https://embedded.fm/). Great podcast hosted by the above author.

[Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/). Good articles.

[The Ganssle Group](http://www.ganssle.com/). Good articles.

[Barr Group](https://barrgroup.com/). Good articles.

[The Amp Hour](https://theamphour.com/). Hardware focused podcast.

[Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/). The 'working out of the box' hardware paired with newbie friendly tutorials are a nice starting point.  Professional development kits and datasheets are oriented towards people who've already worked on similar systems, so there is quite a bit of assumed context someone new to the field doesn't have.

## Applications
The best way to get your application moved forward is through personal connections, and recommendations. But, sometimes that isn't an option, and you have to cold apply.

My advice is to apply to positions that you meet &gt;=50% of the requirements.

Make sure you get you resume reviewed by professionals in the field before applying. 

If you get a low response rate, you need to get your resume re-reviewed, or you need to build better projects that better demonstrate the skills employers are looking for.

## Interview Questions
In addition to typical software interview preparation, embedded software interviews tend to ask some repetitive questions. I don't know how many times I've answered what volatile and static are.  Here are some typical questions:

- What is static?
- What is volatile?
- How does an interrupt work?
- What programming practices should typically be avoided in embedded systems, and why?
- Basic circuits questions: Ohms law. Voltage Dividers. Series and Parallel Resistors.
- Compare and contrast I2C, UART, and SPI
- How does an ADC work? How about a DAC?
- Compare and contrast Mutex and Semaphores
- Linked List algorithm questions
- String manipulation algorithm questions
- Bit manipulation algorithm questions
- Tell me about a hardware issue you debugged.
- Why would you use an RTOS?
- How does an OS manage memory?"

However, my thought process was that I'll get the A+ certification this summer to help me get an internship for next summer, as not many college students would have a certification, and then I could try to get Security+ next summer, to help me get a job after college.

However, If I go for my MSW instead, that won’t be an issue, but I also can’t afford out of state tuition. 

Therefore, If we decide to move I will have to wait another year until I can begin graduate school to qualify for the in-state tuition price. So that means I have to find a job (which i’ve heard is extremely difficult to do with just a BA in psych), in order to afford our new apartment and stuff. It’s also pushing me back from starting my career if I have to wait another year, in which I already feel old/behind in life and guilty about not even having my BA yet. So essentially I would be starting my graduate program at 26 years old if I have to wait a year.

But if I go to school in NJ then my boyfriend might get a full time job offer (he doesn’t have to go to graduate school) and will not want to leave it, or I’ll get an internship in NJ and get a job offer and we’ll end up having to stay.

I’m just extremely anxious about not having my career started at my age and having to push it off even further if we move, but I am so damn miserable here. The thought of having to start a life here in NJ makes me incredibly unhappy. 

I would just like some advice on what my options are and if there are possibilities that if we choose to move, that it will be ok!! Thanks!"

My manager is well aware of my achievements and contributions at work but my mentor knows me better because we get to interact with each other a lot more. So I was wondering who I should get an LOR from and whether I should even get an LOR from here. I'll have enough professors who can write me decent LORs. I'm not sure how an LOR from an industry professional would look like to the admissions committee. 

Lastly if I get an LOR from my manager or mentor do they need to write it on the company letterhead? I've been told my company does not authorise managers to give out LORs on company letterheads and I'd need to ask HR for that. However I'm worried that in that case I'll just end up with a generic letter that wouldn't seem very strong and could get me rejected."

I have been doing sales/management experience for the last 5-6 yrs. I am a 24F, single mom of 1. I have a BS in Psych and lots of help with my daughter thanks to family. I know I want to get into CS as I have taken several self-study courses and I really like it! I feel like it comes to me rather naturally. I recently enrolled into a local university's online CS degree. After all my research, I think applying credits from my psych degree into a second bachelor's in CS will be a better move than a coding bootcamp. I want to take my time learning the material and feel confident when I apply to jobs.   


My question is:   
1. How competitive is the job market and internship market for BS Computer Science majors?   
2. How can I get some entry level experience in the CS field? How can I prepare myself to be a good job/internship candidate?  
3. Is it worth getting certificates in Python, Java, etc?

I hated myself for it so much, I knew what I had to do to meet the deadline and yet didn't do it as usual.

And then I forgot my notebook at home so I had no way of rehearsing my presentation. 

Got there on time for once, and presented without any notes, it stressed me out but I managed.

My internship has been pure hell, I mentioned it before on this reddit. But because of my ADHD it has been  very difficult to do some boring mindless tasks not to mention I was abused psychologically there, and insulted, and left completely shattered.

I broke down during my powerpoint presentation while trying really hard to seem positive and upbeat and never saying anything negative but I couldn't. She asked me ""Tell me the truth about how it was there.."" and I just cried. 

What shocked me was that she didn't judge me and instead told me to let the tears flow and that it wasn't my fault, that it's never your fault that it's been a bad experience, especially in this case.

I just felt reassured and I don't know... suddenly it gave me hope again that there are some people that do actually care..

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a very tough year professionally and personally, I've had suicidal thoughts bcs of it, not now but mentally my health isn't at the best and I feel silly to cry in front of people like this but I think it was an accumulation of everything.

I'm a couple weeks into my new web dev internship. I enjoy coding but I haven't taken on personal projects. Nearly my experience is from school.

My coworker chuckled when he saw my huge method. Then he showed me how a .NET abstraction performs the work for me automatically. Coworker's approach is much better. I'm really glad to learn the easy way but I wish I could have arrived there without trying it my way.

I'm a p decent student, by my standards.

I'm in the top 30% (like 27% I think I don't remember) of my class, and attend a fairly hard school and had a hard time freshman year, which dropped my GPA a bit, but now it's a \~5.2 on a 6 scale.

I'm also just the type of person that *genuinely* likes to learn, and have a pretty wide area of subjects that I like.

# My Problem:

I want to major in bio-engineering/biomed engineering BUT almost all of my experience/stuff I can put on my resume is related to business. I am co-president of a program at our school relating to Business and Industry, I'm in debate (which I know isn't really business but it's more business than bioengineering), and I'm doing an internship right now that's mostly related to business management. 

The only stuff that I really have to show my interest/ability in bioengineering are my AP bio grades/teacher's rec letter, and long-standing personal interest in biology (doing things like reading research papers for a few years and reading significantly more in depth into the materials taught in class, and building connections to bioengineering stuff in other classes, like Psychology)

&amp;#x200B;

# My Options: 

The schools that I want to go to (my match/reach ones) are difficult, like UT Austin, WashU, Rice, Vanderbilt, maybe UMich. At  UT Austin, it's really hard to switch majors, but it isn't impossible. To makes things clear, I want to go into bioengineering *really* badly, but if I ended up having to do business, I would be sad at first, but I know I would be ok because I do like it in general.

Here are my options for schools like UT Austin, because schools like Rice are better with switching majors. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Apply undecided** \- I just really don't want to do this one, it seems like not a good idea and I don't know why, it's like a gut feeling
2. **Apply with business + honors as my 1st, and bioengineering as my second** \- If I got in, then I would have to transfer into bioengineering from business honors and that seems really hard to me, because I would have to take all the prereq courses for bio and maintain a really high GPA. If I applied this way, I would make sure to emphasize my leadership and teamworking and creative abilities because those are applicable to bioengineering too, I guess.
3. **Apply with bioengineering + honors as my 1st and business as my second** \- I think this would end up making me not be considered at all for business, because it's really competitive at UT, especially with honors, and due to my lack of concrete bioengineering experience, I don't think I would get in period.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has been in a similar situation/has done the whole college application process before and is slightly more familiar with it than I am/knows about the schools I mentioned/thinks that I have another option, please let me know. 

I've really been struggling with this for a while and would greatly appreciate someone's take on it."

A LOT of my coursework at school has pointed to CS - I’ve taken 3 years of CS classes and will be in my school’s CS research lab next year. 

However, I really haven’t had many CS-related extracurriculars. Throughout HS, my main extracurricular has been a sport - I’m now a 2-year captain and have been named MVP - and studio art. I’m currently doing a CS-related internship at a startup, but that’s about all I’ve got. 

I’ve come to the realization that the reason I haven’t sought out CS extracurriculars is that I really don’t see myself doing CS for the rest of my life. For a few years, sure. But honestly, I love the liberal arts and I know I can’t be happy in pure CS. I really just do CS in school because my dad pushed it on me. 

I have strong stats (1580 SAT, 2 800s on subject tests, 3.96 UW GPA/4.465 W GPA) but when applying to the schools I’m looking at (T20s) that doesn’t mean much. I also know that CS is quite possibly the most competitive major to apply for. So, my question: should I apply for CS because all my coursework points to it, or should I apply for something else? If so, what? one possibility I can think of is Chem Engineering, since I took all the chem classes available at my school and did really well in all of them, but I’m honestly not too keen on the idea."

For some reason I decided to look back at the position details and finally saw (my own fault) that it was a ""10 weeks participating in a formal, paid, education tailored to your career interests"". 

After the 10 weeks there's an opportunity to interview for a full time Engineer position. 

I don't have much experience with these kinds of programs. It sounds like a roundabout way of calling it an internship. I'm just wrapping up a web dev bootcamp but previously I've had work experience doing web dev so this sounds like I might be too overqualified for it.

Should I pursue it for the opportunity at the end or use it as interview practice and keep searching?

Thanks guys!"

cc5y5q,6,2019-07-12,"My new ‘transition’ research job is everything I want regarding the field I want to go into — except the salary is very low. How can I not let this get to me, and focus on using my passion to transition successfully into industry down the road?",florence_belle,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cc5y5q/my_new_transition_research_job_is_everything_i/,"**_NOTE: (I tried to keep this short, if anyone needs any more information I am happy to provide it. Thanks in advance for reading this novel.)_**

I am a 23 yr old F who recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering, and specializes in neuroimaging. Earlier today, I accepted a highly sought research position at a top (Ivy-league) university where I will be doing the closest to what I hope to do in the neuroimaging field, in an entry level position (I really struggled with finding something similar for job tasks and responsibilities for only someone with a bachelor’s like me). I am very excited for the learning and research experiences and responsibilities for this position.

Only thing is, the salary (42k) is lower than what I would want to be comfortable in terms of being out in the city or really treating myself, like how I went out with friends in college. I’ll be living in an ‘above average’ city in terms of cost too which can get expensive on top of my car costs and a mortgage I am helping my parents to pay (they will actually be my landlords who I am renting out to with a property in the city).

I did try negotiating, and my hirers agreed that my salary should be higher and that they wish they can be more flexible, but they can’t due to *funding*. They told me that they were able to raise my initial salary from 36k to 42k to settle on with HR before I negotiated. This happened bc of my previous internship experience I have had in the past to help me gain the specific skills for this role (I have 18 months of work experience in medical image analysis and software development). It was a good conversation that I was happy to have with them — yes, it was disappointing on both ends, but what made it nice was that at the end they were very vocal about both supporting me and their hope that I’d join them. It ended off with the communication on their end that they were serious about being there to help achieve my goals and to use this position as sort of a ‘launch-pad’/transition job, in order to progress further into a solidified industry job about two years from now (since current funding for this job is til July 2021). I verbally made it clear to them in my interviews that my long term goals were to become more of a subject-matter level expert in neuroimaging, and hearing this in our convo made it clear to me that they were really engaged and listening to me, with regards to where I want to be professionally and why I wanted this position.

Another decision factor was an excellent tuition reimbursement benefit to complete specialized classes in my field and maybe get a degree (Ivy League grad education for free), but I fear that I will not be able to complete a masters in the time I have been given for this position and how I really want to try and make an effort to be frugal with my money afterwards, bc you never know what happens in life and I do want to be prepared. A PhD is something with my current living situation that may not be attainable for me, which is why I think I can possibly do a Masters. I do think maybe getting a grad degree will help me, and if I have the opportunity to do it for free, that’d be so beneficial for me because of the biomedical engineering field in general, and especially with how specialized both my goals and my concentration are.

**Don’t get me wrong, the research will be amazing and impactful for me. But does anyone have any tips for:**

**— Keeping on top of the job and staying motivated with the salary, while simultaneously continuing to work towards my career goals mutually with the research team?**

**— When and how to start opening up a job search for industry towards the end of the funding?**

**— Any tips for starting out with the ‘lower’ salary as a new grad in the city?**

**— I also would love tips on how to use my passion and experience to market myself, but I get anxious about that too**

**— I’m also curious if having such a narrow focus on desired technical responsibilities of my job help or limit me?**

*Please don’t say I should quit and take another job* — I am thrilled to take this job, but all-in-all, just trying to stay engaged and keep staying excited, and to potentially hear some insight here! Any advice and tips for this and saving money as well would be useful! The next two years will require me to buckle down with budgeting really hard, as well as to be open and start planning ahead — but I am excited to see what’s in store in this chapter of my professional life for me."

I usually achieved grades of A's and B's. However, I certainly was not the best at programming. 

I was one of those students who thought obtaining a degree would land me a 100k job after I graduated. During the end of my second year, a lot of my peers started getting internships and work experience. 

I was too late to start applying to places, I thought I'll just apply for the next year for a grad role or something. It would be okay, right? 

I started to apply for places, juggling projects and papers and preparing for interviews that would eventually lead to nowhere. I was ghosted, rejection after rejection. 

I found myself on this subreddit, I learnt that many of us seeking a career in computer science faced the same issues. I didn't give up. Every day I woke up, I applied for grad roles &amp; internships for after graduation. 

I spent almost an entire year, filling out applications and writing cover letters. 2 Months left until graduation did I land an interview at a big4 accounting firm. I didn't want to go actually because I thought I was not good enough. I said to myself screw it I'll do it for the experience. 

I went in and met all of these students with internship experience, knowledge, pet projects and whatnot. There was no way I could compete with them. The next week I received an offer on the phone and accepted a position as a data science graduate, two out of approximately 3000 applicants. 

To those that are trying to find a career in this field, don't give up. I'm writing this post because this subreddit helped me to find my motivation. I hope this does the same for you.

You should read both of these posts, mine first, to understand the context.

I would have responded earlier but I was traveling. But before I begin, first, I take issue with the author of ""The case for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"" for writing a rebuke of my post without actually citing my post anywhere. The author wrote in a comment that they did not link my post because it ""omits a lot of context"" (oh, the irony!) and because, in the author's opinion, it ""doesn't accurately portray how most students at RPI feel,"" which I don't consider to be a valid reason for not citing the post as context. But, alas, RPI is not a law school, and I cannot fault the author for his or her lack of ability in debate when indeed, RPI does not care to educate its students in this regard. But now, let's move on to the meat of the matter.

----

First, the author's defense of the administration. 

&gt; However, the argument with which you were presented with last application season insisted that these issues, in the form they took at RPI, had more of an effect on our students than at universities of a comparable caliber.

The author's exact words are not clear, but I believe they want to make the argument that Rensselaer's administrators made decisions that were as bad or less bad than the decisions of administrators of other schools, and goes on to say that other schools *also* attack free speech. This is quite a comical way of promoting a school, but when the school is RPI, I suppose you have to take what you can get.

&gt; articles like [this](https://poly.rpi.edu/2016/04/13/rounds_instructs_poster_removal/) wildly mischaracterize the situation via omission of context. One of the most recent of the poster takedown controversies involved posters featuring President Jackson dressed in North Korean military attire.

Ah, a bait and a switch! And to do this to the editors of your own campus newspaper: shame! Read the article: it says nothing about the North Korea posters, but of the Save the Union posters. There was no legitimate reason for the removal of those posters, which were firmly in the domain of political discourse, while the North Korea posters were memes at best and reflections of the immature student body at worst. Additionally, the North Korea posters were after the Save the Union posters, and were entirely unrelated.

&gt; Overall, it is reasonable to say that in my experience, quarrels between students and the administration have little impact on the livelihood of students

It is true: despite what the author characterizes as a vibrant political scene, RPI students are a perfect picture of apathy, having been downtrodden and ignored for so long. They no longer care about how the school is administered and have accepted their dismal status as mere customers. Perhaps the author has forgotten that in 2006, the administration proposed numerous restrictions to Greek life and deleterious changes to the alcohol policy, and the student body voted down those restrictions in a landslide 1585-85 vote, actually eliciting an apology from the administration. When those same restrictions were again proposed in 2019, the student body simply laid down and took it. Pathetic. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/b9h9qn/in_2006_dr_j_proposed_the_same_alcohol_policy_she/)

For accuracy, you would be better off calling it the ""deadlihood of students"", Merriam &amp; Webster be damned, because RPI students are much closer to zombies (robots, really, since this is an engineering school) than anything living. RPI has the weakest school spirit of any school I have ever seen. No one wears school apparel: personally, I threw mine in the garbage. The school is an embarrassment: students won't even take the free t-shirts they give away at fundraising events, of which there are many, because the school is so ridiculously deep in debt. Seriously look how cringy this is: [1](https://twitter.com/rpi/status/1062036064959901696) and [2](http://alumni.rpi.edu/s/1225/images/editor/4bcbec9f-c5b4-476f-b23a-bd3686fa498e.jpg) (yes they really did put this shit on a t-shirt).

So yes, I will grant you that most students choose to completely ignore the state of the administration of the school, and I'll leave it to you to explain how happy everyone is about the new alcohol and Greek life policies. Go RPI!

On to Academics.

RPI is rigorous, that is for sure. But if you care about the rankings, you cannot just pick whichever ranking site happens to rank RPI higher than other schools. USNWR and the WSJ are the only two credible ranking sites, and RPI's rank has fallen in recent years even as schools like Northeastern have risen. Like many students of second-rate universities, RPI students love to talk about how highly ranked the school is and how RPI students are so much better than students at other second-rate universities. Please: spare me this drivel. 

&gt; I have taken upper-level STEM courses at all different tiers of Universities (T10 on USNWR, RPI, state schools that aren’t even ranked) and can add from personal experience that there isn’t a huge difference between STEM classes at a school like RPI and a school like, say, Duke.

Well, Duke isn't really known for engineering, now is it? But it's true: classes are mostly the same between schools. The difference is in the students. Are RPI students passionate? I think the answer is resoundingly no. Take a look at some MIT student projects, and then I'll let you take as much time as you want to see if you can find even one comparable student project from RPI. You name the subject, I'll find you a student project at MIT in that field that will blow your mind.

https://www.anishathalye.com/2015/03/07/designing-a-better-judging-system/

On the subject of the Arch, your tepid support for the program even as a supporter of the school is a better argument against the program than anything I could write. But perhaps you should speak with the students that had to turn down prestigious summer internships because of the Arch. Perhaps you should speak with students that won't be able to graduate early because the Arch screwed with their course scheduling. Perhaps you should speak with people in less popular majors where required courses are only offered in the spring and fall, and have nothing much to do during the Arch. Perhaps these problems will iron themselves out, or perhaps RPI's abysmal career center and nonexistent connections to industry will see the program die as the failure it currently is. But do you want to be the guinea pig?

On to the social life.

&gt; In a unique way, RPI has rich political engagement, but people will not hold your views against you.

Easy to say this as a liberal. I am not a conservative, but my friends that are conservative do not speak highly of the political culture at RPI.

&gt; the geek culture; there are probably more Dungeons and Dragons groups on campus than students. Everyone here is into STEM. Walking down the sidewalks, you hear less about good novels and more about differential equations and engineering projects. It feels so truly euphoric as a STEM major to be surrounded by people who share your passion for the sciences in the fullest.

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/991/3t0kod.jpg

Yes, this is the type of person you will find at RPI. Everything in this paragraph is a detriment to the school. People at MIT and Stanford still talk about novels, RPI students are just ignorant. And it shows when you see the abysmal writing skills of the student body (not a slight at the author, whose writing ability is well above that of the average RPI student).

The fact that the author is promoting geekiness as a cultural thing should tell you everything you need to know. Geeks, pretty much by definition, have impaired social abilities, and to mark that as the defining feature of the social scene is telling. Yet, paradoxically, a community of geeks is possible, and it exists at RPI. It's possible to be an engineer and be into STEM without being a geek. 

Here are some sources about the social life. I can rattle off stories like this for days.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9es1z2/do_not_apply_to_rensselaer_polytechnic_institute/e67bils/

And finally Troy. I mean, just see it for yourself. It's a dumpy little town. The people that actually live there hate it: see the comments on the author's post. I've already written as much as can be said about the place. A guy with ties to RPI was shot walking around downtown last year (personally I have never felt unsafe in Troy). https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/6vssc9/rpi_grad_student_shot_in_dt_troy_last_night/

In conclusion, I really recommend piecing through my original post from one year ago. Everything there is just as relevant now as it was then. It features 37 sources, some of which are full of data and figures. Like the author said: do the research for yourself. I trust that you won't like what you see.

I first was a bit confused to see that I apparently had the appointment with a different shrink, but who cares, all I care about is the diagnosis and getting my life back on track.

He didn't introduce himeself to me, just asked me to come to his room, then glimpsed shortly over the tests, looked at me and was like ""there are spikes in the results that indicate ADHD, but ...naw...naw...it's not"".

I was in there for like almost an hour....and this sentence was the only time he even mentioned adhd....and he decided that it's not ADHD after knowing me for less than 30 seconds.

He didn't explain anything, but started to lecture me how the main goal now should be to get me back in a job, then asked my why I did not applied for internships...because ""you need to do something""

Then when I told him I applied for internships since I wanted to work in IT, that I should train myself at home to have some knowledge about the topic already and he would know someone that learned programming at home, then applied to an internship and did get a real job in the company some months later.

Oh yeah, and I have chronic depression.

While I was sitting in front of him, unable to even answer simply questions because I barely could understand them, hardly catch a single thought in my head, everything was racing.... Couldn't understand half the stuff he was mumbling about and just was sitting there, nodding and saying ""yes"" or ""no"".

He then told me that it's not sure if I can get a new appointment, since they have no real waiting list and I should look in the internet to get appointments with other shrinks.

After the appt I almost got run over by a car because I tried to cross the street when pedestrians had ""red light"" but I still was completely zoned out, a few minutes later I was standing in front of a road and not crossing it at all because I was waiting for the car to stop before crossing it....except that there was no cars at all and the street was completely empty, but my brain was telling me to not cross the road again before the car stops.

I mean, honestly, I clearly wouldn't mind at all if the diagnosis would not be ADHD, like at all, but shouldn't he have to explain things to me, like the results of the tests, maybe ask some further questions to clarify and not lecture me on how I need to find a job...and how easy it was for someone he knows to find a job after learning programming at home?

I just don't know what to think anymore. I don't know if I can trust my own thoughts anymore. Maybe I just imagine I have ADHD, I don't know. I just am so furious now and so angry, about him, but especially about myself because I chickend out again and not dug deaper and asked about the test results or some further explanation.

Ever since I returned home I'm just running back and forth in my apartment not knowing what to do and how to proceed."

I am going to be heading into my sophomore year of a civil engineering degree and have yet to take an open channel hydraulics course or anything regarding general hydrology. 

I have been assigned work in ArcMap and AutoCAD. Lately I have had to delineate drainage basins for various crossing culverts. I recently got LiDAR data that has given me contour lines of a very flat area (primarily agricultural fields). 

I was wondering if any of you had any suggestions or guidance of the best way to determine drainage basins from looking at contours lines. Thus far I have just been going perpendicular to the lines that are crested and pointed.

Previously I taught myself how to determine the drainage basins using DEM using the ArcToolbox Spatial Analyst tool specifically in the hydrology category. Is there anything similar that I can use to help calculate the drainage basins from the shape files of the contour data? All of the contours are given in 1 mi^2 increments. 

Anything in response you can give is greatly appreciated!"

ccc17p,40,2019-07-12,Am I making a terrible decision by transferring?,elfgod55,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ccc17p/am_i_making_a_terrible_decision_by_transferring/,"Right now, I am a to-be Computer Science junior and I have gone to a low ranked state school across the country from my family. I have the majority of it covered in scholarships, but despite this it costs roughly $10k/year. I have a 3.95 GPA, which has been rather easy to get. I do not like it there.

I recently got the benefit of being eligible for in-state tuition at one of the best state schools, which is located very near where my family lives, and excitedly, I applied for transfer, got accepted, and hit the accept button perhaps too soon. It would cost roughly $20k/year for the remaining two years (so roughly +$10k/year more uncovered, or **$20k total \*\*extra\*\* or 60k total as opposed to 40k total, all of which will be in loans**).

&amp;#x200B;

I am failing to be objective here. I have told my family and others that I am transferring, but now I feel like it's a terrible decision. I cannot rely on my family for advice because they just want me to transfer, and are (heartwarmingly but, really, unfortunately) willing to take on a large part of the debt in parent loans. I feel like they are likely making a very regrettable mistake by taking on large sums of debt for my both my sibling and I which, while they may be able to technically afford, are still a large burden for their income that will take away from retirement.

So, **the inevitable decision**: Unrecognized school, high GPA, $20k less **versus** somewhat highly ranked school, probably still high GPA?, $20k more, close to family. I am panicking right now because I feel like the best decision is likely to stick it out for 2 more years at my old university, focus on getting (an) internship(s) and learning on my own, and then begin my career, hopefully quickly overcoming the difference in university name.

I have to commit to one or the other very soon and withdraw from the other, so I would really appreciate any advice that helps me make this difficulty decision.

**\*Edit\***: I am coming from Arkansas, and potentially going to Minnesota (twin cities). I don't consider it to be in the tier of top public schools like GT and I guess I was unclear on the definition of the term. But still, based on agreed upon rankings it is still a great difference in reputability and quality."
ccc7or,835,2019-07-12,"Just accepted my first offer at 35 years old, apparently this still works!",pretend_dev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ccc7or/just_accepted_my_first_offer_at_35_years_old/,"TLDR:  'Changed Industries', Got my old ass a job, feels good!

&amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker here, I haven't contributed since I didn't feel like I would be able to add to any discussion.  There are some good vibes and anecdotal stories here that helped me stay positive and confident to execute on a career change, so perhaps this will be helpful to some as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently turned 35 and by accepting the developer offer I have successfully transitioned from a career in finance (with most experience from call centers) into a software developer!

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my life, I have been in some aspect of financial services / sales, the pay was OK, work hours comfortable, but man does it suck selling financial products to people that directly conflicts with what is best for their investments.

&amp;#x200B;

My career transition began in earnest around October last year, my office was notified that it was subject to a lay off and me and my peers would be out of work.  I was pretty done working in the personal finance industry at that point, so I started planning my escape.

&amp;#x200B;

Coding wasn't entirely new, so I knew that it could be enjoyable, but was also super frustrating, and I had not coded for 3-4 years.  I has some previous coding experience as a financial research associate, where I worked on some data visualization projects and automated the data with perl (in hindsight perl was an awful language for a beginner and since I was on my own, I was super stressed out and lost for a good portion of this role)

&amp;#x200B;

I decided for me the best option was to pivot to web development the absolute fastest route possible.  I enrolled in a local coding bootcamp (and fairly well recognized locally and nationally) which coincidentally started classes a week after the layoff.  Up until I began the bootcamp, I was practicing front end coding regularly to prepare.

&amp;#x200B;

The bootcamp focused on the MERN stack, and was a 13 week program.   My bootcamp experience was a sequence of emotional highs and lows, but I probably ended up working harder than I ever had my entire life, making up for being a piss poor student in my younger years (not awful grades, I was just super lazy).  When I finished I felt like I didn't have enough grasp of the subject material, however the school asked me to be a part of their intern program to help the next batch of students.  I jumped on this opportunity and it proved to be super helpful in getting my current offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the internship wrapped up, I focused my efforts on breaking into the industry.  My search was actually surprisingly brief, a mere 4 weeks, \~30 applications before I hit this lead.  The job was for a full stack developer position using Java / Spring for a fintech SASS company... an entirely different stack than what I studied with exception to React.  I studied the job posting and the tech language used to prepare for the initial phone interview which turned out to be quasi-technical regarding OOP concepts.  I stumbled my way through enough that I got an invite to the second, and the recruiter may have sensed that I was a weaker candidate, so she told me to study up on SOLID design principles and OOP concepts for the on-site.   

Guess what I did all day, every day until my on-site? 

At the 2nd interview, one of the first questions they asked was how familiar I was with Java, I said "" To be honest, I didn't know anything until about a week ago when I had my phone interview, I have been studying it ever since.""  I think that was huge to show I was honest, and I think they took it easy on me when they challenged me to make a Class Map using for a controller.  Lots of ""uhs, ums, I'm not quite sure's"", but I was able to answer questions regarding SRP, O-CP, and also identify where the ""App""  we were white boarding needed dependency injection (after some help from them)

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow they felt I would work.  I think the internship was super helpful, as I got the opportunity to teach and explain coding concepts so I could at least sound intelligent when I knew the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually accepted an offer for many thousands more than what I had been previously making, and above Jr / entry level developer salaries are in my city.

&amp;#x200B;

A few anecdotes:

* I feel like I had to pull all the advantages I could offer together to successfully pivot into the industry.  I was focusing on fin techs and financial companies since I could point to industry experience.  I got very helpful experience discussing code as an instructor intern, and my sales background was super helpful to be confident in front of strangers, help promote my strengths, etc.
* The only jobs I heard back from (had a couple other interviews) were for Full Stack 3-5 years experience job postings.  Never heard back from any postings for Jr Devs.
* Due to Boot Camps, I  think my chances were improved **because** I applied to a job outside of the stack I was taught.  Less competition and whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

All I have to do now is not suck.  Which is going to be super hard.  And learn.  A lot.  But shit, here I am!"

I'm lazy, blind, and haven't guided myself throughout my college career.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make a change and learn more about finance. I only know so much about personal finance.

I want to learn the different areas, what might suit me, and how to find my ""niche"". I'm sure these are all things that come with me, effort, and the desire for knowledge.

The logistical challenge is ensuring that the amount of raw materials delivered aligns with the output of factories because output is constantly changing due to the various logistical challenges that our factories face. Output is able to be projected fairly accurately a few days out so we have an idea about the amount of trucking loads needed, but are only able to make schedules one day in advance, which isn't the issue, it is tracking the arrival and completion of these shipments because this schedule never stays the same due to truckers calling out, or production decreasing for some unforeseen reason. When driver schedules are released we use the assigned purchase orders to generate bill of ladings which are legal documents that are used by the carriers and consignees to confirm the arrival of goods. When the BOLs are created we paste them along with the day's schedule into an excel spreadsheet where we attempt to track their status and mark it as ""completed,"" ""deleted,"" or ""open."" We are able to easily paste the BOL numbers into our SAP software and determine the status of the shipments, but this process is tedious and falls short in many facets.

What often happens is that production will decrease at one factory and increase at another so a driver's load/schedule will change and prompt the deletion of their previous BOL, and the generation of a new BOL, which almost ever gets documented in our BOL and and schedule tracker. We need to be able to track the deletion and creation of the new BOLs in our document more efficiently since I won't be here forever, and my supervisor spends most of her time sifting through BOLs from prior years trying to determine whether accounts payable can issue payment to carriers or not. We use an SAP enterprise application to track all our shipments, but there is no way to directly link it to excel and she mentioned that there used to be a type of macro that could automatically track the bills. I am curious if you guys have any thoughts on how to best track these? I am thinking that I could attempt to build a macro that models the tracking process in SAP, but I am not sure where to start. Let me know if you guys have any thoughts other than better communication between everyone who handles BOLs."

If anyone is interested... I have started a platform called Tethys Engineering with my father. It is basically a website where employers and students come together and create/participate in a virtual internship. The point of the website is to allow students to pay off college debt while in university and employers love to pay students $15-$20 an hour for tasks that their employees would do for much much more (huge deal for employers).

Employers come and go when they have opportunities but it's extremely useful for students to stay active on the website.

Currently there's an opportunity to do data manipulation and organization for a minimum of 10 hours a week at a pay of $15 per hour. This opportunity will last about 6 weeks. An example of what you would do for this opp. is look at LinkedIn profiles... if someone labels themselves as ""President of Engineering"" another labels themselves as ""COO of Engineering"" you would group them together because they're essentially the same position. It's simple data manipulation and organization that you will keep track in a spreadsheet.

The website is [tethysengineering.com](https://tethysengineering.com/) and if anyone is interested please create and account, select the student membership for $0/month, go to the left side column on the main page and click apprenticeship&gt;my diary&gt; new entry and begin listing previous experience, achievements, or know-hows. Please build your profile this weekend as the job will most likely start beginning-mid of this coming week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Career Objectives and Background Essay**

**Career Objective:** *To utilize advances in high-performance computing, machine learning and data science to facilitate further research in quantum and astrophysics.*

&amp;#x200B;

My Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Physics has helped develop my strong foundational knowledge of mathematics and statistics. As part of the degree, I had the opportunity to take four different modules on advanced mathematics. I am also well-grounded in numerical and statistical methods, having learned about Bayesian statistics, linear regression, and numerical methods. Additionally, several of my electives focused on electrical engineering, and these will lend themselves well to the hardware aspect of computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I possess first-hand research experience through my internship at Some Research Center (SRC) at Some University. During this time, I researched ways of optimizing the performance of Brillouin-Erbium Fiber Lasers (BEFLs). The latter part of my work at the SRC focused on learning to utilize BeamPROP and CAD software to simulate optical devices. Despite having little exposure with both experimental photonics and the use of CAD software prior to this internship. I was quick to learn about them and am confident in my ability to show the same aptitude for learning in the OMSCS program.

&amp;#x200B;

While I lack an extensive background in programming, I have been arduously working to fill the gaps in my knowledge in this regard. I have familiarized myself with Python and its related data structures via online MOOCs and am now pursuing more advanced courses in algorithmic design and data structures.

&amp;#x200B;

In my final year, I pursued a theoretical thesis that reviewed the mathematical precepts behind quantum state discrimination strategies. My goal with the OMSCS program is to synthesize my research experience and the computational tools I learn via OMSCS to pursue advanced research in quantum mechanics and astrophysics, an area where high-performance computing and data science have become increasingly prominent.

  

**Statement of Purpose**

Following the completion of my undergraduate degree in physics, I have decided to continue my postgraduate education in computer science. While I am acutely aware of the challenging nature of the proposition, I believe I possess the necessary skills and the correct attitude to accomplish my goal.

&amp;#x200B;

After high school, I had the same mark (A+) in both accounting and physics; I chose to study the latter, despite my parents’ apprehension. The primary motivator behind that decision was my interest in understanding systems at large. Since high school, I have had a varied range of interests: economics, sociology, psychology, physics and philosophy. I have always been drawn to these subjects because they are dedicated to extracting general rules and laws underpinning the behavior of complex and large-scale systems. My interest in computer science is borne of that same desire.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the limited educational options I had in X country, I decided to pursue my academic goals in another country. Unfortunately, near the start of my degree, my family ran into financial troubles, and there were times when I contemplated dropping out. Despite the challenges, I decided to push forward and work part-time as an online journalist to fund my studies. This put a significant strain on me, and my academic performance was greatly affected by the change. I graduated as a valedictorian from my high school and was also the recipient of a two-year scholarship, but my results now were far below what I knew I was capable of. I had to extend my studies for the same reason. I eventually became better at managing my time and have worked on consistently improving my GPA in the last year of my study.

&amp;#x200B;

As I progressed with my studies, it became increasingly more apparent that the way modern research is being conducted has changed rapidly, relying increasingly on the use of computational processing across disciplines. While our lecturers often talked about using Python or R for their research, we were still dealing with theoretical concepts written on the board. The increasing importance of computational physics and my lack of experience with it was something I wished to rectify. Therefore, I decided to pursue a master’s degree in computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

I was first introduced to coding during my Computational Physics course, which encompassed the use of MATLAB in employing numerical methods to solve physical problems. My next encounter with coding came when studying Optoelectronics. The lecturer set an assignment requiring us to code a program in Excel VBA to determine the optical output at the end of an optical waveguide. This was initially quite daunting for the class, as we had very little experience with coding. However, I turned to online resources on Excel macros and had crafted a solution within a few days. This was when I started to realize that I enjoy the puzzle-like nature of coding, and I have since started learning to code via MOOCs.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal with this degree is to learn the necessary tools to perform cutting-edge research in physics. The machine learning specialization, coupled with courses on high-performance computing and data analysis, is of particular interest to me and would allow me to contribute to exciting new research in astrophysics or in developing methods of determining the state of qubits, which would blend well with my final year project on quantum measurement.

&amp;#x200B;

A large factor that contributed to my difficulties during my degree was juggling work and full-time study. Since I also work online, an online master’s degree would allow me to switch between work and study with the mere click of a button, saving me hours every day in commuting alone. Georgia Tech’s OMSCS program has a sterling reputation and the low cost of the program combined with the flexibility it offers will ensure I can continue working without having to compromise my studies. I would be honored to be a part of the program and would be grateful for your consideration."

I do not know if I can call this depression but I am looking for help.

I am a 22 year old guy who is having some issues with himself and have a hard time finding out what it is and how to work on it.

My life is great! I have good firends, have work (at the moment then), have great parents even though they are divorced, a tiny but good family. 

You probably think dude what’s wrong with you everything is good. Well the issue is is that I am having a hard time deciding how I want to earn my bread (income) later. 

At the moment I am doing a bachelor Software Engineering and i started when I was 17 years old. I am 22 years old now and I’m in my fourth year after a hard period of thinking to quit because it was either too hard for me or I didn’t like doing it.

Either way I kept going and my internship was great even though I did not much work that had to do anything with my study. The only thing that stands in my way are 6,7 courses and then final internship. 


But ever since February I couldn’t push myself to study even though I had alot of time in my hand. I just didn’t want to do it when I would normally push myself. Now it’s July and I couldn’t even finish 1 course… now I am even longer busy with my study’s but the worst part is is that I started thinking do I really want to keep going like this? How else am I going to earn my income when I do not know what I want to do later? Can I really pull of a 40 hour work week for 50 years? I am worried and confused in life at the moment and I do not know where to go… 


Also my motivation for life is like gone. It’s like my interest for the world is gone. The only thing I am doing is gaming except when my friends planned to do something. I cannot motivate myself to do other things like go exercise. Normally when you have something planned with friends you get excited and look forward to it. I do not have this excitement anymore and I do not know why but it makes me very sad and I do not know how to handle this.
 
Any advice is welcome to help me resolve this itch on my back that I cannot seem to remove"

On the other hand, GSU is right in the heart of ATL and has great internship and networking opportunities and is cheaper.

First-generation immigrant (parents from India), born in the US but now live in Canada (Ontario), have a **dual Canadian US citizenship** which I've heard helps

**Stats: (All Ontario Secondary School Academic Courses, not sure how to get an accurate GPA)**

Grade 9 average: **90.75%** (There are obvious outliers in here such as mandatory gym, drama, and french courses, so how does this affect me?)

Grade 10 average: **93.125%**

Grade 11 average: **91.78%**

Grade 12: Have taken Advanced Functions (Grade 12 Math) in Grade 11 - **97%**

Many of my grade 11 courses, I took in Grade 10 if that changes anything

**Collegeboard stuff:**

Self studied for **AP Macro (5), AP Micro (5)**, not offered at my school - I am wondering if taking anymore in Grade 12 matters or just telling them my reason for not having more is justifiable and I focus on school grades

**SAT - 1500** (730 reading, 770 math)

**SAT Math II - 770**

Both my SAT scores are very weak, and I only have one more opportunity in October to take a test, so which one should I take?

**In-School ECs**

* Debate Club (9, 10)
* Entrepreneurship Club Member (9-11)
* Entrepreneurship Club Vice President (12), create training for every meeting plan, will host an ongoing case competition throughout the year, and have them develop their own ideas to pitch for a final pitch competition at the end of the year
* Psychology Club Co-Founder (11-12) --&gt; clubs for fun more than anything
* Math tutor (11, 12) - brought a students mark from 26% almost halfway through the semester to passing lol

**ECs outside of school**

* Placed first at a few small business pitch competitions
* Ran a business in grade 10 and was the ""Vice President of Sales"" - produced our own design and sold 200 wallets, developed a website, ran social media page, etc. This summer I have been giving a $3k grant from the government and am continuing the business as the CEO of the company and will be running it primarily as e-commerce
* Ran another tech-based business in grade 11 ""Vice President of Technology and Product"" - can't go into specifics but involved hosting a hackathon for university students and creating an online platform, received &gt; $10K in sponsorships from quite big companies
* Will be running another business during grade 12 school year, don't know what yet though
* Working as an unpaid intern downtown Toronto at a start-up doing business consulting (literally doing research on plans for the business to expand into other cities ) and presenting it to the company, work on some tech stuff there as well through learning from them 
* Will be at an business incubator program next month 
* ""Cities Youth Action Committee"" Director of Logistics (11, 12) - I organize events sponsored by the government for youth of the city, 6 events throughout the year, 100+ in attendance for some, each event has different age groups and are of completely different complexities to manage
* Lost 40+ pounds and en route to lose 20 more (don't know if this is something worth talking about)

ccj2ha,180,2019-07-12,PSA: Recruiters And Staffers Are Not Your Friends,BagofBabbish,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ccj2ha/psa_recruiters_and_staffers_are_not_your_friends/,"I've seen a lot of advice telling job seekers and unconventional candidates to work with a recruiter and I wanted to dispell this and set the record straight. If you are not already a fairly conventional candidate, then the recruiter will not likely lobby for you to be hired. They also are transactional salesmen who make a living by selling their inventory of commodities (you), so, expect some shady shit from the less ethical/more desperate guys. I spent almost a year unemployed before my current job and I wanted to share a few things to look out for:

1. **The dangling carrot.** Recruiters will employ what I call the ""dangling carrot"" method to keep their candidate pool large and engaged. This means having an initial consultation with a candidate and pitching the BEST jobs to them, and subsequently telling them they will submit them for consideration, but that they are a long way out. In the meantime, they will periodically check up on you to let you know ""this one is still a way's out, but I have this other job which can start you now! It's not quite what you wanted, but it's something"". I would be cautious and remember the old ""too good to be true"" mantra.
2. **The bait &amp; switch.** This one is a little more dishonest and it's EXTREMELY common in consulting. You'll get a message from a recruiter via inMail that goes something like ""Analyst Opportunity!"" and the description will be something like ""I have a contract with a large consulting firm, think Delloite or PwC, that's looking to bring on a few analysts for a major project. This is an awesome opportunity, these dudes are sharp, and if they like your work, they're known to retain talent full-time"". Then you take the gig and find yourself doing bulk data-entry with no shot at converting to perm. This isn't an analyst job it's a grunt labor role that the recruiter misled you into taking so he could get paid.
3. **The creative liberty.** This one is a close cousin to the bait &amp; switch, but it's a bit different and a little sneakier. In this instance, the recruiter will present you real full-time jobs and retitle them a bit to sound more appealing so you mistakenly take them. For example, I had one guy pitch a ""Rotational Analyst Program at Alliance Bernstein"". I independently verified the job and pushed for the listing, when I got it the ""Rotational Analyst program"" was actually an unassigned ""Client Services Associate"" (ie. not working with one specific FA, but several). I called him out on this and he said that I'd great exposure to lots of teams and when I'm done, I can lateral to an analyst. I pointed out how the description said I could graduate to an advisor and he said: ""let me get back to you on that"" (of course he never did).
4. **The resume botch job.** Recruiters always think they know resumes and interviews best. This is only true in the cases of the experienced guys, but for the average 20 something whose never actually been in the field they're hiring for, this is often bs. My favorite aspect of job searching was going into a staffer arranged interview and having a wildly different resume in the hands of the interviewer than my own. One merged my internship with my first job, which made me look like a junior partner at a PE firm previously and almost all of them neglected to mention experience that many interviewers (including the ones who hired me) were most interested in, because they didn't believe in it and thought it would be better hidden. If you are an unconventional candidate trying to build your own experience, you are almost definitely going to fall victim to this.
5. **The take it or leave it.** The take it or leave it often comes from the more reputable staffers (ie the Shelby Jennings and the New York circuit). These people have a reputation to uphold and, while they're happy to help you out if they can, they're not going to send you where you want to be sent. Instead, they'll offer a lot of FinTech support roles and pitch the fact that a lot of the guys there are ""CFAs"". You can tell them, thanks, but no thanks, but they'll usually either tell you ""this is it"" or ""Okay, I'll keep my eye out"" (read: You're not qualified and I can't help you).

You have to remember these guys make a living by QCing candidates before they walk into the interview room and delivering consistent quality. These guys are not here to pitch your case or to convince anyone to take a chance on you, if they do that, they'll risk losing the client. You are much better off pitching your case yourself (perhaps after talking with a recruiter for honest feedback) to the guys making the decisions on the desk you want to be on itself or to the internal HR professionals at the firm, who are working off a salary, not a % of your paycheck. Think about it like this, if a barber was harassing you to get a haircut you didn't want, you're likely to get annoyed and go somewhere else, but if a friend pitches it convinces you to give it a chance, then you're more likely to go with it- but only because it wasn't solicited to you. If you're an experienced hire and already a decent candidate or a recruiter sends you a good opportunity, don't be afraid to take it or work with them, but always be wary of strangers soliciting your for anything and keep these things in mind.

EDIT: TLDR- recruiters are salesmen that work for the hiring firm and not you. They aren’t like doctors and can’t write a prescription and give you a job."

My internship is 16 weeks and I would like to make the most of it. My goal is to contribute to a feature that is used in production. How long did it take you to get familiar with and contribute at a company?

I just found out I don't qualify for enough financial aid this semester to cover tuition, and I can't afford it. What do?",EnglishMobster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ccm6wy/college_senior_with_a_few_classes_to_go/,"I'm an intern working at a major tech company. I asked early on if I could stay on after my internship. My bosses have decided that they want to keep me, but it's currently going through all the people in charge of headcount and I haven't formally received an offer yet. Even so, my bosses have said it's a 99.9% chance they'll be able to give me an offer to stay on. I'd be hourly, like I am at my internship, and the idea is I could take a morning off to go to classes and come in later in the afternoons.

I was planning on going back to school in the fall, and I already have classes set up. But the issue is I'm only getting half of my usual financial aid for some reason, and tuition is due next week. My girlfriend just had hours cut back significantly at her job, and now it's a choice between paying rent and going to school.

The problem is I had mentioned to my employer that I should be graduating in the spring, and losing these classes will push me back by another semester. I'm not sure really what to do; on the one hand I already have a job in my chosen field now (assuming that offer does come through), and they're very pleased with my work and have pretty much brought me in as a full junior employee already.

On the other hand I *do* want to get my degree, if only because I don't want the lack of a degree to hold me back in the future. The issue is I simply can't afford it this semester and I rejected loans before I knew how expensive tuition was. There's also the fact that depending on what classes I wind up getting, it might be very hard to juggle work and school depending on when classes are, and my college doesn't offer any online courses for CS degrees. I'm also nervous about telling them it's going to be another semester, in case they back out of the offer for some reason.

How much would not having a degree hold me back? I'd like to stay with this company for 4-5 years and get some solid experience (or until the project dies down and I get let go, if that were to happen). Then I'd like to try to stay a developer within the industry, but if I do need to drop out I don't want it to hold me back.

How much does experience count versus schooling?"

As you may have heard, the UC schools have a new application portal this year, which is slightly different from the previous one. You will be one of the first people to apply to UC schools with this new system. To help you apply, I've put together a short guide. I found applying needlessly complicated last year using the old system, so hopefully, this guide will help take some of the confusion out for you.

The UC application is divided into *7 primary sections*.

* About you
* Campuses &amp; majors
* Academic history
* Test scores
* Activites &amp; awards
* Scholarships &amp; programs
* Personal insight

# About you

In this section, you will be filling in personal info. You shouldn't have too much of an issue filling in these fields. Just as a note, your citizenship will determine which pool of applicants you are placed into, and residency will determine your applicant pool **and** tuition.

UC places its applicants into three general pools, each increasingly harder than the last to be admitted. California residents pay the least on tuition, somewhere in the ballpark of $10-20k in tuition, out-of-state US citizens and international students pay around $35-45k. California students are also more likely to be admitted, but you must be living in and graduate from a CA high school to qualify.

[For reference](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/student-profile), at UC Berkeley in 2018, the admissions rate for CA residents was 17.1%, for OOS students 15.4% and for international students 8.7%. CA residents also have a lower average GPA and standardized test scores.

UC schools are prohibited by law from using affirmative action to admit students.

At the end of the section, you will have a chance to review all the information you submitted.

# Campuses and majors

In this section, you will select which of the 9 UC campuses to apply to. Not all UC schools are created equal, and some are definitely easier to get into than others, but this doesn't mean any one campus is ""bad"". You will get a quality education from any UC campus.

|*School*|*Acceptance Rate for Class of 2023*|*QS World Ranking*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|UC Berkeley|16.8%|28|
|UC Los Angeles (UCLA)|12.4%|35|
|UC San Diego (UCSD)|32.3%|45|
|UC Davis|39.1%|104|
|UC Santa Barbara (UCSB)|29.7%|135|
|UC Irvine|26.6%|219|
|UC Santa Cruz (UCSC)|51.8%|367|
|UC Riverside|56.7%|454|
|UC Merced|75.4%|Unranked|

While creating your account, you were asked which term you were applying for admission into.

You will then get a beautiful map of where all the UC campuses are, which is new to the appl. system. This page also gives you an estimated total application cost, and this cost will automatically be deducted if you qualify for a fee waiver:

[https://i.postimg.cc/CKTCr4hB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-08-13-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CKTCr4hB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-08-13-PM.png)

After choosing a major, some campuses will let you pick both a major and an alternate major. UC campuses and colleges differ in how they admit students. Some admit students directly into a major or pre-major, while others, like Berkeley's Letters and Science, admit students to the college as an undeclared.

# Academic history

On this section, you will fill in the high schools you went to, and what grades you receive. While it is theoretically possible to lie, once you are admitted, you will need to send in your transcript (or rather, your school counselor must send it in). The grades must match exactly, and any significant differences would likely jeopardize your admission, so fill this section out truthfully and honestly.

[https://i.postimg.cc/N0663rFN/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-10-01-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/N0663rFN/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-10-01-PM.png)

They will first ask you if you took any high school courses while in grades 7 and 8. They do not care about other courses you took in this time.

[https://i.postimg.cc/hPZpsxQT/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-11-55-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hPZpsxQT/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-11-55-PM.png)

You will then need to add your high school:

[https://i.postimg.cc/C1CcsQbx/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-12-40-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/C1CcsQbx/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-12-40-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/fyKgDrbr/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-13-12-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fyKgDrbr/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-13-12-PM.png)

As well as other basic info such as how often grades are reported and on what scale. You can add more than one:

[https://i.postimg.cc/j5q7BgG5/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-16-08-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/j5q7BgG5/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-16-08-PM.png)

You will then need to fill in every course you took and what grade you got between 9th and 12th grades inclusive.

[https://i.postimg.cc/qqd9kKxz/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-18-47-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qqd9kKxz/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-18-47-PM.png)

You should also report if you took any college classes while you were in high school, and where.

[https://i.postimg.cc/nhkVNFZ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-31-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhkVNFZ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-31-PM.png)

And finally, there is an ""other info"" section you can use to clarify anything unclear here, such as your school's grading system (if you ticked other) etc.

[https://i.postimg.cc/PJ8BH4DG/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-53-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/PJ8BH4DG/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-20-53-PM.png)

# Test scores

Here, you should fill in any ACT or SAT scores you have, and when you are planning to submit. For fall entry, you can last take an SAT/ACT in December, which must be immediately sent as the score is received.

Any scores you self-report here must be sent to the school electronically via CollegeBoard or the ACT website.

[https://i.postimg.cc/fRZTHt4W/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-21-43-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fRZTHt4W/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-21-43-PM.png)

You can send in a score to any UC campus and it will be received by any UC campus you apply to (I think this is still valid, I only sent in my score to Berkeley and UCLA offered me admission).

[https://i.postimg.cc/1XhZf2sR/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-22-18-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1XhZf2sR/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-22-18-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/pdSvtySF/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-14-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pdSvtySF/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-14-PM.png)

This is what it will look like once you fill in your scores:

[https://i.postimg.cc/wjTYyh8N/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-52-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wjTYyh8N/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-23-52-PM.png)

You will then be asked if you have any SAT Subject tests. You will also need to verify any self-reported scores by sending them to the school.

[https://i.postimg.cc/fLP61FJj/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-24-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fLP61FJj/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-24-PM.png)

You will also need to report AP scores, if you took any AP classes:

[https://i.postimg.cc/3wtMFWhq/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-50-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/3wtMFWhq/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-24-50-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/1zsPKLq8/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-19-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1zsPKLq8/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-19-PM.png)

[https://i.postimg.cc/LXvsfmQ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-44-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/LXvsfmQ4/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-25-44-PM.png)

Or IB scores, if you took IB:

[https://i.postimg.cc/wBpxG1ST/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-26-11-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wBpxG1ST/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-26-11-PM.png)

Any exam you have a predicted grade for should be filled in predicted grades. You cannot add the same class to both the first section and the second section.

[https://i.postimg.cc/WbzdGJPB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-27-12-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/WbzdGJPB/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-27-12-PM.png)

You also need to report your TOEFL or IELTS score, if you have one (needed if your school does not teach primarily in English), as well as other exams such as O-levels or GCSE and their scores. You do not need to send in official reports.

# Activities and Awards

In this redesigned activities section, you can report up to twenty activites you may have done, including:

* Award or honor
* Educational preparation programs
* Extracurricular activity
* Other coursework
* Volunteer/Community service
* Work experience

[https://i.postimg.cc/pRL5b3ns/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-30-51-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pRL5b3ns/scrnli-7-13-2019-11-30-51-PM.png)

For awards and honors, you will need to name the award, the level of recognition (was it an international competition? state tournament?), whether the award was academic, when you received the award, and now, explain how award recipients are chosen and why you got it. These short explanations are new to the new UC application. In the previous application, you could only fill in 5 activities for each kind, but you did not have to explain how awards were chosen etc. It was simply a list.

Of course, that's a good mix to have. Try to do one activity in each, so you will have at least something to report. It doesn't mean focus on having an equivalent award in each - you can rarely have an international level math award and also be a well known activist, for example - but try to show the schools that beyond your one hook, you can also do other things. Again, it's fine if you don't have one in every single one - I was admitted to both schools I applied to without having work experience, college coursework or research work that colleges like.

# Scholarships &amp; programs

You will now be asked if you want to apply for any scholarships:

# Personal insight

Here, you will find the ""application essays"" every college asks for. UC schools require 4 essays of 250-350 words each, but one set of four essays is used for all 9 campuses you apply to. Write these essays prior to beginning the application and simply copy paste them into the fields when you're actually applying. Here are the eight questions/prompts:

&gt;From the UC website:  
&gt;  
&gt;**1. Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time.**  *Things to consider:* A leadership role can mean more than just a title. It can mean being a mentor to others, acting as the person in charge of a specific task, or taking the lead role in organizing an event or project. Think about what you accomplished and what you learned from the experience. What were your responsibilities?   
&gt;  
&gt;Did you lead a team? How did your experience change your perspective on leading others? Did you help to resolve an important dispute at your school, church, in your community or an organization? And your leadership role doesn’t necessarily have to be limited to school activities. For example, do you help out or take care of your family?  
&gt;  
&gt;**2. Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.** *Things to consider:* What does creativity mean to you? Do you have a creative skill that is important to you? What have you been able to do with that skill? If you used creativity to solve a problem, what was your solution? What are the steps you took to solve the problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;How does your creativity influence your decisions inside or outside the classroom? Does your creativity relate to your major or a future career?  
&gt;  
&gt;**3. What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?**  *Things to consider:* If there’s a talent or skill that you’re proud of, this is the time to share it. You don’t necessarily have to be recognized or have received awards for your talent (although if you did and you want to talk about it, feel free to do so). Why is this talent or skill meaningful to you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Does the talent come naturally or have you worked hard to develop this skill or talent? Does your talent or skill allow you opportunities in or outside the classroom? If so, what are they and how do they fit into your schedule?  
&gt;  
&gt;**4. Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.** *Things to consider:* An educational opportunity can be anything that has added value to your educational experience and better prepared you for college. For example, participation in an honors or academic enrichment program, or enrollment in an academy that’s geared toward an occupation or a major, or taking advanced courses that interest you — just to name a few.   
&gt;  
&gt;If you choose to write about educational barriers you’ve faced, how did you overcome or strive to overcome them? What personal characteristics or skills did you call on to overcome this challenge? How did overcoming this barrier help shape who are you today?  
&gt;  
&gt;**5. Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?** *Things to consider:* A challenge could be personal, or something you have faced in your community or school. Why was the challenge significant to you? This is a good opportunity to talk about any obstacles you’ve faced and what you’ve learned from the experience. Did you have support from someone else or did you handle it alone?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’re currently working your way through a challenge, what are you doing now, and does that affect different aspects of your life? For example, ask yourself, “How has my life changed at home, at my school, with my friends or with my family?”  
&gt;  
&gt;**6.  Think about an academic subject that inspires you. Describe how you have furthered this interest inside and/or outside of the classroom.** *Things to consider:*  Many students have a passion for one specific academic subject area, something that they just can’t get enough of. If that applies to you, what have you done to further that interest? Discuss how your interest in the subject developed and describe any experience you have had inside and outside the classroom — such as volunteer work, internships, employment, summer programs, participation in student organizations and/or clubs — and what you have gained from your involvement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Has your interest in the subject influenced you in choosing a major and/or future career? Have you been able to pursue coursework at a higher level in this subject (honors, AP, IB, college or university work)? Are you inspired to pursue this subject further at UC, and how might you do that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**7. What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?**  *Things to consider:* Think of community as a term that can encompass a group, team or a place — like your high school, hometown or home. You can define community as you see fit, just make sure you talk about your role in that community. Was there a problem that you wanted to fix in your community?  
&gt;  
&gt;Why were you inspired to act? What did you learn from your effort? How did your actions benefit others, the wider community or both? Did you work alone or with others to initiate change in your community?  
&gt;  
&gt;**8. Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you stand out as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?** *Things to consider:*  If there’s anything you want us to know about you, but didn’t find a question or place in the application to tell us, now’s your chance. What have you not shared with us that will highlight a skill, talent, challenge or opportunity that you think will help us know you better?  
&gt;  
&gt;From your point of view, what do you feel makes you an excellent choice for UC? Don’t be afraid to brag a little.

You can also fill in any additional details you have that do not fit in an essay, such as any limiting conditions you may have had, a reason for a bad grade in your transcript, or any other info you feel can help the application reader get a better understanding of you as a person.

ccrx7b,2,2019-07-13,Chance A Decent but Unexceptional Shotgunner,perspica,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/ccrx7b/chance_a_decent_but_unexceptional_shotgunner/,"White Female New York; Upper Class

Large public school (2500); high Hispanic demographic and a significant portion of kindergarteners do not speak any English at all and as a result, standardized testing is abysmal (significant percentage of elementary school bottom 5 percentile for state). High opt-out rates of state standardized testing have landed us on some sort of state watch list. A handful of Harvard acceptances over the years, one recruited Princeton athlete, one recruited Stanford athlete, about 3 Cornell acceptances a year.

**Stats**

about 101.3 GPA weighted, don’t know unweighted but probably around 97 (no maximum GPA; honors weighted 1.05 and AP 1.1)

Ranked 16/575 as of beginning of junior year, counsellor expects me to be 8/9 when rank is recalculated start of senior year, may go up even more when rank is recalculated in December of senior year

Strong upward trend (8th grade-92, 9th grade-99, 10th grade-103.5, 11th grade-105.9)

I expect to graduate with a 102 weighted GPA and probably ranked 8/9th.

**ECs**

Robotics: Secondary software leader (not main code, I do like lights + vision); Outreach (""chairmans"") Leader + Team Presenter (host STEMinars for Girls, volunteer at coding clubs at middle school, host international teams); awards detailed below;

Science Olympiads: Team started this year; founding member; at our first comp was one of two partnerships to medal. No leadership this year; may have leadership next year.

Academic Team: JV Captain; next year Varsity Captain, we're trash but it's fun;

Corporate Club/Class: Club that's also a class grade for some reason; honestly I hate it but I like the opportunities; host multiple events with local small businesses; shadowed at local hospital and won $3000 award in resulting competition (I wasn't an original team presenter because I kinda try to minimize my interaction with the club as much as possible, but on the day of the presentation no one really knew what they were doing so I learned the presentation + stepped in); 2 month/20 hour internship with local psychotherapist (was supposed to be placed for neurology internship but club organizer messed up :/)

Model United Nations: basic MUN stuff, I chair at our home conference so I overview debate

PTSA: School's PTA but with students involved; community service;

Honors Societies;

Rowing: Most of my extracurriculars end in spring so I joined a rowing club; major time commitment (1 hour away and 2.5 hour practice); since I'm older + just started I am not really competitive for recruitment (that being said, same team is very competitive and had a girl my height join the same time last year and end up getting recruited so who knows); 5 hour practice over summer

Next year I may run for president of Science Olympiads/ History Honors Society

**Awards:**

NCWIT Rising Star: in recognition of being female and active with computer science; pretty low-level but allows for me to run program with local organizations teaching younger girls compsci; will maybe teach local girl scout troop;

(don't know if team awards count but I was very involved with this) Regional FIRST Robotics Engineering Inspiration + Chairmans Award: Both in recognition of community outreach/STEM initiatives; team leader on this + Chairmans is most prestigious Robotics award;

9th in Regional Science Olympiads for Anatomy and Physiology: I know this isn't that impressive but it was our team's first year;

Research award at local science fair (pretty low-level);

Not particularly optimistic about this but I’m looking to submit a research paper of mine to an international social sciences competition/journal for highschoolers; would get results before application deadlines

**Summer:**

Freshmen: One of two students selected for camp under federal judge to learn about legal system;

Sophomore: Community College class;

Junior: 5 hour crew practice; research on tuberculosis at national laboratory (extends into school year)

She's not interested in hybrid touch screens either.  


Probably don't need anything super for a graphics card so maybe that'll bring down price a bit, would prefer no more than $1k, but cheaper would be better.

The thing is I don’t know what constitutes a “side project”? As in: I have no idea how complex my code has to be in order to be considered good enough to put in my resume. Furthermore I’ve only learned java and Python so so far I can only display things into a console or using the Swing library in Java. I feel the need to learn javascript for this project but every time I try to write anything using it I end up getting frustrated. 

Would displaying something on a popup window or in the console be enough for a side project? How complex does it have to be? For example a program that calculates BMI would be too simple—how complex do I have to go?

This post goes out to the rising seniors about to go through the process, and think if they don't go to an HYPSM their life is over. 

When I started this college process almost a year ago, I was at a complete loss; my mom was first-generation, and my sister has a disability, so I had no clue about what I was going to do. My school has a very strange style of education and doesn't send anyone to ivies, or even T20. I had good grades, test scores, and extracurriculars, so I'd figured I'd just write good essays and I'd be set.

I applied to Wharton early and ended up getting deferred, and got into a UNC/UVA EA OOS. I thought that this was looking to be pretty good for regular decision. When regular decision came around, I ended up getting into none of the schools I wanted to and got waitlisted at a bunch of places, while all the kids who went to fancy-schmancy private schools and legacy got into their first choices. I was absolutely downtrodden having worked that hard for those results. But there was one great school that had waitlisted me: Harvard.

I decided to have my head of school talk to my admissions counselor, and their call went over great. My counselor is apparently one of the longest-tenured AOs at Harvard, so I was thrilled to hear this, but I figured out nothing would come of it. I had been planning a vacation for a while to a country I really wanted to go with, and so I departed. Little did I know the first day there, I would wake up with a voicemail telling me he wanted to go to Cambridge to interview. 

I was absolutely thrilled at first, but then I realized: I really do have shit luck. Skype interviews have never been my forte, and with this jet-lag, I was definitely going to have some issues. But I ended up scheduling one anyways, cause it was the only option I had. It ended up going fine, with a three on one skype interview, and even my AO said so well, but I had a nagging feeling it wasn't as good as it could've been. I ended up trying to enjoy the rest of the vacation, but there was a sour aftertaste, even though everyone who had gotten this interview had gotten in. 

A week before my graduation, I got a status update saying I was rejected; I was absolutely heartbroken and had a really bad time until recently. I had no clue what happened, and he gave me the average schpiel of how they ""had so many great candidates"" yadada yada yada. I was committed to a T25 I really didn't want to go to due to personal reasons (and I still may transfer out) but I decided to make the most of my summer. Through networking, I ended up getting 3! internships at different places (One in consulting, one at a HF, and one at a finance startup). I networked with a school alum, who is a C-Suite at a company that I really wanted to work with who offered to take me under his wing to guide me through the process. I wouldn't have had the drive to work this hard if Harvard hadn't rejected me.

After a kid I knew ended up getting z-listed due to legacy family connections (like every other z-lister) I decided to make a trip up to Cambridge to see if there was any shot at it. I met with the senior AO, and after I told him everything I'm doing this summer, the dude looked sad. I could tell that he wanted me there, and was impressed by everything I had done, but the committee had overruled him. He told me one thing to the extent of: ""If you keep on having the drive you have, I know you'll do great things."" 

Crazily enough, if I was accepted to Harvard, I would've been complacent, and not try as hard, and wouldn't have made the connections I had. I can't believe I'm saying this, but getting rejected by Harvard has set me up for success in life. So remember, to all the prospies, just because you get rejected from Harvard or similar doesn't mean you're not good enough and vice-versa. There will always be people better than you, but you just have to work harder. Also, even if you're an introvert and hate socializing, put yourself out there and good things will happen. I still am sorta an introvert, but I read Dale Carnegie and it changed my whole perspective."
ccx058,1,2019-07-13,transfer??,ryooo112,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ccx058/transfer/,"I just finished my freshman year a university about an hour and a half away from my hometown- it was not the best year. I had somewhat severe anxiety while there, and my environment was not positive for me at all. My roommate was a total piece of shit and although my friends there at times were decent, at others they were completely unsupportive and very selfish. There are some pros about being at the school- I’ve made like 2 really authentic and genuine friends whilst there, I have a great internship on campus. 

Due to not enjoying my environment, not feeling comfortable at my school, etc, I was  seriously considering transferring a few months ago so I applied to the college by my home and was accepted. It’s a good school with good opportunities, I’d be able to find internships around here that will help me in my studies, and I’d be paying so so much less and taking out less student loans compared to my current university.. but I just am not looking forward to living back at home just because my parents at times can be strict and I’m used to the freedom and somewhat adulthood I’ve adopted at school. However, my anxiety is much more lessened while here and I enjoy being around my family. My boyfriend also lives here, which is not a defining factor of me returning as we’d see each other either way, but it helps. 

Now I just don’t really know what to do. To me transferring feels like such a big step and I’m really scared. I’m scared about how I’ll feel about it, how slightly taboo it is, whether I’ll regret it, etc. 

Any advice?"

ccxig9,2,2019-07-13,Are students eligible for government scholarships before committing to a certain college?,ForsakenPhase1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ccxig9/are_students_eligible_for_government_scholarships/,"I'm planning on majoring in CS and going into government work for at least a few years to gain experience in the industry, as I think it's a good way to gain experience and make a decent salary with good benefits compared to other entry-level programs, and I like the idea of being able to serve the country.  Anyway, as I'm a Florida student with 100+ community service hours, assuming I don't fail and drop out of my IB program, I have a full Bright Futures scholarship to cover Florida schools.  That being said, there are a lot of things I like about some of the top ranked CS schools like Georgia Tech and UT-Austin.  I don't think I'll qualify for aid, but if I could somehow get a scholarship to one of those schools, that would make this decision much easier.

Recently, I've heard that there are a number of different scholarships that will fund your education in exchange for a mandatory internship and government service for a few years afterwards.  I know a lot of people aren't interested in government work, but especially since that's what I'm interested in anyway, a guaranteed internship and job placement as well as a full scholarship sounds perfect if I could somehow manage to get it.  However, a lot of what I've seen suggests that you're not eligible until you've matriculated to a university.

If I manage to get into one of those top schools (which I probably won't), then having this scholarship would make it a relatively easy decision, but these seem competitive enough that I certainly can't accept one of them and just plan on getting it, so it would be a much harder decision to matriculate into a top CS school over a school like UF (which is a very good school, although I've heard some alarming things about their CS department being worse than the ratings would suggest) without knowing that I can get it.  So, are there any of these types of scholarships that would allow high school graduates to apply and would announce results before I have to accept a college, or are they all for students already in college?

Also, does anyone have any tips about how to get one of these?"

I just wanted to post this because based on what I see, people seem to be so hyperfocused on the small details in CS that won't actually affect them in life. I'm here to tell you that if I can do it, you can too.

I started going back to school at the age of 30. I had most of my gen eds completed from the first time I went to school. I dropped out because of a massive alcohol and cocaine addiction I developed. That continued until I was about 26. I never thought I would truly amount to anything. I met a wonderful woman who supported the shit out of me, we got married and I went back to school.

I'll be honest, school was not as easy the second time around. My short term memory is really damaged from years of drug use. But I didn't let that stop me. I knew I made those choices when I was younger, so I need to work on fixing them now. So I just worked harder. Harder than anyone I knew. And it paid off.


I had my first internship doing basic web development. I learned some things and it was alright. My second internship was at a startup doing full stack development. I learned a ton there and it was a great experience. My 3rd internship was at the US's leading national research lab, where I am currently at. Next month I will be going to a Fortune 100 company to do a Fall internship while I finish my last two classes remotely to graduate.

My message to people who were like me: we made our lives the way they were with our bad decisions. However, there is no reason that we can't fix it. Work hard. Harder than anyone you know. I busted my ass. I'm not smarter than your average CS student, but you damn well better believe I have a stronger work ethic.

I worked my ass off, and you can, too. And if you have addiction issues and want to make a better life for yourself then PLEASE PM me. I would love to talk to you and help you move forward in life."

Since the university I was in just had a really bad year getting companies to come to campus, I took it as a sign that maybe a hiring slowdown/recession is on the way.  For that reason, I applied to some full time jobs on a whim, with the goal being to take a leave of absence to gain some very valuable experience.  So far, I have been working 7 months full time as a data/ML engineer at a great tech company, not to mention my software engineering internship experience.  I also had some unique side projects that caught my interviewers' attention.




While part of me wants to finish my degree, some issues are holding me back:


1) The high cost of education of course.  Besides the fact that I don't enjoy my coursework very much.  The teaching is lackluster, and the professors and academic environment are totally not caring to people who work or have other emergencies.  I feel like I attend the DMV for school lol.



2) Being burnt out from work.  I love my job, but at the end of the day, I am exhausted.  I already have done the college thing once, and I didn't like it the first time.  Besides, I want to take vacations with my wife, and visit my family and friends who I have not seen in a long time.



3) I think it would be more beneficial for my career to attend networking events and going to events and conferences with my coworkers.  If I am spending all of my free time studying, I am not making valuable connections for my career."

1.how to build my profile for such big grad schools ?

2. When should I apply for grad schools (during which semester) ?

3. If my cgpa stagnates below 8 by the time I am applying, will it seriously affect my prospects at these schools even if I have good projects and internships under my profile ?

4.  How high should my gre score be inorder for it to have a positive effect on during my application ?

It would help me tremendously financially since I have bills to pay and since I'm a hands-on person, I believe it would teach me a lot and keep my interest going.

However, I have only taken 2 core CS classes right now. From my understanding, having taken Data Structures is big when it comes to landing an internship. I would be taking data structures in the spring but I plan on doing the free lecture from Berkely sometime next week to get a basic understanding. 

Also if it helps, I have 5 years experience as a financial consultant working with clients which really helped me with time management and tremendously improved my communication skills.

I understand that its more than just all that when it comes to interviews but considering what im doing, is there a chance for companies to still give a callback?

I have other ECs that are more general like sports, FBLA, NHS, Model UN. Some of them I guess help with public speaking. 

Would I be more competitive applying as a Bio major or something similar? Or should I just apply for what I truly want to apply for which is CS?

I went back to school for CS after working in an unrelated field but getting exposed to programming.

Since the university I was in just had a really bad year getting companies to come to campus, I took it as a sign that maybe a hiring slowdown/recession is on the way. For that reason, I applied to some full time jobs on a whim, with the goal being to take a leave of absence to gain some very valuable experience and to get through a recession if it is on the way.  I remember the last recession and it was not good for me.



So far, I have been working 7 months full time as a data/ML engineer at a great tech company, not to mention my software engineering internship experience. I also had some unique side projects that caught my interviewers' attention.

While part of me wants to finish my degree part time as I work, some issues are holding me back:

1) The high cost of education of course. Besides the fact that I don't enjoy my coursework very much. The teaching is lackluster, and the professors and academic environment are totally not caring to people who work or have other emergencies. I feel like I attend the DMV for school lol.

2) Being burnt out from work. I love my job, but at the end of the day, I am exhausted. I already have done the college thing once, and I didn't like it the first time. The only thing that kept me going while studying for my second degree was that I really needed a well paying job.  Besides, I want to take vacations with my wife, and visit my family and friends who I have not seen in a long time.  I am busy enough from work and I don't need annoyances from school getting in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I’m the host of a radio station called Radio Weird. Not much to it really, we play songs that sound odd and have the odd interviewee on every now and then. I only recently took over from the guy before me, Oliver Cole, who died about a month ago. I live locally and I’ve always loved hearing him talk about anything and everything. So, once I heard there was an opening, I thought it’d be a nice way to show my appreciation for everything he’d done.

&amp;#x200B;

My first day was pretty standard honestly. The station was right out in the middle of the woods, so it was a nice, peaceful drive in. As I pulled up outside, I was surprised by how quaint the station was. A fairly large wood cabin with a larger radio tower that towered above the trees surrounding the building's perimeter. 

&amp;#x200B;

The people there seemed friendly enough,  things were a bit awkward though. I get it, it must be hard having some random guy take over from their friend's position. It's a fairly standard shift, make small talk with callers, pick the right songs and overall keep things flowing smoothly. It's only recently, however, that things have taken a strange turn.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just your basic Wednesday, had some decent callers and the intern Ethan had finally remembered how I liked my coffee; black with two sugars. I took a look over who today's guest was going to be. Normally it was someone from one of the towns over who'd trimmed his hedge strangely or some pensioner talking about their expensive silverware. But it was nothing like that today. This was all the information the memo had to say:

'Name's Conner Jennings. Was hiking through the woods, said he heard something. Idk, it's either him or Mr Maddocks again - Carol'

I shuddered. Mr Maddocks was a regular who loved to come on and talk about how he has to look after his late wife's cats. Connor Jennings it was then. Anything beats hearing that Cuddles was in heat again. 

&amp;#x200B;

After an hour, Ethan popped his head around the corner to let me know that Connor was here. I gave him the thumbs up, turning the music down and unmuting the microphone. ""That was Gasoline by Halsey, always welcome here on Radio Weird, as I'm sure you're all aware. And we're only one song away before I have the pleasure of talking to our Wednesday guest, Connor Jennings, a local hiker. Before that though, another favourite of mine from Mother Mother, Ghosting."" As the new song faded in, I muted the mic quickly and dashed out of the room. I turned the corner, smiling and ready for a speedy introduction, only to be taken aback by the man who stood in front of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I could tell Connor was a man who enjoyed the finer things in life. His dazzlingly white teeth, sleek blonde hair and a slim yet toned physique. Which is why everything else about him made me feel uneasy. The black bags under his bloodshot eyes, a baggy hoodie and rather dirty looking jeans. Still, I smiled wide and reached out a hand to shake his. 

""Hi Conner, I'm Aiden. Welcome to Radio Weird."" My hand stood out, waiting for him to shake it. He looked up at me, forcing a smile.

""Hey.""

I looked over at Ethan. He gave an unenthusiastic shrug. I could already tell this was gonna be an ordeal. I recalled my hand and instead gestured over at the door to the studio.

""Shall we?""

Connor nods and slowly follows as I escort him inside. We both take a seat on either side of the table, the track nearing its conclusion. I give him a weary smile, unmuting the microphone as the tracks last note trailed out.

&amp;#x200B;

""And here we are, with our Wednesday Guest Connor Jennings. Hi Connor.""

Connor leans close to the microphone, taking a moment before talking.

""Do you spend much time in the woods, Aiden?"" 

I was taken aback. I looked over at him, hoping to see a cheeky smile or something to let on if this was a joke or not. His stern expression quickly assured me otherwise.

""Um... Well, apart from on my way here to the station, not really. Now, I was told that you-""

""I spend my weekends hiking with my wife. She loves the outdoors.""

I sat there, speechless. Never had a guest cut me off before. I look to the door where Ethan was listening intently. He was just as surprised as me. I took a moment before speaking again.

""Right... Well, uh-""

Again, I'm cut off.

""We love exploring these woods together. They're so full of personality. But never, in my life, have I heard a sound so horrific or terrifying.""

I feel a chill go down my spine. Just looking at him, I could see how horrified he was. I lean closer into the mic, lowering my voice as if it were just us.

""A noise? What kind of noise""

He takes a second as if he were trying to find the right words.

""It was like... a scream? The most nerve-shredding scream I've ever heard. But it wasn't human, no, it was more like an animal, but more than that.""

I lean closer, almost like his words were pulling me in.

""More than just a scream?""

He nods slowly as he talks, and his next words made me shudder. Not the kind of shudders I got from hearing Mr Maddocks was our guest. No, this was a shudder that made me feel sick to my stomach

""I could tell it was a scream, but that doesn't quite describe it. This sound has haunted me every night since, the best way I could describe it is... A boom""

&amp;#x200B;

I realise this post is getting a bit long and I need to get ready to broadcast, so I'll see if I can find some time later this evening to write up more."

I'm entering my last yr of university and was lucky enough to get my 3rd software development internship this summer.   For full time, I know for sure I wanna go big N or Goldman/Bloomberg level companies either in NYC, Toronto or Vancouver. In case I am not able to secure an offer for full time, how likely is it to make it to those companies after working for 2 yrs at a government/defense agency (think 3 letter agencies) in cybersecurity or reverse engineering teams.  

With that kind of specialized skill set, albiet only for 2 years, can I make it to those said high paying companies on their specialized teams? 

I really hate the job environment for these said 3 letter agencies (no innovation, too much bureaucracy, more compliance problems to solve rather than engineering problems, bored people) but the starting salary is good. Should my backup plan be to tough it out for a couple years in cybersecurity specialization and then try to move to Big N or is that not realistic?

I am ashamed of my lifestyle and I need some urgent life advice because I am struggling to change.",Hopeful_Butterfly,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cd7wj4/im_24f_unemployed_feeling_unmotivated_possibly/,"
My family gave me a trust fund. I used to have it only for emergencies and never dipped into it, until the last 2.5 months. 


For background, immediately right after graduating college leading up to this point, I moved out of my parents house, got an apartment with roommates, was working retail, then landed an internship and finally landed a professional job less than a year after I graduated. I was feeling good and like my life was going somewhere. I enjoyed the job for the most part. I was working at this job for almost a year, but there were substantial issues beginning to crop up at my workplace due to poor management and I ended up quitting in the winter time due to certain reasons that were affecting my mental health. I am a giant idiot for doing this, I am very aware, but I cared so little by the time I quit that I did not have another job lined up in my industry. All I could feel was I felt like I was constantly on the go and stressed at this job and I needed to breathe. After I quit I took about a month off of no work. After this “break,” I applied for and got a retail job for a couple months in 2019 that paid me much less money, requiring me to live off the savings made from my prior job. But, despite the shitty pay and boring work, I felt better mentally again. I didn’t feel overworked and exhausted constantly like at my prior job. I felt I had a better work life balance. However, as my savings from my previous job dwindled, I decided to move cities to position myself in a better location for finding job’s pertaining to my industry, because I knew I couldn’t work retail forever. I hated my retail job even if my commute and responsibilities were minuscule. Customers can be so nasty and I was so under-stimulated working retail. I’m no stranger to retail as throughout college I worked retail or odd jobs for my college to make extra money to save. 

Anyways, I quit that retail job this spring and moved cities. i now have an apartment by myself with my pets. That was 2.5 months ago.
But ever since I moved 2.5 months ago, my savings were depleted so I dipped into my trust fund. 


I have lost almost all my motivation and energy after the move. I don’t know if I’m depressed or what. 
My life has been fairly chaotic emotionally the last few months. I’m not suicidal, no, but I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

The last 2.5 months, I have been a bum when it comes to my life. My daily routine for the last 2 and a half months have been: wake up between 7-9AM, take care of my pets needs (I have two cats and some snakes), make sure that my home is very tidy, hang out with my very loving and caring boyfriend a few times a week, maybe eat a few meals, play with my cats as much as they want, halfheartedly fill out and send a shameful number of job apps a day IF I can force myself to, watch Netflix, use the pool at my apartment, and sleep. I at least can pride myself in that I am not a slob, I keep my home immaculate, i grow healthy plants on my patio and my animals are spoiled and given so much love and attention since I’m home so much.


But I’m not fucking productive. It’s a struggle to do job applications, it’s a struggle to go to the gym, I haven’t worked out properly in months and hell its a struggle for me to eat properly. I’ve been underweight for the last four years (not grossly, but by about 10 pounds) when I used to be a huge gym rat in college. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if I am just lazy and unmotivated or if there is a bigger problem here. Like seriously, I used to love exercise, I had muscles and strength and a routine and now I’m just very skinny. Honest to god, even the Netflix stuff, sometimes I can’t even bring myself to watch something, I just lay around sometimes once my animals are taken care of, doing NOTHING. I hate it and I don’t hate myself yet but I don’t know if this is a sign I need therapy or SSRIs or what. I used to love video games too. They remain untouched because they aren’t fun anymore. I like cooking for my boyfriend when we hang out and he is very caring of me, but we don’t live together and have not been dating very long so he is unaware that when we are not together that my diet is shit. I’m a good cook but I struggle to feed myself when it’s just me in my home. I don’t really get hunger pangs. 


I try to spend my money on my basic necessities like food, rent, pet expenses and utility bills. I feel like I could use my fund to invest in something to make myself more income but I don’t know where to start.  

I really want to change and to achieve something out of my life, but honestly I'm living too comfortably and finding it hard to change. Every day I get a bit more bothered and anxious about my lifestyle and I wish so much that I could just get off my ass and get a damn job. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks."

Should I be doing things outside of work to ensure I am up to speed on newer stacks that are being used? Or should I just leave for another job?

However, after researching career opportunities, I have stumbled upon the traveling aspect of CEM. After researching for a while, decided to COCO to Civil Engineering for this fall. It may seem too far down the line, but eventually I might want to settle down in one area, have a house and interact with a community. CEM might inhibit this, and that is why I am here writing this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always loved building. Ever since I can remember, I would spend hours on legos, minecraft, and in general learn how structures are made. I completed an Eagle Scout Project constructing a mile trail in the woods in 2017, and this year I found an internship with a small construction company in northern Indiana. After spending some time learning about construction, I believe it could be a right fit for me, even with the long hours, stressful work environment, and hard work. It can depend on the company, but that is what I found at this company. I might need to do some more research on which companies could fit construction differently. The only problem would be the traveling. If I eventually find work with a larger construction company, I might be obligated to transfer around the US, and I do not know if I can do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are two departments within Construction from my Understanding:

\-Estimating

\-Construction Management 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't mind either, as both are fits for me. I believe both might require me to travel, I could be wrong. Again, except for the traveling. 

&amp;#x200B;

My top reasons for a job would be: 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Type of work, including design and overall completion of projects

\-Work/life balance

\-Moving up within the company, including positions and responsibilities 

\-Salary (which vary based on work/life balance)

&amp;#x200B;

I also enjoyed the ENG 133 class from the Fall of 2018. It was stressful at times, and took a very long time to complete some assignments, but it could be worth going into some technological sides of mechanical engineering. That being said, I mainly want to focus on the type of job I will be doing outside of graduation and with the top reasons above.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a chance to change my classes for this fall in the beginning of the semester. I do not mean to sound struck up or anything associated with rudeness, but with a 3.63 GPA I believe I might have a chance at most engineering majors. That is why I need to decide sooner rather than later to get my degree on track, and also the classes are starting to change. My top Contenders are: Construction, Structural, and mechanical (not in order). 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions on which major might fit those reasons for a job? Any experience finding jobs with similar ideologies? 

Any suggestions will help. Thank you."

So I'm in my late 20s and have recently changed careers from insurance to a tech industry role. I have wanted this type of role for a long time (tech writing) and managed to land a great internship doing it, which will hopefully roll into a full time position. That's the goal anyways, for both me and the organization. 

I was honest in my interview when they asked about my skills, which are limited. Not in a sense that I can't write, more in a sense that I haven't had very much exposure to the tools and concepts they use. They still gladly offered it to me in a very competitive market and city. Still a little blown away. 

It's been about a month and I feel so overwhelmed, but I'm not sure if I'm just psyching myself out. My team is more of a group of individual contributors who work on various projects. Everyone is kind and friendly, but very busy and very introverted. I seems like they aren't quite sure what to do with me. 

All of the little projects they try to give me get put on holds for various reasons, mainly because the company recently got a new ceo and they are a lot of things are changing (luckily I've heard lots of enthusiasm for the changes). I've just been doing a lot of little things, but am always feeling unsure of myself. I spend a lot of time tinkering with the tools or tone or elements, or research a lot about the product (which is incredibly complex). I'm never quite sure what I'm doing and, if I think I am, find things I'm doing wrong. I question myself constantly. 

When I express that I'm feeling overwhelmed, people mostly just smile and tell me it's ok to feel that way. I appreciate that, but I also would like some tangible guidance or structure. It seems like everyone is always in meetings or working from home and asking for help can be hard to do sometimes. I just feel sort of in the way and awkward and barely understand how to actually do this job. I never know what to ask or who to ask. 

It doesn't help that this career change is a part of a major life change, which includes selling my house and moving my family 1800 miles to a new city, state, and entire region. This has all happened in the past 3 months and brought up some deeply buried anxiety issues I've been dealing with.

 It's been fun to experience new things, but it's also been hard to give up a lot of comfort. Some of that comfort was doing a job that I knew how to do, even if I didn't like doing it very much. I could teach people things and could have valuable input at work because I knew what I was doing. Now I don't again and everything is so new, in and outside of work. It's exhausting. 

Has anyone else felt in over their head by picking up their life and changing careers and industries in a new place? How did you do it and when did it get better? 

TL;DR Feeling overwhelmed and powerless as a career changer in an internship and looking for advice or stories on how to feel more at ease."

This is my first term in the program and during course intros, I noticed that a lot of students already have traditional engineering degrees such as mechanical, electrical, chemical engineering, etc.

I have also been browsing through the ""Hiring Thread"" and noticed a lot of these types of students getting hired as software engineers.  

I myself already have a BSEE and I am working as an engineer at a large corporate company.  I was hoping to get some career/life advice from students of similar background.  I am obviously taking this program because I want to become a software engineer and am trying to formulate a plan for how to achieve that goal.  I live in the Seattle area and want to be set myself up to be a competitive applicant for an entry-level software engineering position.  My goal is to work for a tech giant in the greater Seattle area exclusively.

I think an internship would be good to have on my resume and it would be nice to have at least a couple under my belt before the time I graduated but I would have to quit my decently paying full time engineering job to take an internship with no guarantee of future employment...

I am in my mid-late twenties and have no real financial obligations or debt or mortgage, etc.  Should I just complete my CS degree while working my engineering job? Or will I not be competitive enough without internships?

All of the computers are running on Windows 10.

The issue is pretty simple, one of the computers doesn't show on the network [folder](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Al4ooTpybzPSikYgHpFwi5VpMEqQ), PHOTUS1, but if I write the path of the computer it [loads](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Al4ooTpybzPSikiqgbqFpOz23ugy) and I can manage the files just fine, any reason why this is happening?

Even though I can acess it pretty simple, my father may have a little bit more difficulty as well as some interns that come and go as time flows, so if the computer simply showed up at the network folder it would make everyone happier.

&amp;#x200B;

I need a new school laptop. It'll be used for things like Office, but also the Adobe Creative Suite (it's media/IT centred). They gave me the minimum specs needed:

* Operating system: Windows 10 (64 bit)
* Memory: 16 GB RAM (or more)
* SSD: 256GB intern (or more)
* Screen resolution: 1920x1080 (or more)
* Audio configuration compatible with ASIO or Microsoft
* Windows Driver Model GPU: minimal 1,5GB vRAM

&amp;#x200B;

OR

&amp;#x200B;

MacOS laptop 

* Processor: Intel i5 processor (or higher)
* Operating system: MacOS X v10.13 
* Memory: 16GB RAM

Since I have no CS work experience, I'd like for the job to provide some of that. I'd like to have a part-time internship in the fall if possible or a part-time CS-related job. 

I was curious what resources are available or what has brought others success with this before.

I will be taking data structures and algorithms my first semester at UIUC. 

I've heard about Handshake but I haven't seen many postings on there.

I've heard that maybe I should ask professors for research roles or that I should attend a career fair. What are your opinions on these?

Personal Note: I know some HTML, CSS, JS and I think I'd like a front end internship preferably (but I'll take anything)"
cdgnxa,2,2019-07-15,Internship,notspicy,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/cdgnxa/internship/,"I have an internship in a corporate office this summer. Since I started, my social anxiety has gotten worse and worse. I feel like I'm in a downward spiral. I'm really socially awkward with everyone there (including the other interns) and get nervous in EVERY social interaction. I go to business meetings and have borderline anxiety attacks and it's very obvious based on my body language -- hunched shoulders, tense neck, darting eyes. The others in the room feed off my nervousness and get nervous too. It sucks when my anxiety is contagious like that.

I also have to deliver a presentation and I have a severe fear of public speaking. Even when asked to speak up in a group it's difficult. I keep humiliating myself every day with my awkwardness and weird behavior and the shame is so hard to bear. I can't seem to get my anxiety under control and it's affecting my work performance, relationships and general well being. 

I did start seeing a therapist but only had one session so far because she was on vacation for 2 weeks (ugh). I also started taking medication but the effects don't show until about one month. 


Anyways, just wanted to vent/possibly get advice. I really want to quit but my friends and family keep telling me to stick it out. I feel like they don't understand the hell I'm going through :("

Don't know what to do with my life now.,jonleigh7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cdgv4s/cs_student_had_an_internship_at_one_of_the_major/,"So, freshman year of college, I worked my butt off, and got internship offers from the big four and other companies for their SWE internship position. Ended up going with a one of the larger database companies. Realized that the motivation I had for software engineering my entire life, to create side projects, was only for money and to impress my friends. I realized that it came from a place of insecurity, and I didn't have the tenacity to perform at these companies, to stick with a project for 12 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that most of my ability and motivation fizzled out on a project after only \~2 weeks. I enjoyed it but I found myself starting project after project and not being able to finish and commit to one. So when I ended up at an internship I realized I didn't have a commitment or ""grit"" to stick it through until the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up changing my major to Bioinformatics, to find something that I might like, but now I'm at risk of getting kicked out of uni for my grades because I didn't have the interest to stay with it for long.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think I should switch back to CS and give it another try? I've fallen so far I don't think I could even secure an interview at the same companies that interviewed me freshman year, and it's something that will bother me if I try again."
cdh2ml,5,2019-07-15,What can a 30 something former journalist and political campaigner do to improve their lot in life?,Yesthisisforjobs,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cdh2ml/what_can_a_30_something_former_journalist_and/,"So I graduated with a Bachelors in 2010 in Political Science, Telecommunications and general studies in music. 

Since then, I managed a small, independent coffee shop for over a year, before going back to my high school town for an internship on a political campaign doing call time with a congressional candidate, on top of voter and donor research.  

Because the internship was unpaid, I took a position as a server at a local farm to fork restaurant. I ended up working there for about two years, but wasn’t happy and had really bad management. I took a job at a local fine dining establishment, and worked there for over a year before going to work on a mayoral election for a nearby mayor’s campaign. Following that I worked for a lobbying group for equality and civil rights during the state legislature session.  

I followed that up by being a campaign manager for two state house elections, winning both during the 2016 election, including a first time candidate.  

I was fairly burned out after the election, so I didn’t know what to do next, there wasn’t another job on the horizon so I took a short term position as a warehouse, shipping person for a local wholesaler for flowers.  I was offered a seasonal position at the local university working on their video boards, replacing broken leds, modules, and doing basic video programming.   

I also received a job offer to work as the lead city reporter for a local town that was about a 45 minute drive away, and I was there for over a year, but I have a really old car, and couldn’t afford the repairs and getting to work. My take home was about $9 an hour after taxes.  

I’ve since gone back to serving at a local casual dining and an Italian restaurant, but it just doesn’t pay the bills. For every shift I make $200 there’s a shift where I make $19/8/20 dollars or at best like $60.

Basically, I just need to know how I can get out of this job cycle of just taking whatever I can get my hands on, and find something with growth, income potential and more stability.  

Frankly, I’m pretty much drowning right now and don’t know what to do anymore. I apply for literally every job I can find, am 100% able and willing to move anywhere to work, I just need something stable and that pays the bills long term. I don’t wanna just keep taking whatever job I can find. I’ve slowly started trying to train myself on SQL more, Python, and R, and I’m tech savvy, and applied to lambda school and looked into graduate schools but I’m out of ideas and out of money. 

TL;DR I need more stability and a job that pays the bills so as a mid 30s person I don’t spend my whole life waiting tables for 27k, or entry level jobs."

I am currently working as an intern in a company and they need me to divide create graphs for data.

Below is an example of the structure of the data I need to work with. 

I have to plot ""cumulative berries"" on the x axis and ""ratio good berries: bad berries"" on the y axis, but I have to divided them by the names of different people like the graph below.

The way I made this is by selecting the data I wanted to use individually and make the four plots separately. This is time consuming and I was wondering if there is a more efficient way to do it? I have about 100 data sets that I need to make a graph for and I want to make it efficient.

cdi1h3,3,2019-07-15,"25m, working in marketing, wanting to change jobs but no idea what?",bp5678,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cdi1h3/25m_working_in_marketing_wanting_to_change_jobs/,"I'm 25m, living with parents (this is normal at my age in the UK).

I'm looking at moving out and since I have no strings (single and not particuarly family orientated) I can pretty much move where I like. The place I'm planning on moving to is several hours from my family home meaning I'll need a new job.

I've been updating my CV/resume however I've realised I'm not even sure I want to stay in the same field of work.

**Bit of background:**

I achieved reasonable grades at school, college and university however I feel like i almost 'cheated the system' by taking easy subjects. I learnt *how* to answer essays and revise for exams as opposed to actually being smart. Everything I learnt was simply for the test and then immediately wiped from my memory. I didn't pick up any skills for the real world. My degree was sports development - a BS degree that means nothing in the real world.

When I graduated, I blagged my way into a low paying marketing and events assistant internship for a large fitness manufacturer. Hated it but completed the 9 month placement.

This put me off marketing and full time office work in general. Due to hating my life, I decided to take the easy route and get my confidence back by working for a friend who was store manager of a retailer. I helped him with the website, data entry, social media and pretty basic stuff trying to get the online marketing &amp; presence of them to increase. Their budget is small so I was paid basically minimum wage. I then quit to find a better paid job. I enjoyed this job more for the company/who I worked with more than anything else.

Landed my current job which I do enjoy. I've realised it's not actually what I do that is what I enjoy (in fact i'm finding marketing pretty boring and only been in this industry since graduating so for the last 3 years). I can't see myself staying in this industry forever if I'm bored already after 3 years. I realise I don't enjoy marketing but enjoy where I work (despite being in marketing) because of the great colleagues I have and the general atmosphere/culture in the office. I don't find the role exciting or fulfilling though. It's also not particuarly well paid at £26k a year. Many of my friends started on that amount when they graduated and progressed to £35-40k by now (3 years later). I can't see much career progression here.

I'd like somewhere with better career progression for pay but something I enjoy. The problem is a large part of it for me is who I work with and the general 'feel' of the working environment.

**What role do I want?**

I don't know what suits me, partly because I don't know who I am. Eg:

In certain scenarios I'm great with people, confident, outgoing etc. However in other scenarios you'd describe me as introverted. I can go from one extreme to the other. I have different social groups and some would describe me as the loud, outgoing, extrovert while to the other group they've never seen that side and would describe me as the awkward, timid, silent one. So I don't know if sales/a 'talkative' job is perfect for me or the complete opposite!

However I can tell you for **certain** that:

* I'm not maths/numbers orientated.
* I'm not practical/hands on.
* I'm a fairly good writer (but nothing exceptional; far from William Shakespeare!)
* I like to please people
* I enjoy feeling a sense of accomplishment with my work
* When I enjoy what I do and am motivated, I'm ***really*** motivated! This all comes internally/intrinsically.
* I'm not organised
* I'm not an 'on the spot' thinker but give me time and I come up with creative ideas
* I don't speak very articulately but if you let me put my words to paper, I express myself well
* The simple jobs appeal to me - eg something as simple as a taxi/train driver however this wouldn't pay enough (well maybe a train diver). I want to be earning £30k very soon with aspirations of earning more over the next few years as I progress
* I'm pretty laid back, simple man
* I enjoy the outdoors, nature, exercise, health, fitness, travel, exploring, adventures
* I'd like some consistency with my work although the occasional change of work isn't a problem however constant change of both tasks and people makes me feel uneasy
* I have adult ADD (like ADHD but without the hyperactivity). You wouldn't notice this yourself if you met me but it means I can be messy, unorganised and sometimes poor with my timekeeping but since I worry I'll be late to places all the time I usually end up giving myself plenty of time and arriving to places excessively early. Quite a good chance I'll forget something though and have to rush home to pick up what I've forgotten due to the ADD.
* I work slowly but focus on every little detail very carefully
* Once I start focusing on a task, I'll ***really*** get into it and focus on it extremely hard. However if there's external distractions I can find this difficult. Once I'm in the zone I can go several hours without talking.
* I hate talking on the phone.
* I like to have a nice work-life balance. Having said that, if I really enjoy what I do I don't find it a chore to work longer hours (always a bonus if the pay is better because of this too).
* I'd say i'm introverted probably. Quite compassionate, friendly and empathetic.
* I take pride when I can see my contribution to a task/project.
* I'm often not good with coming up with new/fresh ideas but find it very easy to review someone else's ideas/thoughts and add to them, critique them, cultivate them, build on and extend on points within them.
* I don't like high pressure environments.
* I don't always like getting told what to do and prefer a more democratic process.
* Despite being reasonably smart, I feel I don't specialise in any particular field. I'm more of a jack of all trades which has made choosing a new career path extremely difficult."

&amp;#x200B;

I have an Bachelors of Science from uni, but realized when I did my internship that uni prepares those students for a masters program and not a job market. I ended up doing a college certificate in GIS which I fell in love with especially the college applied education style vs. theory learning at uni. I am currently nearing the end of my GIS contract with an organization and realized that this field has a programming aspect that is growing. You need to know full-stack development, python, R, etc etc. I have been rejected jobs I am interested in for not having enough programming experience more than once so I decided to bite the bullet and do a ""reset"" of my education.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the question: Should I go to college and get a programming diploma or should I go into uni in some computer science or software engineering? What I love so far: data modelling  and creating web map or graphical outputs for a user to manage their spatial data. I just don't want to invest so much time in a program and find myself ""out-competed"" by another designation....Like right now I am being out competed by engineers in some jobs too....hence considering software engineering."
cdilyb,0,2019-07-15,2nd Week On Job - Fresh Undergrad - How to Serve Value to the Company and Excel?,theburritoeater,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cdilyb/2nd_week_on_job_fresh_undergrad_how_to_serve/,"**Intro**

I recently graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science, and got hired by a company to do Site Reliability Work.  My job is not too fancy, but I feel very lucky to have gotten it since I have never had an internship (I transfered into CS my last 6 semesters at school from Civil Eng).  

My team responds when the systems go down, and do ad-hoc fixing.  We do not do any actual building or engineering, just fixing and scripting to stop things from breaking again if we can, and routine maintenance.  

Hopefully this post's comments can give me, and other fresh graduates, some insight from professionals here how to perform well at a new job with little to no experience, and how to keep on the right thinking cap to eventually excel and move forward in the field.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals**

I know very little about anything I am doing, and I did not expect to do a job like this at all (i.e. with very little coding involved at all).  But I love systems, Linux, and the cloud, so I am happy to be learning.  I want to eventually learn how to become an architect or such systems, and maybe dabble in some more engineering type of work with code when code is needed.  

Everybody on my team is experienced with at least 5 years of industry behind their belts, and I have been asking the most basic questions such as, *""explain this AWK command to me step by step, I am confused""* or *""why do you want to view this log?""*.  I feel intimidated every day by the job and my responsibilities, which is something I am learning to deal with, but I know with the right attitude and advice and direction, you can tackle anything, hence why I posting here, for some 'tibits' to mull over.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

**-** A recent college grad can be hit or miss for a company, how can I ensure I bring value to the company even while I am doing ""simple"" maintenance work?  Right now I feel as if I am simply following a monkey-see-monkey-do pattern while I learn how a production system works.

\- Once I learn how to bring true value to my team and the company, what are some strategies people here would use to excel?  If anybody specifically is in SRE for my personal career I am very interested.  I am reading books like the Phoenix Project, O'Rilley, etc, but I would love some industry advice here outside of my books or the jokes of a few of my jaded team members.

\- How can one improve and learn more about the SRE field outside of work?  I do things such as scrolling through man pages in my free time or learning how to use certain tools better, but a tool is just a tool and can only be as useful as you make it.  If I want to make sure I stay on track to eventually be a true systems architect, what are some strategies to help keep my train on the right rails?

&amp;#x200B;

**Thank You** for your time taken to respond to this, and I hope this post can help any other new recent college grads gain some perspective on how bring value to their teams, companies, and ultimately, to themselves and their careers."

I had an internship last summer at a startup and now I am about to finish my second internship at another startup, in a couple of days.

The problem arises that I actually failed in a project course last semester and for the past two years since sophomore, my grades are pretty bad (2.7 GPA). Most of the grades are just barely above the passing grade. Honestly, how I managed to pull off the internships is a miracle. But now, I have my final two semesters left and I need to clear my failed course and simultaneously apply for full-time positions along with the current coursework. On top of that, my parents are hugely disappointed that I failed in a course (it's the first time I academically failed in my life), constantly remind me of that by saying they never expected me to fail. I feel seriously depressed and miserable thinking about it and whether I am gonna graduate in time or get a job after graduation. Any suggestions or tips or any motivational talks would be helpful."

How can I get better?,basementmath,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/cdn2j0/how_many_leetcode_problems_should_i_do_and_how/,"I started leetcode problems, starting with easy, and the questions with highest accepted rates, In the past 6 days, I've gone through about 30(29 easy 1 medium). I am currently working as a summer intern. I spend time after work or when there is a downtime at work, I solve leetcode problems. But I'm still a newbie, I know the data structure algorithms but some of them I forgot how to implement, need to go back and study the syntax for some of them so I'm doing easy ones.

Some problems, despite being easy, they're still hard. Sometimes It takes me some time to read over the problem in order to understand the prompt. Sometimes, I need to breakdown and put some thoughts into the algorithm that will solve the problems. There are maybe a couple or less than a few problems where I had to make inference out of hint or the solution.

I usually get about 60 % faster solution, sometimes a bit slower, sometimes a lot faster (like 80, 90% or better) When I'm below 65%, I'll look over the given solution or someone else's solutions. If I get over 70 or better, I usually don't look. Unless I'm completely stuck where I need advanced algorithm knowledge or the question's only solution is to use some advanced algorithm that was invented by a computer scientist, then I go back to it later after studying the algorithm and understanding it. I don't copy solutions, I'm trying to do 100% on my own.

However, I do not want to burn myself out, enjoy coding and enjoy learning. At the same time I want to get better at coding.

My concern is that I was told easy problems should be done in 15 to 20 minutes or less. Some problems I have been able to do them very quick, but some of them I had to put some time in order to think about it before I code which took me well over 15 minutes just to start coding.

How can I improve and am I particularly slow as someone who is starting out? I'm trying to solve all easy(about 200+) problems before September and in September, hopefully I can solve about 80 to 90 medium problems"
cdn3xy,1,2019-07-15,Any tips for getting into Corporate Finance/ Investment Banking for a student?,En3my0fthestate,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cdn3xy/any_tips_for_getting_into_corporate_finance/,"  

Dear Reddit,

I am a 21 year old EU student in London, England. In the end of September, I will be starting my last, 3rd, year of University as a BSc in Business Studies with Finance Specialism. I finished my second year with average of 75.55% (converts to 4.0 GPA), which was a massive improvement from previous 61% in my first year. 

   
 

Alongside my studies, I have worked more than part-time, in order to support myself, as my family cannot fully finance my studies. As well, I have been a part of charity organisations and projects in a different country than my studies. I have mentored some of my peers for examinations too.

   
 

Throughout my second year I tried to score a placement/ internship with all major Wall St. Banks, British audit and financial services firms. None of them invited me to an interview. I have lived in London for only two years so far and I know I am a quick learner and devoted to what I do, but in every turn, I seem to hit a dead-end very quickly. University has assigned me a mentor, who is a banker and works with equity. According to him I am fully capable to work in the industry. 

   
 

I have always been a runner-up or an underdog in most situations in my life. That is probably because I have always aimed very high and set my objectives as tough as they get. I have come from a small town and now I am studying in one of the finest Business Schools in London. I do not intend to give up now, but I have realised that I cannot score a job in Corporate Finance/ Investment Baking only by myself. 

   
 

I ask you, Reddit, to give me advise on what to work on, do or not to do, during my last year in university, in order to achieve a place at Goldman Sachs, J P Morgan Chase &amp; Co and similar banks/ firms. I am planning to apply to different cities not only to London, but also to New York, Dubai, Beijing, Honk Kong, because I also have a desire to see the world while I am working.

Thank you for your time. Your advice, in any form, is very much appreciated.

This is my 3rd internship. When I was initially hired, I interviewed for my manager's team to work on a cool software project with other interns. On my first day of work, my manager informed me I will actually do a ""cooler"" project for another manager and I was selected since I am the most ""senior"" of my group. My manager told me it would involve complex front and back-end and highly recommended me. I met my new project manager who gave me a very brief description of what the project is and told me to wait a bit since the project was still being ironed out by the management. 2 weeks later we finally meet and he gives me another brief description of what I will accomplish. No concrete deliverables or specific things I had to do yet, since he's still waiting for management. He also informed me our director will reach out to give me more details and that he (project manager) will be out for 2 weeks on vacation. No one else knows what I am working on that I can meet with.

During my PM's vacation, my director never emailed me so I messaged him and he didn't really know what I was working on and told me to wait for my PM to come back. I met with my original manager, who came up with a basic programming feature that I could do based on what we knew about my project. He also said he misunderstood what my project would be. I worked on the feature till my PM came back, who was gone for 3 weeks instead of 2. We finally met when he got back (after July 4th week) and he finally showed me concrete deliverables and things I had to do. The feature I was working on would not apply at all to this project. There is absolutely no programming involved, all I would be working on is a tracking table for our hardware infrastructure. This wasn't at all what my original manager told me I would be doing. I asked my PM if I would ever code and he said no.

At this point, I've wasted 5 weeks waiting for my assignment only to find out I've been taken off an original software project to just work on documentation. I've had no one to ask for help or direction. I'm so lost and I absolutely hate working here. I am graduating soon and I am terrified I will not get a job at this company or any other. I'm strongly considering to talk to my original manager but I am not sure how to approach it. Is there a way to come back from this?"

\- I want to stay in SF post grad so I am looking for a return in SF.

\- Linkedin has a rule that if you intern and get a return in Sunnyvale, you MUST stay in Sunnyvale.

\- I've personally never worked at a mid-size company and have only interned at larger companies before.

Would it be dumb to turn down the Linkedin offer in the hopes of potentially getting Square or should I just take the LinkedIn Sunnyvale offer knowing that I may not want to work there full time post grad due to location issues?

I have 3 semesters to go before I graduate. I was able to snag an internship at a reputable healthcare company this summer, and have one summer left to land an additional internship before I graduate in December 2020. Truth be told though, I haven't done much programming at all this internship. I'll probably end the summer writing less than 100 lines of code, all minor cosmetic defects and bug fixes. It hasn't been totally worthless as I've gotten the experience of delving deep into a large code base that few are familiar with, and I've learned a lot about the agile methodology and general work process as well. That being said, my programming knowledge doesn't really feel up to chops. And the technologies I'm working with over the summer aren't that great, either.

Would my time be spent better working with side projects and more modern / relevant technologies? Or would interview prep better serve my interests? I want to do both, but time constraints between work and school make that difficult. Apart from this internship, I don't have much in the way of software development related things on my resume.

I need advice because I've never been in this situation and I don't know what to do. Block of text inbound.

So, a bit of background on the company I work for: I started as an unpaid intern at this car dealership in Pennsylvania, USA and was actually paying ~$40/day to uber there every day (couldn't afford a car). I have been touched and propositioned by some of the salesmen, and when reported, my female supervisor told me to stop and ""there are some things women just have to deal with."" I have been denied a promotion to the title/salary of the job I already do, and have done for a year, because I didn't have a degree. All of my coworkers are toxic af, and refuse to be helpful in any way. Our Finance Manager has driven drunk with me in the car while also smoking his weed pen, at a company event. Suffice it to say, this place is garbage. But I've done a lot for them anyway, because I owe my career to them. 

So, the story: I check my bank account, and see a random ~$25 charge for this photo editing app I use at work. I didn't remember signing up for the paid version of the app, so I checked my account and sure enough, my card was not on it. Now I'm getting suspicious, since there's only one other account for this app that I could possibly be tied to.

I check the company account and lo and behold, my debit card info is on there and actively being charged for paid version and some in-app purchases. I know I didn't put it there, because I never signed up for the paid version on any account as I don't need it, and I was too broke to pay for it, AND there's a company card it could've been charged to (through my supervisors of course.)

So now I check my bank account statements against the invoice history for this app. The charges only started happening after my new supervisor started (the only other one who has access to the app, and we work alone in a building together separate from the dealership). 

I check the company email for these invoices, for screenshots, and I find emails from the support team of the app. There are messages from our email (again, only could have been this supervisor) asking them to remove my login from the app account. I checked the date, and checked my internet history; I wasn't even on the email that day. Screenshotted that too. 

I have printed out proof of all these things. The charges totaled about ~$54 total, and I could be reimbursed no problem; but that's not what I'm worried about. This woman knew I haven't had gas in my apartment for months because I get paid too little to afford it; knew I couldn't go back to school because I get paid too little to afford it; knew I didn't eat lunch most days because, surprise, I get paid too little to afford it. 

I now have to cancel my card and get a new one, leaving me with no way to purchase necessary items for probably the next week or two. this is about more than just getting reimbursed. She stole my info, for no reason, knowing how screwed I already was financially. 

I don't know where to go next. I set up a meeting with my GM for the day after tomorrow, to show him the printouts. I want to file charges but I'm worried it won't be worth the cost. 

Please, help me out. I'm so sick and tired of being used &amp; abused by this company. What can I do to take action against my supervisor/workplace?

Tl;dr my new supervisor stole my bank card info to make company related purchases knowing I couldn't even afford to pay bills. I want justice but don't know what to do."
cdodsn,0,2019-07-15,How to deal with your first experience and how to be a better front end,RelativeAside,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cdodsn/how_to_deal_with_your_first_experience_and_how_to/,"TLDR: Hello to all,

I'm in my first internship experience as a front end, today is my 3rd month :).

Now  i want to share my experience and ask for some advices.

I don't have a CS background. I decided to took the path of the developer not for the wage, but because i'm happy to stay in front of a monitor for 12\\14 years. Yeah it could sounds creepy, but i love computer and programming.

&amp;#x200B;

before the internship i built a portfolio where you will find:

* a javascript and jquery game where you have random dungeon, random position for items, a little combat system, a little menu where you can choose your race and your class.
* a calculator made with react
* algosite - in this site you insert a number between 1 and 1000 and you will generate x random bars, every bars wil have a number inside it ( this number will determine the dimension of the bar ) and after a button named "" sort "" if you click on it will sort the bars
* Google Api project - in this little project you will find a main search bar where you insert for ex "" restaurants in ny "" and you will generate a new section where you will see the gmaps with all the restaurants in new york, a card section with all the restaurants, if you click on a card you will jump on another section where you will find the reviews about the place and the google street view.
* 8 more little projects, at very low level like "" random quote generator ""

to made this 12 projects it took me 8 months approx.

&amp;#x200B;

**I landed and Internship!**

During the internship in first month i worked on react native, redux, redux-saga, react navigator, react persist:

i made 5 differents project that made api call with redux saga, the hardest one was a sign-in sign up form that links to a real project api.

**Now it come the strangest part**

during my second month I was sent to work on a project with an hard deadline ( 30 days ), i tried to did my best. We were in 2 front end and 2 back end. They know I had only 2 months of experience on my shoulder.

In this project i succed to build the login and logout flows, the navbar, some tooltips, fix some bugs, and made some buttons, learned how to use git, redux thunk, redux form, Immutable Js.

I'm still slow as fuck to fix bugs or understands code when i read, but i think it's normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the main front end has left the team, and the project manager ask me to refactor everything without immutable js. I'm disappointed, because i'm not able to manage thounsands line of code alone( i'm completely alone during the day, my project manager allow me about 10\\15 mins of questions per day ).

&amp;#x200B;

But i don't want to give up and i want to take the best from this bad experience.How can i be a better front end ? How can i go over this really frustrating experience ?

I start to consider my self a bad programmer and a bad thinker, i don't know the reason.

I'm sure that "" work 14 hours per day "" bring us to a solid burn-out. How can i really improve my self and my productivity ?"

cdotys,71,2019-07-15,Do I list my retail experience? What about cannabis retail?,listen2thesilentrees,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/cdotys/do_i_list_my_retail_experience_what_about/,"A coworker and I got into a conversation about my job search tonight about whether or not to add my most recent retail experience (\~2 years) to my resume, or possibly how I would present it in my cover letter.

In June of last year, I finished my Masters and have since been applying to largely local government jobs, but some state and federal jobs as well. I had several internships during grad school, but before that, I list no work experience. The last semi-relevant experience before that was from 2013 to 2015, which would leave a \~2 year gap between jobs and a \~1year gap between my last job and the start of my grad program. It seems like there is some debate on whether or not to list work experience that is unrelated. I mean, we can definitely pull some transferable skills from customer service/retail, I'm sure, but is it worth it?

To make this question more difficult, I'll add a few details about my omitted work experiences. For the last 2 years, I have been working at a legal cannabis dispensary and the 3 years beforehand, I was a legal medical grower. I quit growing when I went back to graduate school because I was unable to get good grades and give the proper attention to my plants. I opt to work at a dispensary from there given my experience in the cannabis industry.

I think I have some anxiety that exists from pre-legalization ideas about cannabis, even though its largely accepted, especially in my community. I guess I am just worried about how hiring managers in local government would see this. My coworker suggested that I just list along with the rest of my work experience, but reference responsibilities without ever calling the product by name (ex: ""Managed inventory intake process"" or ""Assisted customers in finding desired products"" - with better wording of course). Maybe you all can shed some light on how I should approach this in my resume.

I've put in so many applications that I'm at the point of desperation. I live in an area with a highly competitive professional job market since the college is here pumping out lots of new/young professionals that love this area enough to stay here after graduation. I'm trying to explore all options to improve my chances of getting a better job: contacting people for informational interviews, new approach to how I write my cover letters, and critically reexamining my resume.

Thanks in advance for providing some perspective on this!"

I've been at the company two years, I've meet the CEO and many of the higher up management (company is international but I work in the US).

I got hired as an intern and make a set rate per hour with zero benefits included, that means no holiday pay unless I work the holiday, no vacation time, no sick time if I'm sick I take a day unpaid(never had to do this I work if I'm sick and handsantize before I touch anyone's or my own keyboard each time, I've always worked sick though and I haven't taken any sick days yet). But here's the catch I've been here working solely alone for these past years as far as running the company's IT (manufacturing). I was a complete novice at the beginning but had just enough knowledge of computers they gave me a shot. I can credit this tenfold for giving me the upper hand and letting me learn while in school. I spent a lot of my own time sacrificed as well learning which was very necessary to keep up but now I personally have deployed in a already created domain. Exchange(including the SSL and website DNS management), wsus, WDS (with IP-Helpers on the Core switches to forward the broadcast traffic) gpos (msi software deployment included). New DHCP scopes with VLANs segmenting the entire network and assigning all important devices static IPs in their corresponding VLANs. Planned with management a load of changes and installs including a new server room and a fiber backbone which I personally had to do all technical configuration, I also help reroute a ton of the cables by hand in the office drop cowling and everything was done to the best of my ability around the standard work hours to not affect the clients (75 people work at this location roughly and 20 or so in the office not including guests). they helped move things physically and I did all configurations, troubleshooting, I help the clients as I am the only support as well here.


So at this stage, I'm pretty beat up and still chugging away, never got any raise but I did get lots of praise from everyone. At this stage I'm lost, what's next."

Furthermore, they already told my mother’s coworker that I will give the interviewer a gift—I didn’t know about this at the time. There are three major problems about this which is making me very hesitant to give my interviewer the gift.

First, my company, like most others, has a disapproving stance towards gift-giving—it’s not 100% prohibited, no exceptions, but my training videos made it quite clear that there are many stipulations even when you are allowed to give gifts. I don’t think I will get fired if people found out I gave the interviewer a gift, but I’m sure it won’t be in the spirit of the company either.

Additionally, I actually had three interviewers. It just turns out that only one of them has (indirect) connections with my parents, and is the one to whom my parents want me to give a gift to. I just feel that, at the very least, the situation will be pretty toxic if somehow the other two found out that they did not get any gifts...

Finally, and the most important reason: The interviewer isn’t even my manager, and except for the interview, we’ve never really talked or interacted or built much rapport (we work in pretty different areas project-wise and location-wise). In short, I don’t even really know her. The only reason I would be giving her the gift is because of parents’ connections.

My gut reaction is completely against this, but my parents really encourage me to give the gift, insisting that this is acceptable workplace etiquette.

So, in this situation, do you think it is acceptable to give the gift? My parents suggested that I ask the interviewer to lunch at a restaurant sometime, but I talked them out of it because it’s just way too much, especially because I don’t have her private contact information and do not want to ask her through company email. On the other hand, I don’t think giving her the gift at the company cafeteria during noontime is very appropriate either. I don’t even know what to say to her, honestly. “Thank you for your support”, “I really appreciate your help these past two months, I would like to give you a small gift”? I’ve never felt comfortable giving gifts, but especially giving gifts in this situation. The fact that I don’t even really know her that well makes the (potential) dialogues even more awkward and artificial.

I didn’t want to directly ask, but I’m pretty sure that none of the (non-Chinese) interns on my floor I’m working with is planning on giving any gifts—maybe to their managers, but I doubt to an interviewer—or agonizing over this issue. I seriously think that this is some sort of Chinese social nicety which doesn’t really translate well into American corporate culture. Am I right or wrong about this?"

I panicked and ended up taking the first job that said yes to me which happened to be an inventory coordinator for a automotive supplier. It’s been two months and while I don’t hate the job, I don’t enjoy it either nor do I feel like I am learning anything new. 

I’ve had two help desk internships before graduating and while they were both awesome learning experiences, I didn’t really get to be hands on with anything besides clearing out ticket queues and taking apart workstations. 

With all of this said, how do I move forward with a career in IT? Would it be career suicide leaving my current position of two months to pursue IT?"

at the moment I am completely confused which path I should take. I am a high school drop out. I quit High school with 18 due to depression and anxiety. After dropping High school I struggled to be consistent and therefore started things and didn't finish many projects. I had the opportunity to work as a Stewardess, didn't do it due to anxiety, I planed to go to Israel for volunteering for a year in a hospital, but didn't go, I had great Internship opportunities, but everything bored me. My parents were paying for everything I started and didn't do. With 21 I said to myself that I have to go back to an adult High school to get my university entrance qualification. I am living in Europe. Two years later I graduated with excellent grades, I lost so much weight and got more and more confident. After graduating, I went to the US and studied there for a quarter Psychology. During my stay, I had severe anxiety, including shingle rashes and stress coughing. I received an acceptance letter from med school in Europe and went back. I met my ex boyfriend in the US, and it was a pretty co-dependent relationship. He knew I was going to med school, and when I was there, he suddenly said he can't support me though seven years, he wants kids soon, etc. So I broke up with him, but struggled and went back to him, telling him I am going back to the US for him. I quit med school, I think not only because of him, but also because I just can't focus and have so much anxiety. I get all the opportunities and don't follow though with anything. I seriously don't know what I want. When I came back home from med school I knew that I had to break up with this guy, because he abused me emotionally and I was sick and tired of myself. I needed time apart from everything and started working at Starbucks in Switzerland. Working there, no offense against this kind of job, made me realize that I have so much more potential and want to do something with my life. I put a lot of money aside and wish to move back to the US, but at the same time I still could go back to med school, because I told them that I need a semester break to get a clear head. They understood. I don't know how to decide on a career. I feel pretty unstable due to my childhood. We moved a lot and nothing was really consistent with my parents. Maybe that is why I can't commit to anything. I am panicking, because I am already 24 and I have too many options open. I applied for this semester for several majors like law, economics, political science, psychology and got accepted. I don't know which way to go, I don't know what I want, but I want to take responsibility for my life and be independent so that I will never ever give up something for someone else again. Is med school worth it, how can I decide what to do now? Does anybody have a good advice?"

2. I really can't decide which degree to get, but from what I read everyone says that computer science is a good foundation and catch all. Is this true?

I wanted to see if I could potentially find anyone here who has worked in these two types of jobs.

I graduated three years ago with a criminal justice degree and am currently working as a . . . cashier.  Not exactly the best position to be in a few years after graduation.  The lack of internships really hurt me in the long run, and it didn’t help that most of these criminal justice jobs involved being in direct contact with people at their worst or lowest.

I still don’t want to try and give up using the degree, but the law enforcement field is more of a calling, and I don’t feel it’s the right choice for me.  Which left me with loss prevention or the other two fields mentioned.  Since loss prevention doesn’t have the highest earnings, I decided to try and land a job in the other two.

Some obstacles are in the way.  I live in an area where there really isn’t a variety of jobs (trades, healthcare, some tech, call centers, and part time work). I’ve also seen suggestions of an MBA in Finance, but I’m not sure I would land jobs with just a masters and no professional experience.  I also have very little money to move since most of what I make goes into the student loans debt.  There also isn’t any real company headquarters around here focused on these jobs in the area.

I’m thinking of landing a teller job, or getting a CAMS cert if I can save enough money.

**Demographics:**

First generation Mexican male from low income family and neighborhood. Being raised by a single mother. I go to a title I school + my family has been without a car for about a year and a half, so I get around town solely on bus and foot. This limits/ed my ability to do tons of extracurriculars that require travelling. I have Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder so sometimes life is just rough, too. I missed a lot of school my second semester of junior year (I had 45 absences in one class, over half of the whole semester) because of how depressed I was. I'm also gay. I don't know if any of this matters. Maybe there's a hook somewhere.

Currently a rising senior and have gone to a different school each year of high school except for Junior and Senior (due to familial issues), first being at an ""alternative"" P/F school and then at a charter school.

Published in University of \[STATE\] Student Poetry Journal, 2018

Attended a STEM honors program at \[STATE\] State University, Summer 2018 (6 weeks), received 3 credits in Applied Mathematics. Culminated in a research poster on the mathematical model I worked on all summer. I will submit this poster as supplemental material on my application. The program was merit-based.

Was an intern in a lab at the University of \[STATE\] working with animals (ants. insane little things. they're stupid and i've been stung several times. super complex social systems tho.) in a STEM summer internship program, SUMMER 2019. It was 7-weeks, I am just about done with it, and it has been absolutely grueling. I've been working 40 hours a week on research for a research poster that is just about finished.

I write good essays, contrary to my ACT essay score. The admission committee for the program I'm in now told me it was one of the best essays they'd ever received. My English teachers have all told me I have a talent, but I think they may be giving me a big head. Idk. I'm a perfectionist so they'll be good regardless.

**Recommendations:**

I'm like a teacher's pet, kind of. Most of my grades are A+'s because I get so invested in almost every class. I think they like me.
I’ll also be getting a recommendation from the Principal Investigator of the lab I interned in who is a well-recognized professor of ecology.

I am in the final year of my software engineering degree. I did a 1 year internship at a full stack software development company.

# Reasons for wanting to leave

**I was never able to fit into the culture and mentality of the society.**

I am non religious and fairly liberal minded. All my life I struggle to fit into the culture and people here. I don't have any true friends I could discuss my thoughts and feelings openly. Feels like wearing a mask.  I respect their opinions but would feel more comfortable in a more liberal society.

&amp;#x200B;

**Not satisfied with working conditions here**

I did my internship at a software company that is considered as one of the best here. And yet I am not satisfied with the culture here. Some teams work regular 9 - 5 jobs. Other times you have to work late nights without extra pay. The company of course  charges a premium price from these foreign clients. But little of it trickle down to employees. Starting monthlysalary is around $600 USD. Since it's kinda above average salary here many are satisfied. And as a full stack role you are supposed to do Front end, backend dev-ops etc.  And they switch you between different technologies. Therefore there is little room to develop expertise in a technology unless you do it on your spare time sacrificing your normal life. In most other companies personal life is non existent sometimes working 14 hour days for months on end. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What I expect by migrating**

I want to be able to do a 9 - 5 job where people care about their rights. Where I don't  want to sacrifice my health and personal life for my job. This is the main concern.

# I need a plan for the next 3 -  5 years

So the obvious problem is I can't think of migrating with just a degree without work experience. So, I intend to work here for a few years to get that experience.  But I don't know what kind of work or field that would improve my chances of migrating.

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer something related to IT and software since my degree and current work experience is based on that. But the problem is working in full stack tech company it's hard  to get good experience in a particular field. What other options in IT do I have?"

I started my internship 5 weeks ago in a startup in London. I had just finished my first year in CS and was happy to land a paid internship.

I got a call the same day after the interview was over, saying I had gotten the position. I was really happy and was looking forward to getting my first real life experience working in the tech industry.

When the internship started I was given a task to clean up some CSS code from hubspot (content management tool like wordpress). During this process the head engineer who interviewed me was very annoyed with me whenever I would ask a question.

Once I was done with that task, I managed to save around 2000-3000 lines of code. After that I was tasked with creating an internal software for the employees to use, to manage logins, give Permissions, etc..

The project was to be done in Django, whereas the company exclusively used, Laravel, Flask and React. They give me no sort of guidance and no real estimate of when they wanted things to be done. I had previously informed them that I had 0 experience with backend development and was learning a lot of things on my own (outside of my university). They were constantly setting unrealistic targets for me to hit  and when I would complain about the targets, they said that I was being ungrateful and that this is the reality of the industry.

None of them have experience with Django and so I often find myself stuck at a problem with no one to ask for help. I was assigned a ‘buddy’ who was supposed to be my first point of contact regarding any issues, but he quit the week after I came. It has now gotten to the Point where I hate coming in. I am made to feel like shit and no one is willing to help me.  


I feel so misled by the internship experience and feel like maybe I am the problem.   I don't feel part of the team and don't feel welcomed into the company. I have head  from other engineers that the head engineer didn't want an intern and that's why he is acting out. I have had no professional coding prior to this internship, and first year CS doesn't teach much outside of basic Java and basic web technologies.

In spite of the negativity I am facing in this internship, I feel like I have learned a lot. I am trying my best to continue to work and learn but I feel so unmotivated and afraid to make mistakes.  


What should I do? Are they right am I being ungrateful? I feel so alone and am just waiting for the end of this internship (3 more weeks)."

I have a degree in Information Technology and had a chance to study on one of the best coding bootcamp in the US but I did not finish it since I failed the last exam before our thesis time. It was a great learning experience. However, for the past 6 years of me working online as freelancer doing WordPress customization (not really hard coding) and modifying themes, using CSS as a tool for design, writing basic tutorial and doing some virtual stuffs, I never really turned into a ""Software Engineer"".

I recently loose my online job which was a WordPress customization job so it's time for me to look for new opportunities since I also have a family to feed on. While browsing on some job posts about Web Development and Mobile Development, most of these requires atleast reasonable skills on react, php, python, ruby on rails, javascript etc, which I am not really an expert or I should say I am not confident to work on. It just hit me hard in the face that I am really too far away from my dream to becoming a ""legit"" Software Engineer / Web Developer.

I was hoping to get into a company that is doing serious web development and can get me as an intern, train me even though paying me just a bit of money just really to dive in to the actual Software Engineering environment but I guess it's really not going to happen as no company even individual would want to waste their precious time for a person like me. 

Wondering how I can go to the path of SE while taking care of my finances. It's just too hard and frustrating."

Was wondering what’s the best thing for me to do.

So for my pre-senior summer, my mom told me that her college friend can arrange an internship at his small town IT company in China.

I get there, and learn that they’re working on an some website/app for a nursing school.

A few issues arise:

My Chinese isn’t very proficient. Communication can get relatively difficult. 

I have minimal experience with creating apps/websites. 
I’ve looked at did a little research and they’re using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, etc. I’ve done coding competitions with Java, and learnt some HTML/CSS on my own.

There seems to be lacking peer-to-peer communication.
The office is relatively quiet, and everybody just seems to be doing their own thing. With an office of around 5 people it’s either small-talk, or talking about the client’s needs.

I’m staying for 3 weeks, hoping to get at least something out of this experience. The past 2 days have been me doing some Javascript/HTML relearning.

**I was wondering what’s the best way I could spend my time there?**

My “supervisor” assigned me a webpage to make, but I don’t nearly have the skills to complete it, and I highly doubt they’ll rely on me completing it.

I tried asking what she’s doing ATM to maybe do some over the shoulder watching, but I think she misinterpreted that to me saying can you assign me something.

So back in 2010 I decided to go back to school and get my bachelor's. I started at a community college, then transferred to a reputable state university and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. Decent GPA (3.4), but did not do internships (I had previous work experience in other companies, but nothing tech-related). I always liked computers, business, technology, etc. so I figured it would be a good degree. Well, after graduating I struggle to find jobs in the industry so I ended up working jobs unrelated, mostly in the construction/sales fields. Now I've been unemployed since February and am seriously thinking about going back to school to improve on my degree. I'd  like to get into something like a Business Analyst, and I see companies looking for Tableau experience - something that was not really used when I was in school. The community college where I studied before offers some certificate programs, and one them is in Health Information Technology. It's a 39 credit program that includes healthcare terminology, systems, coding, etc. I mean healthcare does not particularly interest me, but I am just looking to have something that will ultimately help me get into a promising career. Alternatively, they also have Network Security Administration (24 credits) and Cisco Certified Networking (30 credits). Does anyone here have any experience with certificates like these?"

I'm trying to figure out if I should move to the city and rent out a cheap room for the next few months then leave the country, or just flee the country now. In May I graduated college, since then I've been working 6 days a week at an internship and my PT job. I was going to move home at the end of the summer for the rest of the year to save money on rent then I was going head off to New Zealand around December/January because I got a working holiday visa. It's always been a dream of mine to live abroad, and now I have the chance. The other option now is to just move to NZ because my mom is saying I need to find a full time job before I'm able to move back home. I'm applying to places like crazy, but its almost unrealistic to find a good full time job in my field within a few weeks. Money isn't really an issue at the current moment, I have like $10,500 saved so I can live off of that for a while if I have to. My student loans aren't a problem either since the payments are so low and I had them deferred. 

Given my current situation would you:

A) Go to the city, rent out a cheap room, work some shitty jobs for a few months, save money then head to NZ 

B) Go to the city, work until I die. and do nothing

C) Head to NZ at the beginning of September and try to find housing and a job within the next month and a half. 

At this point, moving in with my mother if probably not going to happen, so I have no idea what to do next. The only thing is, I have no idea what I would do once I got back. The visa is for a year. I don't know where I'd live or anything. I essentially have a month to figure out where I'm going to be working and living.

cdy1sw,5,2019-07-16,The Tully Way Hotel [Part Two],TullyWayReceptionist,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cdy1sw/the_tully_way_hotel_part_two/,"[Part One](https://reddit.app.link/GXuku028mY)

Welcome back to The Tully Way Hotel. I would have written sooner but we had a bit of an emergency here. You see, the hotel is, as some of you might have surmised, not exactly real. I mean it's real in a sense that it exists, it just, doesn't exist on your plain of reality and as such it's impossible to leave, well mostly.

A few days back we had a new arrival, a real piece of shit, almost sent him straight to the kitchen but then realised that that would be to good for him. His name was Percival Carmichael and he was responsible for the deaths of over two hundred people, more if you count the abortions. He was a doctor who on his third day in a hospital killed a patient. It wasnt like he tried to, he just read the chart wrong and administered a lethal dose of some drug and the guy was gone in just over an hour. 

While it was cleared as an accident, the Dr. Carmichael got his first rush. He even said he got a hard on as he watched the guy convulse and foam at the mouth. After this Carmichael chased the high. The first hospital he worked in saw a one hundred and twelve percent increase in its mortality rates. He killed several patients, either by selecting surgeries he wasn't fully capable of performing or purposefully misdiagnosing patients so that the nurses and interns would do his dirty work.

After he left that hospital he got a job as a staff doctor in a nursing he where among other things  he, and he was proud of this, fingered an old woman as she died. He gave her a lethal dose of heroin and then got her and himself off. He claimed that killing elderly people was more sexually gratifying for him. Said it made him think of his mother, and of wanting to kill her.  

He went back to a hospital after that and worked as an emergency room doctor. People coming in from car crashes, stabbings, shootings. If he made a mistake here it would barely be noticed.

He was arrested, fifteen years after his first kill when he was in a bar and he started a fight with some rugby player and stabbed him sixteen times with a stolen scalpel. He said that he killed more people than he could remember and when the police went to his house they found the be tags of each of his victims and the body of his mother buried in the back garden. He said he killed her after he came home one night with a take away and she asked where hers was.

He was sentenced to death by lethal injection but some idiot had let him into the prison hospital the day before and he managed to brew up an antidote. He lay there laughing at the prison officers until one of them had enough and shot him in the head. No antidote to that one.

Anyway, he arrived in the afternoon, as usual the fog hung thick in the air outside the hotel and when he said his name Karen, who came in early visibly shuddered (one of the downsides to being psychic I guess). I filled out his card first and when the list of names just kept going I asked.

""Would you like to go to lunch sir, the chef has a wonderful special on today?"" but as I finished the sentence I realised that would be a mistake, this guy had to suffer. He shook his head and I gave a little fist pump beneath the desk. ""Very well then, you'll be in room thirteen. Second floor, second door on your left.

""Are you sure?"" Karen whispered. I nodded. 

Most hotels don't have a room thirteen because of superstition. Hell, we only have a room thirteen when it's needed.
""Room thirteen, that's, unusual."" Carmichael said.
""We're not very superstitious here sir."" I said with a grin. I heard Karen gagging behind me.
""Well then it's a good thing I'm not either."" he said in his slow southern drawl.
""Well then sir, I'll leave you to get settled in."" I said and placed the key on the desk. Carmichael looked down at me and then at the key. I tried to hide my disgust at him but I'm sure I wasn't doing a very good job, or at least that's what his smile indicated.

I was sitting at the four minutes later when the phone rang, the display showed a series of symbols that flickered wildly instead of numbers. I smiled and answered.
""Good afternoon, Mr. Carmichael, how can I help you?""
""There's someone else in my room."" he said with a somewhat bemused tone.
""Yes sir, that's the object of room thirteen."" I replied nonchalantly.
""I don't understand."" Carmichael said.
""It doesn't leave, it doesn't usually interact, it's just there."" I said masking my glee.

The object of room thirteen, to me at least, always manifested as a clock. If I'd spent any considerable amount of time there the half ticking sound it made would drive me insane. That's just what it does. The fact that it looked like a person was something new.
""Tell me sir, is it male or female?"" I asked.
""It's ... It's hard to tell."" Carmichael replied.
""Why is that sir?""
""Well it's just standing there, I walked over to it but didn't move, it didn't respond. I walked around it but it just turned as I moved."" he said, a little puzzled.
""Well sir I'm really sorry but there's nothing I can do to be honest. It shouldn't do anything harmfull so you should be fine. Have a good day."" I said and hung up.

The biggest curio about room thirteen is that once inside, once the door closes you can't leave, not unless a member of staff lets you out. We sometimes ca it the Esher room. If a guest opens the door the just sees a reflection of the room and if the walk into it they're just back in the room. One previous guest went mad after running through the door for a solid week. He died of exhaustion. 

Another cut himself to ribbons trying to escape through the window, apparently the same thing happens. He jumped through and landed on the floor of the room. He tried a few more times before he bled to death.

Later that evening as I was sitting waiting for my shift to end I noticed that Mr. Carmichael's check-in card had started to glow. As I took it out of the box I noticed a new line of text at the bottom. MAGIC USER, PLEASE TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS. MANAGEMENT. It was rare that management would miss something like that. I called room thirteen but got no answer. For a moment I wondered if he had died already, maybe the faceless man had already driven him mad. 

I went down to the manager's office, which had been empty for years and just contained a large plinth in the centre of the room with a clouded glass sphere floating above it. I placed my hands on the sphere and closed my eyes, focusing on the number thirteen. Within seconds I found myself standing in the room. I looked around and saw the blurred outline of the object standing in the middle of the room. On the floor beneath me I saw a strange symbol that was drawn in fecal matter. 
""Shit!"" I exclaimed as I realised Carmichael wasn't in the room. I closed my eyes again and thought of the office. I was back there when I opened my eyes. 

I ran back to the desk and called management.
""Sir's, uh, we have a problem."" I said. What came through the phone was a garbled mess of noises that somewhere on the back of my mind became words.
""What happened?"" It said.
""Carmichael, sir's, he uh, he seems to have escaped."" I said.
""He was in room thirteen, how did he ..."" the voice cut off and could feel management scraping around in my mind, looking through my memories. It kind of felt like someone pulling out your fingernails (and believe me I have experience with that) but it's in your head. Like the nerves in your brain are being simultaneously set on fire and being frozen solid and you can see every memory they look at. They looked at the symbol on the floor.

""The Harmony of Fools."" Management said after seeing it.
""Excuse me?"" I said wondering if it was an insult or the name of thing.
""The symbol, it's The Harmony of Fools. It's dead magic, before your time."" Management said (and if it's before my time, it's VERY old.)
""What do we do?"" I asked.
""Send security, the spell would get him out of the room,maybe out of the hotel but not much further. I nodded, knowing that would sense it and hung up.

I hesitated before calling security. There are something's I wouldn't wish on anyone, no matter how evil, and security is one of them. But call I did.
""Hello security?"" I said as something answered. There was a series of grunts that indicated it was. ""There's been a breach, an escape."" I said, more grunts. ""He may be outside the hotel."" I said. More grunts, louder now, followed by what could be called laughter. ""Terminate protocol, be cautious he's a magic user."" I said. I heard a grunt and the sound of scraping that told me (from experience) that security was nodding.

I have never seen security (thank the ancients) and I never want to. Karen said she saw them once and that they were beyond description. She said that as she looked at them it was like her mind rebelled against remembering their form. He tried to draw them but all she did was draw a massive black scribble. She said it wasn't what it looked like but that it was all she picture when she thought about them. Karen, who I mentioned was psychic, said that she couldn't read them, not that there was a block, just that there was nothing there, no mind. The chef told me once that they were gaurds from the old prison.

I waited impatiently for word of Carmichael's demise but after about an hour I of silence I started to worry. It was around then that felt something behind me, a hand wrapped around my throat and I felt the cold sharpness of a scalpel.
""You should have given me a better room, whore."" Carmichael said.
""It was the one you deserved."" I replied.
""Y'know, I've heard of this place, heard stories at least."" he said as he leaned in close and locked my ear.
""Really?"" I said genuinely surprised.
""Yeah, Tully Way Hotel. The place where only the worst of the worst are welcome."" he said. 
""That's what's on our TripAdvisor page."" I retorted. I reached forward a little and quickly pressed the panic button beneath the desk. (Not that I was panicking, he could cut my head off and I'd still be fine.)

""I want to speak to Management."" Carmichael said. 
I laughed and felt the blade nick my throat. ""Management, you want to ..."" I couldn't finish the sentence I was laughing so hard.
""What so funny about that?"" he asked.
""If you were to see them, your eyes would boil out of your head, if you were to hear them, your brain would melt out of your ears you shit writing mortal."" I said still laughing. ""Besides there's someone else you have to meet first.

I've tried writing this next part five times and I've had to give up each time: Security came in, (fuck if I can remember what they look like) and what happened next was, well, even for me, impossible. Carmichael's body convulsed and the scalpel slit into my throat, (I'm fine) and he started to twist, his arms cracked and broke as they twisted around his back into an impossible position. His legs did the same except they twisted forwards. His stomach and chest seemed to bubble (I should have mentioned, he was naked.) Large blood filled blisters formed across his chest and burst but the blood didn't spray. It just floated there in front of him. I looked up and saw that his mouth was open wide, wider than should be possible, his tongue had ballooned to fill the space it created. His eyes turned pearl white and blood seeped from his tear ducts. His body convulsed more and he literally, and I mean literally, disappeared up his own ass. His entire body collapsed in on itself and just sucked itself up his ass.

I remember hearing a grunt from the unrememberable security and then it was over. On the desk in front of me was a good coin that glinted and sparkled under the lights of the reception. I grabbed it quickly an shoved it into my pocket. Just one step closer but that's a story for another time. Like I said, a little excitement on am otherwise quiet day her at the Tully Way Hotel. Check-in time is whenever you arrive, check-out time, well that's a little harder to nail down."

I was given deploy permissions to a production app the business relies on on day 3.

I am now expected to merge changes and deploy on my own with no code review.

The project I'm working on now involves multiple languages running on multiple devices across a distributed system. I'm doing it mostly alone, and no one is really reviewing my work. This project is supposed to be deployed by the end of the week, but there's no record of the configuration for some of the devices I'm supposed to deploy on nor are there any test devices. Every device is out in the wild running the last version of production software right now and the company is expecting to upgrade seamlessly early next week.

This seems crazy. What would have happened if I was a crappy intern and had no idea what to do? This company depends on this project as one of its big revenue generators, and they trusted something that seems really important to an intern. Is this normal?"

It's a nice job at a mid-size company with generous pay, great benefits, and relaxed culture, and I have interned there previously. I am moving from the East Coast to the West Coast, so it's a pretty big transition.

But now I can't go anymore and don't know what to do about it. My dad developed a tremor in his left hand recently and  went for an MRI, which came back a few days ago showing a large brain tumor. I don't feel comfortable moving so far away anymore and plan to renege on the offer so I can stay at home or nearby.

So my question is not whether I should renege (I am going to), but rather what will happen to me and my career prospects after I do. 

Most of the questions about reneging on here involve people who received better offers shortly after accepting one, but I of course do not have other offers and would have to start a job search from scratch. I worry that by reneging I will destroy my most recent (and best) reference, damning my eventual job search, even if my hiring manager sympathizes and understands that shit happens. How much will I get hurt?

More about me in case it helps: I graduated from a top-tier university in the US this past May with a decent average (3.6) and some good extra-currics (no research though). I worked software engineering internships each summer except this one. I live on Long Island, not close to but not far from NYC, so that is probably where I will eventually find a job going forward.

Thanks for your help."

I've gotten very few recruiters reaching out to me. 

Most I.T. jobs that I do qualify for end up being too far from me. You can see in my resume, that I'm located in the Northern VA/D.C. area which is booming with government contractors and I.T. positions but I can barely get an internship. 

I've done Lyft but I don't know if that is something I can use to fill the unemployment gap while in school. 

Usually employers ask ""why did you stay that long there?"" my usual response is ""I enjoyed the work culture and it was flexible with my school schedule."" 

Then they say ""why did you leave and what have you been doing since then?"" to which I reply ""I had a family emergency and was focusing on school and taking care of an ill family member"" 

I have just updated my resume and would like to have a critique.

I've tried to organize all the skills that I've learned while in college and someone else had mentioned here to add relevant work from college so I added projects that I've worked on as well.

* DC metro area.

My counteroffer was 100k with 5k relocation, which I absolutely need. If there is no relocation, I simply cannot afford to move and pay the initial months rent, etc. I sent the counteroffer primarily because I need relocation assistance.

Company B (not a formal offer, but everything points to it being one after talking to HR)

Now I’m at my current job, a very small marketing agency of 10ish people. I’ve been at my new job for about a month. The pay and benefits are pretty good and what really drew me was my role. It’s a role I’ve been chasing at larger companies.

But I can’t see myself stay at my current gig for more than a year. If I have to, of course I’ll tough it out but my head is constantly thinking of my next move. And what worries me is coming from giant media companies and animation studios to a super small marketing agency will hurt my chances to get back into those bigger companies.

&amp;#x200B;

One bank has a lot of positions open for interns but so far I already went there for one and got rejected. Should I apply for all positions there or will they automatically ignore me then?  
Even if I would get a response from them for some interviews and getting rejected for every position it would feel really bad(especially since you have to go through the same security and appearing there every 3 days for a new interview feels awkward)

&amp;#x200B;

If I would be rejected for every position what about in the future? Would that hurt my chances to work there say one year later after my studies?"
ce66rz,95,2019-07-16,"For anyone considering Koho: Been using for over 1yr now. Started off great, but the past month has been an absolute nightmare. Cashback going missing, balances off by over a hundred dollars for days at a time. It's actually messed up my finances more than once due to the number of issues. Long post",OhNoKoho,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ce66rz/for_anyone_considering_koho_been_using_for_over/,"**EDIT: So after weeks of pleading for a phone call, I just got off the phone with the KOHO team lead. It looks like my posts on Reddit - as well as my Tweets - have generated some stir in the company. I've been told that the situation has made it's way to Daniel Eberhard who is the CEO of KOHO.** 

**I don't fully buy the reason why I experienced the issues with my PowerUps because timelines and certain other things just didn't line up, but at this point I'm tired and just glad this and the other issues that myself and others have experienced are finally getting attention, and being taken seriously. As I told the person I spoke with, I'm not sure this would be enough to keep me on-board, but I do appreciate some effort to make it at least seem like they are concerned, even if it means I was forced to expend far more effort of my own to reach this conclusion.**

**I am kind of forced to keep using them for the next month at least until I can return to Toronto from my trip, so I guess we'll see what happens. Keeping the post up because a promise is simply words if not backed by action, so until I see some serious movement on these issues over the next month, this post remains up. I will keep updating if anything more comes to light. Thank you all for hearing me out, and sharing your own personal experiences.**

----

So in case some of you don't know what it is, Koho is an alternative banking platform built on an app. You get a unloaded prepaid visa which you can load funds onto via e-transfer, setup direct deposit to have your paycheques deposited into your Koho account, cashback offers (known as PowerUps) as well as a bunch of other neat things that are appealing to someone like myself who prefers to keep away from big banks and deal mostly with credit unions et al. 

Well my experience with them - as the title states -  started off really well. It was a working for my needs, and the few times I had an issue it was minor and quickly resolved. 

Fast forward to this past month to where I've had the entirety of my PowerUps go missing overnight without me touching them, balances being off sometimes over $100 and from anywhere between 2hrs - 2 days at a time, and the list goes on. I actually have screenshots of some of the issues, so I think I'll just address them one by one below. 

Before I go further though, by far the biggest issue is the fact they just straight took my PowerUps I had banked up, and a month later have yet to restore them, despite acknowledgement of the issue, and consistent promises of it being restored in full. Sometimes they promise it will be a few days, others it's end of the week. Well it's been 4 weeks of promises, and now the most recent ""support"" agent I chatted with doesn't even understand the issue at all. Oh yeah, they also only have chat support except it's not what you normally think of as typical chat support because it appears as though they only have maybe 4-5 actual support agent so it can take hours or days inbetween their replies to you. It's glorified email support. Now their knowledge base states that you can request a callback on the phone from support, but I've done that numerous times and not only did I never receive a call, but when I would ask for a callback while speaking with support they would skip right over it with no acknowledgement of the request, and twice I sent individual requests and those are still sitting in my chat history with no replies. 

That said here are some of the other glaring issues, complete with screenshots:

[**Incorrect balances:**](https://i.postimg.cc/RC85zqtr/67058918-2339165822842102-7012447444105428992-n.jpg) So this screenshot was taken after the first time I noticed the issue with my balances showing incorrectly. The first time it happened it was off by over $100, so when I woke up the next day and checked my balance I was like ""oh, I actually have a bit more than I thought!"" and went out and actually purchased a few things I was putting off until bills were paid because I was under the impression I had money I didn't know I had. Certain purchases I made didn't even show in the app until the next day as well, so I couldn't have even noticed by adding them up (not like I should have to anyway). Once I saw the problem, I started recording it, and the result of that is what you see here. I don't normally pay attention to the notifications and dismiss them, which is why you see so many there now, and why I didn't notice the obvious the first time around. This is a major issue for obvious reasons. They knew of the it, yet didn't inform any of their users whatsoever until they contacted support after noticing it themselves. Essentially this whole ordeal in me missing a bill payment which then incurred me a late fee.


[**Unable to access card functions:**](https://i.postimg.cc/G2g0tmSy/66691787-464330637458460-1883994778849247232-n.jpg) So this one isn't obvious at the beginning, but here's what's happening; Koho allows you to generate a virtual card that you can use for online purchases etc. They also allow you to instantly freeze your cards at the touch of a button, all of which is managed on this screen. So what's the problem? Well the only card you are seeing here is my virtual card, and the big white space below it is where my physical card would normally be. Now what's important to understand here is that my 5-year old niece uses my tablet almost daily - which has both cards attached to it -  so to avoid accidental purchases I freeze it when she is using it. For a whole day I was unable to purchase anything with my card because for some reason it was completely missing from the app, and it was locked. Without getting into the details this resulted in a very embarrassing and uncomfortable situation, on top of preventing me from being able to pick up my meds.

[**Basic 101 problems like this:**](https://i.postimg.cc/L5Jc1Fr0/67015496-1322984651184433-5248444697067651072-n.jpg) Now I know this might seem petty to most of you, but anytime I would cash out my PowerUps, this is what it looks like. Been this way for months. This is basic 101 shit (I'm a dev by trade) and if they can't even get something like this right, it's absolutely no wonder that they have been having so many issues recently, and why it takes so long for them to actually address them. A damn 2nd year intern could fix that...

[**Often the app will only show a white screen:**](https://i.postimg.cc/q7LHfLsQ/67015496-1322984651184433-5248444697067651072-n-1.jpg) In this particular situation it seems the app did this before I had a chance to check a support reply, cause every other time it happens it's pure white. It can be like this for hours at a time. 

[**Sometimes it will at least show the keypad:**](https://i.postimg.cc/1t3hyqMS/67086269-1313723458786687-4223373519775334400-n.jpg) While it occasionally shows a keypad instead of a pure blank screen, none of the buttons work, so an improvement only in aesthetics. 

Anyway I know this was a long post, but I felt it important to warn people considering using Koho seriously in any capacity, cause if this past 5-weeks has been any indication, it looks like it's a bumpy road ahead. If you end up with anything other than superficial, easy-to-fix issues with the platform, or need a simple question about a service answered, good luck getting any actual support from them. Considering this is a financial platform with the intention of being a full alternative to traditional banking, the fact that issues like this can go unaddressed, or not taken seriously is a big red flag and I personally will be cancelling my account as soon as I get all my accounts and services setup with another card from an actual bank."

&amp;#x200B;

the other day my boss asked my fellow intern and i if we would be interested in staying at our current company after we graduated. he asked us when we were graduating again and brought up that there was a job opening in our dept. he said it would likely be filled before we graduated, but they will likely be doing multiple hirings around when we graduate and that we would be at the top of the last bc we were interns. i know that there is a strong likelihood to be hired on full-time based on the nature of the project i'm working on and would likely continue to be working on should i get hired full-time.

&amp;#x200B;

i know that sounds great and all, but the problem is that i'm really not crazy about this internship (or this line of work really) at all. you're probably thinking, ""ok don't accept an offer then..."". however, i must say that this internship is at a REALLY, REALLY impressive and prestigious organization. the kind of organization where people would think i'd be crazy to say no to. as for the positives, i've learned a lot being at this internship, i know that it already looks awesome on my resume and a full time position would look even better, i wouldn't have to worry about job hunting, the position would be in a city where lots of my friends live, etc. however, i'm generally not stimulated or satisfied by what i'm doing/what i would likely be doing as a full-time employee. i honestly feel really sad and bored and unmotivated when it comes to my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

basically, i don't know if i would be crazier for turning down a job at this awesome organization or to accept a job that eats away at my happiness...

any advice? thanks in advance!"

My college GPA is shitty, and I’ll graduate with a shitty GPA since I only have one more year. I’ll have only two nontechnical internships, so I won’t be able to get a good job.

I have no social skills and zero friends. I can’t befriend the people that I want to befriend. I have no friends my age (I’m 22) and I see no way to getting friends. 

My parents don’t respect me or love me either. I’m either going to to get kicked out of the house soon, or live in my parents’ basement for the rest of my life.

I’m pretty sure my girlfriend is no longer in love with me and has likely cheated on me for this reason. Whether or not she has, I’m pretty sure we’re not making it to marriage.

I have ADHD and can’t improve myself, I’ve never been able to change anything about myself.

I could go on and on, but at the end of the day I’m too much of a pussy to actually kill my self because I hate pain. I wish there was assisted suicide or something like that in my state where I could choose a painless execution method. But at the same time I’d hesitate because once you kill yourself you can’t go back, and I don’t want to give up whatever chance I do have. But, it’s getting to that time where I will soon be old enough to where I’m past my prime and I know I’ll never achieve good results. Then I won’t have any hesitation. Until now I guess I just endure this torture until then. I’ve always felt destined to kill myself, it’s just a matter of when I finally lose that last bit of hope and really don’t care anymore.

Sorry for taking up space with this ramble, I just realized I could use this sub to dump my feelings more or less."

&amp;#x200B;

I am honestly overjoyed right now, and so happy that I will be going to Umiami in the fall, god willing!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up on a farm in a rural town in the middle of nowhere America, with an alcoholic dad who died when I was young, and an absent mother who has played no part in my life. I've had a pretty miserable life thus far. Growing up, I suffered years of abuse from lingering family members, sexual abuse from peers, and heavy bullying due to being on the autism spectrum and LGBT. I felt very hopeless and afraid. There were no resources or opportunities for kids like me. Most people here don't go to college, even the CC 30 minutes away. I had no one to push me towards education, or instill curiosity in me, as my family is incredibly poor and never really saw the value in a degree.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, I tried my best to keep up with the high-income kids, who had parental support, and school administrators actively caring about their futures. It seemed like because of my home-life, I was classified as a ""lost cause"" at my public high school. I took the few AP courses we had, every single one of them, with one exception for a course that could not be squeezed into my schedule. I was on the student council, the newly-formed science club, NHS, founded the first gay-straight alliance, worked part time since age 16 to support myself, did my own independent research, wrote a paper, and won 2 science fairs for it, won state writing awards, ap scholar awards, and did tons of volunteering for the science club. Despite the fact that I boosted my ACT to a 32 (in a school where the average was a 17 and even getting up to mid twenties was unheard of) I had a pretty low uw GPA, around a 3.4. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My teachers did not really believe in me, as there is a serious misconception in my area about what autism is (especially for women), and how abuse manifests into mental illness for many children living in poverty. I was very sick for a long time, and it was exacerbated by stress at home. I had issues showing up to school due to constant doctor's appointments and my mental health was rapidly declining. I had un-diagnosed PTSD from the sexual assault I experience, in addition to  ADHD. My autism was picked up by others, but not diagnosed until I was a senior, despite showing severe and noticeable symptoms my whole life! No one here knew what autism was!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When application season rolled around, I did not get accepted anywhere, besides a couple regional schools that didn't have my major. Yet, my first semester of college, I did better than my entire 4 years of high school. I had a fire in me, a determination to succeed, and my eyes became fixated on my prize: Education, and healing. Keep in mind, my high school education was fairly mediocre. I had never programmed before in my life, yet I was scoring straight A's in my CS courses. Most people at my school only learned proficiency in mathematics up to an Algebra 1 level, and here I was, doing calculus. Starting from zero, and paving my way up. I never had a 'knack' for math and science. In fact, I failed my AP Biology exam. Then got a 99 taking the same course in college. Once I had motivation, and got into a supportive environment, I realized I could succeed. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After a semester, I took time off to work and save money, and started going to a state school in the fall. My financial aid package was poor, but they told me after first semester, I'd be getting merit aid. Took 18 credit hours with a 4.0, CS major, didn't get any aid. I had to leave. So, I busted my ass once more. Whenever I applied to transfer again, I had almost a 3.8 gpa.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Despite having only manual labor and retail work experience, I scored a part-time job in IT. I got elected to student council, with a position in diversity and LGBT affairs, planning many events for my University, including some featured in local news. I attended an international philanthropy conference, where I met a former president. I competed at multiple hackathons, including at Ivy League schools. I was part of a machine learning research team, where I did work with IBM software and NLP. I learned another language and served in the club for said language- was told I had a knack for Japanese. Learned an instrument for the first time in my life and became skilled enough to where I was performing in concerts with the music students. This summer, I've been at an internship at a national lab, doing machine learning research, and have developed an automated physics application. I will receive a first author publication.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to 16 schools, and was rejected from 15. Vanderbilt said no. Ivies said no. USC said no. CMU said no. Stanford said no. I gave up all hope, and just knew that I'd be headed to the local CC in the fall due to finances, where I would lose my job and my access to do research. Then today, as I was working on write ups for my research, I received an email from the 16th school, University of Miami, telling me that I'd been accepted with a merit scholarship. This year's transfer class had an 18% acceptance rate, and yet they chose to pick me. I am going to study CS and Neuroscience, and I couldn't be happier. I will probably be the very first person from my hometown who will be attempting to pursue a phd and a research career. I am already the first person to study a bachelors in CS or Neuro at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was set up to fail in life. I was told that I couldn't do anything by my teachers in high school. I was called r\*\*tarted by my family.  But UM saw something in me, and gave me the chance to make my dreams come true. I didn't fail."

What would you do in this situation?",beyondinsanity,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ce7w9q/just_entered_my_first_sysadmin_role_my_future/,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to read.

I just started as a sysadmin at a very small company after having been helpdesk/desktop for just over 6 years over multiple internships and a full-time position. I have an education in Computer Science, PowerShell came pretty naturally to me as another language after I had gone through many CS courses in college so I was able to start automating early in my full-time career.

I developed quite a passion for automation and PowerShell in particular which led to me getting this role. Despite the fact that I have limited professional experience in the sysadmin world, they've been impressed with my capabilities in PowerShell and I've re-written many of their old tools and introduced source control to the team. I've taken on introducing PowerShell DSC as well and have already developed configurations that will soon be used in our production environment.

The issue now is that I'm trying to lay out my goals moving forward and I want to steer my career towards DevOps. I have worked in my spare time with CI/CD (AppVeyor), PowerShell module building, AWS (currently taking Acloudguru's Certified Solutions Architect Associate course), and I know that the cloud and DevOps is where I want to be.

However, I personally feel that I have a bit of a knowledge gap between traditional IT operations skills (knowing the ins and outs of Windows Server, server hardware, backups, etc.) and the jump that I want to make to DevOps. I don't want to neglect learning those skills, but I've always had a tough time deciding where to focus my self-learning and end up trying to learn too many things at once.

If you were me, where would you spend your time? I think the idea of learning more about CI/CD tools (Jenkins comes to mind), cloud computing (AWS), IaC and configuration management (Salt/Chef/Puppet/Ansible/Terraform) all sounds like so much fun. But I don't want to leave what I view as my ""weak points"" behind and regret it later.

At home when I'm not working on the Acloudguru course, I've been tinkering in my homelab which consists of a VM host (repurposed gaming rig) running a Windows domain and some Linux VMs, 2-bay Synology NAS, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter-X and a Unifi AP-AC-Lite. I've learned a lot with this lab but I don't feel like I've truly been diving deep into any one thing.

Thanks for any advice that you may have."

1. I have never suffered from anxiety in my life, i'm typically a very sociable and outgoing person.
2. The weekend before the first crisis mentioned below I accompanied some friends on their birthday in Vegas, I was walking down the strip when something flew straight into my throat, I had an insane coughing fit and have had a mild pain in my throat ever since. 
3. I worked a 10-6 job, 1 hour commute each way, and I work in a very isolated environment only speaking to someone maybe every 2-3 hours. 
4. Every now and the the skin on my face just starts to burn but I feel emotionally relieved when this happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated college like 3 months ago, almost immediately after I went straight into an internship at a dream company in my hometown, two hours from where I went to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first three weeks went great, I was doing tasks and contributing to the project then one day I get back from lunch and I have a complete and total crisis. Mortality, existential, everything. It's not like I hadn't had those thoughts before but it was full blast I couldn't concentrate on anything I was on the verge of tears and I completely lost my appetite and was getting cold sweat + shivers. 

I felt like my world was falling apart around me. I go home lay in bed and just crisis myself to sleep. This goes on for 3 more days.

On the second day I noticed a sore on jaw which I popped and I somehow immediately emotionally calmed down, but after a few hours it came back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally get the courage to tell my mother who schedules me an appointment with a doctor in mexico (really really seedy places, worked out of a converted apartment building) since I can't afford an american doctor. Dude takes my blood tests finds nothing weird, he does claim to find traces of staph in the sore that I popped. Prescribes me antibiotics which I dutifully took for a week.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm still having mild panic attacks at any given time for 2 weeks. I cave in and go see a different mexican doctor (ACTUAL CLINIC this time) who tells me if I had had staph infection I should have been in the hospital and that I have no signs of staph. Second doctor takes my blood test and finds nothing weird again, prescribes me dietary supplements. 

&amp;#x200B;

That same week I was still getting attacks and I was just sad 95% of my waking hours, irrationally so but I literally couldn't divert my thoughts. I was locked into just feeling like everything is coming to an end. I started looking for answers everywhere, I went back to the doctor with the nicer clinic and emphasized the sore throat thing, he said it did look inflamed and prescribed me medicine for that, I ran with that medication until it ran out and while my throat isn't in AS much pain anymore, I'm still in some pain. I also really emphasized that I felt like I was going to die at any given time constantly and he prescribed me anxiety meds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well I dont know if it was the throat or the anxiety meds but my attacks faded away but now I'm just perpetually sad and I have no idea why or how. Nothing in my life has necessarily been going terribly other than the fact that my friends are 2 hours away and I work 8 hours a day in isolation. I have zero desire to end my life if not the opposite, I just want to stop being so fucking sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

No one has been able to give me answers and I don't know where else to turn."

It’s a huge change for me since I’m 15, and I was planning on working during the summer. Now everything’s changed. In Louisiana summer ends in the beginning of August, so I don’t even have time to get a job. I haven’t finished making my resume since our computer hasn’t been set up yet. I can’t find places that’ll pay me and allow me to work at my age. I can do volunteer work but I need cash. I have to re learn a new area, and I can’t get to far away areas because the metro system is virtually non existent here. Also no trains so fml. 

My older sister is going to a university (she was recently going to community college.) and is going to a different state and she needs money to get an apartment and everything. My mom is making my sister take out huge amounts of student loans to pay for literally everything. But idk how she will live off that since it’ll be difficult for my mom to not only pay for my private school, but pay for my sister to, you know, eat over there. But I want to be able to help. (My sister doesn’t have a job. I’ll explain that later) 

My mom couldn’t save up any money for our education (she’s always been somewhat horrible at managing her money, so I’m not surprised) so I want to help. Maybe if I save up my paychecks I can have a lot of money for my sister. Then when we reach a stable point, I can start saving up for my own education. 

Overall I’m frustrated. I want to be mature and not blame everything on my mom, but it really does feel like all of this is because my mom was only focusing on herself. Let me explain.

We only moved because my mom was getting a higher salary. I was happy about the salary, but everything about it would be negative to me and my sister. My sister is going to a community college that has all the courses she needs, but moving to Louisiana would have her going across the whole city looking for her classes and the courses she needs. It’d be too expensive for her to drive around (Uber money) and she’d probably have to change her bachelors because they didn’t have all her courses. 

For me it would pretty much nullify my internship at this university I had. (I learned how to make a resume there) Meaning that scholarship would be for nothing. And I wouldn’t be able to get a job at all during the summer. It’d be too late. 

We told my mom all these issues and more, (I won’t say because it’s too personal) and she completely brushed us off. Like, “but that doesn’t matter, I’ll get a higher pay check!” And completely missing the point. She’d always push me to do better in school, always saying things like, “oh you don’t care, you don’t care about anything! Just yourself!” Which is fair because I was doing poorly in school. I mean I only had one 70 at the end of the year,  but don’t even get me started on how bad my grades are throughout the year. But now I want to care, I need to care, and she’s actually mad that I care. “Oh you didn’t care before, why do you care now!?” Would you rather I stay consistent and not give a single fuck about my education, or do you want me to pull a 180 and start giving a shit? Which one will make you feel better?

The worst part is, my mom doesn’t want to help us with (partially) anything. Every time I would ask stuff like, “yo how do I make a resume? Hey how do I apply for this?” She always gets mad. Saying stuff like, “you should know this already” when she knows full damn well they don’t teach you this in school. (Depends on the school) Then we tell her that, and she straight up ignores us. She just gets quiet and changes the subject. I’m so sick and tired of not knowing anything. 


I just feel so trapped. I want to get a job and help my family, but I feel like there’s just more and more obstacles in the way. I know I have to keep on going if I want a job. So I guess volunteer work is the only way to get started. Which is fine! I wouldn’t mind doing that! It’s just I’m desperate for money. 

Hope my sister doesn’t find this because she has a reddit account. Boy would that be a mess."

ce8wmm,2,2019-07-17,Keep getting screwed over? [CA],daisymage,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/ce8wmm/keep_getting_screwed_over_ca/,"Sorry for the title, there is a lot wrong with my workplace. 

I plan on quitting in a month, a few weeks after my 2 year anniversary with the company. I'd like to file some sort of report on the business, or at least the CEO, but worry my coworkers would face some sort of retaliation. This is a business with less than 15 employees and only one, very small location. 

This post might turn into something of a rant, so sorry about that. I would like to ask for some resources or advice on what I can do.

Problems with my workplace and employment:

• No paid overtime. This is justified by calling me a ""paid intern"" rather than an employee, despite being a permanent worker. I do choose my own schedule, but can sometimes go over 8 hours a day.

• Follow up: even despite choosing a schedule that works with my schooling, I am not allowed to work more than ~30 hours so I can remain part-time, even when I requested to work as a full time employee on school breaks.

• Minimum wage for dangerous labor (soldering, heavy lifting, chemical use, etc). I have not received a raise in a year and a half.

• No compensation or even apology when it turns out I am severely allergic to one of the chemicals we frequently use.

• No compensation when my personal vehicle is used for the job.

• No official sick or vacation days/hours. 

• CEO is sexist--not in an aggressive, perverted manner, but he discriminates on the type of labor I am allowed to do under his watch. No heavy lifting, no using knives. I have been told to ""stay inside, like women are supposed to"" when receiving large shipments of material. I am the only female employee besides his wife, who acts solely as a receptionist.

• My desk, tools, and materials are often given to male employees that work less than I do or have a lower production rate. As of right now, I have not had my own work space or equipment for over a month.

• I am often forced to clean or organize instead of the work in my job description. This would be fine except for the fact that once again the male employees are never required to do this task.

• Breaks don't really exist at this job. I can sneak away if I really have to, but I really do mean SNEAK. I don't get reprimanded, but they demand I continue working. cEO even gets angry when bathroom breaks are taken. Employees get questioned when leaving the office for lunch.

• All other employees are granted an hour lunch while I am given a half hour lunch, and I am often asked to continue working while I am on my break (which I typically refuse).

• OSHA laws blatantly ignored? Very little protective equipment offered, no ventilation in soldering and chemicals room, ie no windows or smoke fans. I was granted a tiny, cheap plastic fan after approximately three months of begging for one, which was then promptly given to a new male employee. 

• Building is a corporate office and CEO lies to landlord about the production aspect of the job. Whenever there is a visitor, he locks the laboratory door (sometimes with us in it) and hides any equipment. 

• Throws hazardous materials (lead, epoxy based chemicals, etc) away in the common dumpster. 

• I am often personally blamed for the CEO's mistakes and reprimanded. He takes no responsibility when materials are not ordered or delivered in time.

• No HR department. Apparently a woman worked as HR for about a year before her death and was never replaced. Her office is locked and untouched.

• An employee retired and is consistently harassed to come back and/or work on things for no pay.

• Employees encouraged to take soldering work home.

• Vacation time not respected and if any of us have a day off, we can expect at least 2-3 calls from the CEO begging us to work outside the office.

• I have been encouraged by another employee to hide the fact that I have started a new job.

I'll add more as I think of them. Anything helps."

I just graduated from a trade school for IT in May. I've attended this school for a year. After the classes were finished, I've completed mandatory internship. While I was in process of interning I've had encountered a lot of issues. Examples are they didn't had enough work to pass on to the interns, so there were days where we would sit and do nothing. Furthermore, I would try to ask questions but, the answers were always quick and not as thorough or hands-on as I thought it would have be.  I had faults as well. I would mess up simple task due to me overthinking or scared of making critical mistakes. What added to my timidness was the head of IT. (He is quite knowledgeable of the field and I would've liked to learn more from him but he was unapproachable, even though he was right next to me I was only able to speak to him when he choose to be spoken to. I'm not a confrontational person so I would rather avoid him and his bad moods)  Adding more to the list such as, the IT personnel were very busy most of the time. Lastly, I would look up tickets that I can perform within my abilities and I would get told ""that's not important right now"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I did gain a lot knowledge while i was on the internship but it's not enough to land me a job. I'm currently unemployed I can't afford to take compTIA exams at the moment. I tried using vmware to practice what I've learned while in school on my laptop unfortunately, it cannot handle vmware very well, it lags like crazy. Although, I still take the time out of my day to study my textbooks.  I would want to know what's the next best thing to land my first job or gain more IT experience? I know i'm not a lost cause, I just need environment that'll allow me to grow and a place where I can ask as many questions as I like and not get shoved off.

Any assistance or comments would be helpful.

cebye1,0,2019-07-17,Thinking of switching from a Business Analyst/BI role to software developing straight out of college - Is Software Engineering a fit for me?,karmatreinconducteur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cebye1/thinking_of_switching_from_a_business_analystbi/,"Dear readers,

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking for some sort of advice regarding my future in CS.

Current situation: I'm 21, about to finish a graduation internship in a Business Analyst role for a Business IT bachelor at a University for Applied Sciences (in the Netherlands, if that matters).

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm starting to doubt whether business intelligence is really my future. I've always liked programming as a hobby, and although programming for 8 hours a day never seemed appealing to me previously (which is partially why I chose the Business IT side), I've been starting to think that I really enjoy programming more than a BI analyst role.

I've come to prefer working on ""tangible"" products such as software or apps, and I personally feel like that is missing when working on BI dashboarding and such. It doesn't feel like I'm ""building"" something, whereas with programming it feels like I ""build"" it from the ground up (if that makes sense), which is more satisfactory for me.

(This is not meant to be inflammatory to BI developers or analysts, but it's just my experience so far.)

&amp;#x200B;

However, my dilemma with programming is that I've always thought I simply wasn't good (or committed) enough to be working in the programming field. Which is somewhat confirmed by studying a week straight for a Java OCA certificate test, which I thought was pretty hard, and ultimately failing with a score of 44/100.

My hobby-programming past (Flash ActionScript, a bit of Java and C#) consisted mostly of learning basic code and using only just that to create products/apps.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading this, is a career path in the way of Software Engineer/Developer a possibility or are there already signs or red flags that it isn't something for me?

Mind you, I don't mind learning programming more in-depth and I would like to earn certificates and such in programming languages (if I pursue that career path). However having already failed the very basic Java certificate test, I'm not sure if I'm qualified for the field.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear some thoughts on this from anyone working in the software development (or a similar) industry. All input is very welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. If software engineering is a possibility, .NET looks to be an interesting path to pursue from what I've seen around the web. Any quick thought if this good area to start in? Thanks in advance!"

I'm 24, from France and I am on a verge of a breakdown, or maybe it happened already..

3 years ago I had a big depression that left me really in a really bad state. But I managed to get trough.

I just had a foreign internship to complete. A really nice opportunity for me to really shine.
I work as an apprentice salesman and was sent alone on a mission for a month. 

When I arrived I started having panick attacks and more and more intense. The panick feeling extendes and now I feel anxious about pretty much everything.

Emotions are a top sensivity, waking up in the morning feels daunting. I know I have to work, make calls but it scares me a lot. I am angry for feeling like this and lately had weid behavious. I take showers repeatedly, talk and scream to myself, it happens that I ram my head against the wall. Today I fell multiple times and cried and screamed it's horrible...
I dont feel hungry and cant even eat, I cant tell my boss about those i'm afraid they wont understand or think i'm a big failure. I try my best but dont manage to do anything. And also I feel exhausted after all those crisis..

I am scared, all the time. And I feel also really tired. I smoke now often to calm.down but it does not work. This is getting out of hand.

I feel this is it, this is how i'm gonna loose everthing I have built up. I really try but I cant help it.

I feel even worse taken that I am in a very nice place and in an appartement someone let me borrow. I dont have a reason too feel like this but why ?

I thought I could handle this myself, doctors are expensive here and i'm scared this will get worse...

I feel alone, stupid for feeling like this, helpless because nobody would understand... I am afraid of my mental state i dont understant what is happening.

When evening comes it gets a bit better, as I know the only thing left to do is sleep, but in the morning it hits 

What is there to do to ease this ?


Thanks for reading me until this point, and support for all of you who might suffer."

This is a condensed version of my situation:
I’m currently nearing the end of a software development internship for this summer, and it has been an okay experience. I really like the people I work with, but I’ve hardly done any coding - instead, I’ve done lots of “customizations.” In the beginning, I felt like I was learning so much all at once, but now I realize it was all very basic and things have slowed down a lot for me (I don’t feel pushed, or like I’m learning new things - it all feels very trivial). 

I know I am going to get an offer at the end, but the formal offer with salary doesn’t come until the end of the internship in August. Based on other conversations I’ve had, I’ll have about a month to accept or reject this offer. Based on previous interns I’ve talked to, the offer is a good margin below what would be expected.

I am thinking of applying to some big league jobs (Microsoft, google, amazon, etc) and seeing what comes out of it, and if nothing does, just falling back on this offer, but is it too early to start applying for these jobs? 

On a separate note, one other option I have is to take this internship job, and go straight for a masters in software engineering at a nearby university while working here."

cedwll,1,2019-07-17,Do I need to pay off most recent statement balance or entire current balance (as of today) to return to interest free status and begin receiving my grace period on credit card?,olivecamo,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/cedwll/do_i_need_to_pay_off_most_recent_statement/,"Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I couldn’t find clear answers.

I have about $1900 owing on my credit card as of today. However, my most recent statement balance was only about $1300. For the past few months, I’ve only made the minimum payment (am student, and my internship didn’t start until last month).

From my understanding, once you have not paid a statement in full for at least one month, interest begins accruing on new purchases immediately, even those which will not show up until the next statement. Essentially, you lose the grace period for all purchases until you pay your card in full.

My question is, should I be paying the statement balance, or the current balance as of today to go back to interest free status and begin my grace period again for next month?

I technically could pay off the entire balance when I receive my first pay check this week, however, I’d rather not have my checking account in single digits for the next two weeks."

* I've been a part of my schools research program for 2 years, which will culminate in my own project under the mentorship of a noted scientist in their field.
* I was accepted into the Summer Science Research program at Rockefeller University and will conduct biological engineering research over the summer. Unfortunately I cannot submit my project into competitions because of Rockefeller's rules, but I hope the prestige of the program itself outweighs.

Policy Intern at Campaign

* I help create policy briefs on campaign issues regarding NYC.
* Pretty high-profile campaign/candidate in NYC.
* At some point in the internship, I'll be heading projects to raise awareness about this candidate's policies throughout the city.

The thing that annoys me more is open offices. Almost everyone dislikes them because they're impossible to work in but management everywhere thinks they're innovative or something? More and more places I've gone to interview at also had open offices and used them as a selling point. I'm not quite sure why managers always have their own offices but coders dont. If anything the situation should be reversed since managers are supposed to collaborate. Hell open offices arent even what they were supposed to be, the original open office was a not the worst idea and had desks really spaced out and had building design to accommodate some sembalence of privacy (vox has a good youtube video on open office devolution), but now it's been bastardized so that companies can save money on interior construction and furniture. 

And yo meetings. Do I really need to say anything. I've sat through so many meetings as an intern to see what the big bois are doing and most of the time it was honestly a one on one between a manager and an sde that could've sat down for 20 min and been happy but instead they want 6 extra spectators in the room that browse their emails or code half assed for an hour and a half. 

Is there literally any way of stopping these kinds of things or am I just going to be subject to the will of HR for the rest of my life?"

I've wanted to emigrate for a long time, now I'm actually doing it.

In the next two months I want to go to Amsterdam or Utrecht to permanently live there. My resources:

- I am 24, male

- an Austrian citizen

- I currently live in Vienna, Austria

- I have not yet completed my diploma studies in Fine Arts and could do an ERASMUS guest semester at another university or an internship at a cultural institution

- beyond that I have no formal training for any job, sadly, though I have done work as a receptionist and in cleaning as well as street advertising before. I want to do training to do a better paying job next to my artistic work, since the latter doesn't pay at all.

- I have a budget of about 1.000 eur./month max. available

- I fluently speak German and English, a bit of French and I'm currently learning Dutch

As for my general plans, I would like to first find somewhere quiet and relatively independent to live (eg. a studio that is affordable or a room somewhere), find a day job and start another education, eg. to become a hairdresser, fitness trainer or so, just anything that I can make more money with than my training in the arts. 

My problem is, though, that this seems way less safe than just going through the university that I'm currently a part of. I haven't finished my degree yet and I haven't had a job for a while, so I'm afraid that when I arrive in the Netherlands with only the financial support I currently have from my family and my lack of a degree, I will have a hard time finding a good, stable job. 

Additionally, many places that I could live seem to require me to be inscribed to one of the nearby universities, but since I want to move now and don't have a formal admission yet, I am somewhat dependent on private offers many of which I feel uncomfortable with since I've had unpleasant experiences with flatshares in the past.

As I've said, I could do a semester with an ERASMUS programme, but at the earliest point from next summer term on. It just seems hard to coordinate such stuff from abroad.

cefauk,69,2019-07-17,Is my coworker being underpaid?,t13prod,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/cefauk/is_my_coworker_being_underpaid/,"To start off, I think he (and everyone else on my team) is being severely underpaid. 

Our role is essentially network technician though the titles are spotty. We have different assignments but for the most part, tasks include racking/unracking equipment, cabling, patching, incident response, imaging new installs, etc. Our company has a contract with one of the major automotive companies so most of our work is on the automotive companies campuses around the city. I started not too long ago as an intern @$13/h and supposedly after 2 months they bump it up to $15/h which I feel like is still pretty low for the work we do. I was astounded when my coworker (who has been with the company 2 years) told me he still only makes $15/h. The guy has his CMNA and it’s very knowledgeable about enterprise level networking. To me that pay rate is just a slap in the face. 

I think our company pays so little because they charge the automotive company the minimum to beat out other potential contractors. That’s just my speculation. 

So I guess my question is;

How much should this role be paying? How bad are they ripping off my coworker? 

I don’t mind the low pay for now because I’m still in school and this is a great experience to put on my resume but for my 30 year old coworker, that’s barely a livable wage. He states he’s staying for personal reasons but I know he’s worth much more than $15/h


EDIT: thanks everyone for the replies. I already knew we were getting underpaid but was just looking for validation. 

Also wanted to clarify that I in no way am trying to pry information from my coworker. He asked me how much they started me at which led to him telling me his wage. I usually keep quiet about these topics unless brought up mutually. 

As for me, I’m only using this job to get some experience to put on my resume. I’m still in school so I’m just going to stick it out until I graduate unless I stumble across a better opportunity. 

Thanks for the replies!"
cefffk,5,2019-07-17,How do you build up a list of references if the whole reason you left a previous job was because you were extremely unhappy with the company and not on good terms with your boss?,throwaway94368,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cefffk/how_do_you_build_up_a_list_of_references_if_the/,"I’m really unhappy at my current job and I would like to apply elsewhere. It’s my first job out of school though, and I’ve only been here about a year. 

I am certain I will not be leaving on good terms. I was switched to a non-client facing position after 5 months due to my weight and although my current boss was kind enough to give me an alternative job, it is doing something I hate. I’ve been doing it for another 5 months, so I’ve been at the same org for almost a year, but under 2 different bosses/departments. I feel resentful to the organization in general because of all this. It’s depressing me to continue to work at a place where I have been discriminated against, and I want out. 

I’m not going to be able to use my former boss as a reference because he took an adverse action against me based on my weight. I probably can’t use my current boss because he gave me a chance after my old boss fired me, and I’ve only been working for him for 5 months. While I appreciate the opportunity, the reality is that this is not the area I want to work in for the rest of my life, so I need to get out fast before I end up pigeonholed into this field. So, it’s a complicated situation. I’m assuming my current boss will think I’m ungrateful to leave so soon. The reality is that the organization should be grateful that I didn’t sue it because appearance discrimination is illegal where I live. But whatever. That’s not the point.

Anyways, in terms of references, all I’m left with are internships from 2015-2018, all of which I left on very good terms. Is it a nail in the coffin to not have a reference from your current employer? How does **anyone** build up references when the whole reason why a lot of people leave their jobs is because they are unhappy? Is it okay to use your coworkers as references instead of your boss?

On a side note, I asked one of my internship directors to be a reference, and she said “Sure - I certainly be a reference to the extent that you completed a semester as an intern with us. Good luck!” Does this mean she’ll only be willing to attest to the fact that I interned there, or will she attest to the quality of work I did while I was an intern there?

Thanks in advance!"

cegdo4,14,2019-07-17,finding a part-time job as a student shouldn't be this frustrating should it?,aaagggggghhhhhhhh,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/cegdo4/finding_a_parttime_job_as_a_student_shouldnt_be/,"This is the dumbest shit I've experienced up to this point. Can't even get a part-time job. It's stupid. I live in a pretty small town of a few thousand people, out in the middle of nowhere, with the closest city 50 minutes away. But there's a lot of places in town to work...I've applied to most of them, and complete silence. It's mind numbingly frustrating, to sit here in the summer, doing fuck all, letting time pass by, when I **want to work**. So many people my age have jobs and complain about this and that, all this other shit, like dude, atleast you have a job. And it's really fucking stupid, to have friends that applied to one place, get called, and boom job. I've applied to twenty. And don't give me the ""OH YOU ONLY APPLIED FOR TWENTY HAH TRY HARDER I APPLIED FOR HUNDREDS"" holier than thou bullshit. I won't listen to it.

I don't live in a huge metropolitan area, with tons and tons of people vying for jobs, like I said, small town, and I think most people that work here, atleast in fast food, grocery, that type thing, live here. And that's the dumber thing. This is supposed to be an employee's job market, right? I mean I understand I'm not looking for professional work, but come on unemployment's at all-time lows here, you would think I could just walk into a job. which is why when I hear on the news that places are having a hard time finding employees, I take that with a massive grain of salt (if it's not something that's super specific), because the employer probably isn't doing something right. I just think it's that employers got so used to having to be picky and having to choose from the best of the bunch from 2010-2015, that now with the economy relatively strong and a weaker bunch to choose from, employers are having a hard time finding somebody that excels all qualifications. Maybe I'm totally off base here though.

But back to my main rant, don't give me this shit like ""oh we don't want to hire students that go away to college"". Call me in for the interview mother fucker, I'll tell you that I live at home while going to school.

I will say this, I did get called in for one interview, but it's 25 minutes away from where I live, at a shitty store, where I hardly would have gotten any hours and would have been bored out of my mind every shift that I worked since that store doesn't get too much business. Also a place with high turnover, since I've never seen the same person twice, that or it's a testament to the lack of hours every worker there gets. Also to get into that one a little bit more, the manager that interviewed me was a complete fucking joke. Sets up a time for an interview in the afternoon. **She** gave **me** a window of time. I picked a time, I get there, and we can't interview in her office because the other manager is on some call with corporate, so we have to sit at a desk on the sales floor and do an interview, while she only has a blank sheet of paper with my name on it. I mean it's not like my application was loaded with information, but I had stuff about education, and it was clear she hadn't even taken a single look at it, even though my application there had been in for two weeks (I literally must have been the only person who applied).

It's just a joke. Doesn't help that I really don't want to work too far from home, so that narrows places down, even though like I said I did apply to places 20 to 30 minutes away from me, and I've only gotten a single response. Grocery stores, fast food, a couple retail stores, even a factory that hires summer temps, nothing, and atleast half of them having hiring postings either online or signage in front of the place. And one place that I applied to two weeks ago, still has a hiring sign up. Maybe I waited too late (I started looking for a job in May). But it's fucking stupid.

I think if I'm in this situation next summer (which I hopefully won't be since I'll be looking for an internship next summer, would be hilarious if I can find and get one of those easier than a part-time job that an untrained monkey could do, but maybe I'm a little too overzealous here), I'll go through a staffing agency, but part of the reason why I didn't is that I didn't want to work for just the summer, than have to re-find another job again, even though I did apply for a couple temp positions and got nothing. Even though financially I would be wayyyy better off if I'd have done that.

That's another thing, I have a sibling who works at a factory. In early May, I asked him if they'd be able to hire a summer temp, I'd be able to work 12 weeks. Here he is, three days on he asks me, ""are you **sure** you want to do this man""...uh, excuse me? I need a job, I told you I needed a job, and you offered to ask your boss if they could hire me, yet here you are days later and you haven't asked yet? He finally asks, they tell him, no, we don't plan on hiring for the summer, but that could change. So my focus shifted. Then, in late June, I see job postings for that factory...well, fuck. At that point I'd only be able to work for 6-8 weeks, and I doubted that a factory would hire me, train me, than see me off after just 6 weeks...

Also, fuck Dunkin Donuts. I've gone there every week, asked to speak to the manager, talk to them about how I put in my application and haven't heard anything back...they'll see what's up and talk to this other manager.....it's just annoying to get jerked around, when I go in there and, in my mind, show that I want to work there since I went and talked to three or four separate managers. But, nope, they hire some other fucks, that will probably quit in a months' time anyway, since that place is known to have tons of turnover, even in the store managers and managers, yet they don't fucking call me for an interview.

Anyway, maybe I'm just a fuck, that likes to complain, and hasn't been looking hard enough for a job, which is all possible, but I've been looking for two months here, applied to a few places a week in the area, and got fuck all. Now, go on, and berate me for not trying hard enough, being too lazy, and telling me to apply to three places a day like I always see in these posts complaining about kids looking for jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: tl;dr: I have friends who have gotten part-time jobs, only applying to one or two places. I've applied to twenty, got one response from probably the worst one, and still don't have a job. It feels like I've been really unlucky, and this summer felt like a complete waste.

edit 2: in a strange bout of luck I just got contacted by mcdonalds...so hopefully I should finally have a job, but that doesn't change anything I said at all, this process still fucking sucked."

I'm 26 yo Croatian male chasing bachelor in software engineering (should be done in 2020). I would like to know more about job prospects in any of the following Scandinavian countries (mostly Finland and Denmark) and also assuming I would be down for completing Masters once getting there in a year in one of the fields like Cyber Security/Blockchain developer/IoT/Game development or similar field but I have some confusions to clarify it. 
So my questions are:

Should I specialize in my own country (Masters) and therefore get some work experience (like 2-3 years) or should I make a move once bachelor is finished?

How important is to understand the local language in the IT field? I understand the quality of life would be much easier without langauge barrier but is it necessary to know in order to get a job?

Is it possible to get an internship throughout Masters while being there in given field aforementioned above?

How much would I need for expenses if living as a student there annually (in larger cities | minor town comparison)?

I'm an EU citizen so I don't have issues with an access permit or any kind of limitation (except for the money).
I narrowed down the questions which I would like to hear suggestions/advices/ or any useful information which potentially can make my decision easier.

I'm having a lot of trouble with internships and the interview process for intern recruitment. Most of the positions I'm applying for are for data science/quant/trading positions, and so naturally, they involve probability/stats/coding questions, and I can't seem to pass a single interview or online challenge to save my life. I have formal training in probability and introductory statistics, and have taught myself Python and R, but when it comes to these tests and interviews, I can't seem to remember a single thing, and I inevitably end up failing. For example, I just took a Hackerrank math and programming challenge for Goldman Sachs' Engineering department, and I performed atrociously (i.e. I couldn't even remember the various covariance formulae). You would think someone who goes to UT Austin, is a math major, and has a high GPA would do well in these sorts of situations, but it's the exact opposite for me, and I'm becoming extremely disheartened from the entire situation and it's making me question my abilities.

I want to change this. I want to get better at these interviews. I want to be able to see a question and answer it without having to refer to notes or the internet. How can I engrain the material I learn so concretely in my brain that I don't have issues like these anymore? How can I get better at interviews? 

I apologize for the melodramatic rant, but I've been trying to get an internship for two years now and have only managed to land two interviews, and it makes me believe that there's something I'm not doing correctly. Thanks to everyone who reads this.

TL;DR: I can't seem to remember anything when it comes to interviews/coding challenges, and I want to get better."

I have a 3.4 in Computer Engineering from a good school (think Top 20 USNews, better known for its undergraduate programs). I'd be willing to pay for a 1 year MEng, but those are pretty rare so I thought it would be better to just go for two years of a partially paid MS.  

I'm not aiming anywhere near the standard prestige options - I'm looking more at schools that happen to be in Power 5 conferences (not because of their athletics, but because I like their profiles). The best schools I'm applying to are Virginia Tech, Purdue and TAMU which I consider to be reaches (only because I'm asking for money as an MS student).

I have no research experience because I was gearing towards professional internships, but realized after junior year that I love taking classes in hardware and there's little of that offered at my UG (and it would be nice for job offers in the HW industry because it looks like their barrier to entry is higher).

And this looks like the correct forum. 

Okay so! This is quite a bit of information and hopefully I can cover it all, if not I apologize ahead of time. 

I am a bit confused as to what to do with my career at this point. As it stands I am a college student. I have a A.S. in Criminal Justice, and an A.S. in computer science. And now I am perusing a Bachelors degree in I.T. I am young(22) I have a point for telling you that I promise). Now, I have been co-oping with a company stemming from Berkshire Hathaway. I started out in security(security admin role) , and later moved onto deployment. And next month I will become a RPA developer for the same company using Automation Anywhere. Now I am very happy where I am at, but I also want to persue a potential Government career, specifically federal. I am looking into doing the FBI's honor internship, as well as Nasa's internships that are for students only, so my chances are higher(yes i know these are big names and are highly competitive, just wish me luck!) there are other organizations i have found jobs for such as TSA etc. Now what I am so confused as, I live in a small little town in Georgia, not a whole lot going on where I am. The governemnt offers whats called ""Pathways"" to students. I am interested in doing one of these, but I can't seem to get ahold of anyone on how this would work. I am set to graduate in May 2021 with the bachelors. If i want a government job what should I do? No where local at all offers government jobs. Atlanta is a good 2 hour drive. My institution is not a NSA ""Center of Academic Excellence"".  That is the first big question, is where do i go if i am just about forced to stay local? 

&amp;#x200B;

Another question \~ I seem to be stuck on perusing whatever pays the most (Which is an awful philosophy) but from my understanding private industry pays way more than the government does. Will i be so much better off staying away from the government sector? 

&amp;#x200B;

Another big question of mine I have is what should my masters degree be in? I spoke with someone at the company I work for and they told me without a doubt an MBA should be my route. I said what about a masters degree in software engineering or computer science? And I was told that, that was way to repetitive. I thought that was the purpose of a masters degree? To dig deeper into the field you are in if that makes sense? 

&amp;#x200B;

One last question \~ If the Government does not work out, I am REALLY interested in working for a cruiseline(working on the ship) or a flight company(obviously for the benefits). But even after searching online, I can only seem to find jobs that are either shoreline for the cruise ship, or some cook/janitor job on the ship. And as far as flight companies like Delta and United, my struggle again is the locality of these, or the internships offered are not even in IT!  Has anyone worked at any company or something similar to this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Last question \~ I would be VERY interested in an international paid internship \~ if this is even a thing, the issue i often run into is you pay to intern basically. So if thats all there is, thats fine, but if anyone has found anything else out please let me know! 

&amp;#x200B;

If phone calls are a thing on here, I would love to actually speak to someone about advice on all this stuff.

I considered talking to my manager, but I'm confident my gripes will be the nail in my dev-jobless-coffin because all of my complaints surround other employees that have caused me to end up here.

Project 2: Awaiting delivery of build files from another employee that kept delaying transfer.

As of today, I've become debt free. I can say the it feels incredibly liberating and like there's a massive weight off my shoulders.

I grew up poor throughout most of my life. Money was always tight and my dad has spent most of his life saddled with tens of thousands of debt. Partially from working a low-skill job despite having a background as an electrical engineer. Partially from spending, at times, significant amounts of money on booze, cigarettes, and other vices. I feel like my relationship with money was weird growing up. I had come to appreciate the value of the dollar due to money being tight. On the other hand, I loathed spending it due to being in an environment with emotional abuse regarding spending. 

I always told myself that I wanted it to be different for me. That meant being in a good financial state and living reasonably within my means while also remembering that I need to take the time (and money) to enjoy life. I made a goal for myself when entering University that I would aim to be debt free within one year of graduating. A lofty goal and at this time one I barely did not meet.

When graduating last year, I had approximately $28.5k in debt which would soon rise to $40.2k in debt as I entered into a Master program while working (which I have since finished). I had saved almost 90% of the money I had earned from every single internship I had through University. This enabled me to save up $20k by the time I had graduated. Starting work last September, I knew it would be a long climb to close the gap. I set forward a budget that I kept an eye on like a hawk weekly. I would download my credit card transactions and assess what I was spending on monthly to plan for the next one. I opted to cook 80% of my meals rather than resorting to eating out.

Take-Home Pay: $3,585

Rent + Utilities: -$1,200 (I decided to move downtown because I had a tough situation at home and to avoid a morning commute)

Food: -$450

Pet: -$50

Phone + Misc: -$100

= Monthly Savings: $1,785

If some of you ran the numbers, you'd probably see that this budget wouldn't allow me to pay of the remainder this fast; but, I always treated the food allocation as a maximum and rarely ever came close to it. I also received a small bonus earlier so that helped.

As of today, I made my final student loan payment and I feel relieved to be financially independent. I thought I would share this news here as, while I've never posted, I've come to this sub often to pick up financial tidbits here and there. Thanks to all those who inadvertently helped me get here. Next stop, a down payment on a house!"

Anyway, I didn’t really know who they were at first, just that it was some sort of subsidiary. I saw a protester or a journalist, one of those kinds of people poking around once. Only once. They were gone by the time I got back from lunch. Always wondered about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

A buddy told me this, but I’m not sure if it’s true. Apparently, everyone who worked on the first atomic bomb only hand their hands on one component, so they couldn’t spill secrets to the Russians, or Nazis, or something, I don’t know. That’s how our lab worked for the most part. I got the job straight out of college, which was wild, right? Somehow they got the paper where I outlined the spider silk production technique I was going to work on in grad school, despite the fact I never published it. One of my professors passed it along, supposedly, and I was too over the fucking moon to think twice about it. Increase the tensile strength of ‘x’ material, or modifying a certain gnome. I knocked everything they ever assigned to me out of the park. I should have been a household fucking name, but it was one promotion, raise, company paid vacation after another, so I didn’t ever stop to think about how weird the whole thing was. By the time I looked up, it’d been years. I had a billion texts telling me I was working myself to death. If they only know they half of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Assistant lead researcher for integrated developments, that was my title when I moved to \[REDACTED\]. I’ve never seen so much ice in my entire goddamn life. It was beautiful, cascading, warping, borderline glowing in the sun. As far as you could see, like a shimmering palace of light. Hours on a plane, days on the track, freezing my balls off on a god forsaken snowmobile, to get to a motherfucking hole in the ground. You’d have to take this rickety-old-rusted piece of shit elevator. Hey boss, why doesn’t anyone know about the highly dangerous weapons lab? He told me it was to prevent possible terrorist infiltration, and I bought it, hook, line, and sinker. If I’m one of the preeminent minds of my generation, I think we might be in trouble. That was all we said to each other while the solid mass of brown slipped by the opening on the sheet metal, tinged this sickly yellow by the bulb atop of what was essentially a bucket on a string. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you might be asking what I remember from the early days here? That’s easy, because every fucking hallway is the same stark white paint on steel plate, every moment filled with the mild roar of the air filtration system, and every cabin has the same 5 pieces of furniture and a 90's DVD player. There’s a machine down here that can detect a single fucking atom of contamination in a given sample, you’d think they could stock the place with a couple more creature comforts. Anyways, at least I had the blond from Lab C. Someone literally riding me was a decent distraction from Dr. \[REDACTED\] metaphorically riding me. Water Bears, Brown Woodland Frogs, Greenland Sharks, at first it was your standard genetic isolation. Then, one day Dr. \[REDACTED\] calls me into his office.  He didn’t have any photos, or mementos, or knickknacks on his desk. The fluorescent lights had this way of making every little expression on someone's face inescapable, but with him, it was always like staring into a piece of leather with a couple buttons sewed in. He tried approximating a smile when he shared the company trusted me, but the corners of his mouth just dug deeper and deeper into his cheeks, while they begged for mercy. Apparently, I was getting sized up for the big leagues. He asked me what I wanted in life, and I said a mansion in Tahiti, a few very exotic pets, and a swimming pool full of supermodels. I guess that was the right answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had Lab V, all to myself. I remember walking in for the first time. I didn’t notice the millions of dollars of equipment, the fresh requisition forms, or the absolute sterility of it all. My attention smacked right into the middle of the room. There was this cylinder filled with some sort of liquid. The glass center extended into two metal sleeves that stretched into the ceiling and the floor. There was this cable running right out the center of the glass hooked up to a television on one end. Out of the other was this brilliant pink wiry sort of bit, heading straight towards me, and then like a jewel set perfectly, rising straight to meet my gaze, was something familiar, but not. You’d think I’d be scared, but this wasn’t my first body part. I kinda just felt like saying hello, I mean, staring at each other seemed a little rude. My instructions were simple enough; make it work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could get a new one whenever needed, but I tried not to be wasteful. They never managed to keep a consistent color, which I mildly insisted on. If I fucked up too severely this white glossy sheen would encase the whole thing.  I used to say they’d spoiled, like they were fucking apples or something. The best part of my job was reading everyone's reports, all their work slowly coming together. After years of making pieces, I could finally put together a puzzle. I had authority, resources, all the time I could ever want. I saw less and less of the blond from Lab C. Oddly enough, I hardly knew anything about him. Workplace romances were generally frowned upon, and neither of us wanted to get too attached. He did let it slip once that he was from Maine. I’ve never been, but sometimes I can picture him on a scraggly beach, may be skipping a rock or two.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing by far was how the specimens seemed to follow me around the room. Every once in a while I’d turn from the workbench or the computer, and for half a second I’d think there was someone there. Oh, but no need to fret, it was just a dismembered organ swiveling in a tank. The liquid inside most of the eye is called the vitreous humor. It wasn’t my first time slicing into one, but I became more intimately familiar with the fact that vitreous humor is more of a jelly-like texture than you would expect. It doesn’t exactly spill, it more oozes its way out. The delay on the project was cause for a bit of concern, but every so often Dr. \[Redacted\] would stop by. He’d nudge me awake more gently than I’d ever assumed he was capable of, put a coffee on my desk, and say something to the effect that I was doing a real bang up job. The machinery to read the input generated by the eye was set by the time I was on-boarded. The solution in the tank was perfect at keeping it stable, which in and of itself was worth a couple Nobel's. Really, I had one job. I needed to find the “on” button, and press it. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was made manageable by considering that the human body is essentially a machine. With the right mixture of electricity, chemicals, and force you can make virtually anything act on command. In science, researchers make more assumptions than you would think. Was I wigged out by all the hardware I was running through? Sure, sure I was, but maybe one day we’d go commercial. For fucks sake, the list of guys to fix blindness would have gone me, and fucking Jesus. That’s why I almost pissed myself when I put a few drops in the tank, turned a knob, agitated the solution, and there I was staring back at myself. High Ma, I’m going to Disneyland. I called Dr. \[REDACTED\] expecting him to rush in with champagne bottles. You know what this fucking prick did, he just said nice work, the fucking dickwad. That’s what you tell a 2nd grader who can spell a couple things, I’d just single-handedly rebuilt medical science in my image. Guess he could tell I was hurt, since back in the room there was a stack of Filet Mignon, movies that hadn’t even come out yet, and a bottle of whiskey older than my parents. Fine, apology accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was over. I was getting a bonus big enough to buy an island, and a nice one at that, not some shitty little pile of rocks in the Atlantic. Humanities fate was in their own hands, to do what they may with the gifts I bestowed them. Meanwhile, I was about to spend my life double fisting Margaritas and pool boys. One last meeting in Dr. \[REDACTED\]’s office. Why would anyone want a place to be so fucking white, it was unnerving. One of the perks of being the boss I suppose. He said he had something for me, and I’d figured it’d be a plaque or paperwork or something. Before he had a chance to proceed, the lights cut off. The room filled with red so dense, I could've drowned, before slowly receding back to pitch black. The hum in the air faded to a lull, and for the first time in months I heard my breath, sharply careen in, and dribble out. Dr. \[REDACTED\]’s stitched together face lay absolutely blank, and opacity pooled into all his crevices. A darkness that roll down his cheeks and wormed itself into every nook, and bare space. Form his black inky maw he informed me that this was an alarm, which was a particular shock to me, given that I was unaware we had an alarm. He politely request a minute, and strode out of the room. I’ll never know why he did it, honestly, I couldn’t even guess. He turned, look me in the eye halfway out the door, and recited 1-7-7-6. I sat there for what seemed like hours, but honestly who knows. Time had been flexible from the jump, by now it just snapped in half. I stared into the hall, watched it pulse red, fade to black, red, fade to black, I watched the shiny-metal-flat-slab door handles, I watched the reinforced door frames, I watched the little windows crisscrossed with mesh, all of it covered in red, then black. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I broke into was the filing cabinet. Spending reports, tax documents, employee reviews, and pay dirt. I managed to pass out a few times before I ran out of bottled water and those little peanut butter filled pretzels. Everyone’s files were barely a paragraph long, summarized what they were working on, and ended with “adequate” or “needs further incentives”. 17 adequates in a row, how’s that for accomplished. I thought about walking out there, more than once. It could be an elaborate prank, or a test? There was this gnawing in the back of my head that it might not be real. I was posted up by the window, and sort of barely caught it at first. Shadow coating it from head to toe, definition inching towards center mass. The blond from Lab C. Absolutely drenched in red. Slowly drifting towards the door, no details, flash after flash. I squished against the glass, ready to hear, talk, see. He pressed his hand gently on the metal, like it might slip through and fall into mine. Lifting his head, softly, his gaze sinking into mine.

&amp;#x200B;

You’d think I would have been confused, shocked, but I knew what I was looking at. Horizontal incisions, sloppy, end to end right, right to left, in a panicked motion. Human jelly oozing down his cheeks. The hues had gone, cracked, faded. His dry skin drew back, and he slammed his mouth against the glass. Teethed shattered flying back in his throat. Smearing, obscuring his image. A figure now, forever preserved. Then another, then another. My first thought, clear as day, hit me. I was going to fucking die here, unless I did something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Contrary to popular belief, smart people are not equally versed in all fields. For example, just because I’m an engineer doesn’t mean I know a fucking goddamn thing about hacking, and no it wasn’t 1776, or George Washington, or Concord and Lexington, which is all I got to try before being directed to a system admin. I’m fairly certain I saw him out there, but he didn’t seem any position to help. The door was fairly substantial, but the creaking noise it started to make was fairly unnerving. On the bottom most shelf of the desk there was a locked drawer, and for a moment I hoped with all my heart that Dr. \[RETRACTED\] was dead. It was immediately apparent that this wasn’t a standard lock. Ultimately, it took 6 hours, a box of staples, 3 erasers, two fountain pens, and a share of plastic to open it. Once again, I suppose I should have been surprised. Inside there was a handgun, and a dial pad. I took the gun, punched in the number, and was greeted by a tremendous whirring. 

&amp;#x200B;

The back wall of the room lifted into the air. A veritable abyss called out to me. I looked back for a moment or two, the window on the door looked like a kid’s drawing. Finger trails lazily crawling from one end to the other, but that’s all it was. I stumbled forward. The wall dropped behind me, and for a moment I let myself float in uncertainty, in a lack of control, anxiety, and I hated it. As soon as it sealed, the lights snapped on. It’s sort of difficult to describe the room, but you ever see that photo of Burt Reynolds naked on the bear skin rug? That, but a room. It’s this 70's chic, playboy mansion, stretch couch type deal. The bathroom has a clawfoot tub, with gold inlay, and hot-fucking-water. The kitchen is a little simple, almost like the one in That 70’s show, but if Red was a doomsday prepper. There are cans and freeze dried everything all over the place. I’m not too big to admit I cried, I mean come on, it has a pool table. That and a rather large array of television monitors stacked one on top of the other, with something straight out of NASA for the controls, and what appears to be approximately a billion and a half DVDs.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a decent amount of time drinking, eating, bathing, shitting, and sleeping well. Entertainment was fairly limited, I hosted little cocktail parties with Steve McQueen and Bo Derek, hustled Marlon Brando a couple times, and performed a rousing rendition of the Cuban missile crisis while taking a bath. All the while, Dr. \[REDACTED\]’s little display leered at me, mocking my lack of familiarity with celebrities and the disregard that I mixed my eras with, all the while inviting me to fire them up and step into the next delightful stage of my career. I managed to convince myself that I was being irrational, that maybe Dr. \[REDACTED\] just really wanted to watch every episode of Bonanza at the same time, and I broke. I flick this thing on, and there he was, in what appeared to be the morgue. I wasn't aware this facility had a morgue. I saw him jaunt across the rows and rows of cold storage before turning directly into the camera, fascination suddenly migrating down my spine giving rise to an unbearable frost. I’m not the best at impression, but I’ve watched it a billion times, so I’m fairly confident I call pull off his ridiculous, nasally, WASPy accent. 

&amp;#x200B;

He looks at me, and says “Hey there sport! Glad to see you solved my little puzzle”

&amp;#x200B;

I ask him what’s his weird deal with the American Revolution. 

&amp;#x200B;

This seems to bemuse him a bit “See now that’s how you manage a situation with poise. Good swing, but you missed on that one. 1776 was the year that Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, which has a certain personal resonance for me” he didn’t wait “Now then, I’m going to need one last favor champ. You see that big red button on the other end of the desk. Nod if you see it. Good. I’m going to need you to lift the lid, press the button, hold it for precisely minute and let go” 

&amp;#x200B;

The “why” I let out is quizzical, and in retrospect I really regret that. It played into his demeaning little gag of treating me like I was in high-school. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Another good question, because that’ll incinerate everything in this building. You included. Now I can see that you’re a bit apprehensive about that, but hopefully you found the gun. If you do it right, you’re going to have just enough time to put a bullet in your brain and you won’t even feel having your flesh slosh off your bones. Now, a few reasons why that’s best case scenario. Uno, this place is chock full of Zombies, and if they manage to get to the surface and cross the tundra somehow, it’s going to be a world of trouble. I mean that very literally. A world full of trouble, that you more or less caused. Dos, we aren’t exactly sure who is going to come into possession of this here little lab, and you could only imagine how disastrous it would be if disreputable characters get their hands on this stuff. And, finally, tres, all this data is backed up somewhere HQ can get to it. So, there’s a real possibility, you might be employee of the month, you got my vote, that’s for sure. Too bad being in my office means that you’re also a huge liability, which means whether it’s the home team, or someone else, they’re going to kill you. Now dollars to doughnuts, I’ve always preferred self check out”

 

I disagreed with his assessment, and noted that his concern for my well being seemed a bit hypocritical, since I was fairly confident he was going to put a bullet in my fucking brain. 

&amp;#x200B;

He reminded me that “assumptions make an ass out of you and me, now think about this logically. When you strip all the emotions away from this, you made a tremendous amount of money. You changed the course of history. You got everything you’ve ever wanted. Beyond the cars, and penthouses, this company gave you purpose. That’s what this was all about for you, I know, I’ve read your file. We gave you your life, and now its run its course. That’s not bad, or good, it’s just nature” after a bit of a pause he cut back in “So, most everything that has ever happened in this lab is on those tapes. In case you wondering in the future, no, I didn’t play peeping Tom on you and Mitchel. That was his name by the way, Mitchel. There should be a little memory left in this thing, so feel free to play this back whenever you want. Come to a decision fast enough there might even be time for some closing arguments. In any case, I’m confident you’ll make the right choice. Even in our darkest hour, most of the time, all we really need is a good push”

&amp;#x200B;

His hand moved so quick it took a second for me to realize what had happened. There was a bit of a spurt at first, but after he made it across, it gently flowed downward crashing into the collar of his shirt. Dr. \[REDACTED\] never broke eye contact. He just kept staring at me the way he’d done through every conversation. He calmly sat on the floor laid back, and closed his eyes. The pool around him, moved outward inch by inch, emanating from his neck. A red pool in a world red, then dark, then red, then dark. 

&amp;#x200B;

The facility is a lot bigger than I ever expected it to be. In every room there were smatterings of body parts. Arms, legs, frames missing most of the fleshy bits. Outside of that there wasn’t much mess at all. It seems everyone died in an incredibly orderly fashion, and have now taken to shuffling about the place. Sometimes they bump into each other. If you listen to the tape extremely closely, you’ll notice that a few produce a sort of hissing sound. The path they take is largely the same, eventually they cross the main access room, meander through the security doors, pass all the labs, living quarters, reactor room, storage, until they’re right back where they started. One giant undead carousel, round and round they go. It was fairly boring. 

&amp;#x200B;

After assembling a small montage of people accidentally getting hit in the nuts, falling down, or dropping shit, I started to wonder how it all went south. Apparently, those assholes thought my formula wouldn’t work on a whole specimen. They had a few lanky guys floating in a tank in Lab Z, which, by the way, super on the nose, am I right? To be fair, I didn’t think it’d work either, I mean it shouldn’t have. They were establishing a baseline line, seeing what tweaks needed to be done. When they finished, all the samples were loaded up in a cart and hauled off in the general direction of an incinerator that we apparently have. It starts with an orderly getting his intestines ripped 0ut, and ends with someone asshole “Lead Scientist” opening every door between the hordes and an all you can eat nerd buffet. I never met him, but by the way he ruthlessly shoved interns into certain death, I got to say, he seemed like a real stand up guy. You know how he died? Slipped on a pudding cup running through the cafeteria, before having his leg gnawed off. I’ll admit I considered putting it in the montage.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s no wonder this the place got overrun, there really should have been armed security. I’m going to assume that the trail of grainy static is Dr. \[REDACTED\]. I only know that because the last feed to cut out is, ding-ding-ding, the morgue. Fires back up right at our conversation, fucking dickbag. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the sarcasm may have been inappropriate, but ugh, humor is kind of the last thing I had down here. There was... some things in the records. I don’t really want to get into it, but I need people to understand that I didn’t know. I’m not sure who they were, they wheel them in, right through the entrance, perfectly still, strapped down. They’d do it after lights out. Still, a couple people saw, for a second, and then looked away. Apparently there was significant concern that materials for the experiments need to be… uncompromised. You know, if you freeze someone the water inside their cells expands, which basically ruins the whole thing. It was like they were opening a cabinet and taking out the things the needed bit by bit. Arms, legs, intestines, other stuff. They always stopped right after flatline. I didn’t see much suffering, at least, I don’t think. No one ever screamed or woke up. It was... they didn’t suffer, so at least there was that. I need everyone to know it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t know. I haven’t really decided what I’m doing yet. I don’t think it really matters all that much. I guess, just, fuck them. Fuck them, I suppose, and I was here. If you find this, please, just let people know I was here."
cel3v6,3,2019-07-17,Should I take a Tier II/III job or do a free IT Bootcamp and get 7 certs?,allcapsaway,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/cel3v6/should_i_take_a_tier_iiiii_job_or_do_a_free_it/,"I know based on the title it seems like an easy decision but it doesn't provide all the context.

 I am attending University already and am about a year and a half away from a BS in IT. I have 4+ years of work experience starting with an internship my senior year of high school. I've worked three different IT jobs going from Intern -&gt; TI -&gt; TII throughout highschool/college. Having work experience starting so young made my resume stand out so I never bothered to get any certifications at all. However, I feel like my skills have stagnated and that I'm not really learning much anymore. 

I have two paths I can take right now while I continue to finish school. I have been receiving call backs about a few TII and TIII positions that pay much more than what I've been doing before, but based on the job descriptions it feels like I'll just be doing more of the same as I've already been doing. I mean it's great, but I can't picture myself moving up in those roles without doing a lot of personal learning at home. 

My second option is a ""bootcamp"" that I've received a grant for. It's completely free and spans from August to December. The certs I'd be taking courses for are 

CompTia A+ (1001) (1002)

CompTia Network+ (N10-07)

MST-Windows 10

MCSA Server 2016 (740) (741) (742)

Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)  Composite (200-125)

CompTia Security + (SY0-501)

To be honest, I feel like my work experience makes the A+, Windows 10, and some parts of the Net+ redundant. However, the other courses teach a lot of skills I've been wanting to learn like how to manage/migrate a server and create an AD and more complex networking. I have experience using all these things in my past roles but not really managing/building them. The program comes with two free attempts of each exam, and I get 1 year from the end of the program to take the tests ( I only need to complete 2 certs during the program itself). The program is 324 hours overall, spanning 18 weeks. During the year after the program ends, I'm allowed to sit in on any classes I've taken before again as many times as I'd like. 

Reddit tends to be skeptical of learning programs and bootcamps, but I feel like it's only not worth it if you're paying or you have no experience at all. I don't know, I feel like it's a good idea to go with the camp so I could get those certs, but I wanted to see what you guys thought first."

If you are familiar with F-1 status and how this process basically works, you can skip this first paragraph...

Now for those who aren't familiar with the whole international student status in the US, I am considered to be under F-1 visa status. Basically this visa entails that I am a student in the US, but after my studies, I should go back to my country of origin. For now, I am only able to work at my current university, though when I graduate, I should have a couple of years to work in the US under the Optional Practical Training (OPT) process. In order for me to continue to work in the US, I would need to seek sponsorship from some company. For more details you can search up information on F-1 visas and Optional Practical Training from many sources around the internet.  


Now that some of you all are somewhat up to speed... sometimes it can be challenging to get this support from a company, as I really need to stand out among other applicants. I have worked my hardest to have a good GPA and to have meaningful projects on my resume so that I can stand out. So far this past semester, I applied for some internships at major and smaller companies. I managed to get interviews at Microsoft, Google, Airbnb, Facebook and a couple other smaller companies... I failed every single interview. I know I could have done way better at the interviews, and I am currently working on leetcode problems and bought the cracking the coding interview to sharpen my skills. Despite all of this, I have a fear that no matter how hard I try, I will hit a wall when it comes to getting into these companies because of my visa status.   


I managed to get a web app development internship at my university this summer and it's going great. I can't go too much into detail, but I feel like I'm getting a great experience so far. I guess after all of this background, what I am curious to know is that if there are any of you all out there who were in a similar situation as me (coming from a foreign country under an F-1 visa) that have managed to get ahead and land a job at any company in the US. My expected graduation is December 2019, so the pressure kind of builds up every month leading up to graduation.   


I've been a member of this subreddit for a few weeks and this is my first time making a post here, so I apologize in advance if my writing is confusing or if there aren't enough details. 

  
tl;dr:   
I am an international student in the US hoping to land a job here, and I am wondering if I could hear of some experiences from people who were in a similar background as me. Or if you know of anyone at your work similar to me that has shared their story with you and that has been able to succeed."

A few years ago I wasn't doing well. I had moved away from home to follow a girl to college. My poor study habits and delusions of extreme intelligence led to me flunking out of school. And inevitably my girlfriend and I broke up. 


I was very depressed but took some time to recharge. After a few months I felt that I could succeed in school. That next semester my same issues got in the way of me working hard and succeeding again. I felt like a failure and couldn't even tell my friends I dropped out. My parents were saints and encouraged me the whole way but I always felt ashamed. 


I spent the next few years floundering around in community college and digging my GPA further into a hole. After I reached the bottom I decided that I needed to change my act. 


I started lifting and improving my work ethic. I defined a path towards either CS or IT to get out of community college. After a year I applied to a no name state school. I busted my butt at school (now much older than my peers).


I wanted to be the best student I could be. 

First semester all As. Also created a social life and focussed on my mental health. For the first time in my adult life I felt like I was in control.  After 2 semesters of success, I decided to try to secure an internship and commit to CS.


I failed miserably at my first few interviews not knowing what to expect and preparing poorly. I managed to get into a terrible location but took it for the experience to list on my resume. The following semester I took an equally crummy part time internship during the school year. 


I found cscareerquestions, bought cracking the coding interview, and studied hard with dreams of Big-N after graduation. I had some twisted idea that if I could get into one of those, it would make up for the failures from my past. I studied hard and made it onsite at Big G. I knew I wasn't going to pass because I was so hyper fixated on getting in. My onsite was tough and I was anxious and didn't pass. I felt crushed.


More resilient this time, with a lot of failure under my belt to build some calluses I kept applying and hoping for the best.


The hard work paid off. I finally have a diploma. I have a job offer that's in the 6 figures in an environment that feels like home. I'm in my late 20s now. I feel like I have hit a huge milestone. Couldn't be happier. If you feel like you've fucked your life up or that there isn't hope, know that life can turn around.


Tldr: Slacker pseudo intellectual high school moron eventually gets his act together and lands a SWE job out of college."

I got started as an intern before college graduation in May this year, and about 2 months in they offered me a full time position. It's a QA position for a company that is pretty understaffed - hiring me was basically relief for the other 2 QA's that have been working like crazy for the past few years. All I hear about is how having another person is a lifesaver.

The problem -- I am in a long distance relationship and we plan on getting married in November of 2020 and relocating by the December 2020/January 2021 (ie: I will be leaving the country for good and will be quitting). 

I feel like they're planning things around having me 'long term' and even changing the roles of people around me now that they have another person. I feel very guilty knowing that in a year and a half, I will be leaving. I'm not sure what the correct way to approach this in the future is -- it's definitely not as easy as giving a 2 weeks notice when it comes down to it, because that will put them in a pretty rough position. But I'm worried if I tell them now that I KNOW this will be ending in that time frame, they will get rid of me. I enjoy the job and need the experience, but I'm terrified of burning my bridges at the end and losing them as a reference. 

Any advice for what to do would be helpful. Is it a matter of waiting until a few months before I go? At that point, however, they will know that I knew this the whole time and might hold that against me. I just feel like I'm going to be overrun with guilt for the next year if I don't figure something out."
cengkb,783,2019-07-17,"After 7 months, 120 job applications, and 15 interviews, I finally landed a job offer!",iXidol,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cengkb/after_7_months_120_job_applications_and_15/,"I have been stalking this subreddit from the moment I graduated school, but I never felt that I was ""qualified"" to give advice seeing that I had not found any success in my career search. While browsing this subreddit, I always found a little bit of motivation in posts where people announced that they received job offers after months or even years of hunting. I figured I would share my story in hopes that it would deliver the same motivation for those still searching.


I graduated from University in December of 2018 with a degree in Marketing. In addition to having a full course load, I was also working full time as an assistant manager at a car wash. In retrospect, I believe that summer internships would have been more beneficial to post-college success, but I needed something stable to pay bills.


Upon graduation, my job search began immediately. I was pretty picky and only applied to jobs that I thought I would enjoy. I stayed far away from sales positions (which are often listed as entry level marketing jobs) as I would almost rather not work than cold call 100 or more people everyday. After almost four months of various screening calls and several in person interviews, I was pretty fed up with the, ""We have decided to move forward with a candidate who more closely aligns what we are looking for in this role...."" emails.


Towards the end of April, I came across a position I knew I was overqualified for on Indeed. It was a part time position with a well known media company and paid surprisingly well for what the role was. It did not necessarily involve marketing, but in order to keep myself sane and finally establish a source of income again, I applied and received an offer! Even after accepting this role, I continued to apply for Marketing positions knowing that the if I were to get comfortable here, it would only become increasingly difficult to find a position in Marketing which I truly enjoy.


After nearly one hundred more job applications and plenty of phone and in person interviews, it was already the end of June. On one of my breaks at my part-time position, I was walking around the campus where I work and came across a directory. Out of curiosity, I decided to check what other businesses were located in the area. One caught my eye. After doing some research, I determined that this company was exactly what I was looking for. Great benefits, casual dress code, unlimited PTO, free snacks, the whole nine. In addition, the business operates in an industry very relevant to my own personal interests. I checked out their careers page and saw only one position posted that was for Marketing. To make matters worse...it was posted ""30+ days ago."" Figuring it was worth a shot, I applied.


Not even a week later, I got my first email stating that they wanted to schedule a phone screening to learn more about me. After knocking that out of the park, I had an additional phone call with the hiring manager, two zoom calls with future coworkers, and went in in person to meet the hiring manager and an additional coworker. Everything went so great I was ecstatic. I was so confident that everything went well, but, I had a lingering nervousness knowing that I have been denied in similar situations like this in the past.


Finally, I received a phone call. I did NOT get the job...

BUT. The hiring manager, and two of the employees I had a chance to talk to, really enjoyed meeting me and felt that I had what it would take to step into the shoes of a role that they had just posted which was also in the field of marketing. After reading the description for this role, I was even more excited than before because this job aligned much more closely with my personal strengths and I knew it was something I would be able to succeed in. In addition, I was informed this new role also had nearly a 35% higher starting pay than the original position I applied for. After one more phone call with the hiring manager discussing the specifics of the role, I had an official offer on the table. I accepted. My first day is August 5th and it still feels like I am living in a dream. 


If I could give one piece of advice to people who are going through the job search grind, I would say to try looking directly at the careers pages of companies located near you. Not every company posts on Indeed. And definitely don't get discouraged by jobs posted over 30 days ago. If I would have not applied after seeing that, I would still be searching. 


Best of luck to everyone and their job search. With enough time and patience, it will all work out. Cheers."

&amp;#x200B;

Canadian hee but just finishing up my Bachelors of IT in Australia currently. 

I can apply for a J1 visa which allows for 1 full year of work experience in the USA after my University education. Ideally, I would like to find a job that would sponsor me full time to live in the US, but I am realistic and probably the J1 year thing is a more likely route.

My question is, how do I make the most of this amazing opportunity. 

My general idea is to look into IT internships in the Seattle area after I graduate, and ether hopefully transition to a full-time job and sponsorship after or move back to Canada with the benefits of interning in such a well regarded IT market. 

Are internships after graduation looked down on?

Is this all a pipe dream?

I am looking for a place to settle down for a long term and start a new fresh career if possible. I have just graduated from a US university on May for a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and current still waiting for OPT/EAD card application (because I am holding Chinese Citizenship w/o green card or any sorts).

Speaking of work experience: I am currently working part-time for my father's start-up company as a IT researcher (which actually based in China). For now, I am doing Javascript and LAMP/WAMP stack most of the time. I had some AR and Microsoft CRM experience from my past internship. I also did a capstone project in IoT with Fedex for a semester (4 months).

My native tongue is Mandarin, I don't speak Cantonese but I am able to listen, write and read. English is good (but I really suck at writing) because I have lived in US for 6 years and made a lot of local friends. I also can do some basic conversation in German (took some classes in university and studied outside classroom, planning to take exams some time) and I have learned some Arabic before German.

I am also applying for jobs in US at the same time. Currently job applications in US are not looking good for me, but I have not given up trying. I actually do not enjoy programming right now as I used to be. I have gotten tired of Leetcoding or any sorts of online programming exercises. And I don't plan to do master for now. But I still have some love for IT field (How weird am I?)

I am tending to seeking alternatives like moving to a new place preferably in EU area if possible. I don't really mind where to work and live as long as the country is well-developed and easy to commute, and I do not mind learning new languages, but I do not hope to move back to China due to personal reasons and internet censorship is a really big thing for me. Is there anything I can try or do? I have now completely lost my mind what to do next. I traveled to Germany and UAE last year and I was amazed by the countries themselves. But it seems quite obvious I do not have a lot of advantages to get a job offer from these two countries based on my own status.

Any suggestions/advice are welcome. I'll be happy to answer any questions."

After almost a year of being tormented at my job, I finally put in my resignation. My last day was back in mid April. I very much felt that my direct supervisor never wanted me to have the position I had and was on a quest to have me removed from almost the moment I moved into that role last June/July. I was often left out of important meetings, not told about certain changes to software or procedures for filing, and heard about many of these changes secondhand weeks after implementation. I felt very singled out. No one was treated like I was. I eventually went to my supervisors boss about my concerns and while I was listened to and empathized with, there was no action taken. I made my needs known, asked for help, asked for accommodations, resolutions. And things never got better. The accommodations were not requested formally in writing, though I do have text messages from my supervisor stating that she was aware of my needs, would be sensitive of them, and would implement changes moving forward. 

Things really took a turn for the worse when an individual was hired within the office that has a direct link to the severe abuse that I suffered when I was in high school. She was not 100% responsible for what happened, but for some of it, she is. What I perceived to be a safe place was no longer safe and I felt all of my old PTSD symptoms flood right back. Which is hard to deal with at work, in a cubicle, in front of all your colleagues. And that was devastating for me. I had a hard time going to work and cried before I could even get out of the car. I kept it in and didnt tell anyone because that was a huge thing to unwrap and obviously not something that I have to disclose. I went to my supervisors boss again after being accused of not doing my job by my supervisor. I disclosed what I was struggling with and she encouraged me to tell my direct supervisor what was going on. I felt coerced to tell my supervisor what was going on after she threated to write me up about my schedule. So I told her and it just felt like I made the wrong choice. She understood, but she didn't care. This was all prior to Christmas. Mind you, I laterally moved into this position in June/July.

There were many other things. But fast forward to April 2019. I felt even more suspicious of her motives when an intern working with me had mentioned that my supervisor wanted to know specifically when she was graduating. We both found this odd as there were no openings nor would there be for at least another year. So I did some digging and found a formal write up in my personnel file. It was addressed to me along with a ""performance improvement plan"". HR had been CC'd as well. The document was full of text messages we had exchanged that she twisted in her favor contextually, she had copies of emails, and she also decided she was going to track when I was swiping in and out of our building with my badge, despite me reporting those times anyways. I took copies of all these documents just in case they disappeared at some point. But after finding that, I immediately put in my resignation. I was barely holding on to begin with. But this pushed me over the ledge. I had never seen these documents before, including the formal write up. So why was it there? To spring it on me whenever she felt it would work to her advantage?

After leaving I filed a complaint with the EEOC. I have an interview coming up on August 1st. I also emailed the CEO of said previous company and asked to have a formal sitdown about the ethical and moral concerns I have as a previous worker. I have a conference call set up for this coming Friday afternoon. I don't plan to reveal every shred of information that occured, but how is it that two supervisors, one of which is a director of the site, allowed this neglect to continue for so long? I wouldn't be honoring myself or what happened if I sat here quiet. They need to know what they did was a serious infraction and that it was wrong. 

So I guess my questions are:

What are the legal ramifications, if any, of having a formal write up in my file that I've never seen before? 

Do any issues of liability arise for the company after these two supervisors knew that I was working in proximity to an individual involved in my trauma history? 

Please feel free to tell me how I should handle this. I need some closure for myself. At the very least I do not believe that my previous direct supervisor is qualified to supervise anyone and should be removed from her position. This has to be better for the next person or the next group of employees who is hired. No one deserves to feel how I felt for almost a year."

Let me start off by saying I have absolutely no problem learning something new, in fact this is why I chose not to interview for more jobs and pick this one. But I'm slightly timid in unfamiliar territory. 
The team is comprised of 3 front-end and 3 back-end devs, all 3 of the latter group are leaving, and the PM told me I was brought in to replace one of them. Fair enough. 
The last remaining back-end developer is handing over a chunk of the project to me, and she tells me she would have to sign off on that with management before she leaves, leaving me responsible. The other replacement is yet to arrive. 

I'm approaching the end of my first week and I'm getting worried. While I have familiarized myself with ASP.NET Boilerplate (my main stack included PHP Laravel before this and I fully clarified this during my interview), I'm still worried I might not fully understand the code should I be tasked with any serious refactoring (user authentication for example is still not a part of the project). 

The company is not disintegrating, mind you. It's a sizeable (200+ employees) patner of IBM and Microsoft and most people go on to work at either company after leaving. It's just that this project was apparently left on the back-burner without a PM for a while (she left) and the team slowly started falling apart so they needed replacements, as I was told because I got worried seeing so many people leaving. 

I made it obvious I was a Laravel developer in my interview, which was with my current PM, and she told me she found me flexible which made her recommend me for a full-time position instead of the internship I initially applied for.

Edit: Just want to show my appreciation. I expected all sorts of accusations about lying about my credentials (which friends have accused me of when they heard about my situation), but instead I'm feeling really encouraged by the replies here. I'll do my best and hope I can prove myself."

&amp;#x200B;

This happened while I was on an internship in the deployment department of a quite sizeable company.

My job was basically to setup computers/printers to connect to our network and ship them while also answering to level 2 support request that involved hardware (failing drives, need more RAM, all this kind of stuff).

So this day one of the level 1 support guys comes to me and asks me if someone sent a printer to one of the companies agency. As I look up the name of the printer I recalled that I indeed setup and sent a new printer to this agency so I tell him to transfer me the call.

Me: Me - L: Lady that called

Me: It's me from deployment. I was told that you have an issue with the new printer I sent you.

L: Yeah. We installed it on the old one's spot but we can't get it to work. It got power and seems to work but we can't print to it.

Me: Ok, so first can I check with you if everything is plugged in correctly ?

(ensues usual verifications: is the power plugged in, is the internet plugged in, do they have internet in their office, and so on)

L: Yeah everything is plugged in.

Me: Just to make sure, could you plug back the old printer and see if it works ?

L: Ok, no problem.

I wait for a while, they put their old printer back and everything works. As everything seems to be ok in terms of hardware (note that I did test the printer before sending it and everything was working just fine) I start checking with them if I might have made a mistake configuring it to work in their agency.

We spent a good hour and a half checking every possible misconfiguration, reset the printer twice and set it back up and so on.

Me (starting to lose it as I can't find any possible cause): You sure eveything is plugged in right ? All cables are working ?

L (as tired as me): Yeah, we used all the cables that came with this printer.

Me: ... Wait, what cables did you say you used ?

L: Well those that were with the printer.

Me (finally getting it as I recall what was in the box): You mean you used the internet cable that was in the printer's box ?

L: ... Yeah, why ?

Me: ...Because there was no internet cable with the printer.

The printers we used didn't come with ethernet cables (RJ45), however they did come with a telephone one to use it as a fax (RJ11). Turns out they didn't notice that their ""ethernet"" cable didn't quite fit the printer nor the wall's socket. That was one big facepalm moment for the both of us."
cets4u,2,2019-07-18,Hung up on a career...,Vyke-industries,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/cets4u/hung_up_on_a_career/,"I’m stuck in a career decision and I’m unsure of my course of action.

Right now, I’m an intern for the Technology Services department of a local college. I have been tasked with creating a floor plan map of the campus, to be deployed into our student application. I am using ArcGIS Pro to create polygons for each POI, then exporting the GeoJSON to Mapbox. From there the application team uses JavaScript to create the user interface for the application. 

My education in GIS consists of an AS in Agricultural Geospatial. I earned this degree at the same college I’m working for. My coursework consists of a full ArcGIS Pro course, as well as Pix4D Mapper training. Data collection was a skill taught through the course in the forms of soil sampling, photogrammetry, and ground truthing. I also have skills in digital graphics and know my way around Adobe Creative Cloud application well.

My superiors are happy with the work I’m doing for them. I enjoy my coworkers and the office environment. The problem I’m faced with is that my time is limited. While it hasn’t been formally stated, I sense that once my input on the project is complete, I will no longer be needed. I really want this to be my first full time career. While there are no full time positions available, as more systems in the department are retired, the budge will open up for more positions. My coworkers all have extensive knowledge of JavaScript and various application development skills. I have a basic knowledge of computer hardware and HTML, but not on a scale that is used here. 

The GIS scene here in Iowa is very limited and there’s not really any entry level positions here (from my search on job posting websites). In the near future, I’m told that there will be a need for GIS analytics within the Agricultural sector. As of now, there really isn’t.

My dilemma is do I learn JavaScript and go back to school for computer sciences in hopes that I might get hired on as full time? Or do I continue on with my Agricultural GIS skills once my internship ends and look for other career opportunities that become available?

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

I am 24 Male from Israel and I want to move to Europe(Netherlands or Germany) also open to other options, I don't speak any European language.

&amp;#x200B;

I have BS.c in Computer science, I am working as software engineer at big US corporate, I have 1.5 years full time experience and 1.5 years as contractor and student(yes I worked as intern while studying) .

I have good amount of money for me as savings, so I can use it if I want to move away.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that my field have shortage in Europe, I don't know if I can find a job easily and get visa sponsorship, I am junior..

&amp;#x200B;

I live and lived in small city my whole life, from school to college to work, I tried as a move to get away, to apply to work in another city. I am applying from few months now, while getting interviews most of the jobs expect 3+ years other than startups that expect me to work 9+ hours a day and to be in call(similar to US situation)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any friends where I live since few years now, I am literally not doing anything but working, While I gain good money i only have 14 days in year as vacation, I am expected to work 8.5 hours minimum in day,.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I want to have life quality(knowing that I can't take money to my grave to bury it with me), and really missing life experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I participated once in international volunteering program in Europe and I liked it a lot, and made many friends in short time while I don't have any where I live : (.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I tend to travel solo to Europe for exploration and I stay in hostels to meet new people.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking about immigration for work in Netherlands or Germany or maybe others.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see this move is one way, once I leave it will be harder to me to get back to here, I still have my parents here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My question for those who went out and lived in another countries, what was the line that got crossed that made you move away, and how it didn't scare you?

&amp;#x200B;

What if things didn't work out? what if I end up in worse situation than my current situation socially, everything will be harder to me, I am scared to do this big move.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope to hear advice about my situation and people suggestion that have been in similar situations.

Thanks"
cewibv,8,2019-07-18,"Not a question, just advice from someone in the industry... get a degree.",0wlBear916,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/cewibv/not_a_question_just_advice_from_someone_in_the/,"I see sooooo many posts on this sub of people trying to break into IT without a degree or trying to use certifications as a way to substitute going to school. I hate to break it to you, but unless you want to work low-level support jobs the rest of your career, you're going to need a degree. This wasn't always the case. It used to be that you could get a good job in IT just because you knew your way around a computer. It's not like that anymore. Almost any company that I've ever worked at or even applied for wanted me to have a degree. Especially if you're trying to work in a more specialized field like Security or Networking.  

Now, I know, school sucks. I absolutely hated every single minute of my life that I spent in a college class. But, once it was all over, I was able to apply to real jobs and I was actually taken seriously. One other thing, and I can't possibly stress this enough, *you have to couple your degree with experience.* You can NOT get a degree and expect people to just hand you a job with your diploma. While you're in school you should spend the last couple of years working internships and getting certifications. Honestly, any certification will make you look good. Even a low-level certification is better than nothing at all. However, the most important thing you can do, even more than certs, is getting work experience. Look for campus IT jobs or local companies looking to hire interns or hourly jobs. A lot of places like to pay hourly employees to work graveyard shifts in their NOC or SOC which is a perfect place to start if you're trying to end up in security or networking.  

Another important thing about school, you do NOT have to get a degree in Computer Science. I got my degree in Information Systems. Plenty of people get theirs in other fields like IT or even Business Administration. If your goal is to be doing some really in-depth engineering or coding and if you can handle those types of classes then, by all means, get a degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. But if your ultimate goal is to work in IT and have good job security, you don't need to torture yourself by taking the physics and math courses that those degrees require (unless you just enjoy those classes, then help yourself). Like I said, I got my degree in Information Systems and I'm a Senior Security Analyst. I'm right where I wanna be. I know guys that graduated with me from the same program that are working as pentesters (professional hackers) for the government and I certainly didn't go to an Ivy League school or MIT. But we got to where we are because WE GOT A DEGREE AND INTERNSHIPS.  

One last point, and I'll make this one quick, IT is not for hermits who just want to sit in the dark at a computer without interacting with people. You are CONSTANTLY working with people so you need to get comfortable with humans. Even as a security guy I'm constantly having to talk to people from all aspects of my company and explain concepts to them and listen to their feedback. I'm sorry, but I can't offer any advice on how to get better at this one. It's just something that you gotta do.  

  

  

TL;DR: IT is different than it used to be, you basically *have to have* a degree with internships and certs now and you have to interact with people"

I know based on the title it seems like an easy decision but it doesn't provide all the context.

I am attending University already and am about a year and a half away from a BS in IT. I have 4+ years of work experience starting with an internship my senior year of high school. I've worked three different IT jobs going from Intern -&gt; TI -&gt; TII throughout highschool/college. Having work experience starting so young made my resume stand out so I never bothered to get any certifications at all. However, I feel like my skills have stagnated and that I'm not really learning much anymore.

I have two paths I can take right now while I continue to finish school. I have been receiving call backs about a few TII and TIII positions that pay much more than what I've been doing before, but based on the job descriptions it feels like I'll just be doing more of the same as I've already been doing. I mean it's great, but I can't picture myself moving up in those roles without doing a lot of personal learning at home.

My second option is a ""bootcamp"" that I've received a grant for. It's completely free and spans from August to December. The certs I'd be taking courses for are

CompTia A+ (1001) (1002)

CompTia Network+ (N10-07)

MST-Windows 10

MCSA Server 2016 (740) (741) (742)

Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)  Composite (200-125)

CompTia Security + (SY0-501)

To be honest, I feel like my work experience makes the A+, Windows 10, and some parts of the Net+ redundant. However, the other courses teach a lot of skills I've been wanting to learn like how to manage/migrate a server and create an AD and more complex networking. I have experience using all these things in my past roles but not really managing/building them. The program comes with two free attempts of each exam, and I get 1 year from the end of the program to take the tests ( I only need to complete 2 certs during the program itself). The program is 324 hours overall, spanning 18 weeks. During the year after the program ends, I'm allowed to sit in on any classes I've taken before again as many times as I'd like.

Reddit tends to be skeptical of learning programs and bootcamps, but I feel like it's only not worth it if you're paying or you have no experience at all. I don't know, I feel like it's a good idea to go with the camp so I could get those certs, but I wanted to see what you guys thought first."

I have suffered with depression and anxiety before, and right now I'm not sure if I'm still clinging on to that and afraid to let it go, or is it that I'm so disillusioned that I don't know how bad my mental state is. All I know for sure is that I:

- isolate myself and feel lonely, yet I want close, meaningful relationships
- have no hobbies and interests
- ask others (friends, family) for advice yet ignore everything they tell me. Logically I know I'm doing something wrong because well I'm not happy, yet I always think that the way I do things is right. It's a weird combination of trying to be strong and think for myself and trying to be vulnerable. Yes I know you can do both but I'm not sure how 
- emotionally exhausted

Main thing is that I feel like I've given up on life. I'm so disillusioned. I think I've accomplished so much with my GPA (3.4 and that's not even that high yet I'm so secretly smug about it), I have an engineering internship at a prestigious defense company (yet I'm not producing results, even on simple tasks like transcribing Excel files). Yes I know I'm being hard on myself and beat myself up yet I know I'm also not doing the necessary stuff to get me out of this rut.

I would have taken more this courses summer but I'm doing an internship 6 days a week rn. 

How feasible do you think this is, especially when maintaining a high GPA and graduating within 4 years. Obviously this is a stretch, but I would really like to go down this path to later specialize in ML and keeping my entrepreneurial options open.

For instance, family ties break, people go homeless, friends become enemies, bankruptcies are filed, countless become jobless, many get chronic health and psychological problems, many get under huge debts, some even become corrupt, attempt to kill or even suicide, etc. Most people think it is meant to be this way but is it?  Can I dedicate my life to discover a better and true solution to this problem which could at least take this higher percentage of failure down?. This journey had led me to read many books, researches, meet great entrepreneurs, rich families, teachers and educators to learn their secrets but nothing unusually amazing happened until I discovered my Fail-Proof Formula which is a new approach of teaching business through practical methodology and it has evolved over the years and today I call The DINAMIKA Class. I knew there were so many people, organizations, institutions, teachers, coaches, mentors, gurus, authors, programs, workshops, boot camps, exercises, internships, seminars, webinars, podcasts, offline and online courses, etc. were already trying to solve this problem. That was the time I use to educate myself by reading books, taking courses or meeting someone and learn some key points and say to myself and others maybe this is the solution. But then I started to see some common threads in all the solutions out there which are to let us inform or educate entrepreneurs, business students, and people who want to do business a little bit more through some missing information, case studies, secrets, predefined indoor and outdoor exercises and further information, theories, information, theories so forth and so on. Somehow I was never satisfied because the results were the same.

  
**Stage two Discovery**

Keeping on my mind, **you can't solve a problem with the same level of thinking that created it.** I had to stand apart and see the problem from a different out of the box perspective, which is why I believe I found a different, better and sustainable solution. Data and numbers helped me a lot, ***I found 70% of business graduates never give themselves permission to go out and do business,*** they felt they really do not know anything about real business and if they want to they will have to reeducate themselves all over again in the real world, in short, they could not relate what they learned with real world. On the other hand, ***I found, 98% of Doctors, Accountants, Lawyers, and Pilots, etc. succeed in their careers. Wait a minute what's going on here 90% failure and 98% success, are you kidding me?*** I wanted to know what’s the difference of these model of education to know the truth beneath and I found pretty mindboggling facts. 

1. Medical students in different institutions in the world would learn everything about, disease and medicine through theories, books, case studies, dummies, predefined exercises, etc. but after all that, they all actually have to go to a Real Hospital Emergency Ward where their Practical Education starts, where they will have to meet the high standards for years before they even think about getting a degree and if their hands shake or they cannot see the blood, etc. their seniors then either extend their practical education time period or would suggest them, it is not the right profession for them. I further explored and probed why it is designed this way? and some medical colleges require up to six years of real hospital practical education before their student can graduate. I was told because its a matter of human life we cannot take the risk of just giving theoretical education to our students, ***the world will cry NO to doctors who have studied everything about medicine but have never touched a pulse of a real human.*** It is not the name of the medical college or how great equipment they have for their students but the longer, better, practical education and training system they have, gives the world great doctors. 
2. Students of Accounts are not different either, you see they learn everything about debts, credit, assets, and liabilities through theories, books, case studies, dummies, predefined exercises, etc. but then they have to apply different accountancy real-world firms where they have to balance real financial sheets and meet the high standards, practicing accounts morning, afternoon, evening, night and overnight shifts for years before they think about becoming Chartered Accountants. When I explored and probed I was told most accounts fail during the first two years of this practical education and not after and the reason they are given this tough practical education because they cannot make mistakes if they would, the whole financial system that holds governments, economies, system of taxation, financial institutions, etc. will collapse ***the world will cry NO to accountant who has not practiced accounts for years before starting a career.*** Once again the institutions that have, longer, the better and practical education system aligned for their students produce great accountants.
3. Model of Law education is of two types one where students learn everything through theories, books, case studies, dummies, predefined exercises, etc. and after that, they are on their own. But in other institutions, students actually have to go to real courtrooms, sit with real lawyers, judges, juries, criminals, do their research, study, assist, present their ideas, convince juries, give solutions so that they can be accepted in real successful law firms where they have to practice law right from the elementary level for years before they become attorney. Obviously where students get more practical education are the schools which give society great lawyers. I am told by senior law educators many students change their career right after going to the real courtroom for a few times because they couldn't take the pressure, couldn't think straight, couldn't say or speak the right thing on the right time for the right person, their one mistake can send an innocent to jail or set free a criminal, therefore ***there is NO place for wishy-washy lawyers in this profession.***
4. Student Pilots study through books, lecture, case studies, predefined exercises, etc. only two to four hours a week rest of the 12 to 14 hours they have to be on a Real Airplane flying in real air with an instructor different times of the day and during different weather conditions. Those who fail they fail during their practical education and never get their license. Flying thrills, but it's not a joke, you have to have strong nerves, sharp developed reflexes, you cannot lose focus, you cannot forget anything in the cockpit. Its a matter of your own life and its a matter of lives depending on you, therefore, ***there is NO none practical institution for pilots,*** in fact, the longer, better practical education on different airplanes the more poise and controlled pilots are produced. 

My conclusion was pretty clear the more practical profession the more emphasis is on practical education in other 98% success models of education. **I mean you can’t teach a child how to ride a bicycle through a book or a video game, can you?** ***Its a practical thing,*** you have to teach the necessities through books and instructions, then put some protections on your child, help him get on the bicycle, attach the supporting wheels, show him the breaks, the ring, and how to paddle and then just push him, that's it after a few trial and errors he doesn't need the supporting wheels and then he learns to ride it like a pro even on one wheel, right? 

***I had a big question in front of me which I also like to ask you, what part of Business is not Practical? and Where do Business and Entrepreneur students go to get their Hard Practical Education? I am sure many of you have got that right, Nowhere!*** 

This is not a microscopic discovery, its the core root problem with the model of our business education. Regardless of which institute you go and graduate this tough real-world Practical Education is entirely and completely missing. Most business institutions only have the same old books upon books, theories, lectures, never-ending case studies over case studies, in the end, final presentation and you get the degree. Others would then further teach you through successful entrepreneurs, many lectures and stories of real giants shared by themselves. After that, some give classroom training, indoor business, and corporate predefined situations, predefined exercises, and scenarios to solve, even some cards and table money gimmicks games are taught. After that Think like a child come up with your ideas, let your mind expand, find a new solution to a problem, make any old service better, answer a question or come up with a product idea that can make someone's life better. After that, a panel of seniors would judge your presentations, check your market research and if your idea has a demand then you get a round of applauding if not then go make it better and you will graduate. Some institutions now have their panel of Shark Tank where students present their ideas and some get cash prizes and even investments. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Why the world does not cry NO! to a business student who has learned everything about business through books and theories but have never learned how business is started and ran successfully and learned to earn money from scratch? Loss of $Billions takes the entire economy down is it not that big?*** Most people believe the number one reason entrepreneurs do not succeed is lack of funds. Is it true though? we see in the past 20 years many many websites and services have started to help idea holders get fully funded through the crowed, has it changed the reality? ***over 90% of the online fully funded to at times 200% to 500% extra funded business also fail.*** Many business analyst and gurus and even investors say 9 out of every 10 startups have to fail therefore investing is a picky and risky business. I say off course if we will never make business education better this myth will not be debunked. Because the truth is Business and Money making are a set of skills everyone can learn them through Practical and get better at them through Practice like every other profession. ***If we go back and read the life of Warren Buffet or Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg etc. they all learned how businesses succeed in their early life through real-world practical skills.*** 

  
**Stage three Unique Research and Study**

 After I discovered the root cause of this problem I so badly wanted to do something about it and share it with the world but I didn't know-how. What happened next genuinely stunned my mind I was presented with an opportunity (I call it “The Gift of my Life”) to teach business and entrepreneurship at the most renowned university in Ecuador [www.uees.edu.ec](http://www.uees.edu.ec/). Now I had no formal teaching experience. I said aaaaaahyes and requested the director to allow me to sit with other professors and learn and even interview students. I inwardly knew I am given a chance to do research and study on real students through trial and errors, create and originate a new way through which the missing practical education can be taught effectively to business students. I spent a couple of weeks with professors, library, probing students and get my thoughts and courses together.  I went back and gave my proposal to the director that I would like to take the challenge of teaching provided that they will give me a free hand to teach. He asked what I meant by a free hand, I responded that I will divide my courses into two parts, part one theory and all and part two practical and students have to pass both to pass the course. He loved the idea and my teaching career begun on September 6, 2006. Just like a nutritionist I made notes upon notes and say hmm this is my clinic I’ll apply one after everything from the real world and see what truly works and what does not. The very first day I explained to students my courses will be a composite of theory and a practical and I could see right there everyone wanted to know what's the practical part? And I would respond the real-world education, they couldn’t wait and kept asking when the practical part will start?. Then one day on the chapter of a Hoax Marketing, some students wanted to know what’s the practical application of a Hoax. That’s it, I said this is going to be your practical education for this course. Your goal is to give yourself a NAME as a whole student body, then create a hoax about it and market it within the university to a level that everyone starts to gossip about it. While you experience the application and then analyze how effective were the results. Start brainstorming your ideas now! they came up with many names the superheroes, ET generation, Spartans were their most famous but they were not agreeing on one at all, one girl from the backseat said DINAMIKA (Dee Naa Me Ka) and yes we are DINAMIKA I heard a roar, I said is it the Spanish of Dynamic? Yes! Altogether and so it was. They then created a hoax through, signs, gossip, online ads, chat room, etc. DINAMIKA is a Shakira concert to be announced on such day such time. Others hoaxed it’s the name of a new sports complex which was under construction etc. Within a few days everyone was gossiping about DINAMIKA and on the due date and time when everyone wanted to know what is it, students put DINAMIKA T-shirts on and surprised everyone they were DINAMIKA. Believe me or not it became so famous that for another 6 years, I was known as the DINAMIKA professor, my classes were known as the DINAMIKA classes and my students were known as the DINAMIKA students, many DINAMIKA activities started in university after that and to date, they have there a DINAMIKA student club. 

***Now, this platform does not allow me to go into the detail of every practical after that, but in different courses, I had DINAMIKA smoke free day, smile effect, flowers sharing, coffee alternative day, minute message, the big thing, fragrance day, 4 minutes exercise, etc. All real-world goals learned and achieved in real-world, measured by real-world success or failure. I was not just on a mission to give them the missing practical education but also to know THE WHY behind every failure and success.***

***I would then set a goal for individuals who had the same kind of life routine and learn through observation and probing why some failed and some succeeded, what were the common excuses and what can I do better next time so most of them succeed.***

***I would set goals for pairs and do the same for them.***

***I would set goals for a small group of students and do the same analysis.***

***I would also set one goal for a whole class and then do everything I can to increase the probability of their success.***

***I would also divide the entire class in a hierarchy with different designation and job responsibilities given to different most suitable students, to analyze do the corporate hierarchy get things done faster?***   

***I would also just give a project to students and let them decide on their own who could be the leader and where each student felt fit and then observe which model is better. Corporate hierarchy or project management.***

***I found many mind-blowing and eyeopening facts and I did this over and over again for a little over a year.*** I also learned things about myself like from the day one teaching experience made some profound changes inside me. I would off and on found myself as some call the zone, where I am reading, researching and exploring and have forgotten everything that I have not eaten anything and the day has ended long ago and if I am not going home, I’ll have to stay in the library till next morning. when I am taking a class or giving lectures students interaction became the most important to me. My self-awareness became more alert, I am controlling my language and the words I use to say and even judging my actions and character all the time. I found my true voice in teaching and just never wanted anything to change. 

I used to sit in the library and go over all the practical projects I gave my students and try to make it a step by step foolproof system which should work almost like a science for the next students that will help them learn some real-world business skills better than the previous. ***Can they make money through practical education?,*** I heard this voice inside me over and over again. Suddenly I knew I had to give my students financial goals otherwise DINAMIKA Class is not a complete system. But I am not authorized, what would happen? maybe they won't allow me, what if someone complains about it, what if I get fired but I had to listen to my inspiration and in the next course with a shaky voice I set a goal for students to earn $500 within two weeks from scratch and it should all be profit. Guess what? Yes, they achieved it and they achieved it before time and went further and earned over $1440, selling homemade chocolates and sandwiches. The next class goal was $1000 and then $2000 and then $5000 and then $10,000. ***Money money money ..... money!*** I heard this song whispered inside my head every time students achieved their goal.

Then a random student would meet me in a library or a cafeteria and ask, you are the DINAMIKA Professor right? That's right! Even though my major is psychology but I want to take a course with you because I can take it as a minor, you are most welcome. I had students who took a course with me and then changed their major to entrepreneurship or business. Some told me this was the only course they will remember their entire life, some started their business at the age of 19 and some groups started new services and online businesses. There was a cult-like student body who wanted to get the next challenge and learn through trial and error. Some professors wanted to sit with me and ask me how can they also make their classes more interactive and add some practicality to their courses. 

On the other hand, some students who were not meant to study business were time to time complaining about me, who this professor is, why he is not normal like other professors, give us the assignments, we do it and present and then he marks us that's it, why practical is mandatory in his classes? Some professors were also threatened by DINAMIKA, they thought I was making students hate them and poisoning their mind that their way of teaching is outdated. Some high echelons of university started probing me. Why am I not following the standardization? And by the way where this DINAMIKA way of teaching came from, who am I following? It is not the model of McGraw-Hill, is it? Are you trying to take over the university? I would humbly respond to them, my classes have the highest attendance, great interaction, no one sleeps, students learn through involvement, trail, error and practical, they are becoming entrepreneurs through practical education, is it not what we want? They would say yes yes we love that. 

But then they started putting conditions like no more money involvement, no more DINAMIKA Projects within the university premises, etc. Which was better because now students had to do business, sell and earn money on the streets. The projects became more bold, bigger and more DINAMIKA. ***Little practical education projects became a complete FoolProof system through which anyone can learn, develop and improve their business and money-making skills*** The DINAMIKA word went out, newspaper and magazines wrote, tv interviewed me about DINAMIKA Classes and other universities also invited me to give lectures even in Peru and Colombia. But I also knew the tense bubble was about to explode any moment and it did and they didn’t give me any courses at the beginning of the year 2014. I went back to the university and gave them all the great reasons they loved but somehow they didn't want to hear anything about practical education anymore, they didn't fire me but I was fired.

***That night while counting my blessings of DINAMIKA, I looked up and made a commitment to myself, my hand turned into a fist and I said, the heartfelt service that I gave to my students in a small classroom of a small university in a small country, I will find a way to take it to all over the world.***

**Stage Four DINAMIKA School of Entrepreneurs.  Non-Profit. Offers FREE Classes**

Mid-2015 I came to New York and applied every university I could and shared my DINAMIKA research, findings and teaching experience, only a couple replied, that because I am not Ph.D. there is no chance for me. My second choice was to start my own institution and I didn't know much people but I started reaching out whoever I could. Soon some (who I do not want to take their names) liked my work but they wanted to get all the equity as if I was building another app. Working with students and serving them all towards the achievement of one financial goal is probably one of the hardest jobs to do, plus I am always looking for partners who understand what is DINAMIKA Class and where it can go. Long story short, the business education is probably one of the most expensive fields in the USA and If I started charging for my revolutionary practical education then what's the difference am I going to make? gradually I was drawn and have recently started a ***non-profit institution. DINAMIKA School of Entrepreneurs, offers FREE courses. A class of 50 to 100 Students all together have to achieve one Financial Goal from scratch within 100 days following 9 FoolProof DINAMIKA steps. You become a certified DINAMIKA entrepreneur only when you achieve your goal or you can take the FREE course again. Real business skills are learned and developed in real-world not in a classroom, not through case studies and not through online courses. I have been reached out by many students and graduates even from Oxford university that how much they need to take this course.***

I am going to be here from May to August. I am debating on whether I should include this job on my resume when I apply for accounting internships this upcoming school year.

I only stayed here from May to August. Now, I know this is perfectly normal for a student. But the thing is that I lied during the interview and said that I was taking a year off so I could be hired full time at this call center. So the call center doesn't expect me to quit in August. When I quit, I'm not gonna say I'm going back to school. I'm just gonna say it wasn't a good fit so I am moving on.

But even then, the call center isn't gonna like the fact that I quit so early. But I'm not planning on using them as a reference.

But I'm worried that if a firm calls this company during a background check or something, the company is going to bad mouth me because I left after 2 months. Although I doubt that's going to happen because this is a big call center (200 employees) with super high turnover so it's not like any one in the HR or management is gonna hold a personal grudge against me when I quit.

Do you guys think I should include this job on my resume when applying for my first internship soon?

After the 2nd year of uni I have decided to do a “sandwich year” in which I got an internship at a company that makes electronic components for Motorsport series. Which (as it happens) is all I ever wanted to work. And I truly love what I do, and because I proved to be so dedicated at my job, I have done really well during my internship and now they really want me to go back there straight after graduating university.

I will be going back to university in September to do my final year, and graduating in July next year. 

Another thing: I have never traveled/visited anywhere in my life (well apart from a school trip to Paris when I was 14 that lasted 2 days) I have never even been on a summer holiday on a beach or something. 

So I fear that if I go back to the company, even though I have succedded from a career point of view, i have wasted my youth working rather than discovering the world. And yet I don’t (think) I want to miss the opportunity of having the job I always wanted....

Moreover, I am very VERY broke.. i have to pay for everything on my own (rent, books, clothes, food , transport etc) while at uni. I do not receive any sort of maintenance loan or student loan and my parents can’t afford to help me... next year is my final year and probably the busiest one too (because of the thesis and everything else) so I can’t afford to work much either.

The question is: what do I do after I finish univeristy? Do I go back to work and be an adult for the rest of my life? Do I go travelling and miss the opportunity to be part of a really cool industry? 
Also, if i choose the second option, how on earth will I even afford buying the plane tickets for travelling?

They also ask about whether I give them permission to use my code regardless of the outcome of the interview. I want to say no but I am worried that it will reduce my chances of receiving the job. Is this kind of question normal or not? If you were hiring would you think less of me if I said no?

If there's anyone that has ever came across a same situation please tell me your experience.

I realise this is a weird question to ask but this is my first time applying to a job and getting this far so I just need inputs from other people who are more experienced."

I made a post in another subreddit(https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cedtml/internship_starting_to_suck/), about an internship I am currently doing at a respectable utility company where I am disgruntled with the work I have been given. I mentioned in that post I was (informally) given an offer to work full-time. I have spoken to many former interns and employees here, and they tell me I should accept it. And the company almost always provides former interns with a full-time offer. I have thought hard about it and am thinking I should. Although my internship experience wasn't the best, I have gotten to know what engineers do and the responsibilities here and I believe it's something I could handle and something I would enjoy. What really draws me in is the continuing education program the offer,the amazing and friendly work environment and the benefits. Considering I have interned here for 2 years, I am already comfortable with the job and everyone here, so it would be the best transition. Also, it is about 15 miles away from home, where I plan to live post-grad, so commute will be a breeze. Of course, I will apply to other jobs before I graduate but this is really my first choice.

My worry is, I am really looking to work with PLC's. But as an entry level engineer in my city, there are little to no opportunities. I would eventually have to move away in order to get to that which I plan to do once my life and income are in order, but working in utility really doesn't provide me with the adequate experience for a job in PLC's. Another concern is, I don't know if choosing complacency would be the best idea, because things can change once I am actually full-time. I should take other options that will be available to me, but sometimes the grass is not greener on the other side. 

I know its a bit early to worry about all of this, but May will be here before I know it and I'd like to know what I should do. Choose a place I know that won't give me the best experience for my real career plans or take the risk of going elsewhere which could provide me better experience?"

Outside of this, my previous experience are projects I've run with peers from university, or volunteer work, or a short internship.

At the moment, I get paid 15 euros (which includes a raise from the original amount) an hour as a DevOps Engineer, as part of a team, which handles:

* Development of our Ansible project to provision virtual machine images, and baremetal servers
* Development of bash scripts to automate initial provisioning of baremetal servers

* Highly Available K8s deployment and management

* CI/CD setup for Docker images, and support for our users/developers

* Monitoring and alerting setup

* Backup automation

* IPTables and other networking

* Ansible Dynamic Inventory development

* PCI Compliance

* Dev/Prod environments

* Elasticsearch Cluster

* Database Cluster

* Nginx ingress setup and HAProxy maintenance

...etc

Many of which I have either carried my equal weight for or did most of the work for (and of course other team members did most for different parts of it)

Payscale says the range should be around 41k-72k, which as an undergrad student I don't expect to be anywhere but the bottom end of, of course. And that is 20 euros per hour. I don't think these numbers are correct, but they're the only one I have that's more useful than minimum wage being around 11 euros.

Am I being paid fairly? I feel confident I'm being underpaid, but I wanted to check here to see what you think I should be getting paid for this?

Edit: If anyone has suggestions on how I could do DevOps as a Service as a self-employed person (legally, eenmanszaak), I'm also open to that! It seemed too unreliable to find customers for that, at least for now when I have only so much time to focus on it due to university.

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for all your comments! It seems the general consensus is that I'm getting paid rightly, although I do still have some leeway when it comes to a higher salary it's not by much until after graduation with full time work. I hope this information will be useful for other people too \^\^"

&amp;#x200B;

When I started my degree I didn't really know what I was getting into but I was really enjoying it for the first 2 semesters. Then came the 3rd semester in which I scored my lowest SGPA (2.00) and was considering dropping out. I managed to silence those voices and have had a minimum of 2.8 SGPA every semester.

&amp;#x200B;

In these 3 years, I've had a mix of some horrible teachers who made me feel like a failure who should just drop programming and then there are some who revived my joy of programming with subjects like machine learning.

&amp;#x200B;

In these 6 semesters, I've realized a few things. The first being that I pretty much hate core programming courses for one and one reason only: Final exams. In every course, the final is worth between 50-40% of the grade and I have some trauma issues that make me unable to focus in a 3 hour forced-sitting period and I end up screwing a lot of the exam. This leads to my grade dropping to a C/C+ usually and I still end up above average because I save my grade through assignments and projects. I know how to program and I make a good effort in them and get great marks which keeps me from failing every time I screw up a final. But this is where the main source of discouragement comes from as there are teachers out there who just look at my transcript and assume how serious I am in my studies. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing is that I genuinely enjoy studying a subject no matter how hard it is. In fact, the harder it is the more I enjoy going into its details. I got an A and B+ in Data Mining and Bio-informatics respectively because these courses that interested me, I chose them on my own, and they had great teachers. Currently, my CGPA is 2.71/4.00 (low only because of core programming courses) and this has stopped me from thinking about pursuing a Master's because I can't afford it without a full scholarship. This led me to focus more on my development skills so I can maybe one day think of paying it for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

The third thing is that I can create amazing quality projects, but only when I'm allowed to work on my own and don't have a strict 20 minute-3 hours deadline on my head. Whenever we are given any assignment/project, I make sure I start it on day 1. Starting soon gives me the benefit of being able to get in my comfort zone and look at the problem in various ways and come up with good solutions. I make small increments every day and almost always finish a day before the deadline. I know how to work, but I couldn't explain that to employers since this summer, almost every internship I've tried to get into had a ridiculously low timed test (20 minutes) and I left most of it blank. The thought of not being able to impress employers has made me want to throw development out the windows for good and pursue a different career path.

&amp;#x200B;

During the last year, I've realized that I have a keen eye for businesses and entrepreneurship. I've really enjoyed being alongside such people and working with them on very small ideas. They liked the way I think and encouraged me to use my head more like this since they see potential in me to build something great. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I couldn't land an internship, I decided to learn web/mobile development so I could develop the ideas I had in my head and that is what I've been doing the whole summer. Since I was working for myself, I've made great progress without the pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

I will now try to sum my whole ordeal in one paragraph:

I love studying but can't pursue a Master's because of a low CGPA that exists because of how I handle pressure. I know how to code and I'm developing my own apps but I'm unable to impress employers because they demand that I function like a robot in a specific timeframe and I work best at different times of the day. The thought of not being able to get a job in this field AND realizing that I am a much better product designer/entrepreneur/business person has made me want to change career paths.

&amp;#x200B;

If you could give me any advice regarding my future studies and career choices, what would it be?"
cf7ovz,1,2019-07-19,Any careers that can help act as a springboard into software development?,florvas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cf7ovz/any_careers_that_can_help_act_as_a_springboard/,"So I recently acquired my CS degree, and have come across a bit of a problem. I've got that, plus a six month sys-admin internship, a résumé that's been checked and improved with the help of recruiters, my instructors, and a friend who works in QA, and a portfolio I'm continuously expanding. Enough going that the universal recommendation I've received is to apply for jobs and don't stop. 

In the month since getting my degree I've applied for over 100 of them, all in the Seattle-Redmond, WA area. Tons of jobs. I haven't heard back from a single one for an interview. 

Add to that, when searching for ""entry level"" jobs, 11 out of every 12 (weird number, but that's the **exact** ratio it's been) require at least a few years of experience. Where in the hell are you supposed to GET that experience in the first place if not in an entry level position? **I've even been turned down offering volunteer work.**

Is there an alternative that would make for good experience while I expand my portfolio some more? Or anything I can do to help my chances? I've been networking where possible too, but the only industry ""contacts"" I have are recruiters, and not one of them has gotten back to me (unless you count the ones insisting I move to Georgia or some nonsense). I expected it to be difficult applying cold to places, but my god...I'm starting to think I'm just going to be stuck as a security guard forever, degree be damned."

cf81h7,1,2019-07-19,Migrating a Small Access Database to Sharepoint?,throwaway8688955,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/cf81h7/migrating_a_small_access_database_to_sharepoint/,"Hey guys, I'm a summer intern in a government office, and my section uses sharepoint in order to store and sync all our files. Before I arrived here they were using excel as sort of a database tool to store and track records for contracting companies. I quickly realized how inefficient and non-user friendly our excel file was compared to what I could do in Microsoft Access, so I made a small Access database and imported all the data from the excel file into the Access file. I then made a form with a nice user interface so that my team members could insert records into the database more quickly and more cleanly. Everything was looking good and so I uploaded the Access database to our sharepoint and considered the project done.

The next day I realized that in 2016 or 2017 Microsoft ended up retiring Access web services for sharepoint, so instead of opening the file in browser when clicked on, then altering the data records, then clicking save and having the changes automatically sync to sharepoint (like our excel and word docs do), the access database would download onto the computer of whoever is trying to edit it, then the person editing it would have to do the alterations to the records, resave the database, then go into sharepoint and reupload it, all because microsoft sharepoint retired the access web app.

This obviously defeats the point of the database I made, as I made the access file so that our team would have a quicker and more user friendly way of inserting records into our database. This is now not the case as it would be easier to do what we always have done and just edit the excel document from sharepoint.

I have seen many people online suggesting a switch to powerapps or office 365 or something of the sort, but since we are in a government office, we really don't have a say on the software we can use, so I'm stuck with Office 2013 and a Microsoft Sharepoint website, and a desktop access database.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just coming onto this sub to see if anyone had any alternative ideas that would work, I am honestly stuck at an impasse right now and have no clue what to do, I spent a few days perfecting the database and all the relationships contained within it, and it would be a shame if all that was for nothing. Thanks so much in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Created an Access database for work, then realized that Access no longer has the microsoft sharepoint webapp, and so it is impossible to edit the database without downloading it to the PC then reuploading it. This isn't the case with excel files or word files or powerpoint files, all of which still work perfectly. A few hours of web searching yielded me pretty much nothing useful, as I'm unable to install powerapps or any other database server software. I just want to be able to edit my database from within sharepoint."
cf82j1,1,2019-07-19,[NY] Does my employer own the algorithms I come up with?,drfrev,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cf82j1/ny_does_my_employer_own_the_algorithms_i_come_up/,"TLDR: I am a computer scientist and during my job I come up with some different ways to solve problems that I come across while working. I am not payed to come up with algorithms but I do it because it makes my life easier. I am curious if these tools I come up with can be used when I move to a new job. I know my employer owns my code, but does my employer own the algorithms I come up with to make my work go faster? 


To give more specifics on my situation. In my job I am pretty much a glorified HTML form builder. It's not the job I want but during the hiring process they stretched the truth so I'm stuck here for a bit. I am currently looking for a new job; however, that does not mean I'm not doing the best I can while I'm here. I work with legacy programing languages because the manager (who doesn't code anymore) only knows that one language. Because of that situation it take months to write code that should take a week. I've come up with algorithms while at work to drastically increase the speed I work at, but when I show then to the rest of the team they get brushed off, put in a network drive, and are destined to sit there for the rest of time. 


An example of one of these algorithms is a technique based off regex to parse Excel documents in a flexible way. Currently any Excel parsing my team does is done by writing a script for each different document. It's inflexible and if the format of the files get changed my team will complain for weeks about why anyone would change something like that. The algorithm I made could be called unique and novel and it's not something that would be taught in a classroom. At the same time it isn't a difficult algorithm to come up with if you were given the task to design an Excel parser.


I've been thinking about not using novel algorithms while at work for fear that it means I would not be able to use them elsewhere. I've also wanted to start padding my GitHub with these little tools I've made to possibly help others who have the same problems. I'm not sure at what point my employer owns these ideas. I've also begun to think about programming these things at home, uploading then to GitHub, and then using them at work.


Side note: When I was an intern I worked for a huge faceless company. I had also come up with a cool little algorithm for them that they really liked. In that situation they asked me to do a write up and go through their patent system. I got a bonus and my name on a patent. I know in that situation, that big faceless company owns that algorithm. That got me wondering if the reason that did all of that was because that's what's required to lay claim to an algorithm."
cf8coh,221,2019-07-19,"I got out (USA-&gt;France, via 2.5-year stay in Ireland)/rant/tips",goatsnboots,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/cf8coh/i_got_out_usafrance_via_25year_stay_in/,"For the past five years, I have been somewhere in the process of immigrating to Europe. Five months ago, I moved to France, but man was it a trek to get here. The last three years in particular have taken a lot of mental and emotional effort. I made some mistakes along the way and learned some things that I want to share here. I'm putting a kind of tl;dr here because I anticipate this could be quite long.


Tl;dr tips: Have a lot of money. A lot. Enough so that if life can throw some curveballs at you, you can get yourself on a plane or get accommodation easily. You will get homesick. You will at times hate your new country. Just because you tick all the items on an immigration checklist doesn't mean you are entitled to any kind of visa. Job searching is a wild beast and it's even crazier in other countries. Have strong supports in both countries. Make sure you have fully researched any opportunities before you move for them. **You need to be in charge of your own immigration. Do not rely on a university, a job, or anyone else to have the correct information. You are the one moving and therefore you need to be the expert.** And most importantly, DON'T GIVE UP. There is  a way and you're going to find it. Things will end up alright in the end.


Tl;dr what happened: I moved to Ireland on a working visa intending to work, but that didn’t work out. I tried to switch to a student visa, and all hell broke loose. For the following year and a half, I battled immigration until my residence card was revoked after I'd received a job offer in France. My right to work in Ireland was revoked, I lost my job, and was given a month to vacate the country. Thankfully I made it to France anyway and will be here for another 3 years.


**The Immigration Process**


So now, the details. I am 25 years old now, and this whole thing really started when I was 20. I've lived in the US my entire life. I was in college and knew that I wanted to live abroad. Due to transferring from a community college and the credit mess that can sometimes stem from that, I knew I'd be graduating a semester late. That kinda bummed me out until I realised that I could study abroad that semester. I always wanted to live abroad, so I began looking into how I could stay in whatever country I chose after I graduated in December 2016. Well, I found that Ireland was a pretty easy country to immigrate to. There is a scheme called the Working Holiday Authorisation in which US citizens are allowed to live and work in Ireland for 12 months as long as they have graduated within the past year or are still in school. I found out that I was accepted to a university in Ireland for a study abroad semester in January 2016. I began gathering all my documents (a letter of motivation, my resume, bank statements, etc.). Being new to the immigration process, I figured it would be pretty difficult. January and February when I actually mailed my documents to the embassy in California were insanely stressful. But three days after my documents arrived, I got an email saying my visa had been approved. I was thrilled with how easy it was.


In September, I moved to Ireland. I was in classes, but I spent a lot of time applying for jobs, hoping to get a work sponsorship by September 2017 when my visa expired. Before and during college, I worked as a marketing assistant. My total marketing experience was about 4 years. I looked up CV formats, followed advice from working people I knew, but I just couldn't seem to land even an interview in my field (marketing). I did get a part time customer service job in late October which helped me financially, but in the entire first year, I had a total of 2 interviews. 


**Setback #1: job searching is freaking hard. In Ireland, a company needs to pay you €30k (~$34k) in order for you to get visa sponsorship. In my US city, I'd never heard of a starting salary in marketing that paid less than $40k, so I thought I’d have no problem hitting that requirement. Surprise, surprise, Ireland is different. Graduates often get paid in the €20s. I did not know this. I learned that visa sponsorship would be nearly impossible to obtain with my paltry 4 years experience and recent graduation.**


I kept working at my customer service job, unsure of what to do. I knew I didn't want to go back to school for marketing. In August, when I was in full-blown panic mode about having to leave in less than a month, a friend sent me a link to a masters program in a tech field that I could possibly qualify for. I applied, interviewed, and started the course in three weeks. It was insanely fast, and I was ecstatic because I'd be on a student visa which allowed for part time work.


In order to apply for a visa, you need to leave the country and reenter with your documents (acceptance letter to the program, proof of accommodation, etc.). I did so before my visa expired in September 2017. The customs officers at the airport stamped my passport letting me know that I had 60 days to get to the immigration office in Cork and to get a student visa. No biggie.


What I didn't know is that my course was brand new. It was the first year it was running as a masters program. There is a magical list of specific courses in Ireland that allow international students to attend and obtain a visa for attending. My course was not on it. 


I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this part, but what I will say is that my university had an international office full of staff who were not equipped or knowledgeable enough to handle international students. I was repeatedly given wrong information, sent to the immigration office seven times in eight months, told that my visa status would get resolved with a quick call, etc. It was a nightmare. I couldn't leave the country because I wouldn't be let back in (I knew people in study abroad who were sent back after they left Ireland without their visas, and I did not want to risk that). I ended up filing a formal complaint against the international office and meeting with my school's president to get it resolved. A case with the Department of Justice was opened. 


For eight months, I couldn't work,  and even though I maxed out my US federal loans, they barely provided enough to survive ($8k a year really isn't enough for rent and food there). In May 2018, after my case was brought before the Department of Justice, I was granted the student visa. In June I started a paid internship without which I would have been homeless.


**Setback #2: Just because you follow the rules and tick all the boxes does not mean you are entitled to a visa. There are things going on behind the scenes that can throw a serious thorn in your plans even if you've done nothing wrong.**


Because of the crappy way my university and the immigration office handled my case, I realised Ireland was not for me. I was sick of it, I felt that I was not wanted, and I knew that even if I stayed and worked, I wouldn't be getting paid what I felt was fair. So I made the decision to start looking for jobs elsewhere in Europe.


In December, I was accepted to a funded PhD in France. However, the start date was in March. There would be a one-month gap between my student visa expiring and the move itself.


Ireland has a scheme called the Two-Year Graduate visa. If you have attended and graduated from a course in Ireland, you are eligible for a two-year work visa without visa sponsorship. So I figured that I'd get on that for the one-month gap. You cannot apply for this Irish visa until you've graduated. My student visa expired the day I graduated. See how annoying this is? I knew there would be a period where I was illegal again, but no one seemed to bat an eye at it so I figured it would be fine.


Wrong again. Note that I applied for the Irish visa on February 1st of this year, exactly one day with an expired immigration card. She asked me if I was working, and I said no (I was working part time at an internship that was ending soon. It's illegal to take up full time work with a student visa). She explained that a Graduate visa, the one I was applying for, was only for full time workers and if I didn't have a job, I wasn't eligible. She then confiscated my expired card (never had that happened before when it had expired for eight months), wrote a note in my file that I was to vacate the country, and put a stamp in my passport saying I had no work permissions. So that was it. I lost my internship and only reliable source of income for the second time. 


Thankfully at this point, due to again maxing out my US student loans and the internship, I had enough savings to cover the month of February. 


**Now for the French side of things**


I mentioned in the tl;dr that you need to be the expert for your own immigration because my university in Ireland had no idea what they were doing and also because my university/job in France had no idea what they were doing. In December, when I was accepted, I was told to apply for the student visa. I found out in February that I needed to be on a totally different visa. That ended up being okay because I hadn’t applied yet (I couldn’t until I had my masters diploma), but if I had, it would have been a disastrous waste of time.


On February 26th, I moved from Ireland to France. I had all of my belongings put in storage beforehand (about 7 boxes, nothing crazy) and took myself, my backpack, my suitcase, and my Irish boyfriend to France. My Airbnb was booked for three months already, from February-May, specifically for the visa application requirements. That ended up being a colossal waste of money as I didn’t end up applying for the visa until April. Anyway, I spent 6 weeks in France getting set up with an apartment and the university and whatnot. 


In early April, I went back to the US for six weeks to apply for the French long-stay visa. This wouldn’t have been financially possible if my university hadn’t covered some of my flight and if I hadn’t had a friend to stay with. **This is why it’s so important to have a strong support system in your home country.** You never know when you might need that. 


So I’ve been in France for five months now (four really since I spent 6 weeks in the US). But you know what, life here is freaking hard. In the tldr, I put “Make sure you have fully researched any opportunities before you move for them.” I… didn’t do that. Literally day one of the PhD started with “we changed your project”, so I’m now working on something I don’t care about. The funding body dictates my every move, meaning that I am not allowed to do research in the American or Irish sense of the word but am instead meant to implement my supervisors ideas. I am compensated less than I was told because my supervisors wrongly told me that my salary would be untaxed. I am responsible for paying my tuition, whereas it would be covered in the US or Ireland. I am not paid for sick days. I was told that learning French was not necessary (even though I personally wanted to), but all of my meetings are in French and I’m constantly belittled for not being able to hold a conversation. 


When I received the job offer, I was so thrilled and thought I knew what a PhD was from my American and Irish friends. Once again, things are different abroad. **And now I’m in a foreign country with depleted savings, wholly dependent on my university, and pretty unhappy with my work. Don’t let that happen to you.** People struggle with unhappiness after job moves within the same country, but it is 10x worse abroad.


To conclude, I am still waiting on the visa. It takes about 6 months to get apparently and costs a total of about €500. 


**The Other Stuff**


So aside from all the actual immigration stuff, there are things that I feel I should mention.


The first few months after I arrived in Ireland, I thought it was the most fantastic place I'd ever been to. Raw milk is easily accessible. Healthcare is cheap. There is wifi on buses. Buying sustainable food is easy. People are friendly. Then after the first few months when I wasn't living in university housing anymore, reality hit and I started to realise how difficult life is in Ireland. 


The houses you can afford as a young person are old. Heating doesn't often work. Hot water is a hit or miss. Mold is everywhere and hard to combat. There are rooms in houses called ""box rooms"" because aside from the bed and maybe a closet if you're lucky, there is no room to stand. Public transportation is awful so living far away from your job is only doable if you're willing to commute an hour or so earlier than you need to every day to make up for delays. Life was honestly just really hard. 


After a year, I was really getting frustrated. Hearing about ""successful"" people getting jobs and getting paid a laughable amount was really depressing. The housing crisis in Cork became more real. In my own customer service job, I saw how poorly people can be treated. When I first got my job, I was in love with how I got paid vacation days and a regular set schedule. But my contract would constantly change and I realised that it wasn't very different from minimum-wage jobs in the US. 


There are things I took for granted in the US that I didn't realise I'd miss so much. It's silly, but being able to go to the grocery store to pick up hydrogen peroxide was something I missed (only certain stores carry it in Ireland and it's pretty expensive). I got a concussion at one point and when I went to the doctor, I was given a ""prescription"" for panadol to soothe a splitting headache because they try to limit prescriptions for real painkillers.


There are a lot of cultural things that I found fascinating at first (e.g., in Ireland, the drinking and the extent people go to do it) that I loathe now. You never know what will bother you until you move to a place and you'll start to miss things a year or two in that will seem really silly.


Moving to France was a different story. It was one of the most stressful months of my life. I dealt with communication struggles for 16 hours a day until I finally moved into the apartment 5 weeks after arriving. It was exhausting.


The language is a tough hurdle. I see so many people here posting about wanting to get out without having a second language. Technically, I was one of those people as I moved to France without having learned French first. Every is hard. Everything. Buying a washing machine becomes an anxiety-filled afternoon. Setting up internet takes hours. And that’s not to mention when things go wrong. Our boiler broke, and I called the English line of our gas company and was hung up on because the person couldn’t understand me. I received the wrong sim card for my phone when I got a French number, and the email support couldn’t understand me either. Things that are easy to deal with in English are a nightmare when you don’t have a good command of the local language.


Lastly, things you think of as norms in first-world countries are necessarily norms in other countries. The French banking system is a good example. To be frank, it’s an absolute nightmare and one of the reasons I do not see myself staying in France. After I opened a bank account, I got a letter in the mail saying my debit card was ready to be picked up. When I arrived at the branch, I was told they “didn’t trust” me enough to give it to me. What does that mean? I never found out. Apparently they do this to foreigners. It’s been a disaster trying to set up transfers of money to my American account, so I’ve given up and resorted to Paypal. An expat I know had a whopping €1500 removed from his account because he didn’t provide them with his French tax returns… which he didn’t have because he didn’t reside in France the previous year.


The other side of this is that despite all the things that I am complaining about here… it’s better than the US in some ways. I’ve visited my home state a few times since leaving, and each time I’ve felt more and more out of place. Having to pay 30% more for a meal because of taxes and tips is mildly infuriating. Having to walk an hour to get public transportation is ridiculous. Watching my friends answer work calls and emails on their off-hours is really upsetting to see (actually, everything about work in the US is ridiculous to me now. If the rest of the modern world can treat employees with respect, then why can’t the US?). Enough has changed in my home city that I feel like a stranger trying to make sense of it all.


**How I'm Feeling Now**


I am glad I moved to Europe. There's not a day that goes by that I regret it. But five years ago when I made this decision, I thought I'd move abroad and find my place. I didn't. In fact, the sensation of not belonging has gotten worse. When I visited the US again after two years of not having been in the country, things that never bothered me before started irritating me. I realised that I don't belong there anymore. I don’t feel like I belong in Ireland or France either though. As I mentioned above, I am unhappy with my job and I’m scraping by financially, so was it worth it? I met my partner, so it has been. But other than that, I really don’t know."

I am in a situation and not sure what to do. I am a rising senior in college with a degree in computer information technology and I've recently decided I want to go to graduate school. I want to go to graduate school for cybersecurity. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I attend graduate school, I must pay for it on my own or find funding through my respective universities. While I don't find it difficult to get funding, I am more afraid of not getting into my dream schools. I need to be in the 50th percentile of GRE test takers. I am just curious if that is ""hard"" to do or not. I took college entrance exams less than 3 years ago so I remember those vividly but nothing online really compares the two as it states that they're two different beasts. If I attend graduate school, my plan is to graduate with my bachelors, get another internship in the summer before I start grad school, and then come back for graduate school.

&amp;#x200B;

If I dont attend graduate school, I am looking to go full time. I don't have as much experience as my peers since I am graduating early ( 2 internships versus them having 3 ). I want to be competitive but it feels really hard at the school I attend. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's even more confusing because our career fairs are in September and I don't even have to apply for graduate school until November. I don't know what to tell recruiters I am looking for without rambling like an idiot. I feel like asking for an internship is the safest move but I don't know what to say in a concise way if they ask why I'm looking for an internship after I graduate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I am just very confused and would appreciate all help and advice."

&amp;#x200B;

I got accepted into a very good PhD electrical engineering program and I was wondering whether I should join this lab I've been eyeing for some time (in fact, the very reason I considered this university). My ultimate goal is to go into industry.

I was wondering if r/gradschool could pitch in as to whether these ""initial"" observations of various PIs are good indications of a successful PI-student relationship, or if it's something only a rotations program can address. One important detail is that I'm coming in with a fellowship, so I am essentially ""free"" for whatever professor I choose.

1. First PI (one I'm thinking of working for) is heavily connected, tenured, ex-industry guy. I reached out to him many months before the application deadline. Leads a big academic-industry consortium. Several people at my industry internship have heard of him. Does research in areas that I'm really interested in. Has tons of funding, publishes a lot, goes to the top conferences in the field. His students however work very hard; 60-80 hrs regularly, even more before big deadlines, but they think of it as loving their (numerous) projects so much they willingly do it. He travels a lot as you'd expect, but one of his students says the PI still has reasonable availability, and the older students tend to mentor the newer ones anyway (this particular fact was true in my industry internship as well). The PI even told me, in person, that he could have an army of students with his funding, but he chooses to have less to be able to spend time with them. I know the most about him, his students, and his lab out of all my options, and so far in my vetting I still feel like he's a strong choice, plus I got along with him and his students well. He suggested I join his lab ASAP so I can begin taking part in his big academic-industry consortium, which he claims provides networking opportunities only his group can provide.
2. Second PI is a newer, untenured professor who reached out to me. He will actually be joining around my 2nd semester of grad school. His work is quite related (though not identical) to that of the first PI. He is also ex-industry. Him and the first PI actually plan to work closely with each other. Since he will be starting up, I'll be a part of setting up the lab and everything. I've only spoken via e-mail and voice, and so far he seems like a nice person to talk to. I don't know much about his expectations regarding student work schedules, and I only know one of his students by name. 
3. Third PI is another newer, untenured professor, but he is already on campus. I met him in a one-on-one during accepted students day. His work is more of a blend of materials science and electrical engineering, but still highly relevant. This guy knows several of the professors from my undergrad institution. He was a soft spoken person who wants me in his lab. I am not sure who is in his lab, or his expectations of student work schedules.

There's another guy who reached out to me who is also new, and while he was pleasant to talk to about his research and as a person, his work was considerably out of my element and I'm not sure I'd want to add more complications to my movement in graduate school. 

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is I have several options, and I think one way or another I'll collaborate with them in some capacity during my long journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I start asking questions to other PIs to help ""balance"" the amount of information I have for each one? Or should I take a different approach?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

I had been dead set on doing my Masters right after undergrad for the longest time, until the rigor of junior year burned me out to a level I was not expecting at all. Grades are not an issue (I still have a ~3.8 GPA), but I have no research experience, nor do I really have much interest in it (I was going to be doing a non-thesis Masters anyway). I have also not started studying for the GRE, but I’m not as concerned about that, as I’m usually pretty good with standardized testing.

Meanwhile, I have had two internships, and while I didn’t necessarily hate either of them, I didn’t love them enough to consider myself being happy at either company full-time. Although I haven’t started applying for full-time positions yet, a good few of the positions I have seen that have piqued my interest do prefer a Masters degree. Despite that, I still don’t really have a clue on what area I’d specialize in for graduate school, and I’m afraid of getting into a field and realizing it’s not what I’m really interested in.

I’ve seen a lot of advice on here suggesting to work for a couple years to get a feel for what I enjoy and then using tuition reimbursement through my employer to fund graduate school. If I went to graduate school right after undergrad, it would be on my own dime (because non-thesis), but with significant assistance from my parents. However, I’m almost certain that once I start full-time, I’ll never have the drive again to go back to school for an advanced engineering degree, although I do plan on getting an MBA down the road.

I don’t see myself being an engineer the rest of my career, and would ideally like to move into management within the next 10-15 years. I’ve seen a mix between MBAs and MSEng degrees among my managers and higher-ups over my past two internships (and some with neither), and I don’t know which would be more advantageous.

Sorry, this is a lot to unpack, but it’s been a dilemma I’ve been delaying for the longest time, and now that I’m at the point in my career where I actually need to make a decision, I’m completely stuck."

Here's a very small practice project using the Flickr API [https://flickr-api-b58c6b.netlify.com/#/](https://flickr-api-b58c6b.netlify.com/#/) it's not the best but it helped me practice and learn new concepts.

So I am 17 years old and I applied for an art internship for the first time ever. I later went to the applicants day at the beginning of June. About a week later I got an email that said that I got a personal interview. Unfortunately, I was hospitalized so it had to be rescheduled.
I went in for the interview the day after I was discharged and I made sure that I was smiling and that I was dressed really well. All in all, I was prepared.

The interview went extremely well until they asked me if I considered myself a planner. I answered no and even went as far as calling myself disorganized.

I’m from Houston so they asked me if I preferred Denver or Houston and why. I said Houston. I do like Houston more because I have had a really hard time living in Denver but I didn’t want to say that so I said that I just didn’t feel like people felt as much unity and love in Denver compared to the love and pride felt in Houston. They ended up telling me about how much they loved that city and were clearly annoyed at my answer.

I asked them some questions about the program and then they said they would contact me no matter what mid-july to let me know if I should apply for the other internship. I’m not too concerned about this because I was told something similar on the applicants day.
A day or two later I realized that I forgot to tell them that I am able to make it there on time because I go to an online school in the afternoons so I sent them an email that said that as well as a thank you for being flexible and motivating me to explore more of Denver.
The lady I was trying to contact was on vacation and I had no idea if she had seen the email when she got back because she never responded. So I sent the email again yesterday but the email was bounced.

Aside from what was said here, the interview was amazing. I answered the questions well, I was prepared, and I made sure that I did my research. However, I am afraid that I ruined my chances with this interview because of the things mentioned here.

 This is really messing with my anxiety to the point where I'm having trouble with sleep and I keep replaying the whole thing in my head and I'm checking my email way too much. 

Did I mess up my interview badly? Does anybody have any tips for managing the anxiety?

 I've posted this in other subreddits but I haven't recieved anything super useful so I'm hoping people who can relate can help me out a bit better."

  The work itself sounds really interesting and it's doing something I have a lot of interest in, and during the interview the description of the jobs seems like I would be happy in(albeit difficult/hard work), but the pay seems low, like ~73k a year, I wouldn't have issues with housing/etc because I live with my parents in the general vicinity.


Is it possible for me to negotiate with the staffing firm?  Any thoughts on if I should I take the job and keep applying or turn it down?

I've done one internship for 9 months before a couple of years back so I have very little experience."

Haven’t posted here before, but always lurked trying to find good advice. 

I just graduated with a BA in Computer Science and minor in math from a small/relatively unknown liberal arts college. I did pretty well academically (3.5 major GPA), however because of many constraints I never got a chance to intern during my 4 years. (Also worth mentioning I’m an international student, which means I’m currently under OPT).  
I have worked as a T.A and ran study groups for the CS department and also worked for the IT department at the school. 

I sent a decent amount of apps (~200) and got about ~10 interviews back in March/April. However, no success in landing a job. I’ve been putting a lot of work in mobile development (swift and native iOS) recently and just created my portfolio. 

I’ve been approached by multiple companies that offer training and project based employment in return for a percentage of your pay and a 1-2 year commitment to the company. However, I feel like I don’t want my first gig and resume to be attached to some sleazy company with bad rep and shitty management. 

I need some advice on how to move forward in the best and most efficient way possible (I have 3 months to land a job). 

Feel free to ask more questions and thank you!"

We need a good, clear communicator (written and spoken English), and coordinator with a minimal personal agenda, who seeks mutual growth for all and is able to make a long-term commitment to the primates and the staff. The Pacific Primate Sanctuary Internship is an in-depth, all encompassing, immersion experience. This is more than a full-time position and includes on-call duties. The Sanctuary does not offer summer, or other short term, internships. A one-year commitment is requested. 

The residency requires a self-starter and hard worker, someone who is humble, compassionate, self-reliant, organized, professional, computer literate (Mac), open to learning, capable of problem solving and completing a task. We need someone who can function independently as well as in a group. Our Resident Intern would need to be physically fit, with no communicable diseases or criminal record, who would enjoy a rural lifestyle with simple amenities. PPS welcomes international applications; citizens of foreign countries would need to secure their own visas and permits independently.

The internship is organized into three training modules. The first module focuses on animal caregiving (providing daily care, preparing food, cleaning enclosures, administering medications, providing enrichment, and nurturing to 40+/- monkeys), an introduction to primate behavior, facility maintenance, and documentation.  Documentation responsibilities include: data entry (Mac- Excel, Word, Mail), PPS Manual updates, record-keeping, independent literature research, providing shift reports including the medical status of each animal in the SOAP format. The second module concentrates on emergency care and behavioral conditioning. The third module focuses on colony management, volunteer training, and an independent project.  The Independent Intern Project is an opportunity for advanced study in a chosen area, depending on an Intern’s skills and interests.

Pacific Primate Sanctuary is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit organization. Our staff is made up of 3-7 local volunteer caregivers, 1-4 resident Interns, and an off-site support system of veterinary and other professionals. Since the wellbeing of the monkeys is our primary focus, they are not on exhibit, the facility is not open to the public and they are not subjected to any medical research.

As a result, our organization is not eligible for funding from any governmental agencies nor do we receive funds from admission, as would a public zoo. Therefore, we must rely solely upon donations from compassionate individuals and organizations. Our operating budget is extremely small. Financial independence for personal expenses is required (estimated to be as low as $35-$50 a week).

We provide a fully furnished and equipped 24-foot Yurt or a 16-foot Yurt (traditional round structures designed specifically for tropical living) and utilities. Interns and volunteers maintain an on-site organic garden and fruit orchard. The Yurts are adjacent to the Sanctuary on a large piece of rainforest property with a separate bathroom facility. You would be trained by experienced members of our staff in all aspects of New World primate care (Callitrichidae, Cebus, and Ateles) and may become eligible for certification as a Primary Animal Caregiver.

Please begin making application for the position by submitting the following: your letter of intent, resume/CV, and, three letters of reference (from instructors, employers etc.).  All documents should be sent via email to [pacificprimatesanctuary@gmail.com](mailto:pacificprimatesanctuary@gmail.com) as they become available. "

$1000-$2500, United States

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\*

Realistically, I would want battery life and specifications more-so than 2-in-1 but I would not be opposed to a 2-in-1.

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*

Not the biggest factor, but still wouldn't want it to be too clunky.

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\*

I can have Windows or Mac. Would need to use bootcamp to switch between Mac and Windows on a MacBook because of specific programs.

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*

13"" - 15"" 

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*

I'll have to use some programs related to engineering (CAD, Matlab, etc.)

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*

Games: I play some Rocket League, Borderlands and indie games which aren't too intensive, so basically a powerful enough laptop to run those, but I want to be school focused rather than games generally, but still have some power. 

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*

I really like a good keyboard and wouldn't want to skimp out on one. Really, I just want a laptop which has a reliable battery and can last me a long time without needing to be constantly cared for with replacement parts and such. Finger print reader would also be nice. 

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\*

I have been using a MacBook Air for an internship this summer and it has been my first experience with an Apple laptop (or generally an Apple device that isn't an iPhone) and I've been pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to maneuver through the different tabs and windows you have open. I am not sure whether I would want to give up on Windows though because there would be more programs suited for engineering on there. But, then again, I could always go to a computer lab to finish work or even on my own PC. 

I've been thinking about the Dell XPS 2-in-1, Windows Surface Book 2, and the MacBook Pro a lot as well as others which have similar specs (Nvidia graphics, &gt;=16 gb ram, etc.), but I'm still unsure which is the best for me and if there are other/better options for my needs. Also, no gaming specific laptops - don't like that style. Thanks."

I'm trying to find out if this is logical financially for me. My choices are: 1. Take the job, move into an apt and pay rent, utilities, food..etc based off an 11/hr salary. Or 2. Move home with my parents, find a similar job (hopefully) and live rent free until August. 

My issues are if I should risk finding a job similar to this and move in with my parents, or take this job, and live off of roughly $500 each month after bills.. not even ounting in what my credit card bills are.

I know that currently its not so easy to get a job as a junior developer from a coding bootcamp compared to a few years ago.

I’m a medical professional earning $82K before taxes in CA. That rounds out to be about $4000 per month. I have 5 days of vacation that accrues 1.6 hr every paycheck (biweekly). Sick times accrues in the same way. HMO health insurance. No vision. No retirement besides a very ambiguous shared 401K which from talking with other employers adds up to be about  $600 per year...

Our work times are 8:30 to 5:30 PM with an unpaid lunch. Only the actual day of the holidays are paid. Have to use your time off for days like Dec 25 or before or day after thanksgiving.

No travel or work events. Just see patients everyday and a half day of admin on Friday afternoons.

Was promised commission for selling medical products but for the past 6 months we haven’t hit the numbers.

For my Christmas bonus I got a gift basket with popcorn and two movie tickets. 


The year before I worked as an intern earning a $25K stipend. Had to pay a ton of taxes after receiving my 1098. Was considered a self-contractor. 

Couple of questions:
1. Do you think it’s worth staying at? My boss is super cheap. He in fact actually brags about it. Is always harping on our staff about staying longer and never states if something will be paid for. We always have to ask. Such as whether if travel expenses like travel to and from the airport is covered or if we need to use our time off if we are going to mandatory training.


2. If I’m exempt salaried, can someone help me clarify that:
Since I’m salaried, I don’t get rest periods
I must work at least 40 hours.
If I leave early, I have to use my accrued time off. 
That I can’t take a long lunch if I only get 30 minutes.
Sometimes I just feel like I’m being looked at like an hourly employee.

3. Friday is a short day where we close at 4. Except for me it’s my admin time in the afternoon. If I’m working 8 hours (not including 30 min lunch) M-Thu but 7 hours on Friday, am I fulfilling my minimum hours as a salary employee or am I actually underworking by only working 39 hours? My work is always finished before the end of the week and usually daily tasks that need to be done are done everyday.

4. Last detail: my contract says that I need to give a 60 day notice if I resign. If I put in my notice, and they want to dismiss me earlier because they think “there’s no point in having me around” is this legal? My contract says that both parties need to give a 60 day notice but I don’t know if the law works more in favor of my employer and if they can just make up a reason to let me go sooner to spite me.


Thanks for any help you can give!!!"

Any tips, advice, or questions I should ask? Please and thank you! &lt;3"

I take Data Structures and Algorithms Spring 2019. I recently learned that interns are recruited in the fall semesters.

&amp;#x200B;

I have decent knowledge of linked lists, BST, big O notation, arrays (2D, dynamically allocated, etc), and briefly touched stacks and queues. I have no knowledge of hash tables.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about 1 month until summer ends. What is the best way to prepare?

I was thinking of just practicing a list of the top 100 problems on leetcode, or maybe using AlgoExpert to get a video of the top 70. But for me to do this, do I need to have a stronger grasp of data structures and algorithms coursework first?

&amp;#x200B;

If so, what is the most concise, no fluff, fast resource to catch me up with the data structures I need to know so that I can begin practicing leetcode.

&amp;#x200B;

Current plan: 

1) Take and finish Algorithms 1 course by Princeton at Coursera to learn data structures

2) Learn the top 70 problems provided by AlgoExpert.

Is this a good use of my time?"

Before I received this decision I was planning to attend Boston University for computer science but now I am questioning myself at the last minute if I should switch and attend UMD. I know UMD appears to have a higher CS ranking than BU but I am not sure how that actually translates to the quality of the undergraduate program and other factors such as location, housing, and internship opportunities. With BU I received a decent amount of financial aid and scholarships but I would still end up having to take out some loans. UMD has much cheaper tuition even for out of state but I doubt I would receive that much if any financial assistance this late. Would really love to hear some thoughts on those who have transferred into UMD or any other information about the CS program in general and if it is worth changing at the last minute."
cfkmrc,5,2019-07-20,I got a job offer that I had to reject.

However, my current employer is not aware of any of this. Can I still use this offer to negotiate a raise even if I've rejected it?

Is it too risky? I'm a bit afraid of them saying no, but still having to stay and potentially damage my relationship with the company.

EDIT: Maybe it's worth mentioning: I joined during an internship at university and continued with them since I graduated (I'm 24 now), as a full timer.

EDIT: Maybe also worth mentioning: I work on the IT &amp; software development sector (the new position would bump me from developer to engineer, hence the pay increase I guess..)."

I didn't go to a major CS school, completed one internship at a big company, and have essentially one or two major projects. After applying to a few jobs (in Europe and US as a US citizen) I recently got a call request from a recruiter from a large company I never thought I had a chance with (Europe). Other than this, I've been applying to/interviewing with startups.

Here's where I'm conflicted: I believe I am about to be offered a job at a startup that I like a lot, and even if I don't get an offer I'd need to keep interviewing/start somewhere within 2/3 months (money reasons). But, like a lot of people, I'd kill to work at this large company, especially in another country (language is a big passion of mine, and I would like to eventually move to become fluent). I also know I'd have to study a ton to pass any sort of interview there.

I don't want to let any opportunity go to waste, and even though it is just a phone call, I'm afraid I won't have the chance in the future. Is it a horrible decision to pursue other jobs knowing I would leave if I got an offer? Is it realistic to start a new job and study to be ready simultaneously? Am I totally overthinking this because it's nowhere near an offer?"

In short, I need to put my nose to the grindstone right now if I want anything resembling a career. 

I'm currently unemployed and on benefits, have a masters degree in music production and sound design that I finished last year and aiming at sound design and music in the video game industry as a long term goal. I'm currently lacking in a few essential skills, namely those relating directly to the gaming industry and sound integration. I spoke to a job counselor, who assured me that it was still too early to look outside my field of study for work i.e. service industry jobs and should keep trying for a career in my field for a little longer. From my current situation, my plan is as follows:

1. Practice sound design to picture, build a portfolio website using demo material and use that to create clients, specifically in commercial and marketing(but not limited to) where there's most money per second. This is my day job(not getting paid yet), and doing this because it's more likely that I'm able to get paid work doing this faster and the experience is still relevant to my long-term goal. 4-5 hours every day.
2. Study game engines/programming/scripting and the audio middleware that's used in the industry, eventually start doing demo-projects that can showcase in-game sound design and integration. This is done concurrently with 1. 2-3 hours every day.
3. Build a music portfolio specifically aimed at typical music used in different genres of games. 2 hours every day.
4. Apply for internships at game studios offering my skills/time for free in exchange for experience and network in the industry.
5. Backup: Apply for part- and full-time positions for instance in the service industry that require no prior experience or degrees.

I'm doing these things by myself for now, and have very little contact or feedback from anyone, much less from anyone in the industry, so I can't help but feel that I'm being a little ambitious or optimistic that this will work out. Am I missing something? Am I being too optimistic?"

I'm running on HDD as of now and  am getting SSD atm. 

As 2020 versions of these softwares are being released, 8 gb RAM is a min requirement. Should I just get more RAM (Max is 16 gb for my laptop)?? Or should I get a new one?? Getting an upgrade now would mean I would have to break the bank and I'm unsure because I plan to use for like 3 more years. 

P.S: The laptop that I used for my latest internship was a company provided one with 24 gb RAM and talking to my overseeing engineer, it sounded like that was the usual standard of laptop being used. Don't know much about it. So any field specific tip would be nice.
Edit: Perfectly fine with no touchscreen or 2-in-1 features. Any OS would do. No gaming no video editing.

My job has flexitime - You can come in any time between 8-9:30am. You just stay the full 8 &amp; 1/2 hours as usual to whatever time that works out at. So if you come in at 9am, you're in till 5pm. Very simple.

However - I cannot, without becoming stressed, start at a late time because NO MATTER WHAT I feel like I'm working for 10x the amount of time just because I started later and have no energy by the last few hours.

If I come in for 9:00 and finish for 6:00pm? It feels like I'm working a 12 hour day. I have no clue why - the extra half hour kills me.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is, I'm an intern, and I was 'advised' (essentially told, not a choice) to do the 9-6 so I can get a bit of experience with the international work they do (time zones blah blah). On top of that, I've not told them about ANY issues I have. I've suffered with ADHD and OCD all my life and the past experiences I've had with telling my place of work about these things have not ended well - read: judgement and treated not-so-great.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a note written by my doctors about my issues, but am scared of giving it to my work. But this late start is killing me, as silly as it sounds, and I'm not sure what to do. Should I tell them?

So I'm 17 and I'm Romanian. I'm kind of considering Scotland as my main option for studying abroad. I'm in High School at the moment, and in September 2020 I'll be taking a Computer Science program. I have the CAE exam passed so language isn't a problem. Since I have a B2 (almost C1) level in French and a B1 level in German, I'm also considering the respective countries. But for the sake of the topic, I want to talk about UK. I'm NOT considering England because of the expensive tuition fees. Scotland got my attention because of the many good universities in Computer Science.

1. What are some good Computer Science universities in Scotland, considering not only the education, but all the factors: the students, the place, the expensiveness of living there etc.? I'd like my 5 universities that I choose to range from really good to good, so I can have a few backups. The reason I'm also asking for the place to be friendly is because of my depression, and there's no doubt that studying abroad will affect me, but I'm certain it's better than staying in my country.
2. What can I do to heighten my chances of getting in? I'm going to do an internship at my mom's company for a month (related to computer science), so I hope that'll help.

I'm loving the place where I intern currently, I do a lot of work on super interesting stuff and I have detailed and thought provoking discussions with the full time employees, made insights on their processes and offered ways to improve (and took my advice!). I almost never have downtime, but that doesn't mean I'm forced to work at a fast paced, it just means there is always something to do. All the employees in my group are very knowledgeable and is happy to answer questions and have discussions that can go on for hours.
My supervisor encourages me to take on side projects and supports me however I can and always makes time for a discussion, and him and everyone else I work with are incredibly smart people that have accomplished great things before. 
I mostly do lab work that really picks my brain and forces me think about how to approach the problem, and almost everything I do has some link with what I've learned in college, so I definitely feel like my education has been validated.

Also, the intern events are awesome! There are so many company sponsored events and they always a great selection of food, activities, great people, and most of time, alcohol haha.

Now at Facebook I have coworkers who have focused their whole careers on operating systems, networking, product development, etc.

Long time lurker of this subreddit. I have always enjoyed the topics covered here, and the heaps of help that so many of you are willing to offer.

I'll try my best to structure this in an easy-to-read format. Oh, and thank you for reading. Thank you, so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Background/College: I recently graduated from a small college and majored in Computer Information Systems. I was deadset on getting my NET+ and CCNA this year and working for Amazon, but life and necessity happened. My internship and college work experience constitute a mix of working at a help desk, an ERP intern, and at water solutions/fluid engineering firm. I've also worked in logistical and completely independent operation positions in my four years at school.
* Current Role:
   * How I got here: I moved to a city with a dense population to follow my girlfriend. I came out here and couch surfed for a few weeks before finding a job and place, graciously provided by very distant family members. I fault myself in not looking longer for a job, and making a leap. I wanted to work and be where my significant other was.
   * What I do here: I work as a medium between customers and stately entities to issue loans, ensure stately compliance, and take on issues with stately entities that can be highly complex and require long-winded resolutions. Our office manager was recently alleviated of his duties, also leaving me to constructing office IT solutions and maintaining decent infrastructure. For the most part though, I serve as our (small) company's point of reference for difficult and technical questions that require in-depth knowledge of these products. I regularly use BMS and DMS systems like salesforce, R1, REGUSA, DealerTrack, and Vitu to ensure that compliance is robust, and hey, it's easier than doing it by hand (sometimes). Anyhow, I've gained a wealth of knowledge on how to use, maintain, and train other folks in using them. I'm not sure how relevant this is, but I'm trying to make it seem like I've kept up *some* technical knowhow. 
   * Why I want to go:
      * My pay was lowered after nine months of working. I have asked colleagues if they see any reason for this, and they are incredibly alarmed. It was approx. a 10% drop. 
      * Toxic workplace culture; this may be the easiest reason to justify leaving. Talking garbage about customers, lack of pay, incorrect pay, etc. 
      * Turnover rate; 97% of the folks I've worked with have left, one fired. 
      * Lack of growth; I've been recommended by my direct manager for a promotion a few times, but nothing has come of it. They shifted my schedule so that I now do not have a normal weekend, in order to accommodate for this. But no promotion has been given, and talks have ceased about it.
      * Lack of pay; My pay has been incorrectly calculated each month I've worked here, and have needed to advise top-level management to fix it, and pay out the correct amount. 
* Where I want to be:
   * I want to be in a group of folks who not only care about the product they maintain, but also care about each other. I don't need you to be my friend, but I certainly do need you to be welcome to the idea of a new teammate. I think the structure of ""keeping a smile on"" really puts me into a motivated, professional mode where I can exceed my normal metrics and push myself to go further.
   * A group that needs a technical advisor or manager, but doesn't need them to code. I've fancied C++ and a bit of HTML/CSS, but couldn't write you a line to save my life. Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree, as this is likely more of a technical engineering or product/UX role. 

All in all, I guess that my life is just missing the structure that a job *could* bring to it. If you'd all be so kind to at least give some input to where you think I could land or take off towards, anything helps at this point; I've been so indecisive about whether or not leaving is a good decision, and want to hear if you folks may have a suggested remedy, or just a few cents for me to take in. Thank you!"

This is going to be a long post explaining my full situation, I'd be really thankful to find some good advice, and thanks in advance  


  
So, I'm still an undergraduate, **majoring in Computer Science**, I should graduate next year.  
I graduated from the **Android Basics Nanodegree (Native Android Mobile Development) - Udacity**, and I have a background in **Machine Learning**.  


  
Before the end of the last academic year, I sent my CV to multiple companies to search for a summer internship opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

  
One company, X, called back and **I was accepted** after an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I started the internship program, but I found out that they were going to train me on **Web Development** for a month and a half, and for the other month and half of the program, I'll be, *allegedly*, training **Mobile Development using Flutter**, and maybe I will have an opportunity to work on a **Machine Learning / Data Science** task or two. *-- (The internship program will be 3 months total)*  


  
However, after 3 weeks of the internship, this was the case:

&amp;#x200B;

  
\- I was training on front end (**AND I HATE FRONT END DEVELOPMENT**)

&amp;#x200B;

  
\- I learned about some NoSQL technologies like MongoDB and Cassandra etc.

&amp;#x200B;

  
\- AND: **Another company, Y, called back and requested me to make an interview with me for an Android Native** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Development Internship**, *I love Android Development and I'm positive that my future job will involve some native mobile development role.*

  
That was the straw that broke the camel's back as they say. I apologized to them as I already started with the first company, X. But I hated my self after.  


  
**Reasons I wanted to stay was** that I knew lots of people where I'm currently having my internship and that I was kinda learning something new, BUT the things I was learning, they were not of **great** value to me, especially Frontend related stuff. I knew I will never work as a Web Full Stack Developer or a Front End Developer. I did not try Backend Development but I tried some DBMS and I did not have any issues with it, in fact, I loved it.  


&amp;#x200B;

  
**Reasons I hated my self was** that I thought that I was wasting time in my current role, especially that I'm commuting every day so I have no time to learn anything else while at home after I finish my day. **I'm also enrolled in a Udacity Scholarship, Machine Learning related and I literally have no time to progress in it,** which is killing me furthermore.  


  
I'm crushed and I don't know if what I'm doing right now is the best choice which is:

  
\- Learn some **Backend Development** until the first half of the program finish

  
\- Learn **Flutter** in the second half of the program

  
\- Leave the scholarship opportunity behind due to lack of time and power to learn.

  
I asked some senior engineers about my situation, and they told me that ""I'm still young, and I need to have a background in multiple fields before I graduate.""

&amp;#x200B;

  
I'm not sure if their opinion goes along with my situation.

cfqrb8,0,2019-07-20,Questions to Intern Manager: Make me look unqualified?,rasperrylinux,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cfqrb8/questions_to_intern_manager_make_me_look/,"Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

Was recently accepted into a nice internship in my hometown I'm a bit nervous of course when I'm sending emails and cautious about what the underlying message could be. This is because my major is Computer Engineering NOT Comp. Sci., hence, I feel a bit inferior when asking about things I don't know. This team member hired me and was there during the interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Anyways so here is the message. Basically I'm requesting to be on a specific team. 

 

*Hey, \[SE at company\],* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Hope all is well.  I've been reading up and doing most of what you outlined for me. i just had some questions that I thought I should ask.*  

*... (other technical questions)*

&amp;#x200B;

*Maybe the intern teams are decided but, can I request to join the Java 8 team? If its possible, I'd like to work with Java as it is my most comfortable software to date. I've also been practicing unit testing. It would make my transition a lot easier. Though, of course I am open to \[other languages @ company\], but Java for me would be most optimal.*    
*Let me know what you think!*

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think the intern teams are decided as the internship starts in fall. Does this request make me look unqualified, or is it just something that will just slide over the SE's head? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: Confused if I should send this message because it makes me look unqualified."

I have wanted to study abroad for a semester, although my changing of majors and difficulty getting courses to transfer has left me unsure of the possibility. I am entering my 3rd year (I'll be graduating in 5), so classes are becoming more and more specific. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I have been considering trying to find an internship program abroad for a summer. I have yet to complete an internship, but I have a good GPA. Have any of you had success in finding an internship like this? I imagine I'd be limited to English-speaking countries (I'd lean toward the U.K if this is the case). Is it worth it, or does studying abroad prove to be a better experience?

I’ve been going over my app, and the level of commitment in my ECs worries me. A pretty sizable chunk of my ECs started during junior year or the summer (probably 5 out of my 10), and to make matters worse, not many of them have much time commitment (think 2-3 hours a week for most of them). My question is- how much will this hurt me? I hear that a lot of students have their “awakening” junior year but I don’t think my ECs have enough time commitment. Other than the time commitment, I think my ECs are pretty good (BSA Senior Patrol Leader, 3 internships, nonprofit cofounder, hapkido blackbelt, editor-in-Chief, practically guaranteed class prez, research starting next week, and summer programs at T20s.) Will this be too much of a detriment?  Thanks for taking a look!"

I never thought of them as anything more then a great pass time to get my head off of things. However, recently, I’ve been scouted, recruited, whatever you want to call it. However, don’t think this is the only route to a star athlete. With my stats, I would rather just go to college and live life, and maybe get a scholarship for my merit. For a student like me, being recruited has no natural advantage to me - a student with high stats. Sure, a classmate of mine has been recruited by Wake Forest, and another by Vandy, however they both have aspirations of going pro, and how much school will they really be doing? I’ve been offered spots to T-30s and other colleges, but looking in, I wouldn’t be receiving the proper education that is necessary for the field I’m going into (Political Science). Seeing my friends who have spent all of their time on Sports, while I’ve had time to Model UN, NHD, and other various clubs such as FBLA. Overall, I see being an academically solid student with good EC’s having better opportunities with their achievements then a recruited athlete. Talking to many athletes, they simply don’t get the internships or opportunities. Why? Time constraints. The sport, while giving them an opportunity to the degree, gives them nothing to internships or opportunities outside of campus.
I’m posting this because I see lots of people complaining about how they wish they were D1 Athlete Capable. No, you don’t. Do not think you are at a disadvantage. Find clubs you love, and get involved. It looks just as good (what does an athlete have if they aren’t getting recruited) and is topical to your major. You are on an even playing field. Complaining about it wouldn’t help anyway."

However recently I've been wondering if i should have chosen CS straight up. I'm not too worried because I still do lots of software but I'm unsure as to what career path I should take. 

I've heard that embedded applications doesn't pay as well, and right now I'm considering the following 4 paths:

1. MBA - I want to make money like everyone else but I feel like I'd not enjoy my work as much. 

2. I'm fascinated by economics, stocks, etc and think it would be really cool to work on modeling. How hard would it be to get into finance to be able to get a job like this? Would I need an MBA in finance?

3. CS Masters - I love learning and solving problems and would love to learn more about AI, But idk if I'm smart enough for a PhD. 

4. I just finished a software internship at a renewable energy company which makes hydrogen fuel cells and am very interested in renewables. To me, this one stands out more because I'd feel as if I'm making a positive impact in the world. However, I'm not too sure how much software will play into this field. I also expect some sort of green revolution to happen eventually, whether through policy or once the tech finally becomes cheaper than fossil fuels I expect a boom. Nonetheless, it still is probably my worst financial option. 

Thankful for any advice."

I'm in a very confused position right now.  I did my Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering and I currently work in the Semiconductor industry in a reputed company for over a year now and have a fair deal of grip over my domain of expertise at work.

Rewind a couple of years back - I've been a software guy at university, I was proficient in programming, was an Android dev - have ~10 apps in the Play Store, did an Android intern as well.

While VLSI requires my electronics knowledge, there seems to be only little freedom/creativity in terms of the work done in the industry on the whole (just my feeling, could be wrong). All creative stuff seem to be done by 20+ years experienced legends while others just implement it. It still requires a great deal of knowledge though, no doubt.

Software on the other hand seems a lot more flexible and has room for creativity at all levels in the industry. I'm kinda inclined to it, have been learning other CS fundamentals on my own.

I kinda like where the EDA Software industry is positioned here - it is in VLSI as well as the Software world.

I'm kinda confused what to do this stage. Stay in VLSI or move to general Software or move to EDA Software?

Or take up research roles in either of the domains to satisfy my thirst to do something creative?"

&amp;#x200B;

I lost both parents when I was in high school. I was lonely and considered ending it all more often than I felt optimistic about living a life they'd be proud of. I was raised by my aunt and uncle who peaked my interest in medicine. My aunt is a doctor and my uncle always reads about new advancements in the medical field and loves to share all the things I could be doing with a degree. Fast forward to now, they paid for tutoring and helped me get into medical school.

&amp;#x200B;

For our first year, we were allowed to pick a subject of any choice and do deep investigation and run trials on it. Even if it was something wildly optimistic like curing Alzheimer's or eliminating the need for sleep. I chose to find a way for humans to live longer. My college either found programs which would take students in for a semester-long internship or they would have students work with medical professionals through our University. This was mostly so students could get a glimpse into what it is like for medical professionals to look into a problem and attempt to find solutions. Luckily for me, there is a company (which I cannot name) that is looking for a way to extend the length of human life. They took me in and showed me the ropes.

&amp;#x200B;

The first day, I learned about all these chemicals, oils, extracts, everything they've been testing which has the possibility to extend or benefit the quality of life for people. A lot of the cures are for end of life patients that may want an additional year or so on earth to be with their families before passing. My team that I was added to was three months from testing a new chemical they'd spent the past year developing. I mostly sat in the back and watched the team discuss the positives and negatives of each chemical and the possibilities of them either combining or neutralizing each other when put into one treatment method.

&amp;#x200B;

Late one night, I read a lot about some remedies that have been recommended in India which have been used by people that lived late into their nineties and early hundreds. I brought it up to the team and they were skeptical at best. They heard about it before but it was still dangerous as there had been no clinical testing done on it. I told them perhaps we could do some tests of our own on it and see how it went; it was agreed we'd start on mice.

&amp;#x200B;

The drug was administered to a group of 20 mice and another 20 were given a blend of the medicine they'd created. These mice were pygmy mice, (which have a lifespan of two years), that had just turned two years old. Of my 20 mice, 18 lived for a full six months while only seven of theirs lasted the same amount of time. My internship was supposed to end just before we finished the testing but they all agreed it would be best for me to stick around and I was offered a part-time position at the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

We noticed some small side effects in the mice which didn't appear too bad at the time. My mice were very active at almost all times of the day and they needed half the food and water that a normal mouse needs. We assumed my approach gave some nourishment which kept the mice from overeating. The thing about testing on mice is that humans eat and drink a lot more, so this would be about the equivalent of a human skipping a meal, which isn't uncommon already. 

&amp;#x200B;

We found a man who was willing to try my remedy and we began administering the drug to him once a day for two weeks. He was not supposed to die anytime soon, rather we were just giving him small doses to make sure it was safe. All was well for the first four weeks, so we upped the dosage 50% for two weeks. He noticed that he was sleeping less after the increase which prompted us to lower the dosage again. He was on the medicine for three months with no side effects which we counted as a big win.

&amp;#x200B;

Our next patient was a guy who's kidneys failed completely. He had stage-end renal disease and his body was rapidly declining. We offered the new drug to him which he was very optimistic to try. He was only 36 years old and I knew he wasn't ready to die. I got to run the experiment as the lead.

&amp;#x200B;

We gave him the same low dosage that the other subject was given but it wasn't enough for him. He was still in pain and didn't notice any benefits from it so we upped the dosage. After that, he mentioned that he felt younger and had more energy but he was still having issues from the renal disease that were making life difficult. My team could tell the medicine was helping him and after much deliberation, we upped the dosage again. The man, on double the dosage we deemed safe, felt great. He said he would wake up early and do some light cardio to start his morning, have a coffee, which is bad since it's a diuretic, and report to his dialysis. Everything was looking good which gave us a lot of hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all took a turn when we found out his kidneys went from losing 80% of their functionality to 95%. The doctors couldn't believe that his body was only 4-6 weeks from completely shutting down and he was living like there was nothing wrong with him at all. We reached out to them and told them about the remedy we had him on and they were shocked. They wanted to buy it off us right then and there for their own research but we declined. Then they tried to hire me, but I knew if the testing we'd been doing was a success, I wouldn't need to work much longer. People who create medicine usually have life made once it's commercially available.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was great for my patient until he started taking more than our dosage recommendation. He came in for his weekly checkup and looked horrible. His eyes had deep bags around them and he had lost 9 pounds in a week. He said he could only sleep two hours a night at most and he could barely eat. On top of this he couldn't feel pain the same. When asked if he was serious, he punched a metal door and looked me dead in the eyes saying he couldn't feel it. We told him to only take what was recommended but he wouldn't listen. He wanted to live, and my medicine made him feel better, but he needed more and more to keep the feeling. We started dropping off daily doses at his front door to make sure he wouldn't overdose on it like he previously had instead of giving him a bottle with a week's dosage. What he started doing was holding onto about 3-4 days worth of doses then taking them all at the same time. I wish I would've known this earlier and we would've started administering them in person daily. 

&amp;#x200B;

This continued for three more weeks before we stopped hearing from him. We couldn't reach him but his wife came in to talk to us. She begged for us to stop giving him the medicine and we agreed to, seeing there was a serious problem. After a week without us giving him medicine, he came back and agreed to stay in our clinic and allow us to monitor him for 24 hours a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

We administered the correct amount every morning and allowed him to eat, sleep, exercise and browse the internet from our clinic. If he needed to go anywhere, one of us would go with him. Everything was going well until one night when I was watching him. He slept for a half hour before waking up and clawing at his eyes. He cut deep gashes into his cheeks and screamed that he was scared. I tried to restrain him but he was too big for me to hold down. He ran to our lab area and found our sterile scissors and began cutting himself. I called my coworkers and they rushed down to the lab. By the time everyone was there, he'd cut into his wrists so many times we could see bone. It was the most horrific sight I'd ever seen but he couldn't feel it. His screams were from the terror of not feeling it instead of pain. He began questioning if this was real life or if he was in hell. We finally restrained him but we were sure he was as good as dead. We bandaged him up but he lost a scary amount of blood. He somehow lived through it and went back to sleep. We all agreed to stay there for the night and my coworkers slept in the bunk area. He woke up an hour later and told me the voices in his head wouldn't let him sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked what the voices were saying but I couldn't believe what he said.

""You're supposed to be dead."" and ""Let me take you already."" were what he heard. Over and over he heard this. 

&amp;#x200B;

We agreed to stop giving him the treatment. Clearly whatever we were giving him wasn't safe for humans. We kept him for screening even after we stopped but it got worse. He tried to hold his breath until he passed out just so he could sleep. He wouldn't eat anything for days at a time. He heard voices every day and would beg for us to put him under just so he could rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, he broke out of the restraints and attacked my coworker. He grabbed a butter knife out of our break room and sawed at his throat until he cut through his windpipe. We were called and rushed to the clinic to see him sitting down in the kitchen. He had his throat cut for nearly 10 minutes by the time we got there and he was still alive. It wasn't a clean cut, but this would've killed a normal person by then. I asked him why he did it and he claimed the voices told him if he didn't die soon they'd be there to take him themselves. We called paramedics but he died in the ambulance ride to the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I quit my job. The gashes, screams and bloodstains on the floor were too much for me. They weren't looking into my remedy anymore and were certain it was stupid to let a college student lead an experiment of this capacity. I hope that chemical never sees the light of day again."

cfx63x,0,2019-07-21,I'm not sure am I cut for algorithms,wabhabin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cfx63x/im_not_sure_am_i_cut_for_algorithms/,"Hi. So I'm soon-to-be second year student in CS. I'm planning to go for masters either in algorithms/something algorithms related/cyber security. Why? I like (well before this wee I though) solving problems, especially those in the realm of algorithms. Currently I'm doing a basic summer course in C just because I have enough free time with my current internship. 

Last week what should have been at max \~80min assignment took me over nine hours and required my friend to hand held me through it. Assignment was a really, *really*, basic function which splits string a according to a delimiter string b. I must have tried maybe seven or eight different solutions, all too complicated and not catching the general principle behind the task. And this is not the first time something like this has happened: implementing a game of life on C took me again over to supposed time limit and required hand helding from the same friend. 

It seems I constantly gravitate towards poor, complicated and subpar solutions. For the record, the assignments which take me five to nine hours have taken a small fraction for my friend. He finishes them easily under an hour. Even faster is he's really at it. Any time there's anything regarding algorithms he just gets it. Funny enough, he *hates* algorithms yet he's naturally really good at them. Ironically, I like (well I guess I liked) algorithms yet they are really unintuitive for me. It just doesn't come naturally. 

I've had the same issue before on our other programming courses which involved algorithm/algorithms like assignments. Then I supposed the struggling was due to lack of experience. Now after all the practise I've done when I still find myself struggling on basic problems, I'm convinced that the struggling is due to lack of intelligence. I can see no other factor why, even after practising algorithms my freshman year, I still struggle enormously on basic problems. And this has lead me to think am I cut for algorithms? No, I don't mean *can I complete the required basic algorithm courses in current program*. Of course I can (though it will require more work than for the median student). What I'm doubting is my ability to succeed a) on algorithm master's program b) on the field. Even if supposed I finish all the courses in algo master's program with grade which will enables me to finish the program, is there any practical reason to follow something you like when you clearly lack the natural aptitude for it?"
cfxfax,2,2019-07-21,Image Processing- What's the best open source software?,aewm96,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cfxfax/image_processing_whats_the_best_open_source/,"Hey folks, I'm looking into an image processing project for my internship and I'm curious if anyone here has dabbled in image processing yet?

Ideally what I'm looking for is software that I'm able to code to allow numbers to be read of the picture. So far I'm looking into the Magick package with Rstudio, but it seems like a superficial editor (cropping and resizing etc). I'd love to be able to make matrices from the images and then run equations with the numbers. 

I think openCV would be good for this but I'm curious if anyone here has had experience in this?"
cfxt5y,2,2019-07-21,Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science vs Graduate Apprenticeship in Data Science,Xanimede,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/cfxt5y/artificial_intelligence_and_computer_science_vs/,"I will be starting my undergraduate degree in the University of Edinburgh this September. I'll be studying Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.


This is a 4 year bsc degree, you can see the [degree program table here](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/utaicsc.htm). This degree has no placements (guaranteed work), and it's up to you to find internships.


A few days ago, we were emailed by the uni to let us know of a graduate level apprenticeship in data science.

This is also a 4 year bsc degree. The first 2 years are the same as any degree, but you have a guaranteed internship during the 2 summers. The last 2 years are split into study/work. You study at the uni in your first semester, and then work the 2nd semester and summer until your 4th year begins. [This is the degree program table](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/utbscdatsc1f.htm).


There are only 13 places available, and you have to go through the assessment process. I am afraid this is all I know about the program. I don't know the hourly pay rate, the company, location, or whether the contract is obligatory (usually you can change your degree after your first year).

I am not particularly sure what I want to do after I graduate. I am interested in doing a msc, and going a more research oriented route, but I'm not *strongly* inclined towards that path. I can easily change my mind in the future. 

I feel that I can steer my degree more smoothly while studying CS and AI, but doing the graduate apprenticeship is limiting to data science.

On the other hand, almost 2 years of work before you graduate is great experience.


Opinions?"

My current student visa expires in January 2020.

I've been searching for a job for a while now and the problem i encounter the most is eligibility due to my Egyptian citizenship as I need a sponsorship.

How do I best go about getting a job here?

cfzu3z,16,2019-07-21,I never thought I would be deciding this.,2kinfinity,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cfzu3z/i_never_thought_i_would_be_deciding_this/,"Disclaimer:  **mentions of suicide, mental health, and abuse**

In the past 2 years, I have attempted suicide a few times. I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital twice during my first year at university and because of a necessity to focus on physical and mental recovery, I took a leave. At first, I wanted to start over at this Canadian uni this fall and start Year 1 again (my records were wiped clean). But, I didn’t realize the severity of what’s going on and I’ve since realized I am incompatible with that institution.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR (sorry this sounds so mopey): I never thought I would have made it this far, never mind thinking ahead. Now I don't know what to do. My depression and PTSD are still severe and my anxiety disorders ain't going away. In the very short time I've become stabilized, I've matured a lot and am slowly becoming a person.

&amp;#x200B;

**Brand New Me’s objective**: **Apply to Canadian/American programs this cycle (2019-2020) or next cycle (2020-2021)**. Demographics if needed: &gt;!18, female, POC immigrant, low-income, first to graduate high school, arts school w/ 2000 students and no AP/IB. !&lt;Canadian ones probably are like McGill, Western, UOttawa, Carleton, maaaybe Waterloo. American ones are **T20 schools**.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s what I am confused about:

1. ***Grades/transcript.*** Before shit hit the fan (like Grade 10), I had a 4.0 gpa. After I became severely depressed/suicidal, my grades slowly dropped- eventually, my marks were in the 50’s - 60’s in Grade 12.  Same for uni (now wiped). My doctors told me that I should have sought medical help during high school due to the severity of my situation and accessibility. I didn’t tell anyone at all then for reasons I don’t wanna share. I squeezed through Canadian admissions in 2018, but ofc my ignorance and stupidity won’t fly now. There’s important classes that I bombed - most importantly, Calculus, Biology. I'm worried they'll think I'm lying and think it's just a bad senioritis excuse. **What can I do about my embarrassingly bad marks or am I fucked and am now a dropout? Also how does one do AP tests as a high school graduate?**
2. ***Extracurriculars.*** Quit most of them when I started to be unable to shower, sleep, eat, etc. I can list what I continued in HS and did in uni if needed. I’ve started volunteering in low-anxiety positions and will start working with a social initiative project. I am slowly coding and writing and making art again and I hope I'll do projects, freelance, and do publications. I would love to try more high-stress stuff along the line (lose weight and marathon, internships, travel, research, lobbying, etc). **Any advice about ECs? Should I skip and apply next cycle to find my footing?**
3. ***LORs.*** I’m not in high school anymore and the teachers I knew well have disappeared; probably to some secluded hermit island. There’s nothing in the prepscholar guides or even CC for this - what should I do?

Some part of me wants me to wake up and realize there’s no point in being optimistic *for once* and taking a shot. There is a fat chance after applying that I’ll crash and burn and go in a spiral, yes. I'm not asking you to use my mental health struggles as an excuse for what's on paper, but I promise that I am not lying about them. If you think my plans aren't achievable, please put me on blast.

Thanks for listening to this business pitch. Please drag me through the dirt kindly."
cg04qp,2,2019-07-21,Job search help,YamSmasher,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/cg04qp/job_search_help/,"Hello all,

In May I graduated from the University of Maryland with a bachelor's in Geography specializing in GIS/Computer Cartography. Since then I have been applying for jobs with no luck.  I live in the DC Metro area and there is no shortage of GIS jobs here but for some reason I have not been contacted by any company I have applied for. 

I've been told I have a well written resume and cover letters but I'm guessing it's the content in the resume that's lacking, though I'm not sure what. Heres what I feel might be lacking...

-No previous experience (I did not do an internship in school but I have applied for a few and haven't heard back from them either)

-GPA at UMD was 2.7 (3.0 at the community college I attended before)

-Maybe I'm missing another point?

I feel that I'm very good at GIS operation at a bachelor's level and really do look forward to the potential to learn more of the advanced stuff either on job or by attending a graduate program while also working. But maybe it's my lack of practical application experience that's got me stuck in the loop? Projects and labs are one thing but using GIS in a professional environment is something different I'm sure...

I'm not one to place the blame on outside sources, I know there's something I can improve on with my job search. Any advice? 

Thank you!"

For my final year of masters, my school selects students to enroll in  double degree programs. We had to get the best scores for that as it is highly selective. I decided to go for it, because I thought it was going to be very beneficial for my career. So I worked hard, and I got selected for a double degree program in Dublin.

After getting selected by my uni, I was informed that I would need to pay 17k euros additionally to my 10k tuitions because I don't have a European passport. Now it's too late for me to pick any other choice I could have made, such as: a normal semester exchange abroad, or a double degree in France. I have my appointment tomorrow at the Irish embassy to give my application request for the VISA, but I'm just unsure of my decision now...

I really wanted to go abroad. But the tuitions for Ireland seem insanely expensive and I worry that a double degree won't be worth its money, and not that impressive anyway. I just contacted an old friend from highschool who has a similar profile from mine, and he told me by doing the double degree in Ireland, it made it harder for him to find a job because he couldn't do the usual 6-month internship. But at the same time, I also worry that I'll regret this decision for ever if I don't go.

I've had this dilemma for so long now, and I just need help or opinions on what I should do. My brain is gonna stop working from overthinking.

I enjoy programming a lot, but still very much a novice. I’ve been interested in making my next internship be in Software or Data Engineering (I’m taking classes on Tableau and Hadoop in Fall, already had a class on R and enjoyed it). 

Any advice on how to get myself into one of those internship roles? I’m struggling to do a lot of Leetcode easy problems, but I’m practicing them and watching data structure videos to improve. I’m interested in internships such as with Capital One (they have data engineering), Merck, some financial firms (I’m a business admin minor and love talking about stocks, equities, personal finance, etc)."

I do tailor my resumes and cover letters by following a template I have saved for both and updating them based on what the company is looking for and using their keywords. I have even gone for the lab technician jobs in order to move up later but no dice.

My question is what I can do to improve myself to put myself in a position for these entry level jobs. I live in Denver but i don’t know if there is a good engineering charter to get networking done.

Is it worth it?",Victor_Pascow_Jr,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/cg53is/new_to_game_design_working_for_nexttonothing/,"Apologies for the rant, but I need some situational career advice as a newbie 3D environment artist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started self-learning 3D environment art full-time 2.5 years ago, felt ready and moved across the country to Los Angeles in the Fall of last year to ""chase the dream"" and finally, after 3-4 months of non-stop job searching, constant stress and much self-doubt, landed a 3-month unpaid internship with a small VR studio that just ended at the beginning of June. Afterwards, the studio liked me enough - and the feelings were quite mutual - that they offered me a paid project to be completed in three separate phases, which was to be completed by early October. I can't discuss the details of the project, as I signed an NDA, but suffice to say, I am recreating a large-scale environment based off a real-world location from American history using whatever reference images exist from that time period.  


I am about a month into the project, I spend about 12-14 hours a day (finally took my first day off yesterday because I was so mentally drained) and I am feeling extremely burnt-out and feeling like I made a huge mistake. The pay situation is honestly quite terrible, it's barely even enough to pay my bills over the course of one month - let alone the 3-4 months it will take me to finish - and my financial life is turning to complete ruin as a result. My mental health is also severely declining, despite all my efforts to treat it, and there are many days where I find myself constantly fighting thoughts of giving up altogether, not to mention I now feel trapped by my professional situation. It would also be nice to have hobbies/family/friends in my life again, which I have sacrificed over this idea that someone, somewhere, will see that I have four months of professional experience under my belt and deem that some significant reason for hiring me.   


At the time the studio offered me this project, my life was in check and I had a plan for how to get by the next few months despite the shitty pay. It was a sacrifice/investment I was willing to make in order to gain the experience of working in an official capacity with a studio which would hopefully pay off later down the road . Literally later that same week, my personal and financial life unexpectedly fell apart in every way imaginable and everything changed. I suddenly felt completely lost - and still do. I've since had to move back home to live with family for a few weeks while I try to pick myself back up and establish a new plan for the financial demands in my life, whilst simultaneously working remotely and trying not to let the studio down. The studio in general is composed of very cool people which I have taken a strong liking to - and thus it hurts me deeply to have these feelings of walking away from the opportunity given to me. At the same time, I feel like I'm somewhat being used and should be focusing these next couple of weeks on finding a better career opportunity, and improving the quality of my current state of mind.   


I don't know what I expect from any of you here, I guess I just need an outsider's opinion on what I should do. Someone more experienced and familiar with how the field of game development works, and who can tell me if my current situation makes sense for the benefit of the long run. Yes, I signed a contract knowing the shit pay that I would be compensated in return for my work, but that was before everything else fell apart. And honestly, it was just nice to feel recognized for once after months of rejection. Now I feel stuck and want out so I can try to put my life back together, but I don't want to be a shitty human being by abandoning a group of people who have been nothing but nice to me. I don't know if I am being unreasonable and selfish with my thinking and should just stick through it, or if I should just stick up for myself and move on and accept that I may be an asshole for doing so."

For those who are paid by hour in their software engineering internship and are contractually bound to work a set amount of hours (i.e. you can only work for 200 hours total), do you get paid for company bonding events?

For example, if the company had an ice cream social or took the team to watch a movie at a theater, would you get paid for those events? Or would you only get paid for time spent actually coding/working/being-on-task?

I'm currently interning at a relatively small software company (paid-by-hour and I can only work X amount of hours) and got in an argument with the intern coordinator. I told him we shouldn't get paid for these fun events because that just takes away from the time we could spend actually learning and contributing to the company. Besides, the purpose of an internship is to gain work experience, and unlike a full-time job, we're only here for an extremely limited amount of time. Shouldn't we be able to make the most of it?

I'm genuinely curious to see how other companies operate and whether you guys get paid for having ""off-task fun"". 

(This is my first paid internship so I can't really compare it to other companies myself)"
cg5shh,2,2019-07-21,I don't feel normal without coffee,This-Is-Not-A-Drill,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cg5shh/i_dont_feel_normal_without_coffee/,"Dear /r/advice,

So, I'm a 20 y/o college student. I've been drinking coffee for the last 6ish years, from using my dad's drip coffee machine with Folger's half-caf, to now where I have a bit of everything coffee-related in my dorm. In the past, I'd mostly drink coffee to try to get a mental boost or to help me focus. No judgment at all to those who drink coffee daily, but I choose not to drink coffee every day because I don't want to burn myself out on it - I don't want it to stop being an enjoyable thing that I spend some downtime on when I want some self-care. Having my morning cup of coffee is something that doesn't fit in my life.

Here's my issue, for the past 5ish years I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and major anxiety, and I've handled it through talk therapy, without medications. For a while I used medications, but a psychiatrist that didn't listen to/believe me ended up making me feel that it wasn't the right path for me. Freshman year of college, I was downing coffee all the time, and I was probably more productive than I've been in a long time. But towards the end of the year, I started getting ridiculous headaches - like debilitating ones where I had to miss class. Eventually, I realized that I was over caffeinating myself, and going through ridiculous caffeine withdrawals. This last year, I started limiting my caffeine intake a bunch, and while I felt better / got fewer headaches, I also lost a lot of my energy and motivation, and I had a noticeable drop in grades, and I've found no enjoyment in my internship either. I thought it might be that I wasn't enjoying my coursework, but this summer I've realized that if I don't have coffee, I'm just not interested in anything at all. Once I get the energy in my system, I want to make music or do research or talk to people, but without it, I just want to lay in my room and watch youtube. I can't even read or watch a TV show or movie cause it feels too mentally draining.

Obviously, this is a byproduct of depression, but I'm not sure where to go from here. I don't want to be addicted to caffeine just to feel normal, but I also don't want to feel like this every day. I'm thinking that retrying medication maybe my best course of action, but that was such a rocky road originally that I don't know if it's worth going through that again. Plus, I don't even know if my family can afford it, and that's not a discussion I want to have again.

What do you guys think I should do?"

cg63q0,1,2019-07-21,Electric Engineering Project Help,OptimisticFuzz,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/cg63q0/electric_engineering_project_help/,"For my internship I am currently working on an electronic fixture. This fixture, which test a motor, was created in 2013. I was tasked with making upgrades on this fixture. Firstly I checked over the schematic to make sure it was a proper reflection of the actual fixture. There was some connection that had been made in the last 6 years, so I made those changes to the schematic. The main part of this fixture is a relay board. On this board are 40+ solid state relays. What I am doing is replacing this with two separate boards with 16 elector-mechanical relays with an Arduino hooked up. 

Now, on to the actual problem I am having.  I need to power this relay/arduino system. An individual relay in this system has a coil voltage of 5V DC and a coil resistance of 178 ohms. Thus the coil turn on current is 28 mA. Multiplying that out by 16 relays, each relay board requires 448 mA. We also need to power the  Arduino. I am getting conflicting answers on how much current an Arduino actually needs. I am going to be hooking up wires to the Vin and GND of the Arduino, which has a max current of 500 mA, as I am told. I am 'hijacking' one of the power supplies already in the system. This power supply is 15 V. Thus I found an adjustable voltage regulator. So from what I was told it did not matter how much current was fixed to the regulator, since the boards would only draw as much as it needed? I think that is incorrect though. I had a 5VD regulator system that was fixed at 4 A. I hooked this up and it burnt out two ICs on the relay board which I am in the process of replacing. It should also be noted that I am planning to hook the 15 V power supply into the 5V regulator, and from there split it off into 3 separate lines for the Arduino and relay boards. Will this divide out my current and make the system? Or should I get a voltage regulator fixed at 1.5 A?  Does the Arduino actually require 500 mA?"

cg6iqe,0,2019-07-21,Should I ask for a raise?,devmandude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cg6iqe/should_i_ask_for_a_raise/,"Hey /r/cscareerquestions,  I graduated from UF with a cum laude bachelors in Computer science last may and have been working for my company for a year now. I accepted my only offer, from a non-software fortune \~250 company in FL for 63k without negotiating because I figured bargaining without any leverage would not net me any gain. Theres a 13% target bonus which paid out phenomenally last year, going well beyond the target. I received a 2k market adjustment around November, and a 3.5% bump during my annual review which I have to wait until halfway through this year to get. 

Beyond this job I have roughly 7 months of internship experience split between two companies, an insurance company and a startup launching an 'educational MMO'. I was hired along with 16 others, who I cant help but continue to compare myself to. There are only a select few with any meaningful internships, only one other person has a computer science degree, and non of them seem to really stand out. I try to be humble, but a majority of these people aren't in the same league as me. Some have openly admitted they have no idea how they got the job and had zero meaningful programming skills. 

With all this in mind, I feel underappreciated. I'm given plenty of praise which is greatly appreciated and the positive feedback I've been provided has given me the confidence and gumption to make the strides that I have. But I still cant help the fact that I think my company is getting a bargain. I've championed an entirely new president of technical excellence within my team,  it wasn't hard, there were zero unit test cases, zero documentation, zero roadmap/plan, all in an 8 month old java project, and 'refactoring' was something you did once a quarter. I've taken up the reigns as scrum master, and continued to try to push our team towards more efficient processes all while navigating the inherent social constructs ""junior"" developers face when placed in front of a vastly senior team (10-25 year pension seekers).

I do enjoy the job. The work life balance is great, and the gigs green field development for a project due at the end of the year (that my manager has placed a large amount of trust in me for). Downsides include a rather combative product owner who I have to sit in a team room all day with and a long commute (30 mins with no traffic).

[Payscale suggests](https://imgur.com/a/BssBAqy) my compensation isn't too far off from the average, but there's certainly room for growth. [Glassdoor indicates](https://imgur.com/a/BssBAqy) that I'm under compensated and am due for a 6% raise. 

My title is currently 'Software Developer' and discussions with my manager have indicated that my promotion to 'Software Engineer' is significantly tied to this project we're working on. I don't particularly feel like twiddling my thumbs for another 6 months, though this [indeed advice about asking for a raise](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/guide-how-to-ask-for-a-raise?from=salary-search) suggests that it might be a bad time to ask for a raise since our stock just too a pretty good hit after our earnings call announced decreased volumes, despite a record operating ratio.

Tangents and background aside, should I ask for a raise or do I need to take my skills to the market? I still don't have any particular leverage, but there's plenty of interesting technologies being used around the company that interest me, however ultimately I think I will end up moving to a HCOL area to maximize my savings rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate you taking the time to read this, and any advice from those who can sympathize with my position would be greatly appreciated."
cg6y9v,9,2019-07-21,Is it appropriate to set personal/emotional boundaries within your internship?,nolite_june,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cg6y9v/is_it_appropriate_to_set_personalemotional/,"Hi everyone, I just need a bit of advice regarding my current internship position. As a quick bit of background, I'm currently in a graduate program and I am working in an unpaid internship placement under the guidance of my mentor, a post-doc, and a previous student who took on a job as a program coordinator at the site. I have been working at this internship location for the past two years and have a year and a half to go before I graduate (\~ 15-20 hours per week during the semester and 45+ hours a week during the summer and during holidays/breaks). 

Long story short, the work environment is very toxic: on top of near constant mental/emotional manipulation (e.g., frequently being yelled at, being told that our needs/concerns are unreasonable, being forced to hand over our phones so that our texts/emails can be read, and providing unnecessarily hostile ""feedback"" which is not directly work related but instead attacks on our personalities; I can give more detail on this if anyone is interested), our supervisors often threaten our placement in the program/our ability to graduate in order to intimidate us into working many more hours than are actually required for our degree (we are required to work a maximum of ten hours per week and are meant to have a lunch break during each day, but our supervisors do not allow this) and there is no foreseeable way for us to report this issue to any higher authority within the university as these threats are communicated only verbally and never though written means or in front of other staff/faculty. A previous student who faced these issues contacted the head of our program and then the Dean, and this resulted in her being kicked out of the program. Because of this, none of us feel as though we have any way to advocate for ourselves and are instead just doing whatever we can to make it to graduation.

Last week, while at our placement, it was a particularly busy and stressful day, as we had many clients, few staff members, and absolutely no guidance/direction. While in a private room (not in front of clients), I expressed my stress to a fellow student, and we had a quick discussion of how we were just extremely lost and overwhelmed. Our program coordinator overheard me saying this on the other side of the closed door and ratted me out to our higher-up supervisors, and this resulted in me being called in for a meeting. It was during this hour-long meeting that I was told that I was ""an awful role model, an awful leader, that my negativity has absolutely ruined the experience that other people in the program were having, that from this point forward I needed to isolate myself from others in order to prevent my negative energy from spreading, and that if I did not immediately change my behavior, they would ensure that I would never be able to find a job within the field.""

By no means do I think that I am a perfect student/intern: I make mistakes, I screw things up, and I have issues with anxiety (which they are aware of and have been aware of from day 1) which make things difficult for me sometimes. Despite this, I always complete my work, always go above and beyond in terms of the number of hours I work and tasks I complete, and have up to this point had not caused any issues within the placement or with any students or supervisors. As such, this reprimand was very overwhelming and frightening, and ended with me having what I can only describe as a panic attack in the bathroom (crying, hyperventilating, etc.). I am not proud of this and I wish I had responded differently to the situation, but unfortunately I can't take it back.

Following this event, the program coordinator (who was the person who initiated the whole event, and who has done very similar things to other students in the past) has very frequently been pressuring me into disclosing my emotions and talking about my feelings in regard to the situation and to the workplace in general. This is not in regard to performance - each time I ask if there is a concern with my work, and she replies that my performance is fine and that she's ""just curious"" about how I'm feeling. If I thought that this was out of genuine concern, this wouldn't be an issue, but instead I and all of my coworkers see this as a trap to get me to complain so that it can be reported back to my mentor once again. As such, I have avoided all of these questions, typically answering very neutrally.

However, the questioning has become overwhelming and I am feeling as though I'm on the brink of another breakdown every time the coordinator approaches me. It is very upsetting and it is making me feel even more anxiety about going in every day. I really want to set some boundaries, but I'm not sure if I can or should. I want to calmly tell the coordinator that I am more than willing to discuss any issues or concerns related to my performance as an intern, but that all questions about my personal life/emotional wellbeing are off-limits. 

TL;DR: Is it appropriate to ask for these emotional boundaries? Am I obligated to provide my supervisors with information regarding my mental health/emotional wellbeing if these things are not interfering with my performance? If this is appropriate, how can I best communicate these boundaries without being attacked again?

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read all of this.  I know that it likely sounds very overdramatic and petty, but I'm at the end of my rope and I just don't know what to do anymore."

Around 2 days ago I had a small spill on my laptop (the thing being spilled was some weird mixture of alcohol and milk that I wasn't aware off, and the bottle shook around a bit and I spilled them over a small area of my laptop). I immediately soaked and cleaned away as much liquid as possible with a damp cloth as soon as it happened (I did not inverted it or turn it off since it was quite small, and I did not know that it should be the safety precaution that I should have taken. I know, pretty dumb). It's 2 days later and the laptop seems to be working fine, with the exception of a few sticky key that I tried to clean underneath with some thin isopropyl cloths I have handy.

However, I read some more about the possibility of corrosion caused by sugar and other things in the drink, and I am paranoid about my laptop being destroyed. For more information, it's an HP Omen. Would I be able to remove the keycaps and clean the inside more thoroughly? I cannot take it to any repair shop right now because I am doing an internship in China and will be here for another 6 to 7 weeks. What are the steps I can take to prevent further damage? If something happened, would it damage my keyboard only or my entire laptop? Should I try to remove the keyboard away from other components of the laptop?

Thank you..."

Built a Robotics arcade game that helps teach english to students diagnosed with dyslexic and went out and got ppl to use it for extended periods of times. PATENT pending on this. 

Built a computer programming talent search website to find and help talent across india.
When I went out to teach the underprivileged programming, At first I thought they were really bad at coding. After week of teaching they would use the for loop for a decision making statement(instead of if). After a period of analysing their mistakes, I realised that they were having a really hard time with syntax than they were with logic! They were having a tough time with big huge English words, as that wasn’t their native Lang. That was great. I decided to come up with a Java layer, with special syntax which allowed these students to write code in Hindi and then my program would convert that to java and run the code. If  ==  ugger, etc. BOOM! Several could code now! I also created an image processing app to allow children to draw a flow chart on paper and then convert it to code by clicking a picture of it. This allowed 10 kids to share one PC!"

A little background i'm from one of the top 10 universities from my country and my i'm majoring in psychology which i choose back then since my parent want me to go to college and our family economy aren't that good back then but now it's a bit better. 
Back in HS i'm more into tech and programming but since both of my parents are from management and marketing they don't understand much about my interest and think any major i get in college is fine and any job will take anyone regardless of degree as long as i pass the skill requirement.

Now since i'm about to graduate i'm rethinking about my career path.
My current path is, after graduate i will work in Human Resource types of job either in govermental or private sector. I still think that this path is good but i don't think i will be able to achieve higher rank in this path because i'm quite shy and not that good at talking to people but i took a few internship to hone my skill in the HR job

The other path is i want to take a coding bootcamp class since i've learn a few programming language like python and java and i think i can make a career in that type of work and i know a good coding bootcamp places in my country that can help me achieve that.

So what should i do what the best path should i choose

I have also attended a hackathon and have a good gpa, so would that be enough or do I need to prop up some more projects?

 I mostly have experience in C/C++, so I'm thinking of maybe also creating a calculator that can process compound mathematical equations, since that would be a good showcase in the OOP skills I've learned, but is that too generic?

Gender: Female 
Would like to have 2 kids a few years apart 

Looking to go back to school in fall 2020 (will be 31) and was wondering if anyone could share their experience on when they decided to start a family and how that affected their time either during their MBA program or after at their new job. 

My general concerns are if we start trying now, I could potentially end up having a new born in the beginning of my program which sounds like a terrible time to not be sleeping through the night and potentially be experiencing hormonal mood swings as my body tries to get back to a normal equilibrium. All the while in adjusting to being back in an acedemic setting vs the work force. 

Alternatively we try and have our first child during the program but my thoughts are that by this time I should have a routine in order. And I'll still be getting no sleep but at least I'll know what I'm up against at school. I should add my parents are planning to move to San Diego once I have a child so they will be able to help. 

My issue with waiting until after the program is that it seems like there's quite a bit of focus within the program to get set up with a fitting job when you graduate. From the networking events to summer internships, if we wait until after I graduate to have a kid, wouldn't it be s to land a great opportunity, only to have to leave a few months in? And maternity leave doesn't kick in until you've been at the company for a year so if school starts in fall 2020 and I'm in it for 2 years, and spend a year working before going on leave (all assuming there are no issues with conceiving) then I'd be having my first child at 35 and my second closer to 40, which doesn't feel ideal. 

Seeking advice from anyone who's been through this or knows someone close who has. 30 year old woman going back for her MBA, can't be the only one trying to figure this out."

cgbj21,2,2019-07-22,[Computer Science/IT] PhD or Employment ?,troyoo,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cgbj21/computer_scienceit_phd_or_employment/,"Hi everyone, 22yo French guy in need of some advice here.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated from my Master in Computer Science and Operations Research, a domain of computer science focusing on optimizing diverse problems like task planning, supply chain design, routing and even armament. It's not that relevant to my problem though. After feeling really bored and unhappy during a previous internship in a ""standard"" IT company (Web dev, Android/iOS, ...) I swore to myself to always improve technically and learn new things, because stagnation lead me to boredom and unhappiness at work during this internship.

&amp;#x200B;

To drive away works such as my preceding internships, that I could've done with my skill set from 3 years ago, I wanted to do a PhD, making me improve on both a technical and theoretical side. I am no theoretician and don't wish to continue in academics (I want my work to be mostly applied, while challenging, academics' pay is low and administration is hell), so  I searched for applied PhDs, in partnership with enterprises with the goal of going in employment after that. Note that getting a PhD helps to get in better positions but comes with a pretty low salary increase

After a few months of search I am presented with two PhDs, one of which involves algorithm design and Machine Learning, two domains I want to combine because I believe it has potential.

To summarize, doing a PhD would mostly be for personal pleasure, to work on a high level subject for 3 years, conclude my studies by not being able to go any higher and flatter my undersized ego.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, the company I work at for my end of studies' internship is one I could very well wish to apply to in the future. It's not perfect (but who is ?), but they are pretty close to the type of work I want to do, or at least have the potential to allow me to work on such problematics. And they made me a pretty good proposition now that the internship is coming to an end, with a great salary for a beginner engineer (4k/year gross more compared to my friends going in more standard IT enterprises and only 1k lower than a colleague with a PhD in the same enterprise), but I am afraid of stagnating in the coming years, and this emotionally paralyses me, despite knowing that it would be the same anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Pragmatism tells me that going to this company is what's best for my career, and  the few persons I talked to told me that in my case, a PhD wouldn't be that useful, and that I should reach for the occasion I have before me, but I wanted your advice on PhDs, what you got from it, and how you'd react to such a dilemma. I'm torn between pragmatism and the attractiveness of the PhD offer I have before me ..."
cgcvqo,12,2019-07-22,Computer science student needs advice...,cspp034,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/cgcvqo/computer_science_student_needs_advice/," Hi, I'm a CS student from a top university in my 2nd year. I have read in some places that GPA doesn't matter when looking for a job after graduation (as SWE at a top company), and it matters only when applying to grad school, which I'm not interested in. So my question is what should I focus on instead of GPA to improve my attractiveness on the job market?

Projects? Open Source? Internships? Or maybe GPA is the most important and I should focus on that?"

cgdhco,3,2019-07-22,"Can't focus on a career path, three options lie ahead in medical field.",SubjectDelta28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/cgdhco/cant_focus_on_a_career_path_three_options_lie/,"I'm a Limited X-Ray technician. I can basically do a good chunk of what a full Radiologic Technologist (I'll abbreviate to R.T. from now on) can do, except I can't give I.V.'s/Injections/ect. I want to further my education, but I have three options within the medical field that appeal to me. Each goal more expensive, more time consuming, but more rewarding at completion than the last. But I am about to be 30 in December, and I have two kids (5yr M and  7yr F) and my husband and I eventually want a third child. I feel very constricted by wanting to have a career I love, make more money for my family, but also be around to enjoy having a family. Here's the options that I have thought about and want to choose between: 

Goal #1: Full R.T.  This degree would take 2-4 years depending on which school I go to. Since I'm already a practicing Limited Tech, this would be a breeze for me, least expensive and would mean roughly a $10,000.00 raise minimum in salary. I could also take extra schooling and branch to other imaging specialties. It would also mean more job options,because some states are ""phasing out"" Limited techs. This is easily obtainable, and I want it. But I also feel like I want more than this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Goal #2 Physician's Assistant. This would take me about 7 years. 6 of schooling, 1 year clinical rotation. It would cost a minimum of $80,000.00 starting for school-but my salary would put me in six digits. About a $60,000.00-$70,000.00 raise in my salary. This would be my ""settling"" goal. Not the one I want the most, but would be a half way point to my dream goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Goal #3 (The Big Kahuna) Radiologist (M.D.) This is the goal I absolutely dream of, a full blown Radiologist. Ever since I started taking my x-ray classes, I dreamed of being not only a person who could take pictures of the bones-but also be the one reading the images. This is the goal that if someone said, ""I'll give you a full ride, don't worry about any school expense!"" This would be it. Schooling for this bad boy is about 13 years. 4 Years college, 4 of med school, (If I get accepted) 1 year of an internship, and 4 more of residency. This would mean about $200,000.00 per year salary at the beginning. More experienced Radiologists can make about double that. I want this one so bad, but 13 years is a lot of money and time away from my kids. If I started right this fall, my daughter would be 21 by the time the 13 years was up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make more of myself because I feel I can at least do the bare minimum and get my full R.T. (I chose limited over full at the time I first started, because limited offered night classes and it worked with my schedule/husband's school schedule/ husband's work schedule). I feel very scared of making a wrong choice now, because I want a secure future that I can provide more stability with for our home-but I want to make sure I'm there for my kids as they grow up. I worry about spending 13 years of tests, long nights, and lots of time away from them-but they would be able to go to whatever college or trade school they wanted to with my/husband's full support. But I also worry about hitting my 40's and thinking, ""Wow, this is all you've done. You were capable of more."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Any career advice from an outside point of view would be welcome."
cgdnjb,35,2019-07-22,Wiki Project: A Community-Sourced Guide to Academic Majors,Wicked_UMD,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/cgdnjb/wiki_project_a_communitysourced_guide_to_academic/,"Hi everyone!

Hope you’re having a great summer - be safe and stay hydrated! This has been an idea a long time in the works but I haven’t acted on it til some of our younger mods reminded me of it. A little over a year ago, /u/Zippotro created a [guide for Electrical Engineering majors](https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/79anud/ee_tips_and_stuff/). We thought this was a great idea and a fantastic contribution to the community so I in turn made one for Economics……. and then never really posted it. So here we are. As the moderators of the community, it’s our job to set the example for our wonderful ReddiTerps and give you guys the resources/organization and use our omnipotent mod powers to do FEARLESS things like create a guide out of the goodness of your hearts. Today, we do that.

So here’s the plan: If you are an upperclassman or woman, or a recent grad, and you need something to do today while stuck inside due to the oppressive heat - shout it out in the comments. You don’t need to be an expert but I just need you to stay involved through the whole process. Also don’t worry if someone already grabbed your major, there’s still a way for you to help! Once you’ve got a solid rough draft, create a post just for your guide, take feedback, and make revisions. Once you’ve got a finalized draft we’ll post it to the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/wiki/academics). 

We’d like to roughly use a template.

* Start with an **Overview** for someone who may be interested in your major. Talk about the skills, talk about the courses, talk about the career opportunities. Any important tracks, focuses, or key details. 
* Then cover the **Required Introductory Courses**. What classes you must take, what you should know about them, what you’ll get out of it. Anything that will come back in the future. Usually these classes are pretty well established and once students clear this they are generally locked in on that major. 
* Next get into the **Middle and Upper Level Courses**. These are generally electives, some are more important while others might be a waste of time. Since these are more apt to change maybe we should talk about them more as generalities than what classes are currently good/bad. I’ll leave it up to you if you want to break it 300/400 level, each major will likely be a bit different in structure. Here is probably a good place to cover internships and preparing to join the workforce or look at continuing education.

I might be a little outdated so someone whos been through it more recently, let me know if I'm behind the times anywhere or help me fill in more details. After graduating, I got a job as an analyst and am working on my masters in Economics so my perspective is biased by that. Here we go.

**Overview**

Funny thing about economics here, it’s actually a fairly small number of students who enter UMD as Economics majors. However on graduation day it is one of the top-5 largest majors at the university. Economics is a great combination of statistics and analytical thought that is complimentary to so many fields which makes it a popular double major and gives you a foot in the door to many different career fields.

With that in mind, there are two different tracks designed with two different career goals in mind: the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Sciences (BS). While the BS is more statistics heavy and more rigorous, I would not recommend it for just anyone. The BS requires Economics student to take Calculus 1 &amp; 2 as well as Econometric 1 &amp; 2. It’s a gauntlet and will do some damage to your GPA if you aren’t a math-oriented person. It’s difficult to even know how employers, looking at only a resume, would differentiate a 3.2 BS vs. a 3.4 BA so don’t let prestige be a deciding factor. I do think it will better prepare you if your goal is to get a PhD or you desire to work in an honest-to-goodness economic field, like at the Federal Reserve. 

On the otherhand, the BA is designed with a bit more of an applied focus (maybe aspiring for an MBA/masters degree) and greater flexibility meaning those that might join the workforce in a kind of analyst role. In the BA, you have a much better opportunity to double major or take a broader array of studies. For this track however, I highly recommend still taking Econometrics as regression analysis is essential in almost any field you will enter. I would also recommend being sure to come out of college with strong Excel skills and a passable knowledge of a stats package like Stata or R. The important part about taking the BA is that you come out with some hard skills to show employers.

As an Economics major, you won’t get all the same benefits as someone in the Business school. Just know that you will have alot of competition in the job market and you need to have something that makes *you* stand out. Consider anything that touches data, don’t hone in on one field. Even within the government they hire economists or analysts in almost every bureau. Hunt for internships with governments, think tanks, private equity, etc and foster those connections in the field because I personally have found that is the best avenue to a future job. I’d also recommend trying your hand in the workforce before going for an advanced degree. Employers will often offer education assistance but it will also give you a chance to explore what you like before dropping a ton of dough or getting in over your head.

**Courses**

**Introductory Courses**

Economic courses for first and second year students are largely theoretical and are actually fairly self-contained. Hopefully most people will find them pretty easy as the concepts aren’t too crazy. Introductory Micro/Macro and Intermediate Micro/Macro cover the basic academic understanding of the field. Understanding supply &amp; demand, tax policy and externalities, monetary policy and more are foundational to everything you will see in the field but the actual concepts don’t usually pop up in future courses. Theory just isn’t too valuable until it’s backed by empirical data which gives answers that are much more complex. 

Just to give you a taste of the issues we wrestle with: “Minimum wage increase will reduce employment”. Not that simple! Labor movement is not free or easy (job searching, health care, etc) which allows employers to hold down wages below their theoretical market value. Service industries that tend to pay minimum wage can not just replace labor with capital. Marginally attached workers might see the opportunity cost of a job as more valuable than $8/hr but could return to the labor market with a wage increase. That’s not to say employment doesn’t decrease because in general it should, but there are multitudes of reasons why it does not always play out like it ‘should’. In the past Economics used to be very theory driven but in the era of big data the field demands that you prove it.

With all that said, today’s Econ majors need to be prepared for math that goes well beyond Y=C+I+G+NX. Calculus has applications on the theoretical side so a good understanding of that will help you out in intermediate and advanced micro/macro courses. If you chose the BS track, you will also get a trial by fire in Calc 2. The real money maker though is statistics. While the class doesn’t always apply to economics, your best chance of finding a job after college will utilize stats extensively. Pay attention too as econometrics will build off of this. 

**300-level Electives**

The 300 level courses tend to be more on the non-technical side with a slightly more real world application than the intro courses. While the offerings are limited, here I would recommend finding the classes that most interest you and if you get a chance to write a paper that might serve as a writing sample, make sure to knock it out of the park. If you can use this to land an internship in the field (which in economics is not an easy thing to do, in my opinion), that could potentially lead to a career straight out of college. You should really be thinking about this starting sophomore year because by the time junior year comes around it might be too late to start looking. Another idea to keep in mind is that the Agricultural Economic program offer some classes that can double for economic requirements and plural society general education credits. All in all, I don’t think these courses are that great but they come in a pivotal time when you’re past the beginner stuff and need to serious consider your next two years.

Now is about the time you should really start sinking your teeth into the field too. You should have some familiarity with Excel formulas but there is so much more to that program and you should be building models for almost anything you can. I don’t care if you download historical baseball player contracts and the GDP deflator to calculate everyone’s average annual value in current year dollar terms. Learn some more formulas like Lookups and IF statements. Maybe you’re into the stock market and want to calculate the descriptive statistics of some portfolio compared to the S&amp;P 500. Get exposed to FRED and IPUMS-CPS for some macro/micro datasets. Download R or get Stata and start dabbling in data management, analysis, regressions, and visualizations. Read NBER working papers, CBO reports, BLS data, FiveThirtyEight/Upshot articles. 

**400-level Electives**

400 level economic courses are where the classes finally get good so make sure you take advantage. Firstly, irregardless of whether you are on the BS or BA track, you should take Econometrics. Almost every data-related position you will consider will require these skills so while it’s a difficult class it will probably be the most important course you take. Two other things you should keep in mind are further developing technical skills in Excel and Stata/R but also taking a course that allows you to write an economic paper that can serve as a writing sample.

The thing I would recommend against is continuing to taking too many further theoretical classes. I took Game Theory and the logic is really fascinating but I don’t think I will ever directly apply skills I learned in that class for the rest of my life. I would say that you should have a good idea of what field you are interested in entering and be sure to have a solid understanding of it. General economic knowledge is just not that practical in the job market, you need to focus on technical skills and research experience.

**Beyond**

As I have mentioned, achieving an economics degree opens many doors but it doesn’t set you up for a specific career. For that reason, connections and networking are a big part of the job searching process. I also would typically advise against immediately pursing an advanced degree. If a doctorate is your dream, you might be best served by getting a research assistant position at an economic bureau where you can get experience and quality recommendations. If you wish to join the workforce, you should be willing to consider a broad array of fields - essentially anything that includes the word “analyst”. I always say that an economics major in DC is a dime a dozen so you need to have something that makes you stand out from the pack. In most analyst roles you will be looking at data and learning how to present it, but employers often provide education assistance for something like a master’s degree that can help you further advance your career. 

Many employers don’t expect their fresh hires to be advanced users in any programs so just be someone who is eager to learn something new. Having a broad foundation is a great start, especially to get yourself in the door. Excel should be your bread and butter so get comfortable in that program but specific software beyond that is going to be specific to the field and company. Just demonstrating that you are a willing and able learner is important, which is why I encourage you to self-teach yourself some new skills any chance you get. In addition, you should be confident - confident in presenting material, speaking in front of higher ups, confident in yourself. A huge part of the field you are about to enter is convincing others of what you already know. People skills, work on it! Good luck!

**Resources**

Databases  

* [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) - an aggregated database of macro information. It’s basically the go to source since it pulls inflation, GDP, exchange rates, unemployment, interest rates, and even price indexes from BLS or stock indexes from Dow or S&amp;P. It also lets you visualized the data, make transformations, and more. You can get an API key to pull information directly into Stata and Excel too.
* [IPUMS CPS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/) - A resource to download census and related survey data in a micro format. This is where you get the data to see how education, location, career field, race, gender, etc predict income or something like that. Run fancy regressions with all the controls.
* There’s alot more but these are the two obvious ones.

Software

* Excel - a spreadsheet program which lets you run mathematical formulas and other operations. The idea in Excel models is that cells link together so one value is changed and it effects all the “downstream” cells. It’s alot more than just a calculator so learn it good cause it’s used everywhere. People love Excel junkies.
* VBA - A coding language in Excel. You don’t need to learn this for most jobs but it’s a good introduction to coding languages in an environment that everyone uses. Can be helpful in automating reports or tasks.
* Stata - it’s currently the go-to statistical software of economics. It can handle alot more complicated data management and analysis, and you basically create a scripted Do file to run most processes. It’s somewhere between a modeling program and a coding language once you learn how to use it right. 
* R - probably the future of statistical packages. It’s open source (read: free) and has tons of addons that give it features beyond what Stata can do. The popular addon R Studio basically makes it work like a Stata clone, however the language is more complicated so I would argue it’s a tad harder to learn. You might not use it in classes either but you should be aware of it. If you’re self-teaching, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) is an open source book written by the authority on all things #Rstats. Did I mention free?
* SAS/SPSS - other stats packages no one really cares about but are sometimes used. Alot of workplaces have licenses for all the major programs
* Python - a general coding language that is becoming super popular. Can do most of the things that R can do but doesn’t have the same intuitive interface or quite as good data viz packages. If you want to learn coding as an economist beyond VBA, this is where you should go.

Blogs/News

* [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com) - a data journalism outlet that primarily covers sports and politics. They do a really good job of presenting data in a comprehendible way. They also have some code and datasets on Github.
* [The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot) ($) - a New York Times blog that uses data when looking at politics and economics. They have a super cool live election tracker but they also cover economic issues in a thoughtful way.
* [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) ($) - a magazine that covers international politics and economics. It’s not usually the most in depth articles out there but it is a great source to keep up with the world at large.
* [CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/) - Congressional Budgeting Office. They do cost estimates and analysis of policy and government. It’s a non-partisan organization and gives incredibly deep but also comprehendible papers on tons of subjects.
* [NBER](https://www.nber.org/) - National Bureau of Economic Research. Non-partisan non-profit that hosts economic working papers. Not usually as painfully technical as published articles but tons of high quality research is on that site.
* Twitter - Follow government bureaus, non-profits, think tanks, economists, opinion writers, etc. It’s a good place to get connected with the field. In addition to writers for outlets already mentioned I’d point you in the direction of Bloomberg, NY Mag, The Atlantic, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Vox.

Other

* [CORE’s The Economy](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/index.html) - sort of a modern revision of the Econ 101 textbook. It’s an open source text book created by an international team of economists. It’s not to say Makiw’s Principles of Economics is wrong but it leans heavily into theory, while this book focuses more on the real-world application of economics in a post-Great Recession era.
* Podcasts! - Freakonomics, Planet Money, etc are great resources for learning about economic issues."

Should I email the hiring manager and/or recruiter for this position? And how should I phrase this/these email?

cggf9v,2,2019-07-22,Accepted an offer for the pay despite reviews,DonutCMe,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cggf9v/accepted_an_offer_for_the_pay_despite_reviews/,"So I was previously in a small start-up firm. It was the job of my dreams and I could never have been happier. Fast forward 1.5 years later, the company was unfortunately acquired and most of us had to move on. It was a shame but things happen for a reason, I guess.

I recently just got into a job that's from a company, well-established. Not a start-up, but behaves like a start-up. Prior to accepting the offer, I did my due diligence online and saw how horrible the workplace was. Everyone was warning people not to take up any job in this company but I decided against it and just went for it because I wanted to see how it was like. To me, I thought that experiences are all different so I shouldn't rely on these things to prevent me from trying out something new. Moreover the offer was really really attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I am, sitting up in the middle of the night, regretting my decision and wishing I had never took up that offer. It was a nightmare. I've never experienced a workplace like this - we have people breaking down almost every other day and the worst thing is their manager don't actually talk to them about how they are feeling. I was horrified and shocked to see interns getting treated like garbage - seniors are blatantly screaming in their faces for having to wait 5 mins for a printer because apparently, interns are there to do the not-so-important stuff. People are berated when they try to move out of their seats or listen to music in the office. *I am appalled.*

I feel like throwing up, stepping into the office every single day knowing that nobody wants to be here. The morale is low. Nobody gets complimented for their great work. All they get told is that they've not done enough. In just a few weeks, I've seen about 8 people resigning all at once. And because of this, my work scope has to account for all of theirs and now I'm severely overworked. I feel stressed and severely afraid that I would not execute something well knowing that 10 other huge projects are happening at once and that there is nobody else to run them except me. And this scares me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I can stay here long, but this was something I was opening myself up to when I took up the offer and I knew it. Now I regret it - I don't want to be seen as a job hopper considering I took up this job. I'm weighing my options - I could stay for a year and try to bring my value up and at the same time go insane, fall under pressure, or I could leave and find another job and possibly be seen as a job hopper. Thing is, I don't want to work for a company that finds it OK to treat people like that. It is against my values and I find it extremely difficult to continue working for a company I'm very upset with.

I am a 20 year old Software Engineer thinking of getting out in the future (within &lt;10 years, preferably &lt;3).
I am looking for better opportunities, salary, and education.

I graduated a few months ago here in Mexico, degree to be conferred probably mid-2020. My 100-point-scale weighted score is about 94. I am open to enrolling in a Master's degree if needed to immigrate.

I have been working both as an intern (1 year and a few months) and as a full-time employee(10 months) since I was studying.


Profile:

* 20 years old Mexican with another Central American citizenship. 
* Single
* No car
* Education/Experience
 * B.S. in Software Engineering with honors
 * 1 year work experience plus 1 year of internships
 * Mostly backend development (Java, SQL mostly)
* Languages
 * Native Spanish speaker
 * Fluent in English (expired 630/677 TOEFL PBT)
 * Could probably pass an JLPT N3 (Japanese)
 * A bit of French
* Finances (converted to USD)
 * $3200 in savings
 * No debts
 * Take-home salary is about $1200
 * Currently spending about $300 a month

What can I do to improve my chances? Is it better to keep working and gain experience or just save enough for a master's degree? How much would I need to save for a two year master's (probably around 20,000 USD)? Should I just start applying elsewhere?

When I mention that I want do a particular type of job, he tells me that I'm not as experienced as my colleagues. On top of that I also don't get to interview new candidates or interns!!

As a consequence of not getting good work, I don't have a good profile if I want to look for jobs. Should I look for another job or should I tell my boss that I'm not satisfied with the type of work that I'm getting?

If I achieve the GPA I’m aiming for in college first semester( 3.85+ ), how good are my chances for these schools?"
cghzjb,1,2019-07-22,My friend isn’t responding to my messages yet she acts like we are friends irl. Help.,MPYPA,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cghzjb/my_friend_isnt_responding_to_my_messages_yet_she/,"So I’m kind of in a tough spot rn.

There’s this girl I’ve known for two years (we’ll call her Stephanie). I met her through a friend (who was a junior in high school, we’ll call her Sarah). I was a senior in high school and Stephanie was a sophomore. (Stephanie is currently going into her first year of college and I’m going into my third year of college). We hit it off pretty well and we would always say hello to each other in the hallways.

I once had my mom make her cupcakes for her 16th birthday and brought them into school for her. She really enjoyed them, shared them with her other friends and she thanked me later over Instagram. Few months down the line, I asked her to be my date for senior prom. She told me she was flattered but it probably wouldn’t go over well with her parents because I was a senior and she was a sophomore. I was disappointed but it was a valid reason so I thanked her for being nice about it and we still continued to be friends.

One of the things that makes her unique is that she loves water fountains and loves being a mermaid (she has a mermaid tail and everything) So every time I see a water fountain or anything mermaid-related while I’m out and about, I would snap a pic or a video and DM it to her. She liked that I was thinking of her and has never said anything against it.

Fast forward a year, I go to my Sarah’s senior internship fair and saw Stephanie again. We all talked for a bit and me and Stephanie hugged each other goodbye (she wasn’t comfortable with hugs until this point).

During college, Sarah would send Snapchats to me with her hanging out with Stephanie and I would always reply “MERMAID!!” and Sarah and I would have a laugh about it every time. I would tell Sarah to say hello to Stephanie for me and she always did.

But after awhile, Stephanie stopped responding to my messages or anything I sent her, and doesn’t even open them. I begin to worry but I wouldn’t dare bring it up because I was worried that she might get angry at me for asking or flat-out block me (I was in an abusive friendship for four years and I’m still scarred by it)

Fast forward another year and I go to my younger brother’s senior internship fair. My young brother is the same age as Stephanie and it was grouped alphabetically. Me and Stephanie’s last names both started with the same letter so I found Stephanie there too. She was really happy to see me, we both gave each other big hugs and she showed me her presentation. I asked her how things were going and we caught up. We both gave each other big hugs goodbye and I was on my way.

So of course, my younger brother’s graduation comes along and Stephanie is there. My mom wanted me to bring my good camera (I’m a photographer during my free time) to take photos of my younger brother. She suggested I also take pictures of Stephanie too. So I did and the pictures came out beautifully. I went to find her and I did. After we hugged, I met her parents and sister and told her how awesome it was that she jumped into a water fountain in her prom dress during her senior prom and we both laughed about it. Told her I took some pics of her on stage during graduation and she told me to DM them to her. I did, and she loved the photos and responded with “Aw love these photos! Great seeing you!” and I replied the same thing.

Fast forward to now, she doesn’t even open any of my other messages despite us getting along so well with each other. I don’t send her messages very often either. I don’t know if she is the type who is really bad at getting back to others or she’s just flat-out ignoring me. And for the record, I only like her as a friend. I’m afraid to ask if there’s something wrong because I’m worried about digging my own grave.

cgjd0f,0,2019-07-22,What to take from this internship and where to go from here?,ConvictDev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cgjd0f/what_to_take_from_this_internship_and_where_to_go/,"So, I interned at a large healthcare tech company this summer. Things I learned about: agile, source control, the general workflow of investigation / code / testing / code review and so on, technical communication, how to ask questions, how to dive deep into a huge code base, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I worked on, however, I'm not at all excited about and quite frankly, don't want to touch again. This whole summer I spent working on a huge, old MFC app written in C++. I spent my time fixing little bugs / cosmetic defects. To be honest, the work sucked. I didn't really do that much programming. It would take me the longest time doing investigation and figure out what all this old, auto-generated code meant or how it worked (of which I'm still largely clueluess). While I learned a lot of the ""intangibles"" mentioned in the first paragraph, the coding experience was far below what I was hoping for.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, how should I move forward? How should I frame this experience to land a better internship next summer? I graduate Fall 2020, so I have one summer left for more experience. I'm trying not to sound salty about the experience, but I can't imagine many employers will be interested in what I've done, which honestly, feels like very little."

I currently work full time in professional sports while going to graduate school full time. I started out as an intern part time which I thought was perfect for me. It unexpectedly turned into a full time role which I also thought was perfect until I started gaining more and more responsibilities which then lead to 50 hour weeks while also doing graduate school full time.

While my job is somewhat related to my schooling, none of what I’m learning really transfers over. I also really struggle at my job since my role is meant for someone with 3+ years of experience and I had 2 months of an internship. I feel like I’m letting my entire department down and I have no support from my boss. Most of the things I do he “doesn’t have time for” but I also have no guidance and he’s never there when I need help. 

I’m told that school comes first but then I work 10-12 hour days, I’m doing work and answering emails while I’m in class..

Basically, I’m miserable at this job but I need to start working on my thesis... which requires a location and I do believe I could complete it here, but I’m worried I will constantly be putting my schooling on the back-burner and I’m worried I won’t finish on time. I often have mental breakdowns about my job and I have constant stomach aches and anxiety before going to work. 

I don’t know if I should talk to my boss and risk getting let go for not being able to handle a full time job in sports and entertainment while going to school full time. If I start looking for other jobs, how do I bring up needing to do my thesis there? My program is center around training and development so it could be mutually beneficial for me and the organization.

I don’t have any friends or family to talk to about this and I really just don’t know what to do. I feel so lost and upset about my current situation. I don’t know if I should quit my job or stay, or just quit everything and move back home.

I feel like a failure in every aspect of my life and I feel so guilty for even thinking about giving up on my job since so many would kill to have a job in pro sports yet I feel like I can’t wait to get out."

&amp;#x200B;

I got my undergraduate degree in physics. I did very well. My research focus was in nuclear and particle physics, and I have three published papers in that field. I got many good internships, started and led a physics student organization that got funding to be taken to a national level, and graduated with honors.

&amp;#x200B;

Life got pretty bad my junior year of college and I ended up taking a gap year for mental health reasons and to teach as a way of ""giving back"". During that year I took the physics GRE and utterly bombed it. I got tenth percentile. Regardless, I applied to a range of PhD programs and got admitted to 7/10 of the ones I applied to. I accepted the offer from the top nuclear physics grad school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was all set to go, but the summer before the program would start I began having doubts. I'd never considered any career path other than physics. I'd seen the struggles my grad student friends went through. I began wondering what other options there were and didn't want to commit to the 5-7 years of a PhD program if I wasn't truly passionate about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I applied to a master's of patent law program, declined the offer by the top nuclear physics grad school, and took a shot at this new career. I got hired by a very good law firm. I graduated with a good GPA. And I'm absolutely miserable. I hate this field. I hate waking up every morning. I derive absolutely no joy from this and every single day regret not doing my PhD. I realize now that my passion really was physics and I made a mistake trying to change careers.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to my boss today and he told me that he could tell I didn't have my heart in this. He said he really values my work but wants me to be happy. I told him I really regret not doing my PhD. He said he completely supports me in this and would allow me to work for him part time during my PhD, even if it's just a few hours a week. He also said he'd do everything he can to help me get into a PhD program.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm trying to figure out my next step. I want to email the grad school I would have gone to asking for readmittance. I have no idea how to phrase this email. I know I sound completely ungrateful and pathetic. I don't see why they'd accept me now that I've come crawling back. What do I say? How do I say it?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know who I would ask to write my letters. I know my boss would, but most applications require three letters of recommendation. I feel pathetic asking my old letter writers to write letters for me again. I wasted their time the first time around. Why would they give me another chance? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to reapply to a lot of the programs that had accepted me, but I feel like I'm probably blacklisted or something for turning down their offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

So just...how do I write this email asking for readmittance and reconsideration? How do I ask my old letter writers to give me another shot? Any advice at all on this process?"

How important are high school grades for transfer(I’m gonna apply for transfer for sophomore year so the only grades I’m sending are HS grades and first semester college)?

Does taking the ACT alongside the SAT look better for STEM applications(I already have a 1570)?

I’m applying for BME to all my colleges but a lot of my ECs are CS oriented. This is because my goal(and something I wrote about in my essays) is to combine both in my job and research. Would it hurt me to have so many CS ECs on paper?

* MIGHT do some very informal “research” with another local professor where I will be using machine learning to try and find a connection between volatility and future market performance as well as just testing the reliability of the volatility index over time and in general (don't factor this in, as it probably won't happen).

* Maybe the Entrepreneurship Coordinator in my county who I worked with a ton for DECA (she loves me)
* Maybe my APCSP teacher (11th grade). He was the advisor for my laureate research essay and the teacher contact for the app challenge.
* Maybe my APUSH teacher (11th grade). She's the NHS advisor.
* Maybe a local professor that I am doing research with this summer. Not sure which one yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra Info:**

* Somewhat competitive public high school
* Somewhat started a business (maybe more of a small unofficial nonprofit?) that has a website, a couple hundred monthly users, and won the app challenge thing. It’s focused around mental health and school specifically in my county so should I / how should I include this on my applications? Basically it’s a glorified grade calculator (but my county’s weird with grades). Maybe not even a glorified one lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So... what are my general chances to be accepted to Duke if I apply ED? Whether or not I apply ED is up to several factors, so also please let me know my chances if I apply RD.

Also, what part(s) of my application should I try to improve most in the little time I have?

Thank you!

Hey all, I am currently working on a software engineering degree (graduating next year!). This last semester I took my first web development class. It was basic stuff like CSS, PHP, JavaScript, connecting SQL databases etc. We did all the coding in AWS Cloud 9. I really enjoyed the class and I want to focus on webdev and overall make a career out of it! However this is pretty much the only exposure in my program to web development. I don't really have anybody I can talk to who is in the field for advice so 90% of what I learn is through forums and tutorials. 

The internship I am currently doing is somewhat of a joke when it comes to software skills (it is more IT/system admin focused with more downtime then I thought was possible). So, because of my exuberant amounts of downtime, and wanting to learn more about webdev, I went ahead and downloaded the files for the site I had been working on for class and set up a small Ubuntu server with Apache using an old PC I had lying around. I bought a domain and got an ssl certificate so the website seems pretty legit if I do say so myself, especially being a one man operation and not a pro by any means. I also learned quite a bit about back end web servicing. So now on to my questions:

What should I do next? Continue adding features to my site to learn more programming, work on optimizing the Apache server itself...?

Any recommended skills/tools I should learn?

And a more technical question is what tools do you use to code and test? Right now I use Nano within the Ubuntu server but it seems so old school and takes a long amount of time to code new features, and testing the code is terrible because I'm editing the site code itself (I know, terrible practices)

Again sorry for the wall of text, I am just trying to set myself up with some skills/tools for the real world.

Thank you!"

Although I had known ahead of time that my friends had found jobs right out of college, their wages and those of their colleagues caught me off guard. My computer science friends are making $80k \~ $120k (granted they are living in places such as the bay, silicon valley, seattle, etc.) whereas my business friends are making close to \~$250k (living in places like NYC). 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, I've applied to over 200 positions with no interviews despite fixing my resume and cover letters multiple times through my school's career center. I also understand my bachelor's in aerospace engineering (no internships) would set me at a starting salary of $50 \~ $60 (with no relocation benefits). At this point, I've been pretty burnt out after college losing the starry eyed desire to make something as an engineer but the wages also hurt. Granted I know money shouldn't be a priority but personal financial issues since my youth have slowly skewed my vision throughout college. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given this, I want to know what motivates current engineers or those aspiring to become one. What gets you out of bed and looking forward to the rest of your day?  Do you have any regrets in the choices you've made thus far? Hopefully it doesn't sound like I'm complaining and I understand my friend group is but a specific case but I am just curious of how other people go about things.

I'm a senior CS student, and I'm working at a great company as an intern in summer.
Now, I've got an offer to continue to work here during the semester too, but I have mixed feelings about it. This will be my last semester, I have time to work, the salary great, most of the people are kind etc. 

But first, I'm not so interested in this field(devops), and I know I want to take a different path and learn different things. For example my workmate works from home alot, he's very proactive etc, and I'm not be like that because the lack of motivation. When I got home I rarely look at my next day tasks even.

Second, my boss is kinda look down on me, because I'm very inexperienced and there is some genius folks in the group who naturally gets more attention. I know, it's okay, I have to learn, but it hurts my ego a little bit. I'm isolated from the rest of the group, I have to solve useless tasks, and get so little review I don't know if I'm doing anything good.

So bc of these things I have not so pumped up motivation, but there are two things why I don't want to ""quit"":
- My professor got me this works, I think he sees something in me, and very supportive about this job, so I don't want to offend him.
- I'm working here for like 2 months, I know I can pushed this thing more, be more proactive, get more attention, and not whine like a little boy:D

But the thing is, I don't know if I want to, or if it's worth it. I'm feel like if I stay here, I'm losing time to not pursue my real interests.

I made a post in another subreddit(https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/cedtml/internship_starting_to_suck/), about an internship I am currently doing at a respectable utility company where I am disgruntled with the work I have been given. I mentioned in that post I was (informally) given an offer to work full-time. I have spoken to many former interns and employees here, and they tell me I should accept it. And the company almost always provides former interns with a full-time offer. I have thought hard about it and am thinking I should. Although my internship experience wasn't the best, I have gotten to know what engineers do and the responsibilities here and I believe it's something I could handle and something I would enjoy. What really draws me in is the continuing education program the offer,the amazing and friendly work environment and the benefits. Considering I have interned here for 2 years, I am already comfortable with the job and everyone here, so it would be the best transition. Also, it is about 15 miles away from home, where I plan to live post-grad, so commute will be a breeze. Of course, I will apply to other jobs before I graduate but this is really my first choice.

My worry is, I am really looking to work with PLC's. But as an entry level engineer in my city, there are little to no opportunities. I would eventually have to move away in order to get to that which I plan to do once my life and income are in order, but working in utility really doesn't provide me with the adequate experience for a job in PLC's. Another concern is, I don't know if choosing complacency would be the best idea, because things can change once I am actually full-time. I should take other options that will be available to me, but sometimes the grass is not greener on the other side.

I know its a bit early to worry about all of this, but May will be here before I know it and I'd like to know what I should do. Choose a place I know that won't give me the best experience for my real career plans or take the risk of going elsewhere which could provide me better experience?"

I am mostly concerned over formatting and the position of my sections - I am thinking that it might be better to put skills below education; furthermore, I am not sure if on-campus involvement section is good (I was a rather successful college athlete), but I have received advice that it's useful to put the accomplishments there.

I am primarily looking for entry level software engineering, javascript/node (and other) web development, entry level cybersecurity positions, entry level systems administrator or entry level data science positions.

I am a rising senior with three full time internships under my belt. I have started looking for full time jobs for once I graduate and am beginning the application process.

I was wondering what level jobs I should be applying for. Whether it be a junior level, entry level or should I apply for regular Software Engineer and developer roles?

I feel very confident in my skills and with that I feel a junior/entry role wouldn't be a good fit for me. Any advice is welcomed!"

I was also debating titling the question “did you ever used to be passionate about a field or industry before becoming disillusioned?”

So I graduated college spring 2018. I had this particular field I wanted to go into. I had the right degree, I was super active in collegiate clubs &amp; teams, involved in industry organizations, completed 3 internships, and worked every summer. I thought I at least stood a chance. Come to find out it’s impossible to get the type of job I wanted. 

I took a job in insurance which I’d assumed would just be a temporary thing until one of my preferred jobs opened up. I spent the entirety of 2018 and the begining of 2019 job hunting, while working full time. Needless to say it was very stressful and time consuming. The constant rejection also took a mental toll.

The whole time I was in college we were constantly told how our industry needed young people and need people from all different backgrounds and even if you aren’t the most experienced, if you are willing to learn and do X,Y,Z you’ll have no problem getting a job. I gradually learned this is not the case. 

For a whole year I watch people get hired for jobs because of their last name, who their dad was, or older people with insider connections get entry level jobs just with a more experienced salary of course. For example I would apple for a clearly entry level job that only required a BS and I would get interviewed but the job ultimately go to someone else with a masters or someone already working at the same company.   At this point, I’ve settled into my job and have decided to stay for the foreseeable future because I’m tired of interviewing and the BS that goes with the industry I wanted to be apart of.

While my current job isn’t what I thought I would be doing it does have some perks that are hard to give up now like great &amp; cheap health insurance, my boss is very laid back, I don’t have anyone watching over me, I can take PTO, leave early, or come in a little late pretty much whenever it want and no one cares, the paid is good and I know I get 2x year bonuses and yearly raise. And I don’t have to think about work after 5pm. 

Yes it may not be my passion but had I’d waited on my preferred job, I’d still probably be unemployed or working for less with more hours. I mean what else can you do when your passion isn’t passionate about you?"
cgun2x,2,2019-07-23,Help with depression from family,johnrandle77,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cgun2x/help_with_depression_from_family/,"Hello Reddit,
Today at the age of 22 I admitted to my girlfriend that I am depressed. I would love to have any advice, but specifically I would be very grateful on how to get out of this funk I am. Apologies for how long this is, but very desperate for advice.
 
A little bit of background on me is that I come from a very well-off immigrant family and because I am still living with them while in college, I am financially dependent on them as they pay for my car, college, insurance, gas, food, anything really. However, I never abuse this and actually always feel guilty for using their money. I feel that I am very lucky that my parents support me financially, but I so strongly cannot wait to be independent as I loved having my own jobs and buying things on my own dime. I am convinced that my parents give me such my financial support as a way to control my entire life (I’ll explain below). I was raised to always have proper etiquette and to always serve my family first. When I met my girlfriend and her family about 3 years ago, I started to become aware of some dynamics that were off in my life I never realized who I was until then. I could completely be myself and they (my girlfriend’s family) loved me for that and always made me feel comfortable to free-spirited whereas around my parents I realized I could never be goofy, loud, swear, say inappropriate jokes that the average person may laugh at and so on. A couple of months ago, I realized I was right. It dawned on me that I was always dragged to places by my parents such as their friends’ houses, extended family or friend events, and so on. Because I was held to such high expectations for the past 20+ years, I have found it difficult to be myself.
 
Anyways, the kicker is that two years ago, my parents gracefully gave my brother (23 at the time) and I (19 at the time) the opportunity to start our own business after my brother convinced them that a specialty farm would be a great idea, even though both of us had pretty much no experience working blue collar positions nor farming. At the age of 19, of course I was convinced it would be a great idea and I joined in thinking of all the riches and spoils in my teenage brain. At the beginning, after a bit of arguing, my brother and I decided to start small as we still had a lot to learn about farming. However, it spun out of control. Keep in mind I am deemed a 50/50 partner. My brother wanted to expand over 50% larger than originally intended after our first year and I said no because 1. we have no experience in the field and 2. I am enrolled full-time in a very rigorous university. We fought for hours and then, my brother went behind my back to expand. I found out by going to the farm and seeing all the materials necessary to expand sitting in our driveway. Eventually there was less fighting it and we expanded, but we just expanded the infrastructure not the plants. I decided on what plants to order and my mother paid a 4% down payment for them. Then, I second guessed myself and quickly wanted to cancel the order because I knew we were getting way ahead of ourselves. I offered my parents to get an internship and pay for the amount of money we would lose from pulling the down payment and to no surprise, my family said no. So here I am - almost 4 years later, an equal partner in a business with close to 1 million USD invested in that never fit my vision.
 
The worst part is I want out because no one once listened to me about the path we were going down. The dilemma and depression started to come about when I wanted to leave the business after school and begin my own life with my girlfriend. Not to mention, my mother and brother have displayed concerning emotionally abusive characteristics that have since taken a huge toll on mine and my girlfriends’ relationship with them. My girlfriend has been so generous and helpful with my family all the while, my brother finds it difficult to treat her with simple respect and my mother constantly defends his heinous behavior. I am being held down with so much guilt even though my family claims there are no strings attached when I am well aware there certainly are. If I leave, the business will fail, my family will lose so much money, and most likely risk my brother resenting me forever whereas if I stay, I will be able to make this business work out of my own fear of failing my parents and risk a life time of unhappiness. No one once asked me what I wanted to do with my life, where I wanted to go, where I wanted to work, or when I wanted to accomplish such things. For as long as I can remember, I have been so submissive and subservient to my family my whole life. I am scared of talking wrong, acting wrong, dressing inappropriately, failing my parents, failing the business, embarrassing myself, and so on. Now, I find myself never wanting to do anything, never wanting to go anywhere, and all in all just feel so numb that I don’t care to try to do anything. All I think about is the repercussions of my decisions. I met my true love that I want to spend the rest of my life with and feel a strong weight that is keeping me from accomplishing things we want to do together for our future. I try to tell myself that it will get better when… (fill in the blank). All I want is to start a life with her. For once, I want to own my own things, make my own decisions on my own time and most importantly, act how I want. I know I will eventually leave but doing so makes me feel so guilty and sick just thinking about it. It has been weighing me down for almost a year now. The only thing I find the desire to do is play video games and watch TV shows in my bedroom to temporarily escape the reality I need to face. Because my parents possibly use their finances as a way to control me, I feel like they have a say as to where I live for the rest of my life, what my career path will be, and/or my obligations to them. I just want out, but I feel like the repercussions will ruin my relationship with my immediate family for the remainder of my life. I guess what I am asking here is how can I have the courage to not feel guilty of wanting out and is it the right thing to do?"

Super late, so that doesn't leave me with a lot of time to get an internship before I graduate. I graduate Spring 2021, so ideally, I'd get an internship Summer 2020 or Fall 2020. But, as I've only taken one CS class to this point, what should I do? I hear internships are usually applied to in September/October, but I have only completed one CS class and my skills aren't great yet. I'm teaching myself some basic algorithims and data structures but not very comprehensive. Another negative is that I'm in a region of the US not particularly known for CS (Miami), so internships may be harder to come by.   


All that said my GPA is pretty high (around a 3.8) and I've been working on a few projects that I hope to finish this fall (An emulator and an Android App that'll give you good surfing locations nearby based on weather). I know a top tier internship is likely out of the question for next summer, but will it be possible for me to get any? Do some companies open up for summer internships around next January? I figure that'd be easier for me to apply to, with more CS skills and most likely some completed projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the upcoming Fall, how plentiful are internships then? I'd really love to graduate with some experience and put myself in the best place possible after graduation."

I’m currently a student finishing up next summer, I’m an intern right now with of the big financial institutions as a front end web dev, 
Following is what all I know,
Angular - Proficient

JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS 

Java - I learned in my school - Not advanced - I built a JDBC application

C# - Proficient

I have an interest in Machine learning and AI, but not sure should I learn or not, are the udacity nano degree programs worth it?

I’m an intern till the end of this year then for a semester I’m heading back to school and will graduate.

I’ll be looking for a job then,
If thinking for that POV of landing job, what should I learn until then?
I had java on my mind and become a java dev - considering the trend and demand, is it worth it?

Or should I work towards becoming a full stack web dev considering my proficiency with Angular ?

If not considering the job POV, what should I learn in 2019? Data science? AI? 
If programming then,
What languages are worth learning?

My school taught me .NET (ASP and stuff) but considering it’s declining these days, I’m not thinking much on . NET

I am a fast learner and should not be a problem with learning anything from scratch, I didn’t know angular after getting the job but my manager gave me a couple months, I learned it and am pretty good at it.

I feel like I’ll lose my track if I don’t start learning anything new soon."

We become engineers because we like it. If you want to do more engineering then do it. You can’t complain about not having the perfect work. I am going into my senior year of mechanical engineering and I am already working full time as a salaried project engineer. I did not get here from sitting on reddit when I was board at my desk. 

Here is what I did for a little help: 

I applied for almost any job I could as a sophomore, totaling about 10 jobs. I applied for jobs I wasn’t even close to qualified for. The worst they can say is no. 

I heard back from 5. I was later offered all 5 jobs.

I selected the one that I liked the most and would work with my school. (I have been working full time and in school full time for over a years now. At that time I was already working close to full time with my other job so I was used to 8-4 work and 4-8 classes) 

When I got into the job I found out it sucked. I was just a lab tech and not doing any real engineering. So instead of getting on the internet and complaining(I complained to my girlfriend because I get sometimes you need to complain) I told all of the engineers I wanted more work. I would offer to stay late, I down loaded and self taught cad to make small parts for them. I would get close to engineers and talk with them. Learn from them. By the time I was there for 5 months I was leading the procurement and I initial testing of 2 project prototypes. 

I pushed hard and told everyone what I was wanting from my experience, I told everyone what I liked doing, but I would do anything. I voiced how it was being a co-op. What’s the worst that will happen? You leave a few months early? You make a bad connection with a boss you wouldn’t want to work for? I mean I was never rude. Just honest. If the work was boring, I asked why I was doing it. Like I said above I was just a tech and I was disassembling parts, but when I asked why it turns out they were test parts and it was time to check the results so I asked to be involved in the results part and I got it be. 

The I found another company I connected with at an event. I eventually talked my way into an interview and I then got offered a full time position. And here I am now. I work full time. I leave to get to class, and I am fully apart of this new team. 

You just gotta learn how to talk. The team you work with will it give you work unless you ask. They don’t have time time to invest into a potential dud. 

TLDR; if you want to complain, complain to your boss. Ask questions. Make connections. Find the value in the work you are doing."

I find I enjoy working with big data, granted my experience is a bit more limited with DBA because I cant go messing around with a companies huge live database, or really have a scope of the type of problems they deal with daily. 

So that being said, if I had to choose, I'd like to go into data analytics, but I find myself worried about what I hear. I'm not the best at coding and math. Frankly, I find myself bad at both of those. I still enjoy telling stories with data. Am I doomed at wanting to get into data analytics with I'm subconsciously trying to avoid programming and math? 

Another field I was considering was game development, but I keep hearing (understandably) about the horrible working conditions and low pay.

I work at a small company, about 50% of my role involves handling internal IT and the other 50% is managing systems running web applications in an AWS environment. I graduated from college 6 years ago with a degree in CIS, and during college I did a internship as a software developer. Throughout college, I had always intended to get a job as a software developer, but towards the end of college, I took a couple of systems-related electives, one thing led to another, and I was referred by a professor to a company in need of a sys admin. I took the job without giving it much thought and without consideration of what I really wanted for myself career-wise.

I am now ready to make the transition into software development, but I'm not sure where to get started. Over the last year, I have worked to build a portfolio on github. I have also began to network with a local group of software developers. I am hoping that such networking can lead to something, however, I am also eager to do whatever it takes to get this transition underway soon. 

This brings me to the questions that I have. For those of you who deal with hiring developers, how would you tend to view existing IT experience for someone applying to an entry-level software developer role? Does such experience have the potential to be a good selling point? Would you have questions or concerns about someone making this type of transition?"

I am currently a rising senior in USC that is scheduled to graduate in May 2020 with a major in Business Administration. A little background, I am currently interning at a reputable real estate firm that does agency and balance sheet lending for commercial real estate, mostly multifamily. I got this internship through a reference from a family member, and I believe that I did learn new things such as that I wouldn't mind working in this field and how the industry works to a certain degree. However, the more I learn, the more I feel that I am very uneducated and unprepared for the real world. I will admit that coming into college I prioritized partying and ""having a good time"". I made friends but I don't believe I explored all my options or made many professional connections despite the numerous resources that my school provides. I have a 3.2 GPA and work experience but I definitely could have done better. I do feel remorseful in a sense that i didn't make the most of my opportunities, but that is in the past and I will cherish the memories and the times I had in college deeply with no regrets. What I am most worried about is that if I do decide to try to pursue this career, I would not be chasing after my ""passion"", and if I want out, that would not be an option. I still do not feel what it is that I want to do, and keep finding myself leaning towards the glamour of comfortable living by making a good amount of money. I did explore the insurance industry while I was at school but did not find any fulfillment in it. So here I am, at a pivotal point in my life completely lost and unsure if the path that I probably will be taking -- due to the lack of options -- will give me a fulfilling life or make it a dull, repetitive one. I also feel that I, by not trying hard enough in my college years, have limited myself in my career choices. I understand that nothing in my life from here on will be given to me and I need to go get them myself. A part of me just wants to have passive income and live comfortably, and this also plagues me because I just feel that I don't have that ""spark"" for a specific thing in my life related to my career. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted some advice from people who have been in the situation that I am. What could I do to really expand my horizon on the different choices that I have and explore different interests at this point of my life? How have these situations turned out for you guys? I look forward to hearing from you guys."

So, I'd like to know whether I should go into an entry-level IT job (like an IT specialist) or work as an intern so I'm learning at the same time. What do you guys think?

I am a rising sophomore this year at a highly ranked CS school. This summer I will have completed an internship but for summer 2020 it is my goal to work at a top company with a great internship program, including but not limited to FAANG. I am in a bit of a confused state right now because I'm not sure what I should primarily be focusing on. I recently completed OCA J8 certification and have recently started doing Leetcode, and hope to have some more projects by the end of the summer, but I'm not sure what I should be placing the most emphasis on. I know that the first step is often to complete a coding challenge, and so I need to know how to pass those by doing practice problems, but at the same time if I am to go to the career fair at my college, they may be looking at my projects first and placing emphasis on those. What is the biggest factor in the interview process? Also, what is the best way to get past the applicant tracking system? I have seen some peers use rather graphic resumes (adding acclaim badges as images) which look nice, but at the same time do not follow the basic structure in a simple white page text-only resume. A part of me wants to think that the simple white page resumes will not stand out, but it is also convention, so I'm very unsure of what to do here. Sorry if this post is all over the place, and thanks in advance!"

I don't want to invest the time getting certs only to find out that my lack of experience invalidates their ability to advance my career.

&amp;#x200B;

So at work one of the interns has undone an advanced filter one of the old managers had built and I'm trying to rebuild it to save everyone some hassle. But for the life of me I can't seem to replicate it in the way he had done it, and I can't see a tutorial that matches accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentialy I've an excel sheet linked to an access query which is issue free, similar to this:

&amp;#x200B;

But to work through the relevant excel data we have an additional worksheet that houses the date range like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qvom7kux74c31.png

When adjusted this should hide all dates outwith the date range. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't figure out how to do this without a helper column and a function like

     =AND(Table1[Order Date]&gt;Sheet2!C2,Table1[Order Date]&lt;Sheet2!C3) . 

It seems like I'm missing something simpler as the previous version didn't appear to need the helper column.

If someone could give me a walkthrough on this that would be great.

Me and my cousins are super close, despite two of them living in Europe (I live in the US).

One of my cousins(17F) came to the US to visit for the summer, and she's been spending everyday with my other cousin(18F). The problem is that I don't really have time to hang out with them everyday- I just moved into my first apartment, started an internship, and have to do adult things like clean, cook food, etc. 

It seems like everyday they're finding things to do and places to see, and want me involved as well. I've been taking time off of work and have been spending every weekend with them, since my cousin is only here for a short while, but I'm struggling trying to stay afloat. I need time to decompress, and usually I find myself coming straight from work to her house, and getting back to my apartment late, with no time to myself.

How can I better manage this situation? I really need some time to rest, but I want to hang out with my cousins."

This is a throw away account as my s/o knows my real account. Anyways, here is a little backstory. I’m 22 and a graduating senior in college. I have been volunteering at the company of my dreams in a small capacity for the last four years. I commute about two hours to this place about two-to-three times a week. My coworkers are like my family and this place has been my identity for the last four years.

That was until today. You see, recently an opportunity for an internship had opened up, and I applied for it. Now, I am the only person that his been around in the volunteer position for this long, and I figured i’d be able to get the internship because of the hard work and dedication I have shown the last four years. (I also attend one of the top colleges in the country and have a decent resume).

Today, however, I got a call from my boss telling me that they had chosen another candidate for the position and thanked me for applying. I don’t blame him, I understand that he has a business to run, and he needs to hire the best person for the job. That doesn’t mean I wasn’t crushed though. I got off the phone, cried, got angry, punched some things and now i’m here looking for some advice.

I don’t know where to go from here. Keep in mind that i’m 22, so please understand I have never really been through this. I feel so helpless. My entire future was riding on this internship, and I have had my sights set on it since I walked in the door four years ago.

Please just give me any advice, i’m going crazy.

TL;DR- Worked my ass off for 4 years for an internship, and I didn’t get it. What next?"

So then I continued to wait for my luggage but eventually they stopped dispensing new suitcases on the belt so I went to the counter and asked if there’s any more coming out or if my suitcase is lost. She tells me to fill out this form and go to this separate room so I go and I thought I was there to just file the form as proof that I took action about my luggage. But then the SAME guy was in the room and seen me so he took my passport and called me to the desk and then he said ok I’m gonna search your things. And I’m like ummm why because I’m here about my lost luggage. And he’s like because anyone is subject to a search, ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? And I’m like ok.. no I was just wondering. 

While he was looking through my stuff he was asking me about where I travelled to and i told him and he’s like that’s not what u said the first time I asked u. And I’m like wtf because the first time u only asked me where I came from and asked me about Thailand cuz u saw the stamp in my passport..u didn’t ask me where else I travelled and he’s like but u didn’t tell me that and I’m like why tf would I tell u everywhere I travelled this year if u only asked me where I just came from and what I did when I went to Thailand. 

He didn’t say anything So then he looks through all my shit and was like how much money did u make last year and I’m like wtf idk I dont rmb cuz I don’t work full time I’m a student and I do internships every four months. And then he was like how about the year before and I’m like ... I was also doing internships so I don’t Rmb. Then he’s like how can u afford this stuff cuz all my designer shit was on my carry on and I’m like I worked... and saved..... and he’s like but the math doesn’t make sense ur a student u only so internships and u can afford this? And I’m like well like I told u the first time u questioned me my parents also financially support me and he’s like what do they do and then he basically asked me if we live in Vancouver and I’m like no toronto snd he’s like where and I’m like Vaughan and he’s like where I’m Vaughan and I’m like etf... lol and then he said so why are u here and I’m like cuz this is my layover and in case u wanted to know I’m not going back to Toronto I’m going to Vegas after this 23 hour layover and then he’s like WHY SRE YOU GOING TO VEGs (btw this whole time he was like CHEESED at me for some reason idk why he was being so bitter) and I’m like um.. to have fun? Wtf and then he’s like who are u goi g with, have u been there before and I’m like I’m meeting friends there and he’s like what do your friends do and I’m like ....? They’re servers? 

And then out of nowhere he’s like DO YOU DO DRUGS? And I’m like wha the fuck ? No? And he’s like answer me carefully cuz I’m gonna swab ur bags Nd if there’s any traces of anything it’s gonna be a whole different conversation and I’m like ok.. go ahead. So then he swabs and goes to the back room and then he comes back and obviously there’s no drugs lol andthen he’s like well I’m gonna search ur phone now and at this point I was too tired to be like wtf so I’m like k and I gave him my phone and he’s like oh do u want a female to search it since ur female and tbh I didn’t care cuz I don’t have shit on my phone but just to piss him off I’m like yeah I want a female to search it so then he goes back in the back room and then he came out ten min later and was like ok we’re done.

ch0kfn,1,2019-07-23,[Hiring][SF][Austin] SWEs at Qualia (10% market share in real estate),sidhire,jobbit,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobbit/comments/ch0kfn/hiringsfaustin_swes_at_qualia_10_market_share_in/,"We're looking for clever, curious software engineers at Qualia in San Francisco. The company has led me to think about startups and software design through a completely different lens, and I've made a number of very close friends while working here.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a description of the company:

At Qualia, we are fundamentally transforming the real estate closing process, a $40 billion industry historically untouched by modern cloud-based technology. Our platform brings everyone involved in the closing process – lenders, realtors, title agents, home buyers and sellers – onto one shared, secure, mobile system of record. Within a year of launching nationwide, Qualia has grown to process 10% of monthly U.S. real estate closings and our market share is growing everyday. Qualia is backed by Menlo Ventures, 8VC and other top investors and is growing quickly. Our thousands of passionate users spend the majority of their day logged into one of Qualia's web and mobile enterprise apps.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things I like about Qualia:

* The company is ambitious. We offer, or intend to offer, products to just about every party in the real estate transaction. We started by focusing on the workflow of the title company, the most important party in the closing phase of a real estate transaction, and we're fanning out from there. We've grown from 30 to 150 people while I've been here and we raised a series B last year.
* The engineering culture is strong. Someone on the team gives an engineering talk on something they're interested in every Thursday. New engineers work through interactive tutorials featuring a gravity simulation and security challenges. We've built tons of libraries in-house, and technologies we use include MeteorJS, Semantic UI (the creator of Semantic leads design at Qualia), Docker, Rancher, Terraform, Vagrant, AWS, Node, Mongo, Ruby, Python, Mixpanel. And here are some examples of libraries we've built:
   * DepValue - Given two fields A and B in your database, you can declare in your database schema that B depends on the value of A. Then, whenever A changes, B is updated automatically. (AKA data flow programming...some say every enterprise application is a spreadsheet under the hood, and DepValue enables such spreadsheet logic.)
   * Reval - Development tool that lets you see front-end changes in real time as you make changes to the code. Reval was inspired by the philosophy of the programmer/designer Bret Victor who says that your brain has a much harder time understanding a causal link if it doesn't receive feedback immediately. You would never learn to play the saxophone if it took a second for the note to change after you pressed the key.
* The people are truth-seeking. In meetings people evaluate ideas objectively and collaboratively. The leadership is always open to conversations about company strategy, and that has gives me context on the entire organization. The people are calm, even when things go wrong, but intent on finding the best solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of our engineers are full-stack, with a few infrastructure specialists. We have about 20 engineers, and the SF office is about 50 people. The rest of the company is in Austin. We're currently hiring full-time engineers who can start in the summer or early fall. No internships at present, but feel free to reach out if you think you'd be interested in something down the road.

For as long as I can remember I have always had an interest in computers and technology. Throughout HS I had no idea what I wanted to do after school I knew I wanted to go to college but I did not know what I wanted to major in. Well, I got my associate's degree at a 2-year community college and then transferred to a 4-year university. I majored in CS not really sure what degree to pursue. Long story short I flunked all of my classes the first semester and ended up dropping out the second. Was it my fault for not doing enough research? yes. absolutely. I realized that a CS degree requires a lot of math (which is not my strong suit) I discovered that a bachelors degree in MIS would be a better fit since it combines a lot of IT and business together. After a lot of research (and Reddit post scrolling), I finally have discovered my calling in life career-wise. But here I am almost 24 years old still living at home out of a room at my mom's house and working a dead-end job barely able to pay the bills at barley 1k a month. So yea I have dug myself into a pretty deep hole at this point My main problem is I'm not sure whether or not if I want to go back to college and get my MIS degree as I have read from a lot of people that without certs and work experience it is worthless. Another concern is the student debt that I will have after if I go for the degree around 47k if I've done the math right. On one hand, I could go for the degree and while in college earn my A+ Network+ and other Certs while taking my classes and even land some internships as well. On the other hand, I have heard that certs are all that matter to most employers as well as work experience. I'm torn between the two paths at the moment and just need some guidance from fellow IT professionals and people with the same kind of experience. I just feel so stuck and lost right now and not sure which way to go in the fork in the road. Everyone else my age is already starting there career and succeeding and  I have just been sitting stagnated for almost a year now. I  just want to get started in my career path since I feel like I am running out of time. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

 Anyways, for a bit of context I have a summer job as an intern at one of the middle schools in my school’s overall network (I don’t wanna get into it bc it’s I’m just bad at explaining) and the way in which you get to the school is by driving/walking up one of three paths, all containing hills in some way shape or form, varying in steepness overall. I also had to do conditioning for football yesterday, which will play in a small bit later. Anyways, my boss sets me and my coworkers on break, which was for *only thirty minutes by the way*, and I had $20 from the week before on me so I decided to go get some lunch that was literally down one of the less steep hills so I was fine with making that troop and knew I could be back before time was up. So I set off on my journey and traveled down the not-so-steep hill and in about 10 or so minutes and was ready to reap my rewards of a steak bomb sub. But, the excitement for my reward was short lived as the pizza place I wanted to go to had been closed down. When I noticed this, I stared at it in disbelief (this ._. face is a good reference to how I looked at the close place) before uttering “that’s so gay” and walking away, as I was still hungry and knew there was another pizza place not too too far off.

 I had began trekking over towards the other pizza place, and when I went to see how long it would take me to get there by checking the maps app on my phone, I saw I would’ve gotten there at 12:22, meaning I only had 8 minutes left to get my food which made me nearly give up and go to a convenience store, but as I began walking to a convenience store my mind immediately drifted off to thinking about the sub I wanted, and I turned around and continued walking to the second pizza place, which wasn’t too far off. Upon entering the store I had already accepted that I would’ve been late and texted my boss as such (luckily she was fine with it and just gave me a thumbs up bc I told her I would be back no later than 1). So I patiently waited in a booth seat for my food after paying, and I began to slowly realize that I had to take a shit. This would’ve been fine, perfectly fine, if there was a bathroom in the pizza place I was in, but of course there was not. So as I waited for my sub to be made, I sat there just watching random YouTube videos to pass the time as the feeling of needing to shit just got stronger as time went on until my sub had been made. This made me jump up, grab the food and pay immediately, and as soon as I had gotten my change back I walked out the store without a word sort of began speed walking but strolling back to my job. 

 The closer I got to my job, the sinking feeling of being late began to also further sink in, and the fear of losing possible earned money drove me a bit off the wall. This was because I had began to start talking to myself a bit and making weird hand gestures as I began to mouth the lyrics of RUN by Juice WRLD on my walk back to work. I also had decided to go up one of the steeper hills, since I knew it would get me there faster but fuck that shit. When I got closer to my job I ended up yelling the lyrics a bit which was honestly only done bc I knew no one was around me but if someone heard me screaming “MONEY IS HAPPINESS, CAP” and whatnot I’m sorry for harming your ears. I had gotten back to my job, and felt a tinge of accomplishment as I had made it back, and, after setting my food in my break room, went to the bathroom to take a shit which felt relieving. But then I realized I had to go right back to work upon getting back and I didn’t even have time to eat my food until 2 hours later, when I was off of work for the day, which pissed me off heavily but I dealt with it. 

 Oh, and the football thing: so throughout the day my body was in pain because of the workouts we had to do the day before, and the pain hit an absolute peak when I went on break and while walking up/down the hills, so I basically had walked back to work having to shit and my muscles feeling like they were screaming at every subtle movement I could make. So that just made the experience a bit worse. All of this combined made me pledge to never go out to get food on a break for the rest of the time I’m working there, no matter what.

TL;DR: I went to get food on break, realized I would’ve been half an hour or so late from my break, had to shit on the walk back, was in pain throughout the entire walk, and couldn’t even eat my food when I got back.

As a side note, my sub got cold because of the sprite I had in the bag. I didn’t remember to take the sprite out of the bag, so it just progressively made the sub get a lot colder than it would’ve if I didn’t have the stupid soda in the bag."

However, when I got promoted to full time, I got a new manager and a new team, to which I knew some of them. Things were going great at first, but as we worked more and more, I began to hate my team. They have social drama between each other, so i'm getting pulled between people cause i'm the new guy on the team, and want me on their side. My manager doesn't give a crap, as long as the project gets done. As a student, none of this was an issue, and I actually enjoyed working there...    

Unlucky? Luckily? I got a few places calling me, and asking if I am interested in interviewing with them(all private sector). Some of which have thrown some offers. I'm guessing these are from applications I submitted way before finishing up school. The only problem is that I really want to get out of where I currently am, but need to stay here until the end of the year(My rent agreement doesn't end until the end of the year, and my parents are renting out my room back home)... It's possible that I can move back earlier, but only a month or two earlier...   

TL:DR; Been at my current company for 13 months(11 months Intern, 2 months Full time) and absolutely hate my new team/manager. Have gotten a few offers at other places, but would only plan to be there until the end of the year, and then move back to my parents place where I'd find another job.

Do I have any power as a renter?",DankeyKayng,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ch2y0z/my_27m_old_roommates_30m30f_are_being_insanely/,"Hey All,

&amp;#x200B;

First time posting. I've run into an issue with my old roommates. I currently am renting two places. Both in California, but the old one was an hour away from my new job. I still have four months on my old lease. The new place was an absolute steal, and about 5 minutes from where I work and I let them know about three weeks in advance. The timeline looks something like this.

June 15th: Told them I was moving out and began putting out ads for a new roommate.

July 14th: Moved into new place, had a few people interviewed for old place.

July 23rd: Our story...

So the process of subletting my room has become increasingly specific. They've wanted a girl between the ages of 20-35, and obviously everything else, clean, safe, responsible, has a job etc... This quickly became turning away a lot of candidates. Even the candidates I do manage to find that seem perfect are interviewed by my old roommates in a pretty digging way. They ask lots of personal questions, always have it face to face, and end with usually a pretty vague answer (like ""We'll let you know in a week"").

This is fine, and in fact, smart! But it has scared a few candidates away with how intense the interviewing process has been. There was one girl who comes to mind who was very excited to move in, but then suddenly decided she couldn't after the ""interview"".

I finally found a girl that loved the house, has a very well paying internship, is clean, loved by the roommates from the interview they had, and is willing to move in very soon.

The problems start here.

They said they didn't want her because she was only here to fill the rest of my lease. She would move in from August to November, but they'd prefer someone who would stay in the house for longer. I told them that that was no reason to not accept her, and we decided to have a facetime meeting.

During the facetime meeting, they actually decide that they are okay with her leaving in November, but came up with a list of bogus reasons why they didn't want her. They are below:

1. She wants to grow weed in the backyard. (This reason was a complete lie. I literally texted her asking about this and she said that she never even brought marijuana up but mentioned she would like to grow snap peas and squash, but wouldn't if the roommates didn't want her to).
2. She doesn't have a car. (She picked this location because it is so close to her work that she can bike there in minutes).
3. She is in an internship. (This internship is paid, and she can prove she has an income, bigger than anyone in the house).
4. They don't want someone they don't know. (I've been interviewing people off of different ad agencies for weeks now, they've interviewed people they've never met, then suddenly change their mind).

At this point I am at a complete loss and feeling like I will be paying the remainder of the rent due to their insanely specific demands. They are literally lying to make candidates look bad. Do I have any power here? Am I able to tell them she is moving in as their reasons are insufficient? How much freedom do I have as a renter to transfer the lease to someone else?

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr Old roommates are being insanely specific about who they want moved in and are refusing to allow me to sublease the rest of my time at my old apartment. Do I have any power here as a renter?**"

Then, due to me being limited to just one arm, I missed some spots while showering and got a rash. That rash happened to be in a... sensitive area.

Then, due to me not eating after taking certain medication, I got a stomach ulcer which was ridiculously painful. Top 5 worst pains I've ever felt.

Due to the ulcer, I ate less, went to the bathroom less because I wasn't eating and one thing lead to another and I was constipated pretty badly. The eventual bathroom visit gave me both a tear down there and hemorrhoids.

On top of all that, there's the constant elbow pain, a summer course I took over two weeks at uni and currently, an internship that requires me to be on the streets from 10 am to minimum 3 pm all day.

I'm exhausted. I'm in so much pain. I get a maximum of 2 hours of sleep per night because of my elbow and the hemorrhoid pain. 2 hours of sleep per night for 2 months has brought me to my breaking point.

Hello!

I was hoping someone could provide some advice on how to change my current situation. I am currently an analyst (CFD &amp; FEA/Stress) at an engineering services company in the aerospace (gas turbine) industry. I have been trying to change roles and get into the commercial space sector for about a year now, but have had little luck getting interviews. I have a decent variety of experience, which seems to make me under-qualified for most positions that I find.

**What I want to do:** I want to get out of engineering services; current job security is questionable. My ideal job would be something more along the lines of project/design engineering on propulsion systems. Something less focused on just analysis, and with a larger variety of day-to-day functions.

**My experience:** Bachelors and Masters in aerospace engineering. \~ 1 year as sales engineer, \~2.5 years of FEA/Stress analysis, and \~0.5 years of CFD. No relevant extra-curriculars or internships from college (I was dumb).

I think my best chance to change sectors would be to find a position that plays to my FEA/Stress experience, but I don't want to get stuck in analysis. I know I'm the kind of person that gets bored in a position with limited scope.

**The questions:**

1. How do I leverage my variety of experience to make me stand out in an industry where ""relevant"" experience seems to be the most valuable asset?
2. Is it realistic to try and change industry sectors AND job functions at the same time?

Thank you for reading!"

I feel like I need to study something else and I have been thinking about changing to computer science. I'm worried though that I will find a CS job boring too and I would waste my time and money switching this late in my college career. Personally I just feel like a career is CS is much more open-ended. I could go so many different directions, and CIVE is very linear. I kind of just want that freedom, but I'm afraid I am only bored because I'm working an office job, and if that's the case, any office job, even if in CS, will be boring to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am particularly interested in AI development or Web Development. I have no experience with AI but some with Web Development. Another worry of mine is that I will be outmatched by all of the geniuses in CS. I'm probably above average intelligence since I have been doing fine in CIVE (3.66 GPA). I'm just worried that in the CS field I will be the one dumbass and I will really struggle in some of the more technical classes. What do you think?"

Planning to move out August 10th but that's a minor detail while we plan on talking with them. We will have paid a prorated amount of base rent 1665 * (20/31) + fees to about 1135, and then rent of 1665 for June and July. This completed 3 months of payment for a 3 month lease right?

Based on the calculations the 2 prorated amounts ( 1665 * (10/30 or 15/30 + fees) + the first prorated month is more than just if we moved in on may 1 and left Aug 1. I was wondering about the nomenclature of it all and what I can do?"

How did you find the role that you want to work? Trial and error? More internships?"

The flip side to this is that for some reason I've started becoming more in to software stuff. I graduated with a BsEE. I've 'learned' C++ now (in the sense that now its on me to practice and find what's out there) and will move to either C# or Python next. I've got a year and a half of software test internship which should help. However when I review say potential interview questions, it seems pretty apparent that I don't know enough, which I'm not upset about, just have to acknowledge that I need to keep improving. And then to top it off, there's an apparent divide between software developer and software engineer, and being that I'd like to fall on the engineer side of things, I don't really understand what knowledge I need to separate myself from a developer. Is there any sort of learning resource that anyone can recommend to really make me understand these differences as well as learn the skills to make these differences happen? Or is it truly just ""work on your own project or 3, put together a showcase of your work, and tackle new stuff every time you do a project""? Would be very grateful for any assistance/inputs."
cha9uj,1,2019-07-24,He abruptly ended our dating?,retropessir,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/cha9uj/he_abruptly_ended_our_dating/,"Hi guys

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 29\[F\] (non-adhd) new here and I'm hoping you can help me with some insight..

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I started a one month summer internship at a law firm in a new city, prior to which I had matched with a 32\[M), who asked me out on a date online. I explained I hadn't moved to said city yet - and the reason I was moving (for a job). Turns out, he works full-time at said law firm. I questioned about unmatching given the circumstances, and he pushed thered be no need since the company was so big. A week before I started, I got an email: out of 700 people, turns out we had been assigned to each other by chance as mentor/intern. This freaked me out, so I unmatched us immediately (insecurities, the inappropriateness, etc.). When I started my first day, there was immediate connection - which is very rare for me. I later found out that the other associates were asking him if we knew each other because they were able to see a connection between us, too.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of that month, we got on SO well. Like two of the BEST of friends in the whole entire world. (Of course there was an attraction there as well!) We laughed a lot, got each other’s coffee, made a number of inside jokes, and supported the other if they were having a tough day. I made sure to keep it professional otherwise, because I actually was concerned that 1. He needed to keep a professional appearance in the office 2. That I would get FAIR feedback on my work ethic, as the end of the internship were job offers. I didn’t want there to be rumours for getting it otherwise. As aside from him, it is the top law firm in the country, great culture, great people.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, he did end up being the one telling people he liked me.

&amp;#x200B;

One night at a staff party, we both attended and everyone was asking about us. They thought it was actually really sweet and were very supportive of us.

&amp;#x200B;

We were the last to leave the party and I was supposed to go back to my home city that weekend. We ended up staying out together and I had no place to crash so went back to his. We stayed up the entire night talking about deeper things, and had our first kiss. This is when he revealed he had ADHD, and we both revealed we had a similar past in regards to LTR’s, cheating etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The following week at work (my last week), everything was normal. On that Wednesday he asked me out for a date to a restaurant on Saturday. I had just had a friend pass away that week and hadn’t been home (2hr away) for two weeks so I asked if we could do the weekend following. Also, at this stage I had received my offer to begin working there in 2021, as I am finishing my last year of University.

&amp;#x200B;

We went on the date and it was great. We also went for drinks and again, I ended up back at his since I only had Mon-Fri accommodation. I also met his best friends that evening. FYI we’ve never slept together as I’ve communicated I wait until I’m exclusive with someone before pursuing that. We had another date the week following which is where problems arise.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up bringing him out on the date for dinner, and after we went for drinks. He had drank more than me and started telling me about his two ex’s from two years prior (cue blazing fire). I am very open and understanding about pasts as I am divorced so I understand the complexities and depths relationships go. It came off more like the one he cheated on his ex WITH was intermittently still in the picture. That he still has feelings but they're not good for one another, they fights, etc. He basically told me that there were still feelings there and that it wasn’t water under the bridge. While I had been drinking myself, I felt at that time really bad about hearing that confession, and I told him I wanted to go home because I understood he was still stuck on her. I was quite calm explaining this to him so there was no fight. IHe brought me to a taxi and we said bye. That is when he started sending me voice notes on Whatasapp that he hadn't spoke with her since we started going on dates, he wasn’t seeing anyone else and cancelled his online profiles. I didn't listen to the voice notes because I was hurt, and just said I didn’t want to go further because if she were to come back, I don’t want to be hurt down the line and it’s maybe best he dealt with that before going further with me.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day he started sending me texts that he understands that I wouldn’t want to hang around if theres someone “potentially in the background”, and that its best we leave it here since we’d be working together. It was a complete 180 from him from the discussion when I left, trying to convince me why we should still see one another. I then listened to his voice notes finally the following day. At this stage I was obviously sober, had a clearer mind and was genuinely sad how things went down.  I sent a voice note that was very cheerful apologizing how the other night went down from my end, for making a dramatic exit, and not hearing him out when he was explaining the circumstance to me (though in that moment with some G&amp;T’s it felt heart crushing). There were some inside jokes in the VN but I said I’d think its a shame if we left it off here considering we have gotten along like wild-fire the past two months (first month being professionally/non-romantic, though we could both tell we liked the other). He seemed so delighted and thrilled to have gotten my voice note added smileys and such, that he was happy to have gotten that and he’d reply promptly after work.

&amp;#x200B;

Then after work it was another 180, he rang me and basically gave another reason for ending it with me - the fact that after the summer I move back 1.5hr away, and because we’d be working together in the future, he didn’t want it to be messy. I was genuinely taken aback because his texts after the voice note were so positive and happy about me wanting to move past or at least talk through what happened the other night. He also voiced that if there were “fights” this early on, that it wasn’t a good sign. (despite us having worked 40hrs a week together, seeing each other on our free time for lunches and dinners, etc. with nothing but laughs and deep chats.) At that stage I felt really crushed because he had pursued it the entire time while I was interning there, knowing that I’d get the job offer as the Partners were really impressed with me. The entire time on the phone he was very cold. He said he didnt want my feelings to get hurt down the line, and that it would be better we end it now rather than later. I said I thought it would be a mistake but if thats what he wants, maybe he sees something I don’t and was right and I wouldn’t try and change his mind. We hung up. I do see where he’s coming from regarding work, but it did feel more at the time like it was one of the multiple reasons he had why we wouldn't work out which were all so sudden, when 48 hrs prior, it was all about why we should still see each other and all that he was doing because he has been enjoying getting to know me more and more, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just curious if this was an adhd thing, if I had handled it poorly giving the circumstances, etc. I’m all over the place. I am genuinely sad its over (i’ve maybe cried..). I feel like it was very abrupt. The fact we would be working together 2 years from now when my law school is finished when we had only gotten into one non-heated argument while alcohol was involved, I genuinely didn’t feel like it would be an issue. I would be working in a different department in a building of over 700 people. I felt like it was an excuse to end things with me, but it was so unexpected. Of course as a future lawyer - I can’t stop analyzing! If at the very least, perhaps I am all wrong regarding the above and I can atleast take away from this experience (and post) a better understanding of adhd and dating, even if it's never to be with him."
chaizb,3,2019-07-24,Do programs matter or are certs equally important?,NoBudsChill,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/chaizb/do_programs_matter_or_are_certs_equally_important/,"I got my bachelors a few years back (non-IT/tech subject area) and have had terrible luck with the job market so I'm looking to do an AS in an area of IT since I already have some credits I can use towards it. I spoke with an advisor and one of the professors at the IT/CS dept at a local college and they recommended a networking program.

My initial plan is to do the AS, get the certifications, and do some additional coursework/certifications while gaining some foundational experience in some sort of entry level position. From what I've read security is a big thing so I'd definitely like to incorporate that however I can, whether getting certifications and/or continuing learning post-degree.

Both programs I am looking at include internships as part of them, which I really like.

I was hoping someone one here might be able to tell me if either program is better, if one would put me in a better position to enter the industry, or if it doesn't matter.

Also, is it possible to find some entry level IT work while studying when I have my A+ and Network+ certifications? Just something to gain some experience and hopefully make more than minimum wage until getting my degree?

&amp;#x200B;

I've omitted the gen ed courses since they're irrelevant. Both programs include opportunities to take several certifications.

&amp;#x200B;

First program:

* Intro to programming
* A+
* Network +
* Cisco 1
* Cisco 2
* Project Management and Project +
* Cisco 3
* Cisco 4
* Installation, storage and compute with Windows Server
* Networking with Windows Server
* Identity with Windows Server
* Internship
* Information Systems Management
* Eligible to sit for the following certifications: CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, CCNA R&amp;S, Project+, MCSA

&amp;#x200B;

Second program:

* Computer hardware
* LANs
* Identity Security
* Cisco Router
* Linux Networking and Security
* Information Security
* Computer Virtualization Technology
* Installing and configuring Windows Server
* Administering Windows Server
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* Internship in networking
* Eligible to sit for: CompTIA+, Network+, Security+, a Cisco cert, VMware cert , Microsoft cert, Red Hat Linux cert

chall0,4,2019-07-24,Should I Leave My Job After 1 Month for a Better Offer??,FormerMango,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/chall0/should_i_leave_my_job_after_1_month_for_a_better/,"**TLDR:** Should I leave my job after only 1 month (when the job was basically created for me) if I have been offered a job that is better (pays more, better workplace environment, better benefits, more opportunity to move up)?

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my situation:

For the last year, while I completed my final year of my bachelor’s degree, I was a paid intern for a local nonprofit organization (let's call it X Organization). In January, my supervisor approached me about my plans after graduation and we started a conversation about continuing my employment in a full-time position when my internship ended in June. Essentially she was thinking about creating a new position that would encompass my tasks as the intern and add more responsibilities and she wanted to know if I was interested. I definitely was interested but nothing was set in stone; I knew nothing about the salary or schedule or job tasks or anything. I wasn’t even sure if the position would actually be created. Months went by with minimal updates and I got closer to graduating in June where I would need to start working immediately (in hindsight I should have communicated my questions and concerns throughout this time). In April, I notified my supervisor that I would was going to begin applying for full time jobs elsewhere just in case this didn’t come together. This is how I found out about an opportunity at another local organization (let’s call this Y Organization). The position would pay more, have incredible benefits, have a way more relaxed workplace environment, and there would be more opportunities to move up within the company. I did a lot of research on Y Organization and quickly became obsessed with getting this new job. Unfortunately, the hiring process took much longer than I had anticipated. I applied in May and had only gone through a phone interview by June with no end date in sight. The same week that I had this phone interview, my supervisor at X Organization gave me the official job description for the full-time position she had created for me. The position would have a 6-month trial period so it would technically end at the end of December because that is when the grant ends that will be funding the position. However, as long as the position is effective, it will continue beyond that date on new funding.

Long story short, I made the mistake of asking my current supervisor for more time to consider the offer with the hope that I would hear from Y Organization. I didn’t hear back from Y Organization in time and by that time my supervisor had made the job listing public and was accepting outside applications. At that point, I was faced with being completely unemployed if I didn’t accept the full-time position at X Organization, so I accepted it and was hired at the beginning of July (even though it was no longer my first choice). I have been employed now for almost a month and it has been fine. I am basically a case manager and while I like being able to help people, I'm already finding it difficult to stay organized and keep track of everyone that I'm working with. I definitely don't want to be a case manager forever but I know that I would be able to make this job work if I needed to. This week, I received a call from HR at Y Organization, inviting me to come in for an in-person interview. I went in for the interview yesterday and it went really well, I think I have a good shot at getting the job. 

My concern is this: **if I’m offered the job, what should I do?** My supervisor went through so much work to create this position for me and she had to vouch for me when I didn’t immediately accept the offer in the first place. Leaving my job for this new one would be a huge slap in the face after all she’s done for me and I'm terrified of the thought of turning in my notice after only 1 month. She would be furious. But at the same time, if this new job is really worth it, I don’t want to base my decision around how it will make someone else feel.

One thing I have considered is asking the employer at Y Organization if they would be willing to wait until the end of December (when my current position technically ends) for me to start. I know that’s 5 months away and common sense tells me that there’s no way they would wait that long but they’ve already waited nearly 3 months to start calling people in for in-person interviews. At the rate they’re going, 5 months isn’t *that* unreasonable.

I know I am jumping ahead of myself, there’s a good chance I won’t be offered the job and I understand that. I just want to make sure I have a plan if I am offered the job. It’s very important to me that I make a good decision for myself but also for my current employer.

Thoughts? Advice?"
chbamx,14,2019-07-24,USC vs Northwestern for CS (Admitted to both),StarryEyedKid,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/chbamx/usc_vs_northwestern_for_cs_admitted_to_both/,"For some context, I decided to apply to most colleges as a transfer rather than in high school to save some money. I highly recommend this option as it has already saved me $60K in tuition. For my dilemma now, I am having to choose between USC as a spring admit and Northwestern for my major, Computer Science. By the way, the cost is around the same. I am having trouble deciding between them and the deadline is soon so any advice would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**USC**

* Location is a big plus as California has really nice weather and is close to my home. Additionally, being in LA gives much greater proximity to Silicon Valley and all the tech startups that I would be applying to internships for.
* Social life is likely better at USC from what I've heard from people due to the larger student body and huge party culture. I don't really know if this will apply to me since I'm not much of a partygoer and I don't care about sports.
* Some cons include the huge student population as it gives a state school vibe that I'm currently trying to escape from. Additionally, they gave me spring acceptance which could end up impacting internships or social life if I miss the start of the school year and that scares me.
* Used to be my dream school in college but the more I learn about it, the more it seems like a place that gamed the rankings than a school that truly deserves its rankings/prestige. I still really like a lot of things about USC like the curriculum I will be taking there and the overall vibe of the school.

**Northwestern**

* I really like the pre-professional emphasis of Northwestern as one of the things I disliked about my current college is how relaxed everyone was and how careers seemed to be an afterthought. This environment seems like something that might be more helpful for me but also a lot more stressful.
* Northwestern seems to have some really cool clubs and academic programs like their Kelloggs certificate which might be helpful in pursuing my interests and applying to an MBA later on. That being said, there's a lot of time sacrifice associated with that.
* There are also some big cons with Northwestern including the quarter system which makes it harder to get internships. That being said, Stanford and a lot of the UCs are on the quarter system so it's definitely possible. Location is a big con with that long winter and being far away from either of the coasts.
* Lastly, an overall thing is that Northwestern is applying my credits as social science/humanities electives so while I'm still on track to graduate, it means that I'll only be taking technical courses

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm slightly leaning towards Northwestern for the more pre-professional emphasis over sports/partying but the technical course load and location are pretty big negatives that keep me from making a clear decision. I think I'd be happy at both schools but I'm not sure which one is better for me."

I'm a F 21 and currently working as an intern at a pretty small 10 person company. The company has hired 2 interns for the summer I was hired on as the graphic designer and the other was hired as a marketing associate. We have been asked to work on multiple projects together where he is supposed to put together the text and I'm supposed to handle the designs for marketing materials like books, brochures, and presentations. We've been working together for a couple of months now and he has barely helped me with any of the projects and I end up doing the majority of his job as well as my part. If he does help it is after I ask him at least 5 times to do it and he ends up doing the bare minimum of what I ask him to do or just the complete opposite for what I asked.  

It is starting to make the work process longer than it needs to be and disrupts my workflow. Whenever he and I talk to or show off a project to a higher-up he acts like he's been helping the entire way through the project basically taking half credit for my work. He also will talk down on my work sometimes in front of me and the higher-ups even though I have heard nothing but positive responses to things I've made thus far.  It is not just our group projects he doesn't do it any work in general. For example, today during the workday he sat at his desk all day watching YouTube videos and online shopping. I can't say I stay focused the from the moment I show up until I leave but I still get my work done in a timely manner.

This is the first time I have dealt with a co-worker like this. I would tell someone higher up in the company but of course, the guy that oversees the interns is his older brother. I also don't want to go complain and then it becomes an awkward or hostile work environment between him and I. I need advice!"

It was just her and I living in a house.   


I received an offer to go back to California for the fall too. So I called her in May to let her know. She was ecstatic to have me back living with her. She told me to give her a call closer to the fall. Which I have attempted to do so recently.  


I first tried texting and calling her a few weeks ago, but received no answer in either way. Her phone will ring completely, then go to voicemail. I had left voicemails. Yesterday, I tried messaging her on facebook, but still have yet to hear anything either. I do not have any of her relative's contacts, and since I am not friends with her on facebook, I cannot view any of her friends. I also do not have any neighbor's contact information.  


I am unsure what happened to her, but obviously something is going on. Does anyone have any ideas on how I should go about trying to contact her or find out what happened to her? Worse comes to worst, I could write a handwritten letter and send it in the mail. I thought maybe she was out of the country, but would her phone ring completely, if so?

chc2zo,0,2019-07-24,Could you crique my statement of purpose?,fred_the_mailman,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/chc2zo/could_you_crique_my_statement_of_purpose/," 

**Introduction**

Since an early age, I had always been drawn to computers due to their sheer scale of impact on the lives of ordinary people. The fact that one can learn how to create computer software without the need for many resources, coupled with my impatient nature to learn as much as I can, drew me instantaneously to the field of software development. Many years later creating computer software has become a staple, not just in my pursuit of higher education but in my personal life as well. In addition to the rigorous courses taken at this university, which helped educate me on the fundamentals of software development, I was able to polish my skills through practical applications of projects I had built in my spare time as well as tasks I have worked on in my internship. 

**Course Work**

Pursuing my interest in software development has aided me in developing robust problem-solving skills and bettering my creativity when dealing with new or complicated tasks. Throughout the four-year Bachelors of Science program in Information Science at the University at Albany, I had many opportunities to lay the groundwork in a variety of software development aspects, aspects such as Object-Oriented Programming, Database Architecture and Management, Software Scalability, and Network Security. I had been involved in a variety of projects throughout my courses including the creation of a “Test Creation and Distribution System” for teachers, using HTML and CSS to create a seamless and responsive UI along with an SQL Server as a backend. While challenging at times, my passion for programming and willingness to learn translated into a 3.49 GPA for the Information Science and Computer Science courses I had taken in my final two and a half years at this university.

**Personal Work**

While I regard the work done in academia to be undoubtedly essential in my journey to becoming a seasoned software developer, my efforts outside the classroom were equally as necessary in realizing the true challenges of creating and maintaining software in a real-world setting. Shortly after I had graduated from high school I created an on-demand delivery start-up, Nippy, that operated in the southern half of Brooklyn. 

The backbone of this business rested on the capabilities of its website. The project involved encrypting and persisting users login credentials and personal information, persisting the information of each delivery, using AJAX to continuously update users on the status of their order, tracking each drivers GeoLocation using a GeoLocation API, and lastly, storing and processing users payment information through a third-party application, Square. This project greatly strengthened my practical knowledge of safely and securely storing and retrieving sensitive data, integrating third-party libraries to enhance an application, as well as creating an intuitive design that could keep users engaged. Throughout this project, we have completed over four-thousand orders and transactions.

Towards the middle of my senior year at SUNY Albany, I had built and currently work on an iOS application that allows users to save and organize a wide variety of media types, mobile app content, and web content from a users phone to the app itself to view and share. In addition to that, the app allows users to explore and save other users saved content. The bulk of this application was written in Objective-C which greatly enhanced my understanding of the in’s and out’s of Object-Oriented Programming. I gained a strong grasp on architectural design patterns such as MVC and Singleton which helped boost the efficiency of adding and improving on existing features. I also got my first taste of working with a JSON database, for this project I had chosen to use Firebase, a Google product. While I knew learning how to implement and navigate this type of database would be a challenge for me, I understood that using Firebase would allow me to easily integrate API’s such as Google Analytics and Cloud Functions.

**Internship Work**

My experience working in a professional environment greatly augmented the knowledge I had earned from my academic and personal work. Working on various features I made sure whichever changes or additions I made were thoroughly tested. Using Google Analytics I was able to perform A/B tests to identify which variant of a page was more likely to convert users, keep users engaged for a longer duration, and persuade users to return. I had also worked on enabling the website to become responsive to a wider array of screen sizes, allowing more users to comfortably navigate it. While operating under a supervisor I had learned the difficulties of meeting strict needs while adhering to certain constraints. This internship had also educated me on the importance of implementing features not just on the opinions of a handful of beta users but on unbiased metrics of data. This experience exposed me to the importance of data acquisition and management in order to achieve a superior product.

**Extracurriculars**

Active participation in a wide range of extracurricular activities has abetted me in becoming a more well-rounded individual. I have been part of the Adopt-A-Senior program where I spent three months looking after as well as learning from a Latvian Holocaust survivor. I participated in Blackstone LaunchPad my freshman year with my on-demand delivery startup and made it to the final round of a three-round competition. I have also been a member of the Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity and have taken part in various charity events such as Relay For Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer.

**Why I Would Like to be Accepted into this Program**

With the strong foundation, I have obtained in the field of software development through a trying four years at the University at Albany along with my internship and personal projects, I feel that I am adequately prepared to pursue a graduate degree. Through acceptance into this program, I will have the opportunity to further extend the groundwork I have built over my previous courses and aggregate additional experiences and projects under my belt to both advance my career and increase my knowledge of the field I have dedicated so much of my life to.

Wanted to ask to engineers and hiring managers how much of a role does relevant work in internship play when getting a job after graduating. I just started a zoning internship for a city and it seems that I’m not doing much engineering work but I do look at site plans and inspect areas to make sure they meet variance requirements. 

I’m a rising junior in mechanical engineering but I also have an interest in the civil engineering field hence why I went to a city job. Though it’s early, I’m willing to leave if the work does not compliment my education in any way as this is what internships are for. 

Many thanks."

I know so want to get a Masters degree and possibly a PhD but I’m not sure what field. I am doing astrophysics research now, which is cool, but I’m kind of miserable bc it’s all computational, and I have absolutely no experience (and a fair bit of anxiety) and my advisor is a “baptism by fire” kind of dude which only makes things worse. I am interested in going into aerospace or mechanical engineering, or instrumentation physics. I am probably going to wait a year to apply (apply in 2020 for 2021 enrollment) because I know I’m not ready. I’m also got thrown a finance  internship at my regular summer job, which I am enjoying more than I ever anticipated, so that is also on the table. I’m doing a science communications internship this coming spring.

My question is what should I do to make applications, once I do figure out which path I want to go down, to make myself seem worth accepting? I have an okay GPA (3.4), and I have people who will write good letters of recommendation. I just don’t know how to make myself marketable because of my sprawled out background.  I know skills are transferable between the fields above to some extent (general math skills and such) but I know that if I do anything other than pure physics there will be large gaps in my knowledge. Any advice on how to make a good application/build my CV in an appropriate manner for any of the specific fields, or in general? TIA"
chdeyn,1,2019-07-24,I’m a quiet and anxious 21 year old and I’m trying to get a job,acartse,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/chdeyn/im_a_quiet_and_anxious_21_year_old_and_im_trying/,"So I’m 21, and I’ve had a few jobs throughout the years, but all of them have been seasonal and easy to land. 

When I was in high school I helped my mom out at the practice she worked for, and because I was her daughter I never had a real interview, one day I went in and basically just started working there. I worked at that job on school breaks until I went away to university. During my first year at university I didn’t worry about getting a job because my parents wanted me to focus on my education, but after my second year I felt that I needed to get some real job experience and started my search. In my second year at uni I got a job at our bookstore, and there wasn’t really an interview for it. I applied for the job online and was invited for an “interview” that wasn’t actually an interview, but rather a meeting where a group of us went in to fill out some forms so we could start working. I worked that job until my final semester when I needed to get an internship to finish up my degree. So, I applied for an internship at this non profit and it was not hard to get, at all. There wasn’t an interview for this internship, all I had to do was fill out an application, get a background check, and complete my orientation. 

All of these jobs were easy enough, but what they all have in common that has led to me feeling at a disadvantage is none of them have required a real interview. That hasn’t been a bad thing for me in the past, but now that I’m looking for a more “adult” job I know that I’m going to have to do interviews, and it just makes me anxious. To paint a picture of how anxious interviews make me, I actually had to do an interview for one of the grad programs I applied to, and I did terribly at it. It took me too long to answer the questions, I asked for clarity multiple times, and I choked over my words throughout the entire interview. I just couldn’t seem to get my head straight and it was an awful experience. I ended up not getting accepted into that school, and I feel that it is due to my lack of interview skills.

Anyways, I’m about to start a Master’s program at a school that didn’t require me to interview before being accepted, and I want a job so I can sustain life, but also have something to fill up my days when I’m not in my classes. I’ve looked into working at learning centers and I even had an interview at one of them, but unfortunately things didn’t work out because of the schedule of my classes. Another thing with that interview is that the people interviewing me included a family friend and her boss, so the entire time the family friend was vouching for me, but during the interview her higher up kept telling me that I was shy and I “needed to break out of that.” Anyways I was still offered the position, but I truly feel that it’s because I know someone who knew someone. 

I just feel that me being quiet is often seen as a weakness, and I am unsure of how to overcome that. I’m a very strong person on paper, in emails, and even on the phone. I know I can present myself strongly in certain situations, but something about being face to face with another person while they’re asking tricky questions just gets to me. I really need help because I want to be well rounded and viewed as such. I know I am a hard worker, but it takes me a while to get comfortable. I guess what I want to know is how do I change myself to not be so anxious? How do I make myself comfortable (or at least fake it) when I’m in an uncomfortable situation? How do I get hiring managers to hire me when I’m a quieter applicant than others? 

TLDR: I have very minimal experiences with the interview process and I get anxious when I think about having to complete interviews. I’ve applied to a few jobs, but thinking about having to complete an interview makes me not want to apply to jobs at all. I feel that my anxiety, quiet demeanor, and “ shyness are all holding me back and I don’t know how to overcome them so I can actually get a job."
chdz3z,1,2019-07-24,"My mom is trying to help, but is holding me back from my future and won’t listen. I’ve lived here my whole life, including college.... my mom thinks she’s helping me but she really isn’t. And I’m becoming depressed from it...",moonshine-bih,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/chdz3z/my_mom_is_trying_to_help_but_is_holding_me_back/,"My parents divorced when I was about 3 years old and ever since, my mom has raised myself and my sister without much help from my dad til I was around 13... he’s been out of the picture since I was 13. 

My mom is one of my favorite people. But she is SO dramatic. Ever since I started growing up, she’s gotten harder to deal with. The older I get the more she seems to treat me like a baby.. for example, I was dating two guys, one for 2.5 years at age 17/18, and another for 1.5 years at age 20/21, she would constantly call me and yell at me to come home and stop spending so much time with them because she needed me to help at home. I’d come home and she was fine and there was nothing to do. She always wanted them to pay for me, never half and half. Never wanted me to stay over event though my sister, who is younger(19), could do what she pleases for the most part..

So there’s some background.. now, something WAY more important.  I am 22 years old, just graduated college (first in the family) and finishing up a full time internship with a minor league team that I have interned for as a game day for 2 other seasons. I have amazing experience in sports. I have come so far from being a shy person who was scared of everything, to being out going and performing during the games, calling, and approaching people. This internship means the world to me. It has gotten me multiple interviews and gave me the chance to travel to other stadiums to interview. I have been doing this and college to get somewhere and make something of myself. 

I will most likely need to move. There is absolutely nothing 30 minutes or less around my home that is hiring. Ive looked for hours. I sit at my current job looking on websites like indeed and can’t find anything. So I tell my mom, I need to move. She doesn’t want to hear it. All I get is a lecture on how rent is expensive (not like I can’t find cheaper rent or a roommate). I get told about bills, food, gas, everything. I understand this. I do. But my mom is going to run me dry by making me stay here. I have a part time job that will help me save, but not much.... and what I want to work for is hiring now. I also need a new car, and have money to use for a loan. She knows this and tells me “you need a car” but then goes about buys stuff for me to get my car fixed rather than just get a new car....

We got in a heated argument last night about me looking for jobs. I would mention ones around here and to her they’re “bad” or not good enough. So I mention moving and she doesn’t want that. I know she wants me safe and secure, but she fucked up with money and now it’s holding me back. We live with my grandparents because of it, and they make my life hard too......Its like she wants me to work a high school/college part time job forever... which is dumb and contradicting to her wanting me to save.

 I don’t want to end up like her financially. Which is why I’m working so hard. My internship pays shitty, and my hours suck, but it is helping me find jobs all over the country. I told her it isn’t me just thinking I know what I’m doing, I’m getting this advice from people her age and older at work. She refuses to help me with money for moving because she doesn’t have it either. Even if I say a job will help me, she says “no it’s not a good idea.” I’m so scared and confused on what to do. 


I don’t know what to do. I need help. Guidance. Advice. Words. Anything. Please, please help."

Does CCleaner delete important Drake Tax Software/Quickbooks files?,sdsubro,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/chewub/urgent_does_ccleaner_delete_important_drake_tax/,"I recently started an internship for a personal accountant/EA and was asked to help him set up a remote desktop program and free up space on his hard drives. His C: hard drive had only 20 MB or so of free space on it so I ran a Windows Disk Cleanup and freed up around 2GB. I then proceeded to download CCleaner to clean up all the temporary files on his hard drives. After analyzing stupid me misread 800,000 MB as 800,000 KB and proceeded to run the cleaner. BUT I did make a backup before doing all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is does Drake Tax Software or Intuit Quickbooks store any valuable information in System Temporary files, or any files that the default settings of CCleaner would wipe out? If so, I would need to restore his hard drive but if not I just freed up 800 GB of space! Any information would be helpful, I was panicking for a few minutes."

Feel completely lost",koolaidchildren,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/chf2i3/took_a_medical_leave_still_dont_feel_ready_feel/,"I go to a college in a really big city (incoming junior). In the Fall semester during finals in December, I had a panic attack (not sure if school related or not) which ever since that day I never really felt the same. I'm pretty sure it caused agoraphobia which made me scared of leaving the house. Didn't really know what I was experiencing (was my first panic attack) so I tried going back to college in January and it just made things a lot worse, got multiple panic attacks, had to go to the ER, and basically constantly nauseous and dizzy from the anxiety. Decided to opt for a medical leave at the last possible day and hope I recover for summer classes.

Went back to my parents, did a short internship, got a psychiatrist to prescribe me (the wrong) medication. Still had a panic attack maybe every week and dreaded going outside but I felt like I was good enough to do summer classes, so I returned. That wasn't successful, the agoraphobia came back strong and public transportation (the metro) is a huge trigger for my panic so I realized I'm still not well enough.

Got a psychiatrist to prescribe me different meds and I'm also getting therapy. The meds take a while to work and it's already been 8 weeks on it and I'm maybe feeling some improvement very very slowly.

But, yesterday I had a panic attack at the barber while cutting my hair, which made me really upset and realized I have barely progressed and feel like I might not be up to the task of college which is in nearly 5 weeks.

I feel completely lost and feel like I'm failing my parents. They're being supportive but I know deep down they wish I was healthy and ready to return at this point. It's a shame because my grades were great (3.9 GPA) and I had a solid circle of friends so I don't want to give up but at this point I'm not sure I have a choice.

I'm thinking I may need a new environment and transfer, but its too late for Fall/Spring 2020 enrollment for most colleges, and there's a chance my problem may just spur up there too. Another option is an online degree, but I know there's a lot of negatives to that as well. All of this stress and uncertainty is giving me depression and some suicidal thoughts are starting to creep in."

chhxso,1,2019-07-24,Should I adopt my aunt’s dog?,aimle15,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/chhxso/should_i_adopt_my_aunts_dog/,"My aunt got a dog about 2 years ago because her granddaughter was living with her and she wanted one. Now that her granddaughter only stays a weekend every month, the dog is constantly by himself because my aunt is newly retired and living life (rightfully so), but there’s a few concerns I have, but I don’t think they rise to the level or neglect or anything serious like that:
-He isn’t house trained (he gets the concept of the potty pad, but misses). 
-He doesn’t get walked enough
-She never brings him anywhere except for short walks. 
-He could use a good groom (although he did just have a bath)
-His nails need to be clipped. 

He’s honestly such a good boy, he has great intentions, all of it, really the only problem is he isn’t house trained. 

The reasons I’m holding back are what conflict me. My apartment for school is about 2 hours away from house (he’s fine in the car though). I come home 3/4 weekends a month because my girlfriend lives near my hometown. Because I have two cats at my house, he would need to go back with my aunt for the weekends and I don’t think his training would be reinforced. 

The not being house trained also plays into that for my apartment. I’ve checked over my schedule for next semester and I know I’d have an ample amount of time to take him out and throughout the day, but what if he leaves a mess? I say that because last year I had a roommate who had a dog and was not potty trained, and while obviously it was her responsibility to clean it up, it was almost unavoidable. The dog would pee or poop outside my door and I’d wake up in the middle night and step in dog shit. 
The dog would pee in the bathroom so I had no choice, but to clean it up when my roommate already left for class and I needed to get to the shower. He would pee or poop in the kitchen and I didn’t want to look at it while cooking. I would never want to place that burden on someone cause I know what it’s like. 

Lastly I’m moving to CO in two Septembers. The whole reason for us to move is to explore life and a new state (we’re from the east coast). It’s going to be expensive to have to board him or bring him every time with us when we want to travel, yet I would argue it would be financially possible. I talked to my girlfriend about it because I’d be moving with her and she doesn’t necessarily want the dog because we have discussed getting a puppy or kitten together, but did say that we could come to some agreement about it being my dog, not OUR dog. 

I dog sat him for three days and feel in love and feel so bad because all my aunt does is yell at him because he has so much energy, but she could fix that if she just put in some more effort.... 

I loved every part of it, having to take him for walks, bringing him places with me, having someone so excited to see you when you get home, etc., but I don’t know if this would be the smartest move for everyone involved. Obviously I care about the dog, but I need to care about myself as well. 


While that’s true, there’s benefits too. I get very lonely most weeks after class because all my friends commute or work after, so I just go home and sit in an empty apartment. I basically wait for the weekend to come all week so I can go back home. I’m in law school, so stress levels can be very high, but also having a dog could help that. It would also get my out of the house more. I love going for walks, but my motivation drops after a day of an internship then classes. 
Any advice?"

The problem is, I've been having trouble staying motivated; like all things I've ever tried to start working on (I get distracted really easily and I can't stand myself for it). I started working on Data Science courses on Dataquest and on Edx at my own pace, as well as reading ATBS. It's not like I'm trying to finish it all as I'm not super pressed for time, but I'm trying to use different resources to learn as much as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I wouldn't say coding is necessarily my ""passion."" I somewhat enjoy the finished project, and the problem solving aspect, but it's not something I would necessarily do for a hobby, at least based on what I've done so far. Maybe that's the reason I can't stay motivated. People say you need to find a project you're invested in and passionate about, but I can't think of any. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the projects I've worked on from the first couple chapters of ATBS didn't work out well and gave me errors when I entered them into IDLE like I was prompted by the book. I tried troubleshooting and looking online for my specific problem, but I found no answers. I could enter the code and ask y'all if anyone is willing to help, but I just don't what exact format my code should be entered in and asked - if that makes any sense.

I just got transferred into ENG CS and will be a junior in the fall. I am planning to apply for grad school. For that, I need three letters of recommendation.  

Now, I think that I can get one of them from my current summer internship. So there are still two left. Where can I get them? Will professor give letters of recommendation to CAs?  Need some tips and suggestions.

Thanks!"
chkhfa,43,2019-07-25,Worked hard in college but it didn't amount to anything - feeling lost about (lack of) career?,PretendLettuce,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/chkhfa/worked_hard_in_college_but_it_didnt_amount_to/,"I completed over 5 internships while in college in order to make sure I could land a job in the art world. After I graduated, I moved to Los Angeles, and spent a year interning at an art gallery. The internship eventually became a full time job, but after doing the work of 2-3 roles for minimal hourly wage (that I could barely survive on), I got fed up with the arts and decided to change industry. I began job-searching, and it took me 2 years to land a new job. I got a job at a creative agency shortly after I quit, and was hoping this could be my new long-term career. Little did I know, the company was dysfunctional, and I lost my job as part of the company-wide layoff after a few months of working. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm back to job hunting, and I feel increasingly depressed and lost. Although I've acquired a lot of skills, and have held impressive titles and achieved many accomplishments, I feel like they are irrelevant and ultimately amount to nothing. The skills I have, although very varied (administrative, social media, client relationship management, project management, etc.), have not helped me in landing any ""regular"" 9-5 corporate office job with above minimum wage pay and usual benefits. The industries I'm interested in are creative (fashion, music, arts, etc.), and they don't pay well, or are too competitive. I even applied to other regular jobs in advertising or tech, but I still haven't landed an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a difficult time motivating myself, as I seem to run into constant bad luck when it comes to job searching. My peers have stable jobs and are making a lot more money than I do, despite being in equally competitive fields like entertainment. A part of me wants to use this opportunity to explore the fields I'm interested in, like fashion or music, as I'm 26 and already don't have a job. But another part of me wants to make money and be able to enjoy the benefits of health insurance and vacations. I feel like I should be an adult with a career, and to be able to invest in things and have social status. But no matter how hard I try, I keep running into dead ends. What can I do to get out of this funk? Should I try to explore my interests and accept making less money in order to find out what my passion/career is?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 26 years old and lost. Bad luck at finding jobs. Not sure if I should find a stable job, or explore my interests in order to find a career."

A month ago I started an internship just after finishing my first year in university. To be honest, I felt kind of tired and mentally withdrawn, but I thought such a thing would refresh me. The interview went well, however they said I didn't know most of the technologies they work with (it is a CS internship), but it would be fine. They said they would contact me over email, but never did, so I wrote one and they said I am hired. Next day we met up in their office to ""figure out a plan"", but one was never presented. They just said you are in educational period and I would get frequent tests and small tasks to do. So I started and they gave me a task with all the stuff I mentioned I didn't know. This is fine by me, but if I asked a question I received a vague abstract answer of the sort ""it isn't like that, keep searching"", or the answer was a question (theoretical) itself that had nothing to do with the task. 3 weeks in, I'm keen on quitting, since two days ago they sent me their program, which said that I must do 8+ hours of work, be there after 7pm (even though in the applying document I selected four hours, which was an option in the form), plus they expect me to continue during university (8 hours/day and if I can't, catch up on a day I don't spend many hours in uni). I'm sure that I want to resign, but my mentor/boss (the company is small, so everything is a bit tied up) is pretty kind with me even when he gives me those abstract answers, so I want to quit in a good manner. I thought about resigning via email, because in such case I can present all my arguments why I'm quitting in a structured manner, but I read that it is considered disrespectful. On the other hand, if I speak to the mentor, he will start to talk me over and I'm afraid I won't be able to say no. The thought of it is killing me, yet I want it to end as soon as possible. Thanks for reading and any suggestions will be well appreciated.

PS: I haven't signed a contract and I'm not getting paid."

The self learning went by really slow but over a couple of years, I managed to do a few books and courses and made a portfolio website for my projects. I started applying for jobs a month and a half ago and I now have two offers in hand. I don't have a very well-defined career goal apart from wanting to work as a data scientist or engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

Company A: data analyst at big marketing agency (big 4 for marketing). I don't like the glassdoor reviews though. All of them mention office politics and extremely long hours (which I hate to be honest). During the interviews, they mentioned they had around 8 people in the data team but that most people have left and they only have 3 now so they are trying to rebuild. I was told that I would need to work on a lot of different things depending on the needs of the company's clients which could include non-data stuff too.

&amp;#x200B;

Company B: data engineering internship for 3 months at a well-established startup fully backed/owned by a huge global bank. I had applied for a data analytics internship but they offered me data engineering even though the job listing has certain tools that I haven't used before (and they know it). The pay is 40% of Company A's salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards company B because it gave off a nicer vibe and because I'll be working directly under someone's supervision which is more reassuring since this is my first job in data. The only downside is that it's an internship so I might need to go through the very exhausting job application process again if Company B doesn't convert me to full time after internship. The salary difference isn't a huge factor. I want to make the best long-term decision.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Does it make sense for me to turn down a job for an internship just because I like internship company more?"

* Stay at this school 2 more years to get an Info Sci degree
* Transfer somewhere else and try to complete a CS program in 2 years (not sure how feasible this is because my GPA is pretty low)
* Try and find some low level job that will hire me without a degree

My 2 first years was composed of Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science (with soft skills lessons too and 2 languages).

On my 3rd year i went one semester aboard to London where i had some  basics for AI for example. Then back to France i had more  mathematics/Physics/IT. Actually i'm doing a 4 month internship in a big French company working  on Communication and Security. I have multiple experiences on  internships or contract job as a developper.

Next year i have to do a 6 month internship starting on  February/March (But i can also do a V.I.E. which is a contract based job  for a french company in foreign countries, and longer than 6 months).

And i would like to do make this internship in a foreign country and  especially USA (N.Y. or SF would be nice but looking for suggestions).

The question is : Do i have my chances to find an internship ? 

Where do i have to look ? I did some research on SE/LinkedIn but i don't know if there are any other ways.

And another question : Is an internship income enough to live in USA ?  In France internship are poor paid in comparison to an engineer doing  the same job so i don't know."

Hello,

Honestly, I do not know what I am doing with my life. I’m 23 years old, and I graduated from college a year ago. I felt this depression and anxiety when I was about 20 because I felt like I was lying to myself by studying something I didn’t enjoy, and I felt miserable from all my office internships. I graduated top of the class, but I think I was working hard for all the wrong reasons -- to get away from reality. Since graduating, I’m struggling with what to do next because I feel so lost. I initially wanted to just work part time as I figure myself out.

Fast forward to today- I’ve been working full time, but hopping job to job every 6 months-- something I am certainly not proud of. I am on my 3rd job right now. At first, I thought I didn’t like my job because my previous supervisors were crazy. But after settling into my 3rd job, I feel that same frustration and misery, but just upon myself. My co-workers, supervisor, and company culture is fine, so I know it’s not the job, but me that is the issue. I don’t know where this feeling is deriving from-- am I just not fit for office work? Is this all depression? Do I just need to grow up?

After working all day, I come home and eat. And then just lay in bed until the next day. I don’t have any motivation to do anything. For example, I used to go to the gym daily since high school, but the thought of going to the gym doesn’t exist anymore. Any will and energy is put into waking up for work and working for those 8 hours. Rinse and repeat.

The only time I felt alive and hopeful was the time I had in between my job hopping (the time from leaving one job and waiting for the next). At this time, I didn’t work. I felt like I could process my thoughts out a bit more and I just felt free.. I mean of course, I wasn’t working 8 hours a day? I don’t know..

I know I enjoy video editing, photography, and being creative with digital media. In the perfect world, I would love to work for myself in an non-office setting, or at least in a setting where I have control over my time. I struggle with the concept of office work; I feel like my life revolves around work Monday through Friday, and I am limited to living life only 2 days of the week. I just want to be mentally okay again, and I am thinking of what I can do to better myself.

* Quit job, work part time?
* Quit job, teach abroad (I love teaching)?
* Keep job, save up a bit, have goals with my hobbies (e.g. create blog, work out again, etc.)?

I know. I sound/am like a typical Millennial complaining. Maybe I am. I just feel so stuck and lost right now. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you."

I feel like everything I learned in college is not enough for me to apply to these jobs. They expect you to know so much more which sucks because you don't have experience in the first place! It definitely feels like they want you to know beyond the basics even for an entry level job. My internship isn't really giving me good experience except maybe one small project I can include in my resume and that's not even that impressive or challenging, just basic stuff. I definitely don't see myself working here. But I also am scared that I'm not prepared to apply for the real coding jobs so I'm just stuck in this rut. 

&amp;#x200B;

In your experience with coding interviews or being in the software industry, how do you determine if one is ready to start applying? Is it based on your basic knowledge of programming or your desire to learn? Both? Is even knowing just the basics of coding enough to apply?

chrfru,2,2019-07-25,Classwork is not enough,mduffor,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/chrfru/classwork_is_not_enough/,"Sorry everyone, but I need to rant a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm digging through resumes to try and hire 2 game programmers for our team.  I've been through about 3 dozen or so resumes so far, though I've looked through hundreds of resumes for previous positions we've filled.  There's one particular point I'd like to drive home to everyone out there either in school or currently looking for a job.

&amp;#x200B;

Classwork is not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

If the only thing on your resume is work you've done as part of a class, and maybe a project or two you've done as an Intern for some company, it simply isn't enough to get hired.  For programmers especially, if you have a degree or certificate from somewhere that teaches general game programming where you spent more time setting stuff up in Unity's interface than in straight up writing code and learning CompSci fundamentals, then I simply cannot trust that your programming skills are strong.  If you don't have a link to a portfolio or GitHub account, I can't fully determine what your skills are.  If your GitHub account only contains classwork, the comments from the auto-generated Unity scripts are still in there (i.e. ""Update is called once per frame""), or the longest script you've written is under 100 lines, then don't even bother because it won't help.

&amp;#x200B;

You HAVE to do your own projects.  You HAVE to take the theory you learned in class and actually apply it to something.  You HAVE to spend a LOT of time outside of class learning and practicing additional stuff, because what you are exposed to in class alone is not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you didn't go to school, you'd better have a bunch of code examples that show that you understand the principles that would be taught in a Comp Sci program.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, back to looking for the needle in the haystack.  Gonna go reject a bunch of people's resumes now.  Cheers."

The use, storage, and protection of large sets of information seem to be playing a larger and larger role in our society and have been increasingly valuable in the advent of intuitive and efficient software. The prospects of what I can gain from this masters program in terms of professional advancement and an overall greater role in the industry are of great value to me. With the strong foundation, I have obtained in the field of software development through a trying four years at the University at Albany along with my internship and personal projects, I feel that I am adequately prepared to pursue the courses in this program.

**Introduction**

Since the age of thirteen, I had been fascinated with programming since it allowed me to create nearly any cool idea my young mind could come up with, this fascination inevitably led me to the field of software development. It hadn’t been until I was exposed to my initial information science and CEHC courses that I had taken up an interest in big data. The storage, management, and security of large sets of data seem to be playing a larger and larger role in our society and have been increasingly valuable in the advent of intuitive and efficient software. The prospects of what I can gain from this masters program in terms of professional advancement and an overall greater role in the industry are of great value to me. With the strong foundation I have obtained in the field of software development through a trying four years at the University at Albany along with my internship and personal projects, I feel that I am adequately prepared to pursue the courses in this program. I am particularly interested in conducting research in the area of data analytics to perform statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

**Course Work**

Throughout my four years, I had many opportunities to lay the groundwork in a variety of software development aspects, aspects such as Object-Oriented Programming, Database Architecture and Management, Software Scalability, and Network Security. I have been involved in a variety of projects throughout my courses including the creation of a “Test Creation and Distribution System”. As part of a team of five, I was tasked with implementing a backend for this system. I had created an SQL backend, ensuring there were as few vulnerabilities as possible I made sure to encrypt sensitive information, allow and restrict access where specifically needed, and prevent SQL injections by avoiding direct SQL queries. This project helped broaden my skills in data protection and database security. While my courses were challenging at times, my passion for programming and willingness to learn translated into a 3.49 GPA for the Information Science and Computer Science courses I had taken in my final two and a half years at this university.

**Internship Work**

The experience I earned as a result of my internship greatly augmented the knowledge I had earned from my academic work. During my internship, I had been involved in the rollout of new features. I performed A/B tests to identify which variant of a page or feature was more likely to convert users, keep users engaged for a longer duration, and persuade users to return. While operating under a supervisor I had learned the difficulties of meeting strict needs while adhering to specific constraints. This internship has also educated me on the importance of implementing features not just on the opinions of a handful of beta users but on unbiased metrics of data while simultaneously showing me the importance of data acquisition and management in order to achieve a superior product.

**Personal Work**

While I regard the work done in my classes and internship to be undoubtedly essential to my career, my personal efforts were equally as necessary in realizing the challenges I’d face in a real-world setting. Shortly after I had graduated from high school I created an on-demand delivery start-up, Nippy, that operated in the southern half of Brooklyn. The project involved encrypting and persisting users login credentials, personal information, and the information of each delivery, using AJAX to continuously update users on the status of their order, and handle payment information through a third-party service, Square. This project greatly strengthened my practical knowledge of safely storing and retrieving sensitive data and integrating reputable third-party applications to process data. Throughout this project, we had completed over four-thousand orders and transactions.

Towards the middle of my senior year at SUNY Albany, I had built and currently work on an iOS application that allows users to save and organize a wide variety of media types and mobile content from a users phone to the app itself to view and share. The bulk of this application was written in Objective-C which greatly enhanced my understanding of the in’s and out’s of Object-Oriented Programming. By this point, I had already completed most of my programs course-work and was not going to allow my new-found knowledge to go unused. I integrated Google Analytics into my application and studied the time spent on each page, the number of click events across each feature, and overall average user retention. Gathering this data proved to be priceless as it allowed me to isolate weak points in my app and expand on engaging features.

**Extracurriculars**

Active participation in a wide array of extracurricular activities has abetted me in becoming a more well-rounded individual. I have been involved in the Adopt-A-Senior program where I spent three months looking after as well as learning from a Latvian Holocaust survivor. I have also been a member of the Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity and have taken part in various charity events such as Relay For Life and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer. While I did not explicitly work with any data gathering or analyzing software, these experiences opened up my eyes to the benevolent capabilities of data management. My involvement in the breast cancer walk inspired me to do some research which led me to the discovery that big data can be used to study the patterns of cancer cells and match patients to others who have had similar symptoms to quickly find successful treatments. 

**Why I Would Like to be Accepted into this Program**

Through acceptance into this program, I will have the opportunity to further extend the groundwork I have built over my previous courses and aggregate additional experiences and projects under my belt to both advance my career and increase my knowledge in the field I have dedicated a significant portion of my life to. I strongly believe that the MS program in Information Science offered by this university will allow me to grow and thrive in a setting where I can learn from those more talented than I. The practical applications of this programs rigorous course work will undeniably amplify my current abilities as well as supply me with wisdom that will enable me to realize my personal and professional goals."

I got reached out for an interview to talk to T-Mobile’s TechX team and just wanted to see if any of you all know how the process works and what it’s like to work there. 

Just some general questions I have and any information would be gladly appreciated! 

1) How’s the interview process like? What type of questions do they ask? 

2) I see that it’s a 9 month commitment (for me it says October - June), so I was wondering does it conflict when trying to find other jobs bc I do want to find another engineering internship for the summer of 2020, but I’m concerned since this one spills into June that it’ll interfere. 

3) I do recognize it’s part-time, so I just want to ask if anyone has worked there has it ever conflicted with school? I guess what I’m asking here is that did it ever feel like you missed out on things due to the job? 

4) And lastly, how’s it like working there if one were to get hired? Is the atmosphere great for growth and learning or is it just one of those internships where you barely learn and kind of “get it out of the way?”

I am currently interning as a Data Scientist at a Fortune 500. I always thought I wanted to go into SWE then eventually into PM, this internship has changed my perspective. I would love to know what people who have experience in one of these roles thinks of it!

Here is my basic understanding of the roles

* Project Manager (PM):
   * Good upward movement
   * Higher pay
   * Seen as more ""senior""
   * Better long term viability
   * Not as transferable of a skill as software development
   * Greatly abstracted from actual technical work
   * I am a people person (president of largest CS org on campus)
* Software Engineer (SWE):
   * Gets to stay in the trenches and write code
   * Vague as to what a SWE will actually be doing at a company (seems like a ""jack of all trades"")
   * Potential outsourcing
   * Good skill transferability
* Data Scientist (DS)
   * Huge boom in jobs
   * Highest job satisfaction
   * A lot of non CS majors (Physics, Chemistry, Math)
      * Although there is nothing wrong with this, if there are too many on one team then code quality and practices start to suffer. For example, the place I work at does not have Kanban boards, code review, commented code, code hygiene, structure.
   * Jupyter lab -&gt; A pervasive code editor in the DS community, its bad, just bad.
   * The possibility for needing a high degree (like masters or PhD) especially for Machine Learning which is what I am doing right now and potentially want to go into.

Thanks!"

We're on our 4th week now and I've basically authored the entire project codebase and set up deployment stuff. 

After feeling like she had nothing to do she started working on her first larger feature (sprint goal). Yesterday she finished the first iteration after 1.5 days of working at it. Basically it's 200 lines of poorly optimised and poorly written code (the first edition had an indentation level of 12). The code works but I wrote my own solution today in the afternoon with a much faster and more modular solution in 60 lines. (Granted, performance is not an issue, it's just more readable and happens to also be faster)

The problem is that I don't know if I should commit this code seeing as she might already feel very unconfident in her abilities and this might demoralize her completely as it's her first major contribution. Any advise? My solution uses another data structure which I can't really gradually apply to her code. It's so much more effort to incrementally improve her code than just using my solution.

I want to do well in this internship and I feel that we're collectively responsible for the quality of the code. Our supervisors probably already noticed that she's not doing too well and I feel like a control freak. I just really don't want my name on her bad code (approving it into production).

How do I handle this to show my ability to work in a team and my coding ability?"

chv3br,22,2019-07-25,Experience as a UCSD Computer Science Student,etha7,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/chv3br/experience_as_a_ucsd_computer_science_student/,"Reams of students in the CS program here get the same kind of opportunities as students from other schools. The majority of my friends got internships and later job offers at Google, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram etc... They definitely weren't the best students on paper, but they were passionate about the material and had the expertise to back it up. In other words they were less focused on ""prestige"" and more focused on learning, growing, and connecting with other passionate people.  People who came from broken homes found immense success here. 

The more academically minded routinely got REUs at UCLA, UCB, Harvard, UChicago, etc..... The common denominator was establishing a relationship with the faculty, and pursuing the material beyond the bare minimum.  If you show even a little interest in learning, the faculty by and large WILL make time for you. 

I happen to know for a fact that managers at Amazon literally select resumes at random when selecting possible interns. So I hope anyone terrified for or angry about their future realizes that past a certain threshold, your ""prestige"" matters infinitely less than your actual demonstrable knowledge, and unfortunately often, random chance. **Congratulations,** being here means you're past that threshold.  


From bountiful personal experience, the people and companies that **do** filter according ""prestige"" have the most insufferable/judgmental/toxic work environment. Companies worth their salt know to come here and recruit, and they do so aggressively. 

I hope y'all know you're worth more than your ""prestige"" and deserve better than to feel pressured to grow it. I was terribly anxious and fearful that I'd fucked myself by not getting into other schools. But it turns out that the people who matter, and who deserve your respect **actually will** treat you like a human being instead of a spreadsheet of SATs, ACTs, GPA, etc.... These people can afford you limitless opportunity.

chv9hg,1,2019-07-25,Clarification on ajax and CORS,sparkas,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/chv9hg/clarification_on_ajax_and_cors/,"I'm nearly done with my internship for the summer. Part of it involves calling the web services of enterprise internal webapp A from my team's enterprise internal webapp B. I was eventually advised to use ajax for efficiency, which I didn't know existed until I was told to use it, and have been unable to get through the CORS issue. 

This is my current understanding of trying to work with cross domain requests with ajax

* the server for webapp A has to be configured to allow cross domain requests to work with ajax
* IF webapp A's server is configured for such a thing then it sends back a response that includes a header with Access-Control-Allow-Origin:value. (I have never seen this header on a response from the server.)
* If I try to use jsonp to work around the same origin policy and avoid CORS errors altogether, it might work but would also create a vulnerability within the webapp

Is there a clear point I'm missing out on here? At this point, I'm going to keep trying to hammer away at the issue to make it work but I don't think realistically I'm going to be able to solve it given the amount of time I've put in so far with nothing but errors to show for it. I just want to see if I'm actually understanding this like I think I am or if I'm mistaken somewhere."

chxl94,1,2019-07-25,I'm Worried that I Peaked in College,Swedishfish1234,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/chxl94/im_worried_that_i_peaked_in_college/,"When I look back at myself two years ago, I see myself the way I want to be: Confident, driven, with a 4.0 GPA despite a vigorous and demanding course load. I was popular and involved. I loved the creative and intellectual freedom to take classes and learn anything and everything that interested me. Every summer I had prestigious internships in New York. My work received accolades, and awards including recognition from the AP from my time as the creative director for my college's magazine. I loved being busy and envisioning my future. I was in touch with myself. I knew who I was and where my life was headed. I was going to New York to become a trend forecaster and eventually a creative director- with the eventual intention of getting my PhD and becoming a research professor in Consumer Behavior.  I worked constantly, but I was busy, creatively fulfilled and happy.

A week before graduation I met my now boyfriend. He and I hit it off instantly. He is a young real estate developer. We tried to make the long distance thing work, as I'd already accepted a summer internship in New York and his business had him stuck in the midwest for at least another decade- although he initially promised me that it would only be 5 years. (He is still exceptionally noncommittal about the timeframe.) Consumed by the passions of my first REAL love, I may not have been the best employee at my internship, and was not offered a job at the conclusion of the internship.

Lacking direction for the first time in my life, and missing my boyfriend. I ended up accepting a position with a Fortune 500 company two hours away from my boyfriend's growing business, in, what turned out to be, a  toxic workplace. After a year with the company, I was let go when I forgot to attach a document on an email to my boss.

Before I was fired, I'd interviewed for a role as a graphic designer and social media manager for a small jewelry store in my boyfriend's town. I ended up accepting the role. Although it was not what I had envisioned for my life, and a significant pay cut from previous job, I deemed it sufficient enough to pay my bills and wanted to avoid any gaps in my resume.

Since we were tied to this small college town for at least another 5 years or so, I figured now was as good a time as any to fulfill my ambitions to get my PhD. I met with the director of my desired program who explained that she was very interested in my joining the program. I was elated. Unfortunately, I did not perform as well on the Quant section of the GREs as I would have liked- What's more? Although my curriculum was vigorous and I used to tutor algebra as an undergrad, I tested out of statistics through the AP program while I was in high school. Meaning I lacked additional the verification that I could handle the statistically heavy portions of the doctoral program- I am confident that I can- I'm not bad at math- I just didn't study as much as I should have for the exam. However, I still didn't get into the program. The president of the program encouraged me to reapply, and I'm working hard to improve my math score, but that still leaves me in my current position for at least another year. Assuming I get in next year. 

Today, I discovered that I make less than 1/3rd of what  my coworkers make. Although I'm the only creative, my salary technically has me living below middle class income. I own a home, have savings and make enough to get by. My boyfriend has promised to help ""take care of me"" if I ever need it- although the idea of him paying for my expenses makes my skin crawl. The rest of my job is fine. It's a definite improvement from my last role. But there's always office drama and I can feel under appreciated- discovering how little I am paid in contrast with the rest of the team only intensified the feeling. Likewise, everyone but me was invited on a trip with our president to New York in a few weeks, while I am expected to stay back at the office. Most days I work 10-12 hour days with a 20 minute lunch break. So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Looking back on the past two years of my life, I can't shake the feeling that my best years are behind me. The girl I was in college would have stayed focused and done a great job at that internship. She wouldn't have forgotten that attachment. She wouldn't make 1/3rd of the rest of her team, and she would have studied more of the GREs to secure admittance to the program of her dreams. She'd be engaged by now and planning a wedding, not dating a man whom she loved dearly, but can't commit to a point in his life when he can finally leave this tiny town she hates. She'd have more friends, be more involved, traveling, and winning awards for her work, like she had all through college. Her friends wouldn't ask her ""what happened to you?"" when asking about her plans for the future like she'd recently undergone a botched heart transplant. I realize I was lucky to have had all of the good fortune I experienced in my early 20s, but I don't want to accept that all of my successes are behind me. Is this just a part of growing up? What should I do? How do I reconnect with the person I used to be?"

I have 2 previous internships in iOS dev, and now I find recruiters nudging me towards the iOS roles at their company. I mean it's understandable that they think i'm interested in iOS roles. Heck, when I give an elevator pitch, all I talk about is mobile dev, since it's all I've done.

I'm not ""passionate"" about mobile dev (I don't hate it either), I started it because I figured it'd be easier to get my foot-in-the-door in mobile dev compared to like, robotics, because of the availability of learning resources, and the lower cost of entry since I was already familiar about mobile apps.

Now, I'm having trouble pitching to recruiters that I'm interested in non-mobile dev opportunities, when all my experience is in it. I'm more comfortable in my skills as a general programmer, and my ability to learn things I'm not familiar with than when I started, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to say ""I have some dev experience, all of it is in mobile dev, but I am interested in any role other than mobile dev. It literally doesn't matter what it is, I just want to see what else is out there."" When I put myself in the shoes of a hiring manager looking for someone that will do X role, I don't think I'm making a very compelling case for myself, even though I do have some dev experience.

I'm confident that I can learn and do any role, but I just don't know how to convincingly pitch myself."

- I graduate in a year with a degree in Math (yes, i know its not an ideal situation)

- I can somewhat program in C/C++ (currently relearning both)

- I've done a few projects in Arduino (yes I know its oversimplified)

- I've done an embedded systems internship (only 3 months) where I programmed an ARM microcontroller.  

I plan to pick up another microcontroller and learn how to program it throughout this following school year.

Do you think this is enough to land an entry-level embedded job?  I know it will be an uphill fight but I really like this field.....

Just in case, I plan to do grad school eventually but not immediately after graduation.  I don't have money to fund such an expensive investment right now and I really do want to get at least a few years of work experience."

So, I've applied for an internship, phone interview went good and they sent me some programming tasks to complete. There are 2 tasks, one is using Java and the second one is HTML, CSS, JS. I'm almost done with the tasks, but there are minor requirements not done and my code is, well, kinda messy. So I am asking for help, because it's really important for me to get this internship and I'm really trying to get it (first ever internship, I'm 21 so it will start my career in programming). If anyone could spare me a little bit of their time and help me out, review my code, PM me, it would be a lifesaver !

Bit of background about me: 
Did my undergrad in Industrial Engineering in a 3rd world country. I worked for a couple months in manufacturing then moved to data analysis and then business analyst (3 different jobs) in 3 years.
I then decided to pursue a Masters in business analytics and big in europe.

I am now doing an internship in a big ecommerce company as an Analyst (includes business and data).

They have offered me a job as soon as the internship ends but I've been seriously considering not taking it, mostly because I feel so underskilled compared to my peers.

I linkedin stalked them and they're ALL cum laudes with CS backgrounds and consultants from very prestigious consultancy firms. Tableau, oracle and everything certified. Even before the stalking I could tell these guys were in another level.

I was very sincere since the initial interviews about my background and skills. I barely know SQL (which I learned in one of my previous jobs), and I've been struggling with stuff they do so easily. It's making me think I might not meet their expectations in the long run. It doesn't help we're the same age or they're younger than me.

I've dealt with Impostor Syndrome before and managed to convince myself that they hired me for a reason. But this time I'm really doubting myself if I belong here.

I don't want to go back to my country as the situation is not great and I'll probably feel as a failure if I do. I'm not getting any other offers anywhere and I'm having all these doubts about staying in this company.

So I guess I want advice on what might be the right move here, just stick with it? Try to swallow all my doubts and endure? 
If anyone has been in the same situation how did you manage it?

Any advice is very welcome."

I've never done an interview before, never had an internship, and my previous ""work experience"" is almost non-existent. 

There are a few big questions that I have for those who have gone through this already:

1. What am I even worth? The cities I'm looking at are all mid-tier CoL. Are the ""entry level Software Engineer"" salaries on glassdoor really accurate? 

2. When I'm eventually given an offer, is it ridiculous to try to negotiate some remote time (0-5 days a month)? 

3. I'll have to relocate half way across the US. Should I expect a relocation bonus?

4. What is the likelihood of being given difficult technical questions? I mean in terms of coding challenges, and even technical knowledge about the languages/technologies on my resume?

5. How critical is it to have a fleshed out linkedin? I have no social media, and would like to keep it that way, but if linkedin is central to finding a job more easily, I could create one. 

I know the answer to some of these questions will depend on how attractive of an applicant I am. I'd say I'm pretty middle of the road. I've got a small project on GitHub, some leetcode problems complete, and my code is somewhat better than the average of my classmates (but definitely not insanely better)."

My old Laptop just gave up on me and now I am in the market for a new Laptop. I've been doing a lot of research and I just can't find anything I want to pull the trigger on. I've got a T460 from work and I do enjoy using it, especially because of the keyboard but it's really slow because of all the crap that's installed from the company and it does get decently loud even doing simple tasks. So I wanted to buy a Thinkpad but after having to send back two t480s and one x1c6 because of thermal and noise Issues I am a bit conflicted to buy another Thinkpad. But I can't seem to find a laptop that I could enjoy. The newer Thinkpad I have been looking at x1c7, x1e, p1 all seem to have somekind of thermal problems. The new xps line has also been criticized a lot. So I am at a loss. I've been thinking I could probably get by without a laptop until october, with just my Ipad since that's when my internship ends and I have to hand in the t460. So I've been wondering if I should just wait it out until october until the new gen lenovos/xps have been tested thoroughly. Otherwise if you guys have recommendations now I am happy to hear them.

Budget &amp; Country : Germany, up to 2k.

Should be able to handle programing, especially some unity/unreal dev."

I needed an easy internship I could do alongside classes and to gain a professional recommendation, but I haven’t applied any of my engineering knowledge at work since I’ve begun. 

I’ve stuck with it because of money and ease, but I’m tired with it now. I was out of the country for two months and returned last weekend. Today is my second day back and I am thinking of just quitting before I leave today. 

Before leaving two months ago, I agreed to work seven more shifts between today and when I begin classes in two weeks. It’s a small business so they’re already short-staffed and that’s the only thing that makes me think before telling my boss I’m quitting. There’s nothing holding me here though, I don’t like my boss’s attitude most of the time either and he has a temper that has caused interns to just leave and never return. 

Before I quit today, I just wanted to gather some thoughts and advice before I make the final call. Thanks!"

I have just finished my 1st month of an internship within a large aero OEM. I requested during my interview a placement within a technical discipline, as a result of my interests during university. What has resulted is that I've been placed within a very management heavy role in a department that is not technically driven.The department review procedures within the company and between it and the customer, then employs transformation projects to make improvements. It's an important area, but the complete opposite of what I wanted, I could not think of an area within ""engineering"" that I'd want to be in less, as they describe the work we're doing as a different kind of ""engineering"" from a services/support point of view. I actually rejected an interview from another major OEM company as the role they offered was in engineering services.  
   

  

I have raised the issue with my line manager, and there are talks to get me involved with another more technical team which hopefully will come to fruition. It will still mean that I have to split my time between this role I am in now (which I despise), and the other team closer to where I want to be. I wanted to use this internship to get experience within my favourite technical discipline so I could decide if I want to do something like a PhD in it, but now all I am doing is helping support a transformation project on company procedures within services, a business/humanaties student could do this work. Not an engineering student who has studied thermofluids, structures, propulsion, etc, all very recently.   
   

  

A lot of other interns in the company have very cool sounding placements, especially in some areas that were my primary interest, when some of them have no experience in that area. It has not given me a good impression of industry so far. My view so far is that industry: + money, - interest/satisfaction.   Academia: +interest/satisfaction, - money. It's hard to stay motivated and want to do well in this placement. I know if I just give up and don't make an effort it'll look bad, but if I try I'll still be unhappy. In both cases I won't get the experience I want. It will feel like a waste of a year ""engineering"" internship if I only get experience of this current department."

I have a big dilemna involving my actual job, former job, and a third possibility. 

Here's the actual situation : 
I am an engineer currently working for a company making medical devices. It's not my primary speciality (i.e. not exactly what I studied at uni) but still a little bit related. My job requires me to travel a lot (up to 80% of my working time - 50% of living time), and to meet a lot of other engineers working around the globe for the same company. I implies working with a lot of hazards, but can give me a variaty of other skills always nice to have for an engineer. 
The thing is that I don't really enjoy the situation. I'm not talking about travelling. Travelling seems super cool, but the fact is that I'm working shifts, and they change regularly. Not gonna lie, it's kinda hard for the body. But we have bonus to compensate that, so i cannot really complain about this. 
What worries me, is that the company is inneficient as hell. The decisions made in the higher management (from my n+2 and above) are completely disconnected from reality, and the consequence is that the reputation of the company is going down (in this precise business world, not to the eyes of the general public). During an installation abroad, for instance now, i'm for the past 2.5 months abroad, we don't get the parts we need from the headquarters, we get rushed, but the quality control is really bad, management tightens the budget and asks us to work more, because we get delays by the part that don't work (due to bad QC), they heard about Lean-6sigma about a month ago, when they should have implemented that years ago, and then blame us because documentation is missing (which we did not even receive). It's all that... a mess at the headquarters, and the people on site, working their asses of, are getting all the pressure. The thing is that the management refuses to hear the hundreds of complaints from the low level, and spends time creating dozens of forums to speak about this or that subject, but it just buries or dilutes what's important into the mass of unimportant stuff that make their way to those forums.

It's just a pain. And i'm there for less than a year (about 10 months now). This is my second installation, and it's the same problem all over again. Nothing changes. And the customer is less and less happy. The company will have to pay fees because they are not on date, due to bad stock/budget/resources/you name it - management. 

Now, friends that i made at my previous job are telling me that i could potentially go back there. I left that job because i was there as a consultant, and given shitty job (fighting with excel 24/7). But if I go back there as an intern, i'll probably have a job for which i actually made my studies at university. And, also, i like the team, there's a good ambiance and all. (my actual team... if i can say that, is completely neutral, and we see each other maybe 5 times a year, as we're all spread all over the world). I know that if i go back to my former team, i'll lose in salary, but i'm prepared for that. the thing is that it's a pure desk job, and i'm not such a huge fan of that. 

The third possibility, is doing a PhD. i've always wanted to do one, and i applied for one last week. But the deadline for application is in november, so they probably won't rush to give an answer. 

I'm writing here because I don't know what to do, and there's kind of urgency in making a decision, because the former company offers a 1 year training program that starts in october, but they close every application mid august. 

So, what to do ? Stay here, and try to talk to my boss, who supports my in my beliefs and agrees that i push for solving issues, go back to my former job with less salary, desk job, but better ambiance, or stay here in the waiting of a slight chance to get that PhD ? 

Everything is a mess in my head now, and i need external people (i.e. not friends nor family) to advise me :) 

Thanks, 

Florian"

24 year old Canadian IT guy (Junior Sys Admin) with about 3 years of experience split between in-house roles and an MSP. I currently make about $50k/year. I haven't really found a passion for any one particular path, but I love leadership roles and could definitely see myself in a management/ops position down the line. Dream career in 15 years would be a CTO/CIO job.

I have no formal education in IT, nor do I have any certs. What I do have is an MA and a BA in a humanities discipline (Theatre), and I've always been really good at selling the value of my degree(s) and relevant soft-skills. I typically leave my MA off of my resume because I've found that I get more responses with just the BA listed. I have the opportunity to move to the Netherlands (I'm a dual citizen) to pursue a BSc in Information Technology or a BSc in IT Management/IT Business.  It wouldn't really cost me anything (tuition is cheap for Dutch citizens), save for the opportunity cost of leaving a full-time IT job to study and work part-time. The programs both offer internship experiences (Ie. Cyber Security Analyst, IT Business Analyst, etc.), and they also offer final capstone projects that might be useful for job applications.

I love higher-education, and I find that I learn better in school environments. If I stay in IT, I want to set myself up for success, and I want to commit to this 110%. To get into a leadership role down the line, I may have to look at going down the path of obtaining an MSc or an MBA, which I suppose would be difficult given my non-relevant previous degrees.

So what do you think, should I go back to school for IT? I don't have any debt from my previous education, and I'm a young guy who really has nothing to lose at this point, so I'm leaning towards just going on the adventure and taking the opportunity to learn. Thoughts?"

ci83qk,7,2019-07-26,TIFU by answering an email without checking who had sent it.,gmorais1994,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ci83qk/tifu_by_answering_an_email_without_checking_who/,"HI TIFU, 


This is my first time posting here. Inspired by your stories I decided to share something that happened to me four years ago. It's been a while but it's something that still comes back to me from time to time… I like to see it as a learning experience, even though it was an absolute train wrack. 


I started working as an intern for a luxury car company from UK back in 2014. One year later, I was already familiar with everyone in the office, had a great relationship with my bosses and really enjoyed what I was doing. I was 21 at the time, in the middle of my bachelor's in International Relations. 


My team had been working hard on implementing a new system that was released by the company world wide a couple years before, but just now it had gotten to Latin America (where I work). I was doing my best to work with all the clients so they could understand how said system worked, it was very different from what they've been using before, the English language barrier made it a bit more complicated for most of the car dealerships, since in some countries very few people spoke fluently. 


In this process of trying to help them understand how to use the system, I actually became good ""friends"" with them. I say ""friends"" because we never actually met in person, but we spoke on friendly terms on the phone and on emails. Things were working out very well, sure, not all countries were in the same pace of implementation, but we were getting there. During those months I realized that in Latin America, you can just ""impose"" something to people, as they will probably tell you  (kindly) to fuck off. The way to make things work was to build a relationship with these people, and make it that we would be working as a team, and not as some kind of commander or something. Everything was working out. 


And so it was a Friday, at around 6 Pm which was the time I left the office. We were getting very close to the delivery deadline of that implementation, and a few of the partners still didn't comply to the new requirements. They were working on it though, I'm sure they were. Those people became my friends and I really trusted them. Right when I was about to leave, I received an email. 


That email was written in a very aggressive tone. It said something among the lines of ""Oceania delivered it in time, Middle East as well, even Africa, but why can't Latin America deliver it? This shows a lack of commitment to the project and incompetence from the whole zone"". I checked to see who had received that email, lots of people from LATAM, including my bosses and my new friends from countries. That email by itself made me pissed off, in a way that I had never felt before in the office. ""How dare him???"" I said to myself, and with this newfound rage inside me I decided to answer this chain of emails. This is where I fucked up. 


At that time, I was studying International Relations like I've mentioned before. In this job, I had never had the opportunity to actually talk about politics to anyone. Suddenly with this impetus of fury, I actually thought I was having a chance to shine and stand up for my boys. It was almost like a ""heard u were talking shit"" kind of feeling that moved me.


I replied to that email in the same aggressive tone from the one I had received. I said something like this:


""Dear Mister X, 


It upsets me that you're unhappy with our results. We are working on it as a team, and we'll have it delivered in time. I have to remind you to not compare LATAM with the other regions from the Southern Hemisphere, as the British way of colonization has worked in all of them but here. Our relationships are forged in a way of cooperation instead of top-down impositions.


Cheers.""


Right after I sent that email I thought to myself ""Damn get schooled bro"" lol. I really thought I was a fucking badass. I turned of my PC and left office to enjoy my Friday with this amazing feeling of accomplishment inside me. I was really proud of myself for handling that situation, and was ready to treat myself a fine fucking weekend for that. ""You won't talk shit about my team, mister… Wait a minute…"". At this point I realized I didn't know who I just had answered.


An hour passes and my boss calls me. He was pissed off.

""Gabriel, do not ever reply to a chain of emails again. You talked shit to the Global Head of Finance"". 

""oh… sorry"" 


As he hang up just to tell me that, all the beautiful feelings I was enjoying for the past hour were transmuted in some kind of shame, disappointment and the famous ""I fucked up"" feeling chimera. I spent the rest of my weekend very anxious about the Monday that was to come. 


I get to the office on Monday and everyone is already familiar with what happened. Some people actually praise me for doing that, specially the other interns. But the older people in the company were absolutely disappointed. I talked to my boss, he was very understanding and taught me valuable lessons about the work place on our talk. He tells me to join him on a meeting with the guy I had answered at 4 Pm. 


The meeting comes by… The CEO of Brazil, pretty much all directors and managers are present, only me as an intern. For a few minutes before I actually thought that maybe I had done a good thing, as I was in a high hierarchy meeting. This meeting wasn't really about the email that I just had sent, it was about some other plans for the zone. Right when I thought ""phew… I skipped this one"", this dialog happens:


Person I answered:  ""and who is that guy Gabriel?"" 

My Boss: ""he's an intern, and he's right here listening to this conversation."" 


Oh boy… I got absolutely roasted. Like literally destroyed. I don't even know how to put in words, it seems like it was so traumatic that my brain doesn't allow me to remember what he said to me that day. After that, I had lost all the ""reputation"" I had built in the company, my coworkers stopped talking to me, and I was fired a month later. 


TLDR: I answered an email without checking who had sent it, and got absolutely destroyed. "
ci87n1,2,2019-07-26,Keep the dream chasing alive (MIT) or settle?,Grand6x6,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/ci87n1/keep_the_dream_chasing_alive_mit_or_settle/,"**Note:** This is a cross-post from r/ApplyingToCollege as it was recommended.

Hey r/chanceme! Right now I am a rising senior from Middle Tennessee. Since sophomore year of high school I've dreamed of making it into MIT. I've realized, the closer I get to application season, the more unlikely my chances are. (My testing scores aren't as high as I was hoping.) Right now one of my more realistic (but still slightly reach) options would be Vanderbilt. Looking at the school's stats, my chances of getting into Vandy are more than doubled if I apply early decision round 1 if I remember correctly. While I desperately want to attend MIT, I would not want to throw my chances of Vanderbilt away just for a small chance of getting in and ending up with neither. So I'm asking you all what you think I should do!

Here are my stats and generalized ECs if it helps:

**ACT:** 32 Composite (35E/29M/30R/32S/9+W) | Side note: hoping to improve this by September but there's no promise, given that's my best of 9 attempts. My superscore does not change any subparts and I am waiting on my most recent writing score.

**GPA:** 4.38 as of the end of Junior year. Predicting 4.55 by the end of Senior year.

**Class Ranking:** 1st of 150 as of the end of Junior year, expecting Valedictorian.

**APs:** 12 AP classes by the end of Senior year and 7+ DE classes.

* Specific classes and scores as per r/chanceme's general guidelines: (Side note: I do not know if this will be considered, but my high school provides very poor resources for AP students.)
   * **Sophomore year:**
      * AP Human Geography (4)
   * **Junior year:**
      * AP Seminar (3)
      * AP US Government &amp; Politics (2) - Teacher dropped out half way through.
      * AP Macroeconomics (2) - Teacher dropped out half way through. Course continued by a teacher who was not educated in economics.
      * AP Language (4)
      * AP US History (4)
      * DE Astronomy
      * DE Precalculus &amp; Trigonometry
   * **Rising Senior summer:**
      * DE Calculus I
   * **Senior year:**
      * AP Calculus BC
      * AP Chemistry
      * AP Literature
      * AP Research
      * AP Psychology
      * AP Environmental Science
      * DE Calculus Based Physics 1 &amp; 2
      * DE Linear Algebra
      * DE Differential Equations (or another DE math course)

**SAT Subject Tests:** (I am *definitely* retesting in August.)

* **Math 1:** 690
* **Math 2:** 690

**Desired Major:** Science Writing

**Other:** Expecting to graduate with an A.S. of Mathematics from my local community college by the end of my Senior year. Still applying as a first year student most likely.

**Some generalized ECs:**

* Formed community of ""x"" activity in Tennessee by becoming the youngest event organizer in this particular world-wide association. Built the community up from \~50 participators with less than a dozen locals to having hundreds of locals all over the state within a few years.
* Regarding the aforementioned activity, I have some state and regional records within that field.
* Profitable video game developer with millions of hits.
* Numerous scholastic awards for nonfiction writing.
* Participated in a research internship with association with Vanderbilt University throughout this summer.

**Demographics:** Upper-middle class white male. 

* Additional info as per r/chanceme's requests: I currently go to an art magnet high school for writing. I am also a triplet, but aside from that, my demographics seem fairly bleak.

**Essays:** Because I am a writer, I expect my essays to be very strong.

To rephrase my main question, do I have a big enough of a shot at getting into MIT to sacrifice a greater chance at getting into Vandy? If any more information is needed, I will happily provide it. Thank you all!

**Other suggested information:** A responder from r/ApplyingToCollege suggested that I talk about other schools I'm applying to aside from MIT and Vandy.

* **Significant Reaches:**
   * Harvard
   * Princeton
* **Reaches:**
   * Dartmouth
   * Georgia Tech
* **Safeties:**
   * University of Tennessee Knoxville
   * University of Wyoming

And if any of you have any school suggestions, I am completely open to listening!"

I graduated in May 2019 with a degree in computer info systems with an okay gpa. I never had an internship, just classroom experience. I've been looking for a job since May and I make it to interview processes, but never got an offer before. I even got my dream job interview at a big four company, but I didn't get it. I feel like the only entry level jobs in IT are in programming and I really don't want to go that route. As a CIS, not CS major, I only took one Java course and I already know for a fact that's not what I want to do. I feel like I choose the wrong major because I'm not very passionate about coding or even a lot of technical stuff. I just want to get a job in corporate even if it doesn't have to do with IT. I feel so hopeless, though I know lots of recent grads feel the same way as I do. I'd appreciate any type of advice, thank you!"

I’ve become a lot more self sufficient and confident since I started a month ago, but I think the rose-tinted glasses are finally starting to wear out. I’ve been noticing a lot of flaws and just generally feeling like shit even though I know an internship should never creep into my personal life/time. 

The job started out fine: just imaging computers and setting them up, along with general troubleshooting. I got tired of that realllly quickly, and picked up PowerShell and within 2 weeks and started automating a lot of our processes (saving a lot of time/effort for my team and others). PowerShell is super cool and I’m glad I got into it, but nobody has bothered to try my scripts out yet. Theres also an app I’ve been working on that was suggested by management that I’ve delivered a working demo for, yet same as before it hasn’t been brought up in weeks. I’ve brought these up in our team meetings multiple times, but I don’t hear anything about them afterwards. My manager is a cool guy, but it just seems like the IT department doesn’t give a fuck and just does things the way they’ve always been done, and clocks out. The dev team managers have meetings with their interns multiple times a week, doing code reviews and 1-on-1s. I haven’t had a 1-on-1 with any management and can’t even get a constructive message on Slack. I just feel like a bitch going the extra mile when it’s never noticed. I still make a lot of mistakes, especially with hardware, but I’ve literally just been trained by another previous intern and learn as I go. I was really interested in cloud and got a cert in 2 weeks, but have just stopped caring since. 

Is complacency this normal in the industry? How can I actually make an impact if nobody is watching? I guess I need to just keep pushing them on looking at what I’ve done. I’m not going to quit or anything, this is still a great job. I just wanted to get any advice or input from you guys. Yes, I am polishing my resume up and always on the lookout for new internships."

I've already spent time on and off during this internship with algorithm prep. I feel like I've improved but not as much as I would have hoped.  I wish I had spent more time on preparation but was also going through a lot of personal issues (i.e divorce) which didn't help.

I'm taking a heavy course load for the fall and winter in order to graduate sooner. I won't have time to do any prep during these semesters. That's why I'm worried that any time I spend preparing for interviews in August will be wasted since I'll forget most of it by spring of next year.

This summer I’ve been interning at a decent sized (2,000 employees) space and defense R&amp;D lab. The bulk of the company are MechEs and EEs, but it also has divisions dealing with chemistry &amp; materials, biomedical, AI/machine learning, robotics, etc. 


It’s been awesome and I’ve loved working here, and I would love to come back next summer under one little stipulation. Ideally I‘d like to transfer out of my current position/division (MechE intern, systems hardware) and into something more related to my major and interests (probably an intern in the chemistry and materials division). That division is mostly composed of Chemistry masters and PhDs, but I know there are a few ChemEs working there as well. 


I don’t know if they take interns, but I want to talk with someone to get my foot in the door and get more information about it. I‘m not exactly sure how to do it without seeming too straightforward but I also want to make sure they’re aware of my intention.


Around 1.5 months ago I used the company’s employee portal to find the name of a random manager in the division and explained that I was a ChemE and would like to learn more about their lab and the work they do. He gave me a full tour of the chem/mats labs, and towards the end I mentioned that if he needed a hand with anything I’d love to help out. I haven’t heard anything from him since. Should I just locate another manager and do this same thing? Or maybe schedule a time to get coffee with them (a different person) and have a casual conversation about their work?


Much appreciated if anybody has advice."

Oh boy, I tried and sorta dropped out of a lot of clubs, and my course load was pretty high last year since I took an extra course and early APCS alongside my schools pretty darn hard normal courses, but here they are:

Rocketry Team (10-Present)

FRC Robotics (Freshman Year, first bit of Sophomore year, intend to go through Senior Year)

Lab Assistant (40 Hours) - precursor to lab research

Lab Research (\~180 hours internship)

Lab was a neurobiology lab at Harvard Medical School, Some Machine learning programs there. I had about a week where I wasn't paid that count as volunteering hours.

I also have certificates of completed lab trainings so that I can actually work in the Lab, as well as a certificate from a programming course I took on vacation in India, do these count for anything?

CTY Astrophysics and Game Theory programs

Personal Coding Projects: Solar System simulation: I made a simulation using real data of the solar system, the magic lies in being a realtime simulation that can run on a pretty underpowered laptop at a reasonable refresh rate.

Game Development: I've been making a game on and off for the last couple of months, I plan to finish it over this next year and release it (hopefully successfully)

I don't know how I can put my fascination with Astrophysics and Space in general into something tangible I can put into my apps. Any help here appreciated. Do I need to retake my SAT or take an ACT? I feel like 1500 is low and my dad wants me to retake.

If anyone wants you could also chance me for HYPSMC / what I should do to improve my chances for any.

&amp;nbsp;

**Anthony Schultz**

&amp;nbsp;

I walked onto a stage and turned to face the audience. I smiled widely at the faceless masses before me and began to gesture grandly and talk. However, my lips moved but no noise came out. My smile faltered and I paused. Immediately upon my lips going still the spotlight turned red and shone bright upon me and I felt my skin begin to burn. The smell of iron began to permeate the room and I felt a liquid splatter my face. 

&amp;nbsp;

My heart pounded as I sat up, hitting a knee on something in the process. I looked around and noticed Catalina glaring at me holding a spray bottle. As she walked back upstairs, she said, “You’re going back to work today. I’ve called the Station and they’re sending some intern to get you.” 

&amp;nbsp;

I grunted in response and ran a hand over my right cheek, I felt water on my scraggly beard. As soon as I confirmed the liquid covering my face I registered that my left knee was beginning to tingle, so I began to massage it while waiting for the sensation to go away. After the tingling died down I leaned off the couch and began fumbling around in the gloom trying to find the bastard responsible for what happened to my knee. I found it after half a minute and moved the scotch bottle to the table, shaking it see if it still had anything left in it. I sighed as I realized the bottle was empty so I sat up properly so I could stretch and check my watch.

&amp;nbsp;

4:37 AM

&amp;nbsp;

I gave myself about an hour to get ready before anyone came to get me, but they really wouldn’t have a use for me until around noon. ‘No, I’m going to be in Ngozi’s office for an hour while she makes sure I’m fit to go live, and then when she’s satisfied, actual work will happen,’ I thought to myself as I carefully moved around the dark living room. After nearly breaking my leg on a side table I managed to get into the hall and turn on the light. Satisfied I wasn’t going to impale myself on a plant now I walked to the full sized bathroom on the first floor. 

&amp;nbsp;

I stripped and showered, making certain to wash any place liquor might have hit me the night before. I walked out of the shower feeling like a fresh man, if not a new one. I stared at my face in the mirror seeing what needed to be fixed before I could entertain millions. Eyes… dark rings… that’s gonna need some makeup, mouth… chapped and dry… hopefully some lip balm will fix that, and finally the beard. Scraggly and patchy on the cheeks… I was clean shaved before… my thoughts began to drift before splashed some water on my face to clear my head. 

&amp;nbsp;

Change is good, beard stays, but the cheeks are going to have to go and I’ll clean up the chin as best as I can before I get to the studio. I pulled out a pink disposable razor, some razor cream, and a small pair of scissors out of the cabinet on the right of the sink. I cleaned up the hair encasing my jawline as best as I could. I slowly moved my face around in the mirror trying to see how I could trim it any better, but I could tell that there was something wrong without any clue how to fix it. I sighed and went to lather up my cheeks. I worked on the lower portions of my cheeks first, making sure not to make the jawline look any worse, and then moved quicker on the rest and removed whatever sad excuse was the state of my mustache. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Shit,” I swore as somehow nicked my upper lip. The pain I ignored but the scent of iron made me sick. I closed my eyes and gripped the lip of the counter and tried to steady my stomach, but that blood covered face came to mind and I rushed to the toilet before I got sick.

&amp;nbsp;

After cleaning myself up I brushed my teeth, and worked my facial muscles by practicing smiling, feigned horror, rapt interest, and a gentle chuckle. Happy that I wasn’t out of practice I left the room and headed upstairs to get dressed. 

&amp;nbsp;

As I entered our bedroom I noticed that Cat had already made the bed. ‘Disciplined as always,’ I mused to myself as I walked to the master bathroom. She was where I expected her to be, precisely putting on her makeup while she considered which outfit to bestow upon the adoring public today. I went to the walk in closet and picked out a white silk shirt, black suit from Italia, and a plain red tie. Taking the outfit together something seemed off about it, and it took me a second to realize that the suit hung looser than I expected. Booze and no food made it easier to get buzzed, but I didn’t realize I was beginning to wither.

&amp;nbsp;

Coming back into the bathroom Cat eyed me saying, “Get Sybil to touch up the beard when you get into the Station, and you need to eat more, or I’ll have to have someone to refit the suit.”

&amp;nbsp;

“I’ll keep that in mind next time at the bar,” I said as I went to stand next to her and straighten my tie. 

&amp;nbsp;

We stood next to each other in silence for a minute before she said, “Remember the deal Ant, we have to keep moving forward. ‘We’ll make it to the top together.’ Remember?”

&amp;nbsp;

We locked gazes in the mirror and I stared blankly back at her and finally said, “Yea I remember Cat.”

&amp;nbsp;

“It’s been three months Ant. It’s this or you actually have to go to therapy.”

&amp;nbsp;

I grimaced at the thought, “No, I’ll… I’ll do work.” I made a move to change the subject, “Working on the Spring collection today?”

&amp;nbsp;

She parried with, “You have until New Year’s to find a path forward or you’re seeing a Therapist.”

&amp;nbsp;

I held up my hands in defeat, “Fine.” 

&amp;nbsp;

I turned to leave but she grabbed my sleeve and said, “Give me a kiss before you go.”

&amp;nbsp;

When I turned to look at her again I caught a flicker of sadness on her face, but by the time I faced her fully she had nothing but kindness shining back at me. I smiled and we kissed. 

&amp;nbsp;

I went back downstairs and grabbed my phone, wallet, and a banana from the kitchen. I looked at my watch again.

&amp;nbsp;

5:25 AM

&amp;nbsp;

I devoured the fruit, tossing it in the trash, and grabbed a black peacoat as I left our townhome. One of the things I loved most about New York in December is the snow and the chill. The time I took to savour this weather distracted me from immediately noticing a peppy little red headed kid standing in front of a black town car.

&amp;nbsp;

“Good morning Mr. Schultz! Did you sleep well?” he said with a wide grin on his face.
His face was red from the cold, but he remained energetic enough to give me a moment of pause. “It was good,” I said slowly. “What’s your name kid?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Peter Donnelly sir!”

&amp;nbsp;

I walked to the back seat of the town car and before I could let myself in he opened the door for me. I frowned, “Uh… thanks Peter. Please just call me Anthony. Mr. Schultz makes ya sound like trying to sell me something.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Of course sir,” was his response as he closed my door.

&amp;nbsp;

As he moved to the drivers seat I decided whether or not I was going to like this kid. By the time he started the engine and began driving us to the Station I decided that he amused me. I felt my heart warm a little to see someone so naturally peppy and energetic, but If he didn’t settle a bit, Peter was going to get on nerves. 
“So are you my new assistant Peter, or are you on loan from someone?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Yes I am! Ngozi told me to grab you after we heard from your wife that you were coming back today.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Were you helping the night desk before she transferred you?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Yea, I was helping them with coffee and random research for when something big was happening, but nothing it’s been dry outside of election coverage and the Daedalus.”

&amp;nbsp;

My stomach began to churn at the mention of the cursed vessel, and I noticed that Peter had adopted a forced smile after he mentioned the Daedalus. Conversation stopped after that point as well, which was nice, since the mention of the first great orbital graveyard drained me of any desire to do any real talking.
After twentyish minutes of silence, we pulled into the underground parking garage of the Imperial Media Tower. He opened the door and we both quietly walked to the elevator bank where he pushed the button for the 43rd floor. 

&amp;nbsp;

We exited the elevator directly into the reception area of the Station, and I couldn’t help but look up at the overly gaudy sign over the reception desk ‘Trans-Atlantic News Network’. I stared at the LCD screen behind the desk that just read off the date in little blocky letters 

&amp;nbsp;

DECEMBER 2nd, 2014

&amp;nbsp;

We walked past the desk towards the newsroom. “Sir, Ngozi would like you to see her in her office once you get settled back in,” Peter said as we approached the door.

&amp;nbsp;

“Thanks Peter I’ll make sure to do that,” I responded absent mindedly as I moved to open the door. I paused right before my hand reached the handle and instead said, “Kid we’ll get along fine so long as you do two things for me. First, tone down the peppiness a little. It’s nice, don’t get me wrong, but you’ll have me bouncing off the walls with all that excess energy. Second, until I start mentioning that clusterfuck of a broadcast in normal conversation just pretend that I didn’t show the entire world the Emperor getting impaled by a fucking pipe all right?” I bit my lip as I realized I delivered the second half a little to emotionally, and breathlessly. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Yes, sir.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Anthony.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Yes, Anthony.”

&amp;nbsp;

And with that last line we entered the newsroom.

&amp;nbsp;

cie83n,2,2019-07-27,I hate not finding a job,banonji52,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/cie83n/i_hate_not_finding_a_job/,"Graduated in May. IT related degree from mid tier school (got 80% funding in scholarships, my single parent can only support me so much financially). Been searching for a job for the past year and a half now (internships and now real jobs). I am an international student so I gotta be careful of all the regulations as well. No kidding I have applied for about 800 applications since last year. Got like 5 interviews. showed my resume to professors, Career department at college, alumni, people I know at senior level positions all say resume is fine. I talk with people for referrals as well. After months and months of searching I  manage to get an internship right out of college (the pay rate was low and it was through my department. Remote position so I could just work from home no commute) and thought I would be good to go for the time being but this stupid ass internship is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. My boss does not give me any paperwork or offer letter (he sent me an email as an offer letter and then i requested an offer letter) He never responds to emails on time and lately has not been responding at all and always gives me an excuse that he is out of town for a busy project.  He says the way salaries would work is that I submit a bi weekly summary and then he reads it and approves it then sends me my salary through Zelle (which is illegal on his part btw). Did not even give me a pay stub i had to request one. I do work for week 2 and 3 while actively applying for other jobs and interviewing. Running out of savings, credit limit with bills to pay and loan payments from college coming up. Two weeks later my payday comes and I submit my summary and wait patiently for my salary. Week passes by no salary. I stop working as this whole thing is pissing me off. I stay patient and then he emails me saying he needs a more detailed summary which was already detailed similar to what I submitted the first time. I resubmit it ASAP. Does not respond at all. It is four weeks later now. No sign of my pay. No sign of communication. Does not respond to emails or phone calls. Same thing is happening to the other guy who is an intern with me. He is also at my university. Was supposed to get paid for 40 hours and no sign of it. $10 in my account. Rent is due in 3 days, I have nothing to eat. No money for commuting if I get an interview. Credit cards maxed out since last 2 weeks. Mom has already helped me out the best she could. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is not even the worst part. The worst part is my will slowly deteriorating. The only thing that is keeping me from killing myself is the thought that my mom does not deserve the kind of pain that I will bring upon her. I have been searching for work for months and months now. I have not slept properly in ages. I just live with this headache now. I apply for jobs all day all week. I cant work part time because of my visa status as working part time would be illegal for me. Every night i try to sleep and the thoughts of failing in life keep popping up in my head. I cant even fucking cry because my brain just stops me. Every time I get an interview I hope this would finally be over but I only disappoint myself when I get rejected every single time. Tried everything in the book. Just nothing works. I do not know what is next. Will I ever make it out of this hole? The answer has to be yes I keep telling myself. But each passing day I doubt myself even more. After weeks of searching I land one interview and I nail it. Or so I think. The company still ghosts me and this cycle continues. All my friends are already in the next stages of their lives while I sit here wondering if I will make it. Struggled back in the old country and struggling here as well. Just not meant to be happy ever in my fucking life. Cheated of the money I deserve fuck this existence just fucking end me already."

because  I always loved programming since I was 12, I started to consistently learn and research about Computer Science (and later on will start Web Development since I’ve heard it’s a safe path to employment).

now, my questions are: how will I be able to apply for jobs without any certificates and degrees?

for instance, I am about to finish CS50: Intro to Computer Science, which you can get a certificate; however, I don’t have enough money to pay for it. I am also wanting to start CS50: Intro to CS and Web Development and won’t be able to pay a certificate for it either. should I even bother stating on my resumé that I did them?

do companies solely base your experiences off what you have on your GitHub? because I am putting every single little project on my GitHub(for example a credit card number validation check that I wrote in C, and now pretend to rewrite it in JavaScript). should I only be publishing big projects such as websites?

my only hope was taking AP Computer Science my Junior year and maybe land on a internship; now, this dream is over because I’m moving out of the U.S. for a year. :/

sorry for the long post and (most likely) stupid questions.

side question: should I also ditch studying Computer Science and low level programming (most of my projects are in C and C++, I love those languages), and start learning Web Development (JavaScript, etc) right now since I only have +- 1.5yrs to land on a job?"
cig2gp,1,2019-07-27,Internship options between QA Engineer (automation) or Research Developer/SWE,manaminerva,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cig2gp/internship_options_between_qa_engineer_automation/,"I studied CS but worked mostly on projects as a gameplay programmer for most of my school time, so my portfolio and experience very heavily lean towards that. 

However, now that i'm close to graduation I feel like I really shouldn't pigeonhole myself into games development, so I'd like for my internship to expose me to the broader possibilities of a CS degree.

I've been presented with these options, wondering which ya'll think would provide a more valuable experience.

The QA Engineer intern role involves creating automated testing for new features and tools for a game engine. It's still in the games industry but gives me an opportunity to work closely with the internals of the engine as well as develop skills in tooling and testing and such, which are more general skills.

The Research Developer role is working within a small research team at a large data security/management company to find possible new products/tech to utilize.

The Software Engineer role I'm not too clear on, but I believe it mostly involves working on existing products and doing maintenance and stuff.

ciigra,12,2019-07-27,Advice on Apprenticeships?,atomicJam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ciigra/advice_on_apprenticeships/,"Hi there! I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on finding CS apprenticeships (particularly in Seattle, WA because that's where I live now)? Here's my quick story: I graduated back in December with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a pretty good GPA, but due to other circumstances, I rushed through my degree and did it in 2 years. Because of this, I only really had one summer to do an internship (the other summer, I did 15 credit hours of school) and I did it at Microsoft. I wasn't able to do internships during the school year because I didn't live in a city with tech companies offering internships. Microsoft said they would love to hire me, but that they want me to have a bit more experience with larger scale projects before I went on full time, and that seems to be a general consensus with other tech companies I've applied to. The issue with that is that I already graduated and, as far as I've seen, all the internships offered are only for people in school, so I'm looking for an apprenticeship. Also, I don't want to go back to school for a Master's right now because I burned myself out with my undergrad and I don't think I'd do well in grad school right now and it wouldn't be good for my mental health. So does anyone have any advice for finding apprenticeships or for getting experience on large scale projects outside of that?

My boss came to me yesterday and said he knows my internship is ending but he’d like to keep me and offered me a full time job making 50% more than what I do now. 

The only thing holding me back is I’d have to cut my class load in half due to scheduling and I’d lose out on almost all of my scholarships at school. I’d have to pay around $6k extra because of the lost scholarships. This is a great job and I really like what I do and I’m leaning towards accepting the position and not graduating until April, but I’d hate to lose the scholarships because of it. 

Anyone had any similar experiences or advice?"
cijmp9,1,2019-07-27,"Advice about whether to take comfortable kind of boring job in a mid-size city v/s looking for a better, more challenging role in tech [Long Post]",taxicicle,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cijmp9/advice_about_whether_to_take_comfortable_kind_of/,"I have asked many people for advice but they don't have the same background as I do so it's been a little difficult for them to give me good advice. I feel like posting it here will help me get a lot more variety in opinion. 

**Location: USA**

**Background:** I'm currently doing a PhD in Materials Science &amp; my research is on wearable electronics and flexible semiconducting polymers. I also have a Master's in the same with the same research work during my Master's, and my BS is in Polymer + Chemical Engineering. Basically, at this point I have been studying, modifying, and researching electrically conducting polymers for 7+ years. I've published 5 research papers (+2-3 more in the pipeline) till not and am going to graduate next year with my PhD (I will be 27 then). I really want to go into an industry R&amp;D/product development role and have been shaping my resume as such by doing a lot of workshops on science communication, industry-oriented workshops, and I network quite a bit even when I'm not looking for work, just to stay in touch with companies that I am interested in. 

**Current:** I really wanted to do an industry internship before graduating with my degree, so I applied to various companies (about 50). I interviewed with 5 of them. 2 rejected me, 1 gave me an internship offer, and the final 2 said they don't have any internships for highly qualified individuals (their interns are mostly undergrads) and they interviewed me but asked me to stay in touch in the future for full-time opportunities. These two companies are very innovative, align with my research interest, want me to continue the work I am doing during my PhD, and are located in the West Coast (which I am kind of dreading because of how expensive that part of the country is).   
I took the internship offer from the 1 that did give me the offer - they're a large corporation in CPG and have been around for more than 100 years. 

**Working during internship at CPG:** I've been working on the materials and packaging side of this company. While the company is good, I am probably the ONLY PhD in MSE they have here (within employees and interns) and I feel like a big fish in a little pond. The work is not very exciting, the company is old so they don't want to be innovative. Their starting salary for me would be $85,000/year which they say is non-negotiable and which feels very low to me. However, they have great benefits and the city they are in is quite affordable and a good size. The company culture is good and the employees are very nice. However, I already feel jaded in 10 weeks and I don't know if I can see myself working here for even 5 years. Moreover, the work in R&amp;D here is very different from my research topics, the latter of which I absolutely love. Additionally, as a packaging scientist I would be in more of a ""save money + solve plant issues"" role rather than product development side of it. They do have some initiatives with packaging sustainability, but again very little innovation.

**Dilemma:** Should I take this full-time offer at this CPG company that is well-established, has good benefits (though low pay), and is in an affordable place, or should I hedge my bets that those other two companies that were much bigger, very innovative and located in a much more expensive area would take me, especially since they have interviewed me once? I am very confused between whether I should settle for something less exciting for a good work-life balance + culture, or if I should take the chance and do something I love (and also potentially end up working 50-60 hours a week)?  


Additional details: My internship company will make an offer in August 2019, and expect a reply by October 2019. My PhD will end around August-September 2020, I hope. I don't have any student debts so I am not worried about having to pay something off. I don't plan on having children so I am not worried about having to suddenly save a lot of money after 5-10 years."

cile31,0,2019-07-27,Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail immediately after graduation - Am I shooting myself in the foot?,NBP3,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/cile31/hiking_the_pacific_crest_trail_immediately_after/,"Hello all! I've gotten a lot of outside opinions on this topic, but I thought this sub could help me form a more informed opinion. 

TL;DR - I plan on thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail as soon as I graduate for about 5 months but worry this plan could seriously upset any chance I have making a career in finance. Details time.

I'll save you the spiel about the trail being a life-long dream and all. I am graduating with a bachelors in Accounting and Finance from a non-target school in May 2020 with, as long as I continue my current output, a GPA around 3.8. Not many extracurriculars (my school offers very little), though I have put together my own financial models and Excel projects in my spare time, as well as learnt some computer coding and programs (mostly SQL). My professional network is decent, but not enough to have companies knocking at my door. While I have no internship experience, I have worked in sales (retail), management &amp; liquidation (also retail), and for the past 3 years, a government office job where I often work with sensitive info, accounting forms and financial reconciliation. My goal is an entry-level position in either Equity Research or FP&amp;A, and I am very open (and looking forward) to relocating once I finish school.

I have spoken with plenty of people I'm close to, including friends, family and co-workers, and some tell me that post-graduation is the best opportunity to make this journey. Others tell me I am screwing myself out of a job in the future because of a 5-month resume gap post-college. I'm not sure what to believe, so I'm turning to this sub for your most honest opinion on the matter. 

My main questions are these: 1. Is this an irresponsible choice to make this hike at this juncture of my life? 2. If I do the trail (which, as of right now, is my plan. Money already saved), is there anything I can do while I'm out there to show that I am bettering myself? Coursework, certificates, etc. or would explaining the hike justify the gap in my resume? If it makes any difference, I do receive government certification that states I completed the trip. 3. Hypothetically, now would be when I should apply for jobs to start once I graduate; however, would this change if my start-date is not until November/December of next year rather than April/May?

I greatly appreciate any advice offered!"
cilfcq,2,2019-07-27,Manager is targeting me?,Quintanamo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cilfcq/manager_is_targeting_me/,"For background, I am a software engineering intern at a fairly large multinational company with very little experience in the field (point of the internship, I guess).  The “chain of command” goes floor manager &gt; supervisor &gt; project manager &gt; mentor &gt; intern.  A potentially related incident is when I was implementing a feature on my own, the floor manager came by and asked me how I was doing.  I told him I was working on figuring something out which I suppose he misinterpreted as I was struggling because he told the project manager that I was struggling and the project manager told me not to say anything to the floor manager so he doesn’t get worried about stuff like that again.

Anyway, the internship started off fairly great, but due to some technical difficulties, we ended up having to switch frameworks in the midst of the project.  It was very sudden and myself and another intern have very little involvement (if any) in that decision making.  The floor manager heard about it and asked me if I think the new framework will be better (it will be) and how long it’ll take to get caught back up.  Most of it would theoretically be copy/paste work, so I told him I didn’t think it would be too long once we got started.  He asked “so about a week?” And I said “that’s possible”.

However, in order for me to get started, I had to wait for the project manager and mentor to figure out how they wanted to do it and prepare us for the change.  On  Monday, he told us just to look over some stuff and sent us a small example to play around with and that more would come soon.  More didn’t come soon, so I asked if there’s anything we could do in the meantime via email.  He said “just look over the framework and watch this video on the blog”.  I did/have been and haven’t gotten the go ahead to do anything yet.  On Wednesday, the mentor said it was taking longer to get things set up but he’ll have a template for us.  On Thursday, he said he’d work on the template.  Friday, he wasn’t there, and the floor manager showed up at my desk and asked if I had anything to show yet.  Knowing I told him it would only take a week to set up (assuming I was able to start at all, which wasn’t made clear to him and I take full responsibility for that), I was a bit flustered and nervous because I had next to nothing tangible to show him.  I explained that I couldn’t really do anything because I’ve been waiting for the go ahead from the mentor (and also for the GitHub to get set up since multiple people are working on the project).  He seemed very frustrated with me (and only me for some reason) and told me to email the mentor and C.C. him in it.

Now it’s going to be apparent that I “threw someone else under the bus” but from my point of view, I didn’t have any other choice.  I’ve asked for work several times and pretty much got told to wait every time.  I’d happily work on something if I could but my stuff relies on the other intern and mentor’s stuff to be compatible.  This also makes me wonder why I’m being targeted and responsible for all of this since I’m the lowest ranking and also paid less than the other intern, and I feel like I’ve been carrying more weight than the other intern.  I only have until the middle of next month, but I’m dreading going back to work and having my superiors be upset/angry with me over something that’s technically their responsibility.


TLDR:  highest ranking boss seems to be holding me accountable for an entire group project when I’m the lowest ranked one on it, and I’m unable to do my job until my mentors/supervisors finish setting up which is looking bad on me, and I have no opportunities to do anything else since that’s the only project I’m on.  I’m afraid this is hurting my image and relationship with my coworkers.


How can I approach this in a positive way where the least about of “bad” can come from it and possible resolve any conflicts?  Is it reasonable for the floor manager to hold me accountable for something that’s out of my control?  Any other information or encouragement would be greatly appreciated, I feel lost, upset, and helpless about this whole situation."

Hello! I have been playing any computer games I have on a 5 year old laptop that only has integrated graphics and is probably meant to have google chrome  and excel as its most intensive programs. I play a lot of CS:GO because my laptop can run (commonly dips down to around 15 fps), but I want to have a computer on which I can play games with 60+ fps and ultra on some titles. my budget was originally $1,000 but I increased it to $1100 because I think that extra $100 can really add a lot of power to it.

I have a microcenter that I'm going to on friday to get a bundle deal on the Ryzen 7 2700x and motherboard for $260, So I'm very happy about that deal because it's basically getting the motherboard for free.

My main concern is getting the blower 5700xt. I would like that card because according to the LTT it does incredibly well with SolidWorks (I use it a lot for my major), but I have heard the blower cards are incredibly loud and can even turn off from the amount of heat.

&amp;#x200B;

I would wait another week if I knew for a fact that AIB cards would be released by then, but have only seen things like mid-august for the release. I begin classes on the 19th and would like some time where I can play it without the worries of projects.

&amp;#x200B;

With that knowledge, do you think that an Nvidia card would be more suitable for the build?

&amp;#x200B;

If so, is there any way to see if that card would work with the freesync on my monitor?

&amp;#x200B;

Any way to save a little money by changing the parts on this?

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be possible to stream occasionally on this?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a terrible build that is so bad you thought about reporting it?

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any bottlenecks in my build?

&amp;#x200B;

Tips for a first time builder?

&amp;#x200B;

Even a ""great build!"" or a ""I would recommend changing X"" would really help me out. Thank you!"

So at the end of the internship/Summer, I was planning to build a personnal project in Angular (or React ?) that I thought about for a long time ago.

So I'm now I'm not sure if I really want to make that web app, I'm actually thinking about building my personnal project in java, c++, python or something.

Two more semesters left before I graduate with my cs degree, I've been TAing for first/second semester student programming labs for about two years now, I've enjoyed programming ever since I started in the degree path and I do well in my classes. Until this internship, I never questioned that I was doing the right thing for myself by pursuing a cs degree. It felt like it made sense in a way other things failed to. Then I got this internship at a bank.

My manager has been great, asked what we wanted to learn, then assigned some things based on that. I did some basic ""read this vulnerability report and see if you can replicate the vulnerabilities or prove that they've been fixed"" and felt good about that. But I was also supposed to get out internal application to presumably send requests to get information from another internal application.

I couldn't deliver one of my technical deliverables. I keep hitting a wall. I looked at code samples provided, tried asking other devs who referred me to other devs, have done hours and hours of solid research and different approaches. Had one dev who I tried asking for advice professionally call me incompetent (""Any dev should be able to implement this code easily"") after I tried to explain that I wasn't using Java anymore because my dev team wanted it done with ajax. But the final presentation for this internship is coming up and this one technical thing I really needed to do I just couldn't do it.

Yeah, I learned a lot about topics I'd never used or engaged with before. But I have never felt so defeated and like I've wasted the last few years of my life in a position I felt miserable and worthless in. Web app dev isn't the field I want to be in but still it feels awful. It feels like everything I try to do in this internship is wrong, I apparently just pissed off the dev team of the webapp that provides the web services I was trying to consume when I was trying to get advice, how am I supposed to cut it in an actual entry level position if I can't even pull this off? (I'm definitely still trying, but at this point my manager is having the person who will work on it when I'm gone learn about what I'm doing.)

Is this normal to feel as an intern? When and how do you know if you're just not actually suited to CS?"

-Home far away from both

Pro about SF:
-network opportunity for full time position in other nearby tech companies

Pro about NYC:
-Warmer
-a lil cheaper

ciqliy,4,2019-07-27,Feeling lost,prs-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ciqliy/feeling_lost/,"I am going to be a Junior in college this September, majoring in CS. After going through this subreddit and a lot of other CS-focused subreddits, I just feel like I have the most rudimentary, basic knowledge of Computer Science, and I have no idea how to expand my knowledge. In college so far, we've learnt a little JAVA, C, and assembly, but the terminology thrown around on these subreddits and stack overflow looks extremely advanced compared to what I've learnt for the simple programs we were assigned. Aside from this, it feels like there are thousands of different fields in CS aside from programming itself that I've never even touched, like 'distributed systems' and security, and AI. I feel lost and stupid. I don't know how I'll ever land even an internship let alone a full time job with the basic knowledge I have, and the worst part is, I can't even seem to remember everything I learnt in college after term is over. 

If anyone has any advice about this, that would be really great. Thanks."

But I've had to ask a lot of questions whilst doing so for various reasons (the guide is outdated in places, I've never been good at this particular side of CS, and some necessary steps aren't mentioned) and I feel like I'm starting to bother my mentor. 

I'd like to ask the relevant people more directly instead of sending all my questions to her, but for the most part I still don't know what people do. 

Is this experience normal and something I'll pick up after a couple weeks? I do feel like once I start my actual work (which is more in my area and code-based and less about servers and the like), I'll feel a lot better.

common answer is do Leetcode.

I have got preplacement offer from Service based company, during my engineering in Mumbai, India.

But I wanted to do something Big, like ""BigN"" companies.

I have started many times HackerRank, HackerEarth, and many other platforms, leetcode also. but I solved two random question on leetcode and then I gave up.

I have done Internship as Full Stack Developer at Service based company, but it was very bad experience. I didn't learned anything from them.

TLDR;

I am commiting today, that I will solve as many leetcode-problems I can in these 30 days. 

and I have 1 month free before joining service based company, I will utilize it and try for getting into BigN companies.

seriously I wanted to change my struggling-life, and only way I can see is getting into BigN rather than service based company, which pays 0.25X Less than that of BigN.

Heres the part list: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2R2P29](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2R2P29)

I'm mainly curious if there are any components being bottlenecked here, or things I should be concerned about as I'm expecting this to be my daily driver for work &amp; play.

Generally, the system is going to be used for heavy development work (running local databases, constant compiling of programs, a lot of ram &amp; CPU intensive applications), light graphical work (Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop) and 3d modeling (and maybe some game environment stuff). Oh, and of course some gaming every other night @1920x1080p, 144hz

A few years back (maybe 3 years ago) I bought an Acer Predator G5, it was and still seems to be a tank (minus bloated battery &amp; thermal throttling). I got it mainly because I wanted to stop gaming on console's and I needed something portable to do school work on.

Anyways I compared the parts using user benchmark (here's a fresh run link) [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/18801327](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/18801327) and selected components that would compare 1-1 with my system, I then splurged a bit and upgraded them all. my results are the part list above.

For those curious about the title, I've built 3 PC's and picked out parts for 2 of them. None of them were for myself, they were for the high school I went to and my first internship at a cad/cam shop.

(MsF,MFE,...)",jmillancho,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ciwc4o/maximizing_my_options_of_getting_a_job_ibpe_in/,"Hello everyone! I’m currently finishing a bachelor degree in Economics and a minor in Finance (about 1 year left). I went to high school in Pensacola, but unfortunately I couldn’t afford college tuition fees in the US as an International Student, so I had to go back to my country to complete an undergraduate degree. Nonetheless, it’s always been my dream to return to the US and hopefully get a job there. I understand the low chances of getting an H1B visa nowadays but this is a huge risk that I’m willing to take. 

I started taking finance electives from my second semester and really got into it and that’s basically how I started focusing my academic cv into the skills required for the job. I have a 3.8 GPA and currently sit at rank #1 of my class. I have RA and TA experience along with a research group that I founded (mostly Data Science stuff). I know most of these accomplishments might be considered nothing coming from a top 400 university in the world which basically requires me to do a Masters degree at a target school. I’m planning to take the GMAT next semester, do a 6 months internship at a local firm and apply for fall 2021. 

In your experience, which masters programs give more recruiting opportunities to students, specially international, and upgrade the cv from random international undergraduate to competitive candidate for a job. 

The dream would be IB and I’m willing to give my everything to reach that goal. I’m thinking maybe using the masters degree to get an analyst role and work my ass off for 3 years to move up to associate. That’s why I’m initially considering MsF and MFE options since I highly doubt I’d get an associate offer even with an MBA. Also, I’d rather work 3 years, learn a lot and get experience, and move my way up than go 2 years to business school. 

Any thoughts or ideas on my options and how I can use them to maximize my chances of making it?"
ciwyr2,1,2019-07-28,"Lied to by AirBnB ""Host"" Several Times, What Do I do?",RuneInfantry,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ciwyr2/lied_to_by_airbnb_host_several_times_what_do_i_do/,"I also posted this on r/AirBnB but I really need help and so I have also posted it here.

This is going to be long, but please read because I very much need advice.

I  booked an AirBnB near Detroit for three months while I did a  programming internship for a company that works very closely with GM. I  am a little over two months of the way through my stay.

My  AirBnB consists of two tenants, neither of which is the host, as the  host lives in another house down the street. One of them is a grandma.  They pay rent to the AirBnB host, and the grandma gets a discount on her  rent when she takes care of an AirBnB guest, meaning she effectively acts as my host on a usual day.

A  little less than a month into my stay, the grandma asks if one of her  grandchildren can stay with us for a few weeks while her daughter gets  moved into a new place. Says he will be well behaved, etc, and I  reluctantly decide it is probably okay for just a few weeks.

Fast  forward to a week later, and the daughter as well as her two grandsons  have essentially moved into the house. I was not comfortable with this  arrangement, but was assured that it would be over soon. After two weeks  of this situation, I contacted the AirBnB host who had already somewhat  caught wind of what was going on. She tells me that they previously  agreed that no grandchildren were allowed to stay in the house while an  AirBnB guest was there, and this was an agreement the host and the  grandma had made prior to my arrival. The host arrives, and the two have  an explosive argument while I feel guilty for ""causing this mess"".  Afterwards, we hug it out. The date is now June 27.

That weekend, neither the grandchildren nor the daughter were at the house. I thought it was over.

Later  into that workweek, the grandma calls me in desperation and says she  doesn't know where her daughter can stay. She asks if she can have ""one  more day"". I agree. She asks for ""one more day"" for the next few days. I  am going on a trip with my family for a week soon, so I decide to allow  it and hope that when I get back from my trip she will have everything  sorted.

This is not the case. When  I get back, they are here, and when I talk to her about it, I don't  remember the details, but she essentially ""one more day""s me again.  After three more days of this, she comes up the stairs to my room and  asks me questions.

She informs me  that the host would have evicted her had I decided to leave my AirBnB  reservation after the whole argument from a couple weeks prior. She asks  me how much I pay for my reservation, and counts the days her family  had stayed with us (I feel as though they were here more days than she  counts, but I have no evidence). She comes to a number over $500 (for 16  days of them being there, again, sounds low, but I have no hard  evidence), and asks if she pays me that if I'll stay, don't tell the  host, and leave a positive review. Feeling guilty about draining money  from her, I say that half of my rent for this period would work,  totaling $250.

Her exact words are  ""You will get the last 5 and a half weeks to yourself, and you'll get  this money."" I agree. She says she will give me the money a little  before my reservation ends.

Again,  they are gone that weekend, and everything might be okay. Blah blah  blah they are back again the following week. The grandma meets me  outside after work and says she apologizes and that she will raise it to  $300 for the extra days, and that her daughter is getting a new  apartment for her and her children this Saturday. $50 sounds low for an  extra week, but again, I'm trying to help out someone in a clearly  desperate situation, so I agree.

I  left for a friend's on Friday night, but on my arrival on Saturday the  daughter was still here. The grandma works nights and I haven't been  able to talk to her yet, but there are now 3 weeks and 2 days remaining  in my reservation and I have no idea if I can trust whatever she has to  tell me when she wakes up.

The  host also contacted me a few days ago about whether or not things had  been sorted out since our big argument, but I haven't responded out of  fear of losing my (now measly sounding) $300.

Please,  please, please tell me what to do. I feel lied to and cheated and have  spent the vast majority of my stay here living with more people than the  posting on AirBnB states. Part of me wants to ask for a large amount of  money, but the grandma might say that we already had a deal for a  lesser amount. I could contact the host, but that would go against my  agreement with the grandma, and I'm not sure if I can hold the host  financially responsible for the actions of her tenant. I am 21 years old  and this is my first time living somewhere other than a dorm. Please,  please give me advice. I need this to end and I feel I am entitled to compensation.

TL;DR I have spent over a month and a half living with the daughter,  and usually the grandchildren, of one of the tenants at my AirBnB  reservation. What do I do? They are still here."

Didn’t do any actual research besides an independent study class with a professor, but didn’t produce anything notable. I received an award for undergraduate excellence in math, but I don’t know if that would help my application. 

I’ve done a couple software engineering internships, one with a defense contractor and another with a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, etc) company during undergrad. 

I joined the FAANG company and am now working in the cloud computing space on a fairly “prestigious” and “visible” team. I’ve been here for a few months. I’ve come to accept that this career is really not for me. I’m frankly burnt out from coding and don’t think staying in tech will be fulfilling for me.

I’m interested in researching urban policy, specifically centered around affordable and public housing. I’d like to get an economics PhD and focus my research on these subjects. I feel that this would give me a better chance of influencing policy than an urban planning degree would. I need to do more research on this, but suggestions are welcome.

Is it feasible to pivot like this? I could likely acquire at least a couple decent academic and industry recommendations, and I think I could get a solid GRE score.. 

Would I be a competitive applicant even though I have minimal research experience?"
ciyynq,1,2019-07-28,"How do I ask for pay increase after receiving an offer elsewhere? I did a year internship, left for 8 months, and now back as fulltimer for 3 months so far",LibertyState,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/ciyynq/how_do_i_ask_for_pay_increase_after_receiving_an/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I did a year long internship at a big corporate company. I built 2 great things that are still used today. My manager loves at least one of them and in his own words (after i came back as  a full time), it saved them at least 10 times the work while i was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

When i got the offer to full time while i was back at school, the salary did not reflect that i was coming back to the same team and have done great things, it was actually lower than what my peers were getting at new teams (they did internship at te smae company too but different team) and they didnt do ""great"" things that their managers loved. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i tried to negotiate my salary, they didnt give me what i want (i asked for 4k more, they gave me 1k more and 5k sign on bonus). I took because i didnt want to fight too hard for my first job, and i didnt know that my work has saved the team that much effort because i didnt find out about it until after i started. Now most of my friends are making more than at equal positions for no reason compared to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway,  a recruiter contacted me, I told them Im open for offers but not actively looking right now. So ill get back to you in about a year, but im open for conversation if youd like. They insisted, I went along with it, gave my resume etc etc. They asked for salary expectation, i gave a number thats 10k-13k more than my current salary, she didnt stop. She still continued and wanted me to send resume, so i suppose that that number is within their salary brackets?

&amp;#x200B;

So im gonna send my resume soon and i have good hope because the job is very close to my current job and im really good at it. Now, I dont want to switch companies because my company is much better (reputation, products, etc) and is more well known and respected. and my manager invested in me a lot during my intenrship so i dont want to leave him right away. However, I want to use the new offer (suppose i get it) to increase my salary as much as possible, doesnt have to increase by the 10k-13k i asked the new company, but at least match me with my peers (who are making 4k more than me) and a bit for actually saving my team that much effort, so maybe 6k increase. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question is, suppose i get this other offer, how do i bring it up and is it reasonable to do having been back for 3 months now (but did an internship that ended 8 months before, and was 16 months long, doing equal quality work as a full timer's responsilbiites)?"

i kept my sights to within texas because unfortunately, my GPA is around a 2.7 so i didn’t think i was going to land with a larger company (the ones that usually do relocation assistance) so i applied to as many smaller firms as i could, especially in places where moving to was feasible because i had family that lived there or housing that a family member owned and could move in to for the summer

eventually, i exhausted all the small firms that i qualified for and started throwing darts at big companies, and to my surprise, was actually able to interview with them (daktronics and johnson controls)

after about 80 something applications, with 8-10 calls back and about 5 interviews with no internship, i was a bit disappointed, but was told by peers who are much further ahead than i am (like, grad school for EE ahead) “hey man, you know how many calls back i got as a sophomore? zero, so you’re doing good”

so coupled with that, and a friend who got an internship with amex for programming (his rationale to apply was “hey, my dad has a card with amex so why not”) when he, by his own admission, absolutely flubbed the knowledge check portion of the interview and failed out of the college of engineering, but still received the works (5 star resort for when he interviewed, flights paid for, housing stipend, meal allowance) - i feel confident that i can land an internship for the next summer

i just really would like to get an internship out of texas, specifically in the SE united states because i need to get away from home, and i want the best possible chances of doing so

So I was a pretty driven guy during my teenage years. At a certain point I decided to turn my life around, lose about 200 pounds, dedicate myself to learn skills that I was passionate about and could use in work. I did all of them pretty successfully and felt like I was taking very measures steps to better my life, and college was the logical next step.

Fast foward four years, I have worked several internships, was selected to be the only tutor for our programming in the school, did well in my classes, got the respect of my teachers and again just generally did what I considered pretty well for myself. 
However by the end of my college career between all the hours of work and stress I lost some of that drive and dedication. I'm not particularly unhappy and I do enjoy my work and have landed several jobs but I also feel a sort of ""what's the point"" nehind everything too. The world looks like a big empty place with not a whole lot to do, and I find it difficult to bring myself to keep up with working out as well. I don't want to let myself slip back to what I was, but I also am having trouble finding the passion to do anything else. I guess that's where I'm having trouble.

Because I used to be filled with motivation and passion. But i just don’t know where or who else to tell this too.

I used to live in abroad and I enjoyed doing music a lot, it made me feel more than alive whenever I played with the band, I had a healthy circle of friends, I saw myself as a Sound Engineer in the future but I had to leave all this due to financial problems back to the Philippines.

So now I’ve pretty much lost contact with my old circle of friends, band is broken and there is no career path to being a sound engineer here. We don’t talk anymore, and I understand. Why would they?

So now I needed to go to college.

I didn’t want to go to college, I felt like I could work my way up from any corporate work place as is but in the culture here, it’s the paper that matters.

Also that the language barriers and culture was so vast I had a hard time making friends. Luckily I was able to make a few good friends when I did a one compulsory year of high school here. They were all similar to me.

Anyway back to the subject, when I came to the Philippines I didn’t lose my motivation yet. I still had a drive to be successful. On my first year of college I gave myself a goal to get a degree of Marketing and use it to get a corporate job for a few years then lend some money from my uncle to start a business.

Every year after the first, I could feel my motivation being grinded to dust. The shit I was learning was so utterly useless I wanted to just leave college right off the bat. But my family would kill me. 

The feeling of “what I’m doing is pointless” grows every year.

My family wants me to get a degree above anything else. Only then will they stop bugging me.

On my 2nd year it feels like I’ve been learning the same thing but worded differently. I feel like I’m wasting my time. I feel like everything I’ve been doing up to now has been worthless.

But I grit my teeth and told myself to get through this with solitude.

On my 3rd and 4th year. We had a bunch of theses and Business Plans we had to do which would be graded as our exams.

We had to do them in groups of at least 5 and in almost every group there was some sort of payment to have these done outside of school to get the easy way out. 

Paying somebody to do it for you.

I didn’t like this idea but I had no choice. We NEEDED to be in groups so I did my part and paid anyway. So this enforced the feeling of uselessness to my goals even more.

As of now, I am meant to graduate next year with only my Internship and 6 units left to do. I actually dropped some subjects In the past so I’m a year late.

But now all I do is play video games with my initial friends I’ve made every time I come home. The entire summer all I did was play games, I’d meet up with them but only twice in 3 months over the summer.

 I made 0 real friends in college because it’s so hard to talk or find people to speak to in English, or even find people who are somewhat similar. 

Everyday I wake up, thinking about that goal and I get a heavy, pushy and warm feeling on my chest. 

Everyday thinking about enrolling again, i get the same feeling.

I don’t have any motivation anymore. I can’t see myself ever achieving that goal. I don’t even know what goal I should give myself. 

My friends said I should be a streamer or YouTuber because of my rank or versatility. But I just don’t have the hardware to do so. Even then, I doubt people would watch me, skill doesn’t equate to content, does it?

I’ve been paying for half my tuition, internet and food by selling accounts, selling in-game currency for money or boosting accounts. 

My uncle helps pay for my tuition and I am very grateful. But I feel like he’s wasting his money on me. He always gives me pep talks about being a successful marketer but I only chose this to give me an edge in the work place because I thought it’s the most versatile option out of all the courses/degrees.

Even then, I still live with my family. But apparently that’s normal here, but it feels wrong to me.

I feel like deadweight.

I guess I’m just going to try to get through college, but with only 6 units and internship left to do but it feels like such a chore to me now. 

Whenever I think about it I just feel so uneasy, trying to achieve a goal that I’m not interested in.

All this time, I’ve just been telling myself to “grit my teeth” or “harden up” or “do It
through solitude”

But now, I feel like will is about to break. No real goals. No motivation. No passion. Nothing but a college degree that awaits me. A paper I never wanted to have.

I appreciate anyone that took the time to read this. Just letting it out here gives me a good feeling that I’ve released some weight off my chest."

The idea of a react component makes sense but trying to remember the syntax of it all is a huge issue for me. I tried using styled-components with typescript and could not make the button on my machine look the same as in the guide and have no idea why. 

What are some online resources I can use to become more comfortable with React/typescript? What are your strategies to learn these things?"

Does this look good? As far as lower divisions go I only have the Calculus series and 31-33 articulated. 45C will possibly be articulated (from transcript review), I'm not sure if I should take the credit exam just in case.

Data Structures &amp; Algorithms should be mostly review for me - I took an equivalent DS course in C++ which ASSIST articulates to Berkeley's 61B (which in turn articulates to 46 but my counselor said the CC course will likely not articulate). Should I fight to get it articulated? I think retaking the course at the university level could be beneficial to me.

Is there anything I should swap out or remove? My primary goal this first quarter is to prepare for internships via Leetcode and personal projects. 

Also, at this point in time (with only the above mentioned courses articulated for CS major) is it possible or feasible to make room in my schedule to pursue a minor? Thinking of Sociology, Psychology, Mathematics, or Statistics.

would also appreciate professor recommendations! :)"

For context, I graduated this past spring and accepted a software engineering job. During my undergrad I did on-campus research and several industry internships. I’ve written this mostly based off my own experience, online reading, and conversations with people I know. I recognize that everyone’s experience is unique and my perspective is just one of many, so if there’s anything you disagree with or would like to add, I’d love to take suggestions!

**Overview**

Computer science is one of the most popular majors at UMD. The CS program here has a strong reputation, and that combined with a strong job market for software engineers means that the program has grown rapidly in recent years. The CS department is housed in the Brendan Iribe Center, a brand-new building that opened in Spring 2019.

Software engineering – i.e., working at a company designing and writing software – is the most common career path for CS graduates. There are many job opportunities available locally – government agencies and defense contractors have a big presence here, with Amazon coming soon! Many CS grads also end up going to tech hubs (e.g. SF, Seattle, NYC) to work at major software companies. There are also opportunities in research and academia, particularly in “hot” fields of CS such as data science and machine learning.

As for as what the major entails – graduating with a CS degree should give you a strong programming foundation. However, computer science is about more than just programming, or even computers. It is the study of comput*ing*, answering questions like “What is possible to be computed?” or “How fast can something be computed?” This is reflected in the fact that the major has a significant theory component in addition to programming. Strong logical and analytical skills, as well as persistence, are helpful toward doing well in the major.

The CS program offers two specializations, cybersecurity and data science, in addition to the general track. Specializations do restrict the upper-level courses you can take (in a major where seats in upper-level courses are fairly tight), so take that into account if you are considering a specialization.

**Required Introductory Courses**

Most people start off in either CMSC131 or CMSC132, depending on prior programming background.

CMSC131 is intended to be a first “intro to programming” course, taught in Java. It covers basic programming constructs (if statements, loops, etc.) and object-oriented programming concepts. If you have prior programming knowledge, you can exempt out of 131 with either a score of 5 on AP CS or by taking an exemption exam. If you don’t have prior programming knowledge, I would recommend being selective about who you take this class with. A good professor can get you hooked on programming, while a bad one could make you feel lost and discouraged and want to quit the major after the first class. After this class, you will probably start to get a feel for whether you like programming or not.

CMSC132 is, in my opinion, one of the most important classes in the major because it teaches you almost everything you need to know for technical interviews. It is a continuation of 131 but gets into more theoretical topics like data structures (linked lists, trees, heaps, etc.) and Big O notation. You learn how to implement the data structures and the situations in which they are useful. Many job and internship interviews simply require you to apply the content of 132 in a clever manner so definitely pay close attention in this class. You can also exemption-exam out of this class but for most people I’d recommend taking it unless you’re really confident about the material.

CMSC216 switches gears to the venerable C programming language. C is a very old language and does much less behind-the-scenes magic than Java does, so you’ll get a better idea of what’s happening when you compile and run a program and you’ll learn how to manually manage memory. You’ll then learn some form of assembly language, which is a further step below C in terms of level of abstraction. Throughout the course you’ll be running stuff on a UNIX server (grace), so you’ll learn how to use the UNIX/Linux command line – an extremely important skill in many workplaces.

CMSC250 is mostly a math course. Honestly I didn’t feel this class left a strong impression on me, but I remember we covered Boolean logic and did a lot of proofs by induction.

CMSC330 is a very interesting class IMO. I think the primary purpose of the class is to simply get you exposed to a diverse set of programming languages that are substantially different in style and philosophy. The three languages currently taught are Ruby, OCaml, and Rust, with OCaml (functional programming) taking most of the time. Functional programming can be very mind-bending coming from object-oriented languages but many people find it very elegant once it clicks. You also learn regular expressions and the theory behind them, and a little bit about parsing as a preview to 430 (compilers). According to Anwar this class makes a lot of people feel like they’ve become a real computer scientist as opposed to just a programmer, which I think is a fair description. After this class you should be comfortable learning just about any programming language on your own.

CMSC351 – algorithms – has a notorious reputation, particularly with Kruskal. Kruskal covered a lot of sorting algorithms and formally analyzed their runtimes, with a more rigorous definition of Big O from 132. Another important topic was graph algorithms (including Kruskal’s algorithm!) and NP completeness. Lots of people go into this class very worried about its difficulty but I really think it varies from person to person. The assignments and exams require some creativity to come up with efficient algorithms for doing things, which comes more naturally to some people. Despite its reputation, the failure rate of CMSC351 is about the same as other CS lower-levels. I found a good study group very helpful.

**Upper-level courses**

Once you pass 330 and 351, you are largely in control of your own experience for the remainder of your degree. You can take a lot of hard classes, or a lot of easy classes; you can take a lot of theory-heavy classes, or a lot of programming-heavy classes. This subreddit already has a ton of threads about the value and difficulty of most of the 400-level electives so I won’t bother to repeat that here. Off the top of my head I know 412 (operating systems) is known as the most difficult 400-level by far, and I heard 417 (networks) is also pretty difficult. Again, just search this subreddit for more details about any particular 400-level class. Choose classes based on your interests and desired difficulty level. Unfortunately, seat availability might affect your ability to get into a specific class so have some flexibility, especially at the beginning of your 400-levels.

**Beyond the degree**

I’ve split this section into three subsections – industry, Ph.D, and Master’s – to cover the main possibilities for what people might want to do after graduation. For each one I’ll talk about some of the things you can do as a student to improve your prospects.

*Industry*

As I mentioned previously, going to the industry to work as a software engineer is the most common outcome as a CS grad. The most valuable thing you can do as a student to land a good post-grad software engineering job is to do internships. Employers love students having internship experience because it shows that you’re capable of writing code in a professional environment, and that you can build more than just toy projects for class. Many (most?) companies will also extend return offers to interns who perform well, so if you play your internship cards well, you may not even have to go through a job search in your senior year! Conversely, graduating without any internships is likely to make your job search a lot more difficult. In my opinion you should start applying to internships as soon as you feel comfortable with the material in 132.

There are many avenues through which you can land internships. Make sure you take advantage of the CS career fairs, especially the bigger one in fall when most companies are hiring for the coming summer. UMD being a “target school” for CS, we’re lucky to have a ton of major companies – including the “big 4” i.e. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon – sending representatives here to recruit at the career fair and interview students on campus. You can also network through the various events that companies hold on campus.

Outside of the career fair, there are many places where you can apply online, including job boards and directly on company websites. I’ve linked to some in the resources section below. But you should expect positive response rates to online applications to be very low (5% to 10% is normal), so apply far and wide. The internship search can be grueling and discouraging, especially as an underclassman. Not getting an internship as a freshman is totally normal and nothing to worry about, just do your best. It does get easier as you get closer to graduation. 

Not quite as good as internships but far better than nothing, is doing personal projects. Basically, just come up with an idea for something you want to build and build it. If you don’t know how, Google until you figure it out. It doesn’t have to be some completely new idea or the next Facebook – totally fine to start off with something simple like a todo list app or a personal website. The idea is to demonstrate that you can apply what you learned in class to build something real and have some talking points for your resume and interviews. If you aren’t getting bites on your internship applications because your resume is blank, personal projects are a great way to break that cycle. If you can’t work up the motivation to build a project, try going to a hackathon or two. Learn how to use Git and showcase your projects on Github. (But don’t post class projects to Github!)

*Ph.D*

I’ll preface this section by saying that a big chunk of this information comes from Prof. Dave Levin, particularly his “So you’re thinking about grad school” talk. If you are considering grad school or research, I would highly recommend talking to him or going to one of his grad school info sessions. He runs the CS departmental honors program and can give a lot of helpful advice on the topic of grad school.

As far as I can tell, there are two very common reasons that people decide to do a Ph.D in CS:

* They love research and want a career in research. They want to be working on something new and cutting-edge all the time and have greater flexibility to choose what to work on. They may have tried doing software engineering in a company but discovered that most code written in companies is too mundane for their liking. They may be willing to take a pay cut to do more “interesting” research work, often in academia. A lot of professors here would fit this description.
* They are looking to break into a subfield of CS where most job positions actually require a Ph.D – the classic example of this being machine learning and related fields (computer vision, natural language processing, etc.)

If you’re considering getting a Ph.D for some other reason, again I would recommend having a chat with Dave or some other CS professors to get some advice on whether it makes sense for you. Remember that getting a Ph.D is a huge time investment (5+ years) and comes with a large opportunity cost since you could be making a lot of money and climbing the ladder in a company during those years. You wouldn’t want to put in all that effort only to discover that you’re now overqualified for the jobs you want. If you just want more education before starting a job, consider a professional Masters.

So let’s say you’ve established that you do want to get a Ph.D. How do you actually get admitted to a Ph.D program? Ph.D admissions generally works a lot differently than undergrad, removing the faceless “admissions committee” that is a staple of undergrad admissions. Instead, applications go into a database that professors can look through, and if a professor wants you to join their lab, you’re admitted. As a Ph.D student your #1 job will be to do research, so professors are primarily evaluating you on your potential to do research.

For that reason, getting research experience as an undergrad is one of the best ways to strengthen your profile for Ph.D applications. Bonus points for co-authoring a published paper, and even more bonus points for first-authoring a paper. And if you present a paper at a conference, you’d be heads and shoulders above other applicants. Basically, the more you can show that you can do good research, the more confident professors reviewing your application will be about bringing you on.

Another important part of Ph.D applications is recommendation letters. Most programs require at least three, so think about who you might be able to get letters from. Letters from professors who have directly supervised you in a research setting are the most valuable, followed by letters from professors who know you well personally (e.g. a professor you’ve TA’d for.) “Did well in class” letters are acceptable but not generally very compelling, so you want to avoid having all three letters be DWIC letters. Strong positive recommendations from esteemed faculty (“You’d be crazy not to accept this student!”) can override just about any weakness in an application, so try to make the most of your recommendation letters.

Finally, your application will likely include a statement of purpose explaining your goals for getting a Ph.D, your undergraduate transcript, and GRE and TOEFL scores if applicable. You generally want your GPA and test scores as high as you can get them but research the institutions you are interested in to see if they have published cutoffs or averages. Application deadlines are usually around December of senior year.

*Master’s*

Master’s programs broadly come in two flavors, “research Master’s” and “professional Master’s.” Research Master’s programs are generally designed for people who plan to continue on to a Ph.D, while professional Master’s programs are designed for people who intend to start working afterward without doing a Ph.D. As the name implies, research Master’s programs typically involve a research component and often a Master’s thesis in addition to coursework. Professional Master’s programs tend to only require courses and therefore feel much like a continuation of undergrad.

Why would one do a research Master’s or a professional Master’s? I’d say that a research Master’s makes sense if you aren’t sure whether you like research and want to try it out more before committing to a Ph.D, or if you feel your background and credentials aren’t good enough to apply for Ph.D programs and want some more time to strengthen your profile. But if you already know that you want a Ph.D and have the credentials to get into the Ph.D programs you want, I’d probably try to go straight for the Ph.D and skip the Master’s.

A professional Master’s makes sense if you aren’t interested in doing a Ph.D or research but still want the credentials – basically you want “M.S.” in your title and on your resume. Some companies offer increased pay for MS grads and others don’t; whether the extra credential is worth it is your call to make.

Admissions-wise, I would say that the criteria for research Master’s is broadly the same as for Ph.D, with the bar set somewhat lower for prior research experience. For a professional Master’s, I would say the importance of research experience goes down while the importance of having internships and industry experience goes up.

Another option to consider is doing a part-time professional Master’s while working, especially if you’re going to work at a company that offers to subsidize tuition. Master’s programs are expensive because they are often cash cows for CS departments. So, having someone else foot the bill can be a good move. However, the downsides are that it will take longer to complete and your work/life balance may suffer.

Finally, also consider UMD’s combined BS/MS program. This lets you take grad-level classes during undergrad and have them count toward the MS degree so that you can finish the MS with only 1-1.5 extra years. AFAIK it is fairly easy to get in and you get to skip the GRE, thus avoiding a lot of admissions-related stress.

*Undergraduate research opportunities*

Even if you don’t intend to go to grad school, doing undergrad research can benefit you in a lot of ways. It can give you connections to professors who can write you recommendations, help you figure out what CS subfields you enjoy, give you course credit (CMSC499) or pay, and serve as a stepping stone to internships. Ask around to figure out what professors are looking for undergrad research assistants, or join the departmental honors program…

*Departmental honors program*

Related to undergrad research is the CS departmental honors program. It’s run by Dave Levin and Leilani Battle and intended to help undergrads try research, especially if you have no idea where to start. You can apply for it after you finish 216 and 250 assuming you meet the GPA requirement – 3.5 CS and 3.25 overall – and I believe most people are admitted. Once you’re in the requirements to complete are relatively light. You first take a 1-credit CMSC396H course where a bunch of professors guest-lecture about their research, to try to match students with professors. This class can be waived if you’ve already secured a professor to do research with on your own. Then you complete one semester of research with the professor via taking CMSC499, write a report (“honors thesis”) about what you did, take at least one grad-level or honors 4XXH class, and finally maintain your GPA above the requirement. The CMSC499 and grad-level class can both count for CS upper-level elective credit, so in theory you can complete departmental honors without increasing the number of classes you have to take, discounting the 1-credit 396H. For this you get a nice “departmental honors” mark on your transcript upon graduation.

Note that the departmental honors website lists doing an “oral defense” as a requirement, but AFAIK this isn’t and has never been a thing, so I don’t know why it’s still listed 🤔

*Internship and job search resources*

**Some final bits of advice**

A problem I’ve heard about fairly frequently is first-time programmers getting intimidated seeing all the people coming in with prior programming experience and acting like they know everything. To that I will say that most of those people don’t know as much as they seem, and eventually you realize that this field is so unbelievably big that no one know anything and everyone’s just learning as much as they need to get by. I know a lot of people who have come in as freshmen with varying amounts of programming experience. Everyone struggled getting internships freshmen/sophomore year, but now approaching graduation they’re all doing just fine in the job search. Just give it some time.

Imposter syndrome – feeling like you don’t deserve the job/internship/degree you got and you just got lucky somehow – is also somewhat rampant in this field. While there’s no “cure” for it, it is important to recognize and reassure yourself that you can do it. It’s okay and even healthy to feel slightly underqualified because if you already know everything you need to know, you aren’t learning anything new. CS is a field that requires continuous learning.

Finally, don’t cheat, and especially don’t copy code. The CS department takes it seriously, it is automatically scanned for, and tons of people get busted every year.

Good luck and enjoy your time at UMD. Classes and career are important, but so is making friends and having fun. Take it easy from time to time."
cj7s5h,1,2019-07-29,Requesting Guidance. Should I take a full stack course as a beginner if I want to pursue a cyber security career?,Corrupted-Heaven,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cj7s5h/requesting_guidance_should_i_take_a_full_stack/,"Hello Everyone,

I am a computer engineering student who has next year as his last in university, and whom still hasn't managed to get into an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I have got the opportunity to enroll in a full stack course which demands 13 hours a week, divided into 3 days, for 6 months, starting this September.

&amp;#x200B;

As a small background. I didn't apply to internships because I thought that I didn't have enough knowledge and experience to be accepted, mainly because I haven't worked on any project outside what my courses demanded. That was my mistake which I'm trying to fix by creating projects this summer and enhancing my skills so I won't be the dull knife I have been so far. And after which I will start applying to as many companies as I can in order to be accepted for at least a one year internship 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, now I am in a dilemma. on one hand this program will benefit me massively and I am confident I will be able to find a job after finishing it. On the other hand, this isn't the field I want to advance in.

I am aware that my lack of experience denies me the knowledge required to reach a correct decision, since I don't know much about full stack and so it's entirely possible I will be compelled to continue in this field. 

However if I truly am going to pursue a career in security, will this program be a liability for my goal, or in other words, will learning full stack be so disconnected from cyber security that my time will be best spent learning alone?

What do you advice me to do?"

Is there something just less than Domain Admin that gives most of the same capability?,NecessaryEvil-BMC,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cjb159/looking_to_redo_ad_permissions_for_it_is_there/,"We want help desk to be able to create and edit users in AD, move computers around, create groups, etc., but I think the plan is to take away some of the capability to remove some of the capabilities to delete certain things. I'm not entirely sure yet, as my boss just brought this up to me last Friday after hours. 

I just know the main goal is to not just be giving Domain Administrator access to everyone (especially summer interns). The helpdesk needs full access to computers, but not the entire domain. We plan on putting them in a new Helpdesk domain user group, and adding that group to the local administrators of the computers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know within VMware's VCSA, I set up the permissions for the help desk, that lets them turn on and off machines, and remote into them, but only the network/system administration group can create, edit, and delete VMs and datastores.

If there's any other insight or anecdotes from past endeavors similar to this that should make us stop looking at this, I'm all ears...err, eyes."

First of all, I want to thank people of this sub for answering noob my questions.   
I am an electrical and electronics engineering graduate, looking for a junior embedded systems engineer job post. My job seek has been taking months now. I apply to jobs regularly for months. I had two interviews (these were open applications, people thought I was interesting, turns out they couldn't find me a suitable  position in their projects). 

I didn't learn much about embedded systems and had very basic coding skills after graduation, therefore I was studying by myself, practicing c++ and learn so many theoretical stuff. Let's say I wasn't lucky enough to come across a company that could give me a chance. Also, most companies that I apply are in Germany because they have many interesting projects there that I'd really like to be a part of and I am from Turkey.

**At this point, I start to lose my motivation and maybe consider other positions. Do you think I should also apply for internships?**

Need serious advice.,PussyLunch,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/cjd9nj/long_post_ahead_need_serious_advice/,"Hopefully this post doesn’t get too long, but here it goes, I’ll be transparent as possible. For the past 3 years I have done absolutely nothing, I was in a masters program and things kind of fell threw right at the end, and now 3 years have passed of me leeching off my aunt and mother playing video games, sleeping, and staying inside. 

I am 27 now and for the past 3 months I have been moving forward quite a bit, I’ve lost a lot of weight, got back into my masters program and will be able to finish it within 4 months. 

Here’s the fun part and why I am on this sub, I’m completing an internship to finish my degree and I hate this shit more than I should. My drive is long, the pay sucks, and the work is all bullshit, but all things are pointing positive and I’ve  technically haven’t been in a better spot. And yes I understand that my options will be better once this shit is over with, but knowing that doesn’t help me get through the day. So why the fuck am I so miserable, that shit doesn’t make sense. Everyone is telling me to get on medication and frankly I’m against it since I already was on two pills for 7 months. I dropped them cold turkey when I got off my ass 3 months ago. I never thought the medicine helped personally and neither did my family, which is funny since they think it’s a good idea again. 

No matter what happens, I’m finishing this internship, but the question I want answered is if you guys think I should go back to living with my mom and leeching off of her. I get it. I’m a lazy piece of shit, I think about this everyday and honestly this might be my true nature, and not just the typical lazy bullshit like everyone thinks they have, like, this is the I sat around for 3 years and it didn’t bother me lazy. The truth is when I sat around for so long, I probably wasn’t “happy” but I know damn well I wasn’t unhappy either, and now, now I know I am unhappy. 

So yeah, I’m going to have a MS soon, and it doesn’t excite me, I don’t feel motivated and I really don’t give a shit. I was so excited to put everything back into place and full of energy, but now that I’m doing this shit, fuck all of it. So yeah, if I have the opportunity to leech off my mom should I just do it? Give me any kind of advice, please. I don’t think I’m suicidal, but the thought of driving off the road one day and trying to cripple myself does put a smile on my face and brightens my day.

Edit: oh and I just want to add this last thing. I have talked to mom about this, I wouldn’t be doing nothing this time. I’ll continue to workout and go outside, but I think a part time job could be really beneficial to me. While I don’t give a shit, I will have a MS soon, so I’ll be fucking picky to the point where I may never find something good enough for me. My mental health is the most important thing, I won’t ruin it by hating myself and being miserable."
cjdbgj,1,2019-07-29,"I'm a Finance Intern for a fairly successful restaurant in Boston, and have a 1 year tenure with the company. I'm getting paid minimum wage, and I'm unsure if or how I should approach my boss about a raise",shevildevil,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cjdbgj/im_a_finance_intern_for_a_fairly_successful/,"So basically the title.

I'm an upcoming Junior in college and have been working for a pretty successful restaurant startup in Boston as a Financial/Accounting Intern since June. The employment agreement is that I have a 1 year tenure with the company as an intern, and it's been a great experience.

The only issue I have is that I'm being paid $13.50/hour for this position, which includes HR tasks (organizing a database of all employees), running payroll for the entire company, building spreadsheets for various tracking of employee progress and costs, and analyzing financial reports. As of now, the CEO and I are the only ones in the company who manages the financial, accounting, and data-oriented tasks. I know that the company has a job listing for a Financial Specialist to join the team, and the starting salary for that position is listed as $75,000. However, the tasks for the listing includes the same things I'm doing now as an intern (payroll, creating databases/spreadsheets, analysis of financial reports and models, etc), and it got me thinking about my payrate.

Another thing to note is that may or may not be relevant is that my payrate of $13.50 is the same as the employees who work on the line at the restaurants. This has slightly peeved me, as I feel that I'm doing a lot more work than a line server at a restaurant. I've looked into the wages of other financial interns at other companies, and they make ~20-25$/hr.

But on the other hand, I feel like I shouldn't ask for a raise since I'm doing this job as an intern and the experience is great for future internships. Even though I'm getting paid so low, I'm fortunate enough to be from a wealthy family who can help me out with rent for my living situation this summer and with any other necessities. I just feel so guilty using my family's money when I have my own job and working 40+ hours a week.

I just don't know what to do in this situation, can anyone give me some advice on this?"

I'll be graduating university next year (2020), and would like to work at a start-up in Toronto, preferably right after 4th year is over or during September.

I am undergoing orthognathic surgery to correct my overjet in May. TBH, my jaw isn't that bad because the braces helped fixed a majority of the problem, but getting the surgery would give me a perfect jaw. The recovery time would take 6 weeks, but I def regret not fixing this when I was younger because **I feel like the timing of the surgery will affect my chances of securing any sort of job-offer for 2020.**

I know startups have a more flexible hiring process, but I have a feeling process could still take a couple of months. I really don't want to be staying at home, still applying for applications during summer post-op because I couldn't secure a summer internship or because I was partially out during the summer. I'm also underqualified, so no one's going to be waiting out for me. I'm worried about missing a cycle in the hiring process, and then boom, I have to wait till 2021 or something to apply/start working. I really don't want to delay getting out into the real-world. 

Are start-ups ever looking for people to work in September, without some sort of official summer internship? Or any-time during June, July, August?

I'd like to know people's thoughts on this.

My freshman year, I had an internship position at a small company near where I live (USA), but that was more controls engineering where I used MSI Safe Soft and ladder logic. I did create a SQL database with some Java so the company could search through paperwork faster, but that's really it.

I also don't have a TA position despite my rather high GPA 3.84/4.00 because I'm pretty involved with Club Tennis and we qualified for the national tournament which I went to when interviews for these positions were happening. I told the professor in charge of interviewing and he refused to let me interview at another date because there were so many applicants.

The languages I know are basically only the ones I was taught at University: Java, C, some SQL

This summer I've been studying Python 3 through a Udemy course I found. I'll be working on a web scrapping project soon as part of the course which I plan to put on my GitHub.

I don't have any side projects on my GitHub. So far, its just mainly been all my coursework projects like push down automata, neural networks, heuristic mini-max connect 4, parse tree evaluator, etc.

Last year (as a Sophmore) I tried taking my Universities algorithm's course, but I ended up dropping it because it was pretty difficult and recommended for Juniors. I asked one of my friends who will be working full time at Amazon soon what I should do to try and land an internship and he said to basically just study algorithms and use leetcode. I plan to read the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* for help on algorithms and then try and apply some of it using leetcode to get better at algorithms. I'm not sure how much it'll help because it seems to me like people either understand them or don't.

I'm kinda worried that my resume sucks (no side projects/no internship this summer), and that I won't even get an interview at one of the big tech companies. If I do get an interview, I'm worried that I might just not be smart enough to figure out the algorithms they'll interview me on (I dropped my algorithms course after the graph theory exam, just before linear programming). I know that there are plenty of people in my year with super stacked resumes so it just seems far fetched.

In high school, I thought I was a pretty smart and did fairly well on my SAT (2170/2400), but that algorithms course did me dirty.

So I have a couple questions:

1. Given what I've written, is it still possible for me to get an interview from a big tech company?
2. What should I do now to make my resume stronger?
3. How did you go about learning those advanced algorithms in University? My college doesn't even recommend a book to study - we just show up to class.
4. How do I know if I'm considered intermediate, advanced, or an expert at a certain coding language? Like for Java, I've been coding with it for a few years now and we never really used any advanced packages (just scanner, math, file i/o, etc)
5. I've done quite a few projects in C, but I still fell really uncomfortable with the language. Is that normal?

I just had to get a few things off my mind..."

I have an in-person interview for a junior DevOps position this Friday and would love some advice on how to prepare for it and the things I should be expecting. A little background about myself, I am currently finishing up my last class in college to earn my CS degree this coming August. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to intern during my studies so I have no professional experience but I have taken classes such as Unix systems, Operating systems, Machine learning, and Theory of Automata that have given me some exposure to bash, Unix/Linux, python, and C programming.   


My question is, what topics should I cover and go over before the interview? I have started to study the CI/CD pipeline, its workflow, some basic Unix/Linux questions, bash script programs, and basic networking questions. The job description laid out various topics of things I should now and was listed as follows:

1. Building CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring security
2. Ability to script and code at a production quality level
3. Background in Linux/Unix Administration
4. Knowledge of automation/configuration management using Terraform, Ansible or an equivalent
5. Experience in CI/CD software deployment automation tools (Jenkins, Artifactory, Spinnaker, etc.)
6. Ability to use a wide variety of open source technologies and cloud services
7. An understanding of networking basics is preferred. Switching/routing, VPNs, load balancing, proxying, network virtualization, firewall basics  


Thank you!"

**Subjective**

Essays (out of 10) and additional info about them: Can't really judge them since I'm still in the writing process, if you could audit and critique my ideas that would be greatly appreciated! Ideas: Overcoming my self-doubt (which causes my extreme test anxiety) and growing as a person, developing my love for STEM (with a unique twist that I don't really want to post here because anyone could copy the idea), My love for Rubik's cubing and building legos from a young age and how that ties in with my big passion for STEM.

Letters of Recommendation (out of 10) and additional info about them:

(8/10) AP Lang Teacher - worked extremely hard in his class even though I am not a native speaker, he knew me pretty well and also knew about how I do robotics.

(9.5/10) Physics 2 and Calc BC/Multivariable teachers - worked extremely hard in both of these classes, both teachers knew that and about how I competed in robotics and my overall love for math and science.

(8-9/10) AP Chem teacher, really easy and fun class for me and I scored a 5, and she knew a lot about me in robotics since she was the advisor a couple years ago, so she was always interested in talking about it and was super pumped about us getting 2nd in worlds.

(10/10) Internship manager - knows about me as a person and outside of the classroom which I think will be really helpful, also can talk about my CS and engineering knowledge and eagerness to learn.

Anything else to know about you: I am a very hardworking person, and coming from a school where so many students don't have to work as hard to get higher scores than me is pretty annoying. Yet that doesn't stop me from putting in the dedication in my work. High school has been a very bumpy ride for me as I started on a 4.0, but then went down during my sophomore year, but I am working my way back up. Also have really bad test anxiety where most of the time, my test scores don't really correlate with my studying (this can be seen in my AP and SAT/ACT scores). Physics is an example: I love physics a lot, it is my favorite subject at school, yet I just can't do well on the tests because I get so nervous, I forget things and end up doing a lot worse than I should. But still that won't stop me and that's why I plan on retaking the Physics C exams because I know that, even though I have to put in a lot of work, I can get 5s on both. Also, my lowest point was 1st semester sophomore year, where I had literal physical reactions (heating up on the inside, itching back) while taking tests; due to this I received a C in AP Calc AB and a B in Physics 1 (also my math teacher was the worst at the school egotistical, sexist, and one that completely changed her behavior whenever the principal was around, she did not enjoy teaching her students whatsoever). My counselor was recommending me to drop some of my AP Courses, but I still pushed through and second semester I only received a B in AP Calc AB. I also retook AP Calc AB first semester over the summer and received a 101.5% in the class, which truly reflected my competency in math. My junior year I received all As in my math and science courses and only one B in AP lang.

Any feedback is appreciated, and a big thank you to anyone who is taking the time to read through my whole post, means a lot to me!!! :)"

I got a request to do a coding exam for the possibility of an internship at my dream company.  I've done a coding test for them before (like three months ago) and failed it. I kind of quit programming after that because I figured I just wasn't smart enough and went on to try different career opportunities. I took a few college courses on Java and basic HTML/CSS but I'm pretty much just two years self-taught in a pretty wide range of OOP languages. It's on HackerRank so I know I have the possibility to write the programs in a wide range of languages if I wanted. I doubt I'll pass this thing, but I figure you guys might be able to give me some tips. I don't have much of an idea about being a career-oriented person and was wondering if there were maybe some things I could do to show them that I'm willing to work hard to learn everything that is needed if given the position? I've never had any tech job experience so I'm not sure exactly about the principles of things like this. Thanks in advance."

I just wanted more alone time. We were in a long distance relationship so I only saw her on weekends, but I wanted more. We talked on the phone every day too. One day I just couldn't take it. We were together two years. She was great honestly. I really just felt like I couldn't date anyone. I feel very selfish in all my action and I always feel like I have to be fake all the time. I feel like a child. While I was dating her I couldn't separate her in my mind, anything I thought about she was in my head, not in a good way or a bad way. I didn't feel comfortable going to store without telling her. I don't think she would have cared, but it was just the thought that she would question why I went that bothered me, I liked not being questioned. 

I have never told anyone how I actually feel. I grew up in a better off family, not rich but parents made 250k+ a year in small town. So my college, cars, and everything was paid for. I did work just. I worked 40 hours a week durning the summer in high school and part time in college. I did it because I felt guilty. Everyone would tell me how easy I have it. I also grew up on a farm so I had chores I did every day. Anyway I'm a semester behind in college because I'm so lost. I'm getting a degree in computer science and I've gone on the same internship 3 years in a row and will hopefully get to work there, right now they said they are trying to find me a job there. So pretty much no struggle, but I'm not as happy as I should be. I always wanted a girlfriend before her I felt like I would be so normal then. See I always felt different. In my home town I was nerdy but 'popular'. Everyone just knew me. In college I haven't made any friends. I have no confidence, terrible social anxiety, and I just feel stupid. I've downloaded tinder since breaking up and I've matched with actually cool attractive girls. This surprised me, but I just don't want to talk to them. I went on dates, but I didn't like it. I'm too selfish with my time and alone time. I love being in control. I think I have a form of OCD. If any part of my day is changed, it hurts me in my head. At my internship, I can come in anytime I want, but if I come in later it makes me feel so uncomfortable. This is the way with everything. I like to go to bed, wake up, eat, workout all the same time each day. I really can't imagine sharing my life with someone. I have tried stuff in my life. In high school I went to the parties and I had fun, but I became an alcoholic and ended up doing community service. In the beginning of college I went to parties and had some fun, but it got old. I converted a van with a friend and drove it across the country. But at the end of day I like doing the same thing. Sure these other things are fun and I will do them. I'm looking into a 500 mile dirt bike desert race for next summer. But most of the time I want to go to bed at 9:30pm, wake up 6am, workout, go to work, come home and work on my projects. The weekends I kinda like to stick to it, but I'll try to go out or hangout with friends. But staying home and working on projects is fun too. The whole time I dated her I stayed up to talk to her, part of it was her job, or she would be upset, but I did it 12 or 1 in the morning. It drove me crazy that I couldn't go to sleep when I wanted, or without telling anyone that I was. Idk if that's my OCD or what. But I've never meant any girl like this. My roommates actually went to bed 9:30 to 10:00, but I was dating her so I would usually be up until 11ish. Anyway more weird things are: I don't want kids, I don't like drinking that much(I over did it), I'm an atheist, marriage is nothing to me, I like a rigid routine, I like to only eat healthy, I don't like being around more than one person. I'm just so uncomfortable with myself. I saw a girl my age smoking next to the place I work and I actually thought, how can she do? She looked successful. I just thought how could someone let everyone see you doing something that you know is bad for you. I don't want to smoke (it does disgust me) lol but I couldn't just because I would feel like everyone would think I'm an idiot. Sometimes I'll tell people I'm spending the weekend alone or that I'll be asleep by the time they want to go out and they question my choices and I feel like such an idiot. I'm not really close with anyone, so I feel so alone. Sorry I just had to get this out there. It would mean the world if someone actually read this and talked to me :/"

a few years ago I got in a car accident with 5 of my friends when it was wet out. None of my friends got hurt, but the opposing party is an older couple. They lawyered up and started taking me to court, but I was a broke college student so I had an assigned public defender.

long story short, I ended up with a felony, went to jail, over 100k from insurance. They kept coming back and even tried to get me to pay for the guy's scrotum surgery over a year later which was unrelated. Guy came back saying that he had to retire early and asked for lost wages. lady said that her hand was sprained and wanted lost revenue from her jewelry making hobby. I lost one of my internship at that time and owed even more money.

1 1/2 years later, I ended up with a career and my HR team forwarded me an email of these couple asking for my salary which my HR team did not give them.

4 years later, I'm finally out of debt. I filed for expungement and a month later I'm being contacted by one of their friend about the case, a famous racist slumlord in the city (with multiple articles about him online). He started calling me, texting me, started contacting my old boss, my old workplace. I feel unsafe and feel like they're going to try to pursue more actions. I don't have the money to go through this again. I just got out of debt.

I had to make all of my social media private because they tried to add me on Facebook. Started looking for me on Linkedin. Is there anything I can do? I realize it would have been ideal to record all of these conversation. My old HR said they have recorded convo and I have a picture of their caller ID. Just nothing prior

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: A few more entry I just noticed on the case. There's a  

* Memorandum of Costs After Judgment, Acknowledgment of
* Writ of Execution Issued
* Application and Order for Examination
* Order of Examination

Going into the internship I wanted to come out being able to say I'm a better software engineer compared to when I started. I noticed that for the most part I got better at reading documentation and solving things by myself (looking online,trying by myself until I'm sure I can't figure something out before I ask a better/higher-up engineer for help) , asking better questions and got better at working in teams to reach a common goal. One ""weakness"" I suppose is when I spend too long on trying to solve something and end up wasting hours (which gets me stuck in a loop) rather than asking for help.

I could ask the scrum master for an evaluation of my performance but I don't know if that's a good idea (since he keeps track of how I'm progressing on my tasks/ meeting deadlines rather than my software dev. ability if that makes sense?)  I'm striving for a big 4 position so I want to be able to assess myself and find my own strengths (to highlight them when interviewing or talking to other engineers and weaknesses (so that I can improve on them).  How do you guys assess yourself to see how much you've improved as a software engineer( or similar positions)? Do you look at how fast you get tasks done? do you get better at introducing others to codebases, do you get better at explaining technical things? There probably isn't one answer but I want to see what everyone else does . Ultimately I want to be able to assess myself and find out whether i'm improving or not once I graduate in the Fall and once I start my first FT position."

**NeoNERV Agent : May Stevens (Entry 2)**

My name is May Stevens and I'm a physicist currently employed at NeoNERV Research &amp; Solutions Inc. Or rather, we were NeoNERV until the government found us useful and stifled our company name secretively. NeoNERV stands for New ""Natural Energy Resources and Variances"", not to be confused with NERV who focuses on national security and defense against foreign invaders. Our main focus is particle acceleration and energy production through applied physics. One of our head physicists, Dr. Aaron Lefeldt, championed this new, hot government contract and had no time to check with the daily functions of home base. Recently, I was weeded out of from that government project as half of our staff were diverted to their prototype development. I was a little relieved to not be selected after an awkward, cathartic,  and misplaced tryst with a fellow cynical scientist from Central Point Inc. At least I didn't have to bare the shame of seeing him and his wife every day at  that nightmare of a facility.

About fifty kilometers away from our lab, our own NeoNERV employees labored at covert Central Point Inc. to achieve applicable particle acceleration through small scale teleportation. My friends were never able to disclose any details further than that and I was always curious about it. The remaining team always felt the quakes and turbulence and noise; we experienced blackouts as the conglomerate seeded massive amounts of energy. One particular shock wave triggered an anomaly that I have a hard time processing and explaining.

The experiments and programs here that were in development were all at a standstill. The funding was siphoned to Central Point Inc. and impeded our own research and development. My research into solar energy and batteries was interrupted and I lost the will to finish it without supporting the funds and resources. I decided at this point to revisit the older ideas that attracted me to this field in the first place. I studied string theory and began to unravel.

Whenever I meet new people, they are initially very interested and impressed about my career choices. They are genuinely stunned at the awe inspiring mystery that makes up our universe.  As the conversation progresses, their eyes glaze over slowly as they realize how much mathematics, meticulous measurement, and analysis is involved to become such an anal retentive person. They wonder why I'm not wearing a crisp white lab coat. They are thrown off by the grueling hours, rejected theories, failed experiments, and constant tinkering involved. It is my obsessive nature that propelled me further down the rabbit hole and into horrifying depths.

The principle of string theory attempts to merge the theory of general relativity (large objects) and quantum mechanics (very small objects) into a single unified field theory. The goal was to have a centralized and universally acceptable theory of everything to explain the many different interesting events of the universe. Receiving media attention in the 1980’s, it was heavily publicized and all the rave at the time.

The general relativity theory expressed the nature of how large celestial objects like planets and stars bend the fabric of space and time around them and attract other objects via gravity through their impressive mass. On the other end of the spectrum, quantum mechanics dealt with tiny atoms and subatomic particles and their various behaviors that ranged from useful, inexplicable, interesting, and volatile. These small base units had very little mass or no mass (such as with photons) and were not affected by the mechanics of general relativity such as gravity.

This stumped researchers until it was suggested that the smallest particulates that make up subatomic particles could have been vibrating strings rather than fixed points. The strings were suggested to vibrate at unique frequencies to alter the behavior of their consequent atoms. These different frequencies were theorized to add mass and charges to atoms. The mathematics were impressive and it was a poetic and nice notion; yet it had some major flaws that impeded it from fruition. String theory could only exist in a minimum of ten dimensions - which was difficult to merge within our own universe.

Other concepts such as dark energy, the expanding “vacuum” of space, and the discovery of a mass granting particle refuted the initial claims of string theory as a universal truth. Although it failed to become the theory of everything, it provided a framework for calculating equations and encouraged even more interesting discussions, succeeding theories, and critical experiments.

I wanted to find something to distract myself since the lab had been deserted and too quiet - missing more than half the staff and the strong community that pursued fresh ideas. I dug up old research in our dusty records department and promptly got to work. This initial framework and innocent inquiry became a deceiving and intricate web that I got lost in.

It all started rather mundanely as I perused the multitude of formulas of our large server. It started with string theory at first, but I bounced around different formulas and topics like a game of pinball. I started to spend more and more time at the lab as I finally found motivation. However, one striking and unique night launched me into another realm in the same physical space.

As usual, I tinkered in the lab and was inputting formulas into different programs. The ground started to quake in a minuscule earthquake as the lights flickered. I rolled my eyes as I thought of the grand old time my colleagues were having at Center Point Inc. and waited for it to pass. The moments dragged on and the effects of their experimentation only grew in power and volume. I frowned and paced over to the window. The glass vibrated as the shock wave exponentially increased its influence.The lights flickered again then completely went out just as I got to the widow and I gasped out loud as I was the only one left in the middle of the night.

In the distance, I could see an electrical storm churning in the direction of Central Point Inc labs. “What the hell…? What the hell is that?” I said out loud to nobody in particular. There were immense lighting strikes and deafening thunder claps that echoed throughout the city. The darkening grey clouds churned in a fatal dance around that specific location.

They expanded and contracted like a pulsing and erratic murky grey heart. Cumulonimbus and stratus clouds oppressed the sky and blotted out the city skyline in a menacing shroud. It was like a flashing tornado that grew in power with each moment. The lightning forked and connected within the dark clouds like a fatal web of hysteria. I could hear car alarms activating below and the wail of ambulance sirens. Some of the blocks below lost power as citizens looked towards the sky in confusion.

The city completely woke up in the dead of night to witness this climatic phenomenon. It definitely wasn’t just the weather...

Where did this stem from? What were they doing over there?! My mind raced with possible causes as I looked to logic for comfort but came up empty. The floor below me seized even more violently and disturbed my balance as the storm progressed. A loud boom reverberated in the sky as storm sirens wailed in the distance in warning.

I saw a bright light flash in the distance as a billowy wave of heat, static, and discomfort hit me. The lights and sounds all blurred together as I heard the glass shatter and I felt something completely foreign and powerful come over me. It was like I had warped through space and time and then reincarnated back into the physical world whilst occupying the same location.

I didn’t know if I hit my head or passed out and dreamed, but what I experienced was completely disorienting and almost inexplicable. I can’t express in words of what I witnessed, but I will try my best to recount it. The deafening noise and blinding light first rendered me blind, deaf, and I could only feel tiny static shocks strike my body as well as strong gusts of wind. My vision returned and it was as if I traveled somewhere completely different, yet remained in the same space.

My hearing slowly came back and I was floating through space as I heard a constant hum. It was as if I experienced perfect senses for the first time. As if I had cataracts all my life and only experienced the world through a murky filter. When I waved my arm, I saw it phase through the table. I tried to reach for a marker at the opposite end of the room. My arm stretched only slightly as it traversed some kind of shortcut before reaching the marker.

I saw the air itself contort and change, even though it was invisible to the naked eye. The objects and structures in front of me contorted and warped into themselves, yet I could still feel them as a solid structure in front of me. In the colorful mess of reality, I felt like I was being watched by something closely. I wasn't alone in this realm. What the hell was that? I felt on edge as the world around me spun out of control.

The transitions were giving me vertigo as more changes evolved into a kaleidoscope of trippy experience. I was able to see through everything! I looked through desks and was able to see its contents. The walls were no longer a barrier to the outside world. I was able to see the skyline and infrastructure below. The scene before me was overwhelming as the lights and sounds stretched and snapped back like a rubber band.

Everything churned together alarmingly fast like reality had been put through a blender. The sounds were so uncomfortable as one noise tried to overpower the other. It all mixed together into a deafening tinnitus. I forced my eyes to close as I felt vertigo, confusion, and paranoia wrack my body. It was as if another world collapsed onto ours and the physics of both realms  were battling it out in front of me.

I woke up to penetrating sunlight stabbing at the seams of my eyelids. I must have been on the floor for hours if it was already dawn. I immediately stood up to look out the window. The visage before me was innocent enough with no evidence of what transpired last night. This was strange, but I know what I saw was real because of the broken glass I had to clean up.

I asked my fellow scientists if they experienced anything weird last night, but they all claimed they hadn’t. I kept wondering what happened at that lab. I immediately called up some of my colleagues that were stationed at Center Point Inc. to inquire. However, most of them didn’t answer or said they were not allowed to disclose anything that would pose a risk to security or their patents. I had driven home lost in thought and completely worn out from that strange and overwhelming storm and anomaly.

I woke up with so much energy the next morning and looked forward to work. I had returned to the NeoNERV lab with purpose and a plan. I wanted to explore this harrowing event and learn all that I could. Attempting to coerce my friends into breaking their contracts was a bust, and I felt like the government wouldn’t take kindly if I sought out hackers to infiltrate their data stores. I needed to figure out what I experienced on my own and was desperate to recreate it.

My office started to look like a tornado tore through it as I amassed different books, research studies, catalogued information, and had an ungodly amount of tabs open on my desktop. I absorbed everything I could get my hands on. I was particularly interested in learning more about higher level dimensions. That was the only logical concept my mind gravitated towards. I still felt the looming presence of something invisible and otherworldly always there, always watching me.

I spent hours cultivating a messy, eccentric,  and restless environment that reflected my inner obsession with finding answers. My coworkers were stunned and offered assistance, but I knew that this was up to me to figure out. Eventually, all the formulas, theories, and ideas started to blur together as I lost my train of thought and became stuck and confused.

I couldn't think straight - it was all too overwhelming. I wanted to experience that same phenomenon but I had no means of accomplishing it. One of our interns, Mark Wells, was agape and offered to assist me as I spun out of control. He regularly combed through my mess and reorganized my research in a more coherent way.

Even with his help, I was still blending formulas together. I was surprised and shocked when I started to notice these equations appear on something other than paper. I was in my office one day and saw the string theory equation appeared on a dosimeter. I was shocked as I saw it clearly where the radiation reading was supposed to appear. What the hell… ?

I looked at it for hours. I needed to know more. I dismantled the dosimeter to look at the individual parts. I kept opening it up and tearing pieces out as I searched for meaning. I was disappointed when I had the very tiniest bits gutted in front of me before me and didn't uncover anything that would solve me problem. I was upset, but the same vision of formulas, numbers, and theories started to appear everywhere, on every surface.

""What are you doing…?"" Mark inquired as he passed my office. I was just about to take apart my printer when he interrupted. I paused and finally noticed the carcasses of gutted electronics around me. ""Ok, look at the touch screen on this printer."" I told him as I pointed to the little display screen. ""It says *E=mc\^2* instead of the print options."" I announced to him with excitement. He peered over at it. ""Uuhhh no it doesn't."" He shook his head.

What the hell? I looked again, and it was clear as day! How could he miss it? ""You should get some rest, you've been pulling double shifts all the time recently and sleeping in your office. You should go home, the work will always be here."" He advised. I wish I had listened to him. I cleaned my office sheepishly as I realized I probably looked like an obsessive compulsive nut. I rested at home but still experiences the same weird visions.

Yet, I could see this mix of numbers and letters and symbols everywhere I went. It haunted me no matter where I went and I still felt a lingering presence of some sort. ""Hey Mark, do you believe that something can be alive and survive in a higher dimension without us seeing it…? I asked him. I was curious and starting to get restless at this point.

""Oh, of course! If it exists, then yes. We just can't see it, only experience its sphere of influence around it. Just like with subatomic particles, we can't actually see them because the energy from our tools would alter it. But, we can measure what happens around it."" He chimed in with knowledge. ""I wonder if the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle would translate the same and could be used when dealing with these other dimensional beings…."" He trailed off.

""The beings in a hypothetical flat 2D world can't see us, but are aware we exist because we can exert influence over their world. I suppose something in the 4th dimension could be in the same situation. It could observe us undetected and exert influence over us."" He mused.

Well, that didn't make me feel any better. I felt so disturbed and on edge as I felt the presence and continued seeing the odd formulas where they shouldn't appear. The formulas appear and vanish and return again. One day, I noticed an equation appear on my hand! I was so concerned, but I couldn't feel it on my skin and it didn't hurt.

I touched it and marveled at my sporadic spectral tattoo. I saw a little piece of hangnail jut from finger. I wonder...I pulled at it and felt instant pain. I shook my head as my incessant picking caused a little stream of blood. I adhered a band aid to it and mentally slapped myself. I needed to get a grip. The tattoos continued to periodically appear and I began to see them on others.

I delved further and further until I was too deep to resurface. I was so distracted and almost mindlessly kept taking things apart. I didn't realize I was doing it until I someone would intervene  and inform me. I received a lot of nervous looks from my coworkers and felt kind of embarrassed and self conscious. But I had to continue this; I had to know what I experienced. I took a leave of absence and hauled my computer and literature home with me so I could work without criticism.

I was even more restless in my own personal space. Without having to keep up appearances in civilized society, I fell further into disarray. My entire apartment was a flurry of papers, books, office supplies, measurement tools, torn gadgets, and crumpled up or ripped ideas. I spent hours and hours on my research. My neighbors complained about the constant pacing of my restless footsteps.

Any time I found a lead and a random equation appeared, I would work diligently to merge them together. When the calculations failed on paper, I took apart whatever the formula was written on. Then suddenly, brand new formulas appeared! They didn't match up to anything similar in established physics. They were so beautiful and encompassing as they drew me in and captured all my attention. They appeared everywhere and the presence of an unknown entity was even more powerful. It was like I was in a trance, I had to know.

I was harshly impeded in my studies as I accidentally wrecked my car. I was surprised to see formulas appear on street signs, traffic directions, and billboards. I sped like a madwoman trying to get to the next sign and see the other part of the formula. I drove erratically for hours before my exhaustion and eccentric driving  caused a victimless wreck. Thankfully, I only ran into a concrete median on the freeway and was immediately rendered unconscious.

I woke up in a local hospital and found I was admitted for exhaustion, dehydration, and malnutrition. I didn't even realize how much weight I had lost or how disheveled I looked. I was shocked at my appearance, but even more fidgety because I lacked the resources for my research.

I was admonished for dismantling medical equipment, trying to tear apart the unit, and causing disturbances. The formulas and knowledge were everywhere! It escalated when I snuck into the burn unit and tried to unwrap the many bandages of the patients there in order to find the secret formulas underneath. They restrained me after that and I signed out against medical advice shortly after.

I was ecstatic to return home and resume my important tasks. I started to rip wallpaper off the walls, dismantle appliances and furniture, and loosen the floorboards as new equations formed underneath. I was so thrilled as I documented and analyzed all this new data! It was as if there were many layers and I wanted to know more! Each layer unearthed new equations and added to my data collection. I finally took notice of what was apparently following me…

I opened the panel to explore the fuse box one day when I noticed it. I saw a red specter in the distance absently and I was completely shocked! It was gaunt and bent at an angle, menacingly crooked. It only started with a blank expression, like it was surprised that I took notice and was able to see it.

What the hell was that?! Was I hallucinating from the lack of sleep? I was terrified, I but even more manically curious. I started to approach it to ask my important physiological questions, but it retreated from sight. I explored my apartment, but would only notice it at certain times. As if it phased in and out of reality. It would periodically appear and then vanish as I pursued it.

I was so close, I could feel it. I wanted to merge all the different established theories with these new beautiful ones that revealed themselves to me. I wanted to create a theory of everything. I needed to know the secrets of the universe and how everything worked. I had been up for days at this point and deserved to know everything! The red specter was silent witness to my insanity and undoing. It didn't seem to want to hurt me or allow me to approach it or study it. If it was not going to contribute to research, then I would banish it to the background and ignore it. I needed to focus without distractions.

The red specter would visit me and almost encourage me to uncover the truth. I deserved

to know after my thankless efforts, declining health, countless hours, and intense focus! I was compulsively pacing and so uncomfortable with myself. It pained physically me not to know. I hated feeling like a complete failure. I absolutely had to find the missing links and connect everything!

It was getting more difficult to work as the power was cut and electricity restricted. I felt disconnected with the lack of internet and technology, but I continued to manually calculate and write on every single scrap of paper. I must have sacrificed hundreds of trees with the tsunami of paper flooding my home. I started writing on the walls after I ran out of paper. Numbers, symbols, letters and glyphs were scribbled all over the walls like some crazy and meticulous graffiti.

The landlord interrupted my important efforts when he loudly banged on the door demanding payment like some ogre. How rude. I largely ignored the outside world as I got lost in the wonderland of stunning and complex physics theories. My neurosis wreaked havoc on my mind and body. I was so exhausted and could barely read and write anymore, but I persisted.

I went to the bathroom sink to wash my face and wake myself up with cold water. However, the red specter halted my progress and stared back with confusion. I gasped as I realized the thinning red specter was myself in the mirror. I was looking at myself in reflective surfaces. What the hell happened to me?! I was so logical and sound of mind before I pursued this!

I supposed I lacked self control when I noticed the equations appear on my body. I was manic and needed to know what lay underneath. I didn't restrain myself, but kept peeling. I looked at my reflection in horror as I saw that I didn't have any skin left. The pain from the lack of epiphany was actually the agony of my bleeding red muscles and fragile exposed nerve endings.

I realized that I studied string theory and began to mentally and physically unravel. I just had to discover more information as I pulled apart items and pulled the threads of my own flesh. I compulsively strived to find meaning and the reasons of how the universe functions. I searched too hard and followed the trail until I got lost in madness.

I screamed in a panicked screeching symphony as I realized what I've done to myself. I was overwhelmed and confused and in denial. I screamed and raged until I noticed something that silenced my screams and sent waves of anxious fear throughout my soul.

I still felt the powerful presence of someone or something I couldn't see. It was definitely right there with me, oppressing the air and my logic. A shiver ran down my spine as I remembered the intern mentioning that entities from other dimensions are unseen but could still exert their will over our realm...

My situation is kind of weird in terms of my high school. I'm a rising senior that is on track to receive an associate's degree upon graduating (my hs does not offer AP or IB, just this DE program). As you could imagine I've taking a boatload of DE courses and will be taking many more my senior year. I'm taking up to Calculus 3 along with other math heavy courses such as Discrete Structures and possibly Statistics.

I'm interested in computer science with likely a specialty in data science. I've been looking into colleges for a little while now, but I've never really asked anyone about how I stack up in terms of colleges I'm looking into.

Stats and EC's:

1290 SAT

3.9 uw gpa

EC's: part-time job (idk if that even matters tbh), leadership position in nhs and sca,  volunteer at comp sci camp, and comp sci internships.

I'm looking into applying to mainly in-state schools in Virginia (uva, vt, vcu, maybe w&amp;m), but also a few out of state (unc-ch, nc state). I'll also likely apply to one more safety school in VA just in case. The way I see it right now, UVA, UNC and maybe W&amp;M will be my reach schools. With NC State and VT being my 50-50 schools. VCU and one other safety school would round it out. 

So my questions are...

Where do I stack up with these stats and EC's? Is my current view on my choice of schools accurate?

What other schools should I consider applying to? What schools should I not consider applying to that are on this list (if any)?

I know you guys get these kinds of threads a lot, but I'd appreciate any feedback if possible. My college counselor at my school kinda quit her job so I'm not sure where else I could ask these types of questions.

Thanks."

My question is, when do companies usually start getting back to you with coding challenges, phone interviews, etc, once you apply? I understand it definitely varies based on the company, but I’m confused on the timeline of how the general application and interview process works. Some friends say it’ll take until November, others say it can be immediate(?)

Is the truth that my algorithms don't actually have to be that elegant? If they work and decent-ish efficiency speed, is that really enough?

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been hired in this very small company (CEO and two more employers except me, one of them is an intern as well) for a Summer Internship in PR.  I was excited, as the CEO told me during the interview that the company has signed a contract with a big worldwide group, that could help make it successful and well-known. 

On my first day of work, I came in and there was no briefing, no introduction to the other two colleagues, nor a tour around the office (which turned out to be a space shared by other offices and we only had one tiny room for all four of us). Later I found out that there is no PR person in the company, and that we had a third-party PR agency. My only job to do with PR is to go there every week and bring them more and more stuff, without even talking to them. Everything else is more like a personal assistant job. 

The CEO *'runs*' two companies at the same time (with the same employees) and neither of them are successful and don't even break even. All of the things that are produced and copies of other brand's designs, and I know that because I was made me do research of what those brands made throughout years and put the pictures on a document. The work computer has files of their designs labelled as ""(insert brand name) design"" sent to the designer and the factory. The materials the items are made out of are horrible and cheap, however the set retail price is over $1300 per item. Some of the garments can be even found on Chinese websites selling them for $100, with the exact images as our official images. 

My main issue with this job is that the boss is completely clueless. She doesn't know a thing about business, marketing, or anything on that matter. As an example, she was shocked when I told her that hashtags on Instagram attract followers aka potential customers (in 2019!!!) or that buying random followers (mainly male demographic from Turkey, Jordan etc.) will not get her brand's online presence far. It would all be fine if she spoke English more or less well, but on a scale from 1 to 10, her English level is a 4 maximum. Let alone that, she doesn't know any of the business/marketing term words (neither in her language, nor in English) and explaining everything like to a 5 year old makes everything much harder. 

Most of the time I am all alone in the office, as the other two employees are out trying to find potential stockists. If I'm not alone, the CEO is here giving me tasks that don't fit my role (sort out all of her invoices throughout the company's existence) or talking to her friends on speaker so loudly, my head hurts. On top of that, no one except the CEO is sure that there is a deal with that big worldwide company mentioned before. The reason for that is that the CEO always lies about everything and tries to make themselves sound better than they are (where they live, *which turned out to be not true when I sorted her invoices*, lying about being married even though all the documents say otherwise, *again, the invoices*, oversharing how many expensive bags they have, etc.) 

I don't know what to do now. I have worked here for a month and have another month ahead of me, but I am so tired and sick of everything about the job and the CEO. I am not a quitter and wanted to stick through the end, but all my family and friends tall me that I should quit as it is not teaching me anything and is unhealthy. I'm scared that it will damage my further career, but at the same time I know that a company that is based on lying and stealing other's designs/ideas is not a fit for me. 

 What do you think? Should I stick around or pack my bags and run?"

I have been working at a \~65 person HVAC company for 2 months now and my 3 month review is next month. This position started as more of an internship and at $10/hr (what I'm currently making). The previous IT person who trained me has now left and I have taken on all day to day IT management for the company. My department is combined marketing and IT, and though I am not the department head, I am the only actual IT person. 

There is 100% going to be a raise at my 3 month review, and at first I was gonna ask for somewhere around $13/hour, however after the other person left, me taking on more responsibility and researching online, I keep changing the amount I'm gonna ask for.

**The job duties include:**

We have \~30 people in office, and around 30-35 support techs who work in the field and hardly visit the office.

Desktop Support - Web Services Administration - VoIP phone support - Network support - iOS device management - and many more day to day random IT tasks.

My official title is ""I.T. Administrator""

**My experience:**

I graduated high school 2 months ago and I'm 19 years old. 

Spent 9 months doing basic desktop and classroom support at my high school (not paid or an official job, it was all volenteer)

Spent 3 months working for my school districts actual IT department doing various computer setup and maintenance tasks as a summer job.

I spent 2 years at vocational school for computer programming/ software where I also got college credit and a Microsoft MTA certification.

**-----**

With all of this in mind, I am thinking of asking for around $20 an hour, and hoping to end with about $17 an hour.

Any feedback you people have is greatly appreciated!"

cjs7cu,1,2019-07-30,Ask for my job back? Or bad idea?,kelseaxo,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cjs7cu/ask_for_my_job_back_or_bad_idea/,"So, this probably could get a little lengthy.

So a few years back, I started a position at a Speciality doctor’s office while in nursing school. I was working there part time, doing administrative type of work (front desk) Checking in patients, collecting co pays, for only about 25-30 hours a week. Nothin’ crazy. 

Fast forward about three months- one of the Medical Assistants there went out on maternity leave. The office I was at had a lot of the employees “float” to all the different offices throughout the region. And one day, a physician asked if I wanted to assist in his clinic for the day (answer phone calls, schedule outpatient procedures, check out patients after consults) I was all over it! That one day turning into a month, than a year, than I had officially ranked up enough hours for my internship through him to receive my Medical Assistant Certification. I loved it! J loved it so much, I decided to put nursing school on the back burner and work full time as his MA. I was learning SO much and was getting hands on experience that I just couldn’t pass up, and I genuinely loved my job. 

So... then, me being in that position for about a year, ( also the doctor I was working for the President of the company, he is the busiest, with the most patients, and by no means was my job slack to put it that way ) Anyway, I then find out that they had hired a new Clinical Operations Manager, aka: I had a new boss. Everything seemed great at the beginning, she always care to me if she was unsure of something, was always asking for my advice, she was just going the extra mile so it seemed. Then, I went on vacation for a week with my family (this was requested off literally a year prior so it wasn’t like a spur of the moment thing) I come back ready to work, and I see a note on my desk, stating to come and talk to “my new boss” I didn’t think anything of it, I walked up to her office, sat down, and she said that I was getting written up for having “unsent mail” in my desk while I was gone. 
Uhhhhhhh...
What??????????? 

For one: Why in the world was this woman going through my desk? I mean there’s just absolutely no reason for that. I can’t think of one at least. That’s for sure. 
And for two, which I argued this point, that there was no patient name on the envelope, (I could understand a HIPAA violation or something, but no, didn’t do that. I explained to her that these patients actually came into the office and I gave them their instructions in person rather than mailing because they were nervous for their upcoming procedure and wanted to make sure they understand things clearly. 

Nope. She still made me sign that piece of paper. I got written up. I was honestly devastated. I had no other issues what so ever at this job, and I was just so confused. 

The following week, I get called up to the office again, she states that I sent something in the computer wrong, (I cant really get into details details) but, the moral of the story was; the rule was the entire time that I had been employed there that it was our responsibility to do this task, but apparently this was suddenly changed and NO ONE was aware of it, because as soon as I left her office, I asked a colleague if she was aware in normal conversation. And she said no. Well, she wrote me up for this too!!!! I was like what is happening. 

Two weeks later, I am rushing out the door for work to take my new puppy to day care while I’m at work, he runs off, and he gets hit by a car... thankfully he did not pass away but he did have to have surgery. I called my job right away and told them what happened. They said “ok. So are you going to come in today?” I was like.... uh.... I mean I didn’t plan on it, I am at the vet, my dog literally just got ran over my a car. “ and she was like “ ok well just I guess let me know how everything goes” and I said ok. Well we were at the vet all day and night that night, and I didn’t even think of calling her again throughout the day. I managed to pull myself together and go to work the next day, and everything seemed... fine. 

The next day, I go into work, I walk in, and have my boss, and my former boss I guess you could say. (The new one pretty much took the others jobs, but said they were “splitting the duties” idk, they never got along it seemed like to me) I was like Hello! How are you guys? And they both kind of looked at each other, and said we need to speak with you, I was like... okay.... 

I walk into my doctors exam room, and they both sit down, and say, “ I’m sorry but we are going to have to let you go” 


I sat there in literally pure freaking shock. I truly did not believe that this was happening. I looked at them both and was just like what? How? Why? My old boss just kind of tucked her head down and looked at my new boss. My new boss stated: “ you have had 3 write ups and it is company policy to terminate you. “ I said wait what 3?? When was the 3rd? She then proceeds to say that, I never let her know if I was coming into work the day the my dog got into his accident. 

When she said that, I was furious. I could not believe that they were writing me up for something so out of my control, it all seemed so unfair. I literally ran out of the office in complete tears and was majorly depressed over this for months and months. 

Fast forward a year later- I went back to school in the mean time, and have been just serving/bartending on the side. I came to find out yesterday that, my “new boss” no longer works for the company I had worked for anymore, and had went back to her old job. I was SHOCKED. This lady seemed to live breathe and die this company so I truly couldn’t believe it. Than, I got to thinking- 

Maybe I should ask for my job back? 
I mean the worst they could say is no? 
My ONLY problems in the work place unfortunately revolved around that woman. If she is no longer there than, maybe I can get a second chance? Do you think I should send an email to my “old boss” that is still working for the company, and explain that with her being gone (she saw what she did to me first hand) I think that I could really thrive and make the company a better place. My job was extremely fulfilling for me and I just haven’t been the same without it... 

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated"

* Addressing level 1 IT tickets
* macOS troubleshooting for system issues
* Hardware configuration and installation

I'm interested in finding out about jobs in the city. I don't know much about what these companies do or what roles they offer.

For example, Goldman Sachs are a huge firm and I don't know what they do. I've read their website and it's a bit vague for me. Similar with other companies. Maybe you need to be from an education or social background that gives you some understanding but I don't have that.

I have an advanced maths degree (PhD) but as I get older I am realising I'm less interested in doing maths calculations and more interested in people facing roles.

Where can I go in London to ask for more information about them and discuss what they (or other companies) can offer me and what I can offer them?

I'm in my early thirties so don't want to do an internship with 22 year olds. Do they offer opportunities for older people?

I graduated last Spring and managed to land an internship at a startup in the Fall. Since then I’ve become an “official” part of the team, although for all intents and purposes, I’m basically a volunteer as the hours are not regular and the company doesn’t have the funding to pay us hourly. Obviously, this isn’t really ideal for me, but as it has been my first break into the industry I want to be in and a great source of experience besides, I’m continuing to stay there until I can find a similar position. 

So the problem I have is this. I’m currently applying to entry level jobs and internships, but because my title at my current company is “editorial director,” I’m worried my motivations for applying to low level positions might be called into question. Worse, people might think I’m lying about my current position. How can I explain my situation to potential employers in way that won’t make me look bad?"

This was for an internship in the Silicon valley area. Apparently the recruiters had to take an emergency holiday and the HR mailed me asking whether if she can talk to me in a few minutes to which I responded yes. This was late night from me around 9:30-ish since I am in the east coast but the call was from the west coast.

I got a call from the HR late within a few minutes, she told me she got a positive response from the engineers and they would be extending me an offer. At this point, I was ecstatic, but the call quickly turned into a small interview where I was asked my salary expectation and I kind low-balled it. I had previously searched the net for a salary expectation for the company, but the data was old. I had networked with one of the engineers in the company as he is a friend of one of my cousins. Today, that person shared me his intern salary and the rate I gave them as my quota was about $5-$4 low per hour when compared to what he earned 2 years ago. I gave an answer out of the blue because it was late night and I wasn't honestly prepared at that point for that question.

I wanted to know how to handle this. The engineer I networked with asked me to negotiate when I receive the offer letter. If so, how should I go about negotiating? Will this be considered as a negative remark towards me? Any advice would be welcome.

At first they didnt really have any work for me to do but eventually found me a project in which I need to make a website for a internal client. I got told to use the tech stack that they normally use (ASP Net Core MVC) which is ok and got to learning it. Bu they can't take away any resources from any other projects, which means I have to work by myself and can't really get any support for my project. I can ask the occasional question but the only team nearby working on web apps work on legacy content. 

The website I am making is essentially some CRUD pages with a bunch of tables to display different models but it does also have a few more complicated features. I started by handwriting all the tables and adding paging, sorting etc. But this got tedious quickly so I thought I would try and write a generic taghelper which would handle most of the work for me however this has got very complicated very quickly and to be done well it is probably beyond my current capability. 

I started looking for a library and found one called ""DataTables"" which provided all of what I needed and more. However after speaking to my boss he said I couldn't use any libraries as they needed to be approved and when I tried to get it approved no one could be bothered to read the licence.

To make matters worse, other people are going to take over the project once I have left and I like to try and take some pride in my work so I want my code to be decent however I feel like my current table solution is just a mess and am really struggling to refactor it. The work has really started to stress me out and I feel like I have to continue with it when I get home so have no free time.

Is it normal for companies to be like this and do you think I should try and convince them to let me use a library? 

TLDR; Given project to do solo. Some of it is beyond my means and not allowed to use libraries. The work is stressing me out."

Anything else to know about you:


I'm pretty worried about not getting into the Questbridge college match as a finalist, so if you don't think I'll get into that then let me know and just chance me for MIT early action and the rest of those schools regular action.


Also this post isn't meant to be a flex or anything else, it just helps to relieve anxiety as I'll probably be anxious until December at the earliest. Fun times!


I also have applied to WISE(MIT fly in program) and plan to apply to the Columbia, JHU, and CMU fly in programs. On the fence on applying to JHU and CMU.

I am taking some prereqs classes at my local community college so i can start taking the actual IT classes in the fall. 

I also have a plan to get an internship hopefully next summer so I can work with some IT people and actually do hands-on work in the field. 

But i was talking with my parents and my father said i should have a plan on what I should be doing so I can make myself useful to companies since competition is high in this field saying I need to differentiate myself from others. 

He was saying I should have a plan to get certs either during my breaks (winter and summer) or during the semester. And i should know exactly what i should be doing so its not like i get to a job and find out its bot what i wanna do etc

- What types of things could I do to use my time as much as possible and as efficiently as possible? 

- How long does it take to study and get certs? I have a month off for winter break, I could grind out a whole month to get a cert or two but Im not sure how much just one typically takes. 

- For example a CCNA cert or comptia cert, would it be possible to get a cert in just a month of studying like over my break in January?  If so, i may start looking into that as soon as my semester is over. 

- Are coding languages useful in IT (like C++ or Java etc) or should I focus more on PowerShell? I see a lot of people over at r/sysadmin say powershell is very important for automation scripting. And one of my It classes is Java anyway"

I am a full-time student. I do not currently live at home (although my permanent address is still there). My parents live in North Carolina and I live in Tennessee (internship). My question is this: would changing my permanent address to a TN address mess with their ability to claim me as a dependent? They are helping me though school so they do qualify as supporting me.

Moving addresses makes sense because it's looking like TN is where I am going to end up for at least the next 5-10 years. My drivers' license expires soon so I either need to make the trip back to NC or simply establish residency at a friend's house. Also, would there be a reason not to make my permanent address at my friend's home where I live/pay rent?

To sum up: I am looking at changing my address but am unsure of tax/license/legal repercussions.

In my case, however, I'm actually drowning in work. I'm the only co-op student in the company and everyone gives me work to do from their projects. Some are menial tasks and some are really important stuff. 

The main challenge I have is that everyone wants the task they give me to be done at the same time and it gets overwhelming.

I don't want to work overtime because I have things to do after work plus I get really tired after a long day, so staying after work hours won't be productive.

Also, I have a hard time declining tasks they give me 'cos I don't want to be seen as lazy. But in reality, it's just impossible to do it all.

That automation tool was outdated and a pain to work with and asking for help did literally nothing, I finished it on my own time.

Now, I have to work on integrating my code into some other tool that no one actually knows how to use. When I asked for the person that works with this tool to help me, I asked a couple questions of why something was where it was and what I should replace it with and they didn't know. 

After that I was just left alone to figure it out. It's so annoying and a lot less actual coding/logic than I thought it'd be."

Fundamentally, I find it much more appealing to do something within 75-80% of my capability so that I can save some time and energy for hobbies as well as be able to actually enjoy the work I'm doing and avoid burning out. 
     
Plenty of my peers seem to stretch themselves so thin (i.e. working towards masters in undergrad while also balancing research and internships) that it doesnt seem they reap as much benefit from their experiences as they could (just barely skimming by).

While I didn't make the initial cut (and the Executive Director thanked me for taking the time to consider applying in e-mail), I suddenly found the position of Program Coordinator at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies.

\----

Duties:

Works closely with the administrative leadership to coordinate the  activities of the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies. Primary  responsibility involves student support services. Plans and organizes  student information, orientation, returnee sessions, and other  student-related gatherings. Coordinates all aspects of application  intake/processing, review, placement/award, budgeting and orientation  for students traveling to Japan for internships, summer school, language  studies, and research. Maintains all student records relating to travel  abroad including release forms/waivers, and assists with record keeping  and analytics. Prepares correspondence relating to student placement  and programming with various units across campus and host organizations.  Produces materials – print, web, social media – to promote student programs in Japan. Position also involves support to designated faculty,  including calendar, correspondence, website, course materials,  committees, publications, travel arrangements, and files. Position also  includes event coordination and communication, including some website  maintenance. Occasional frontline responsibilities. Performs other  duties as required. Occasional overtime required.

**Basic Qualifications**

3+ years of administrative experience. Education may count towards experience.

**Additional Qualifications**

Bachelor's degree with a concentration in East Asian  Studies or Japanese Studies strongly preferred. Excellent  writing/editing skills; communication and organizational skills are essential. Working knowledge of desktop publishing skills and  familiarity with computers and technology preferred. Candidates with cross-cultural experiences and/or experiences working/studying abroad a  plus. Knowledge of Japan and Japanese strongly preferred.

\----

I only have two years of admin experience since I help out with a NGO as a volunteer aside from doing research stuff. Also did a BA in Vancouver, Canada towards Political Science. I can also hit some of the additional qualifications needed.

It's a tempting job ad, but I'm not sure if I can relate to it (I would like to, at some point, do research on East Asia/Japan from an academic/institute perspective someday). I did study upper level courses based on East Asia (One course is modern Japan).

Another question is for example, I have (maybe) minimal desktop publishing skills since I have my own blog to publish my own articles on what's happening in Japan.

Would like some thoughts on whether I should give this a shot."

ck293v,2,2019-07-30,I sent an email to my editor about my ADHD. I’m nervous how he’ll respond but I hope this was the right step.,alinkbetweentimes,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ck293v/i_sent_an_email_to_my_editor_about_my_adhd_im/,"Here’s what I put, censoring parts about where I’m interning and names for privacy:

Hi —-,

I’ve debated on sharing this for a while, but I think it’s come to a point where I need to so we’re on the same page. I came here to grow my writing skills, both in terms of quality and efficiency, and I think it’s safe to say it hasn’t been meeting expectations on either front. I hope none of this comes across as giving excuses or unhelpful whining, as neither is my intent, nor excusable in a professional setting. I simply want to explain where I’m coming from so we can find a solution moving forward.

I have pretty intense ADHD, and while I’ve been fighting pretty hard to try some different medications, I’ve been entirely off meds the duration of this internship.

For this internship, I’ve found that I can write a news story in about the time expected for a relatively inexperienced intern. Once I’ve settled on a topic for a feature, the going can be a little more rough since it’s for a longer duration, but hey, it gets done. Far and away the biggest challenge for me here is pitching.

I can’t fully explain what about it seems to get me so stuck, but coming up with an idea out of what can seem like thin air has had me reach what I can only describe as a “wall,” where somewhere the cogs in my brain snag on something and repeat on a loop. In the past, my way to deal with this has been pure elbow grease, even if it meant taking four hours to send a single email, which has happened.

I no longer have that luxury. Four hours is a lifetime in the field of journalism, and to be honest, that’s terrifying. I’ve been cutting lunch breaks, staying later, cutting hours on my job, drinking more and more coffee, and even spending nights and mornings catching up on work. And I’m still producing an embarrassingly small amount of work to show for it.

You’re not my teacher or counselor. You’re a longtime professional at one of the biggest publications in an extremely competitive industry, and you chose me to fulfill a position many other people would’ve loved to fill, expecting me to write with the quality and efficiency of someone who’s certainly still learning, but nevertheless qualified and hard-working. Without hyperbole or being overly dramatic, I think it’s safe to say I’m blowing it.

I was so happy when I found out I was going to intern at —— ————. I was determined to kick ass at every opportunity I could, to if not impress, at least show my competency and willingness to work to those around me, and make some connections.

I’m proud of a lot of the work I’ve done for —— ————. But in other regards, I’m embarrassed and disappointed in myself.

Now, it’s almost over. I can’t undo those mistakes. I also can’t change the chemistry in my brain, not even with meds until after the internship at least. (And meds aren’t some cure-all anyway)

Here’s what I can do. I can get more sleep so I can focus better. I can prep meals ahead of time so I don’t have to leave to eat. I can brew and drink a consistent but not excessive amount of coffee, setting timers for when it’s time for another cup. Finally, I can stick to the quotas: three pitches per day, no matter what. If that means I need to get some more work done at home, that’s not the end of the world. (It’s okay, I volunteered for this)

This is the real world now. It’s time to find some solution, or it’s time to give up on my dreams of breaking into this industry.

Maybe a time will come when I have to give up, and find something else that fulfills me that I can succeed at. That day isn’t here yet though, and until then, maybe I have a chance to turn this around.

I still have half a month left at —— ————. I intend to do everything within my power to make it a good half-month."

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, the company has been throwing away (setting for recycle) a bunch of equipment that has been under warranty and repairable/replaceable, or simply not properly troubleshooting and testing.

Just in the past month, there have been 3 computers that were 2 years and and 10-11 months into their 3 year warranty that were stripped and tossed, but were barebones anyway, so I was able to rescue them and put them through RMA. SSDs that were tossed but passed all diagnostics, but ""wasn't bootable"". It was formatted in MBR and tested on a UEFI system, so didn't work when they tried to boot off of it. I was able to figure it out and verify it worked properly in minutes.  And in just the past 24 hours, two noise-cancelling headsets that retailed for $250 a piece were thrown away because of microphone issues, but after a firmware update and ACTUAL testing, do not experience the crackling or electronic noises complained about that is typically an issue with Bluetooth being Bluetooth or software.

It's aggravating that the company isn't being wasteful, but a lot of the summer help (college interns) that's supposed to be doing the easy jobs like ""testing returned equipment"" is doing a piss-poor job. I've recovered probably $3000 worth of equipment that wasn't actually bad, just a victim of laziness.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very close to trying to implement something where equipment that gets tossed has to be checked by two people. I mean, some things like ""keyboard key sticks"", no big deal, but I don't know...I can see the argument that it's not worth the cost to go that in depth, but on the other hand, 6 computers, 2 headsets, 2 SSDs...it adds up."

Part 2,smellycaaat,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ck51q2/update_is_it_normal_to_feel_this_way_at_a_job/,"Here is my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ccxiv8/is_it_normal_to_feel_this_way_at_a_job_should_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

From my previous post, I have listed down all the red flags I have first observed at the first month of my job. I mentioned that I had to go for a work trip so I wanted to “wait and see”.

I just came back from the trip and it seems like everything that happened overseas was a nightmare. I got yelled at in the bus, shoved and cried almost everyday in my hotel room. I followed some of the advice to stick it out, maybe I could find some common things I could share with my boss, but alas, I felt like everything’s gone to the opposite direction I’ve hoped.

My relationship with my boss is kind of sour and cold now, and the difference of her treatment is apparent when it comes to my other colleagues. I’ve tried to do my best to make her happy and done my work best as I can, but she likes to nitpick everything I have done and get mad at me frequently. 

Every morning I dread going to work and cry. Sometimes I feel depressed because I can’t do anything right and I question my self-worth over and over. Maybe it’s better if I could just die right then and there. Before this, I’ve always been more confident even in my internships or temporary jobs because of bosses who guide me and supportive colleagues.

I am at my wits end, and I really think I won’t be able to survive through the probation (it’s coming to the end in 1 month plus).

Everyone tells me to leave, but it’s difficult to find another job with the ongoing US-China tensions and being guilt tripped by my parents who felt that they have funded for my degree and that I should suck it up.

tl;dr: I am being mentally and emotionally abused by my superior at work and I am at my wits end. Should I leave now without a job or should I stay and suck it up?"

I got in a good internship with a contract for one year, this is my first career-related job. I got 2 semesters left on school and i'm about to get on the last with lots of courses. The final semester is very relaxed with only 3-4 courses and the rest of the time to invest on your internship.

I used to work before in something that wasn't related at all to engineering. I did 25 hours a week for about 1 year while going to school about 5-6 hours daily. Office was close to school and I left the job 1 hour before school started.

Now I will do 30 hours per week and my job's exit hour is school's first class, I still have to complete 6-7 courses this semester (I can't choose), that translates to like 6 hours a day of school.

I know all the professors already so I could talk to them and ask for help so they let me arrive a little bit late. Also i'm kinda worried about the stress since my last job wasn't related but I used to work unpaid overtime, travel outside the city and work on weekends, at least my internship will not force me to do that things. I did decently while I worked before, my GPA is 3.7 atm.

Any tips? 

Thanks!"

I myself don't even really know what that means but I didn't properly develope them on my own and it bites. I've had anxiety and agoraphobia practically since I was born, and in elementary when all the other kids were socializing and learning what to and not to say and do, I was sitting quietly at my desk wanting nothing more than to go home and lock myself in my room until it was over. I often observed the kids around me but it never really occured to me to learn from what they were doing and in fact I believe my thoughts were along the lines of ""those people are stupid like anything, never do what they're doing."" And it's crossed my mind that since that's how kids started out with each other maybe I should try to act like that, but if I start that at this age people just wouldn't talk to me. I wouldn't talk to me. Talking without thinking about it first just isn't me. I don't like the heightened risk of hurting someones feelings. Hurting other people in turn hurts me. I know how to greet people and ask how their day or life has been. After that I usually fall back on the only thing I know how to do which is talk about my problems because while the other kids were learning to talk to each other, I was learning to talk to a therapist. And not just a single therapist either. They would hand me off to the next intern after my current one finished school. Then I went to a behavioral school where the only time we were really allowed to properly talk was during group when we talked about our problems. You know, long story short, didn't get to learn how to conversate, I would like to learn to conversate, please help me."

The list goes on to top companies that people love to brag about especially with their high starting salary.  To me I don't understand it, maybe its because I'm 25 and just on the cusp of getting my first full-time job and I'm more focused on getting a stable job with amazing benefits rather than higher starting salary.  I also think  I would have a higher chance of moving up in the chain faster since most of the people are starting to retire since  a lot of employees have been with this company for several decades!  Bottom line though I am smart enough to negotiate a reasonable salary, and also know when the offer is low but I think a reasonable start is much better than aiming for a high salary just out the gate.

However, I was able to land a software development internship this summer with a large, established and reputable tech company. I have enjoyed the internship but I am not 100% sure I want to return to this company for full time once I graduate next year.

For the last year, I have a text file where I put couple of ideas per week. Most of the ideas are garbage or too hard to implement, but remaining can be split into 2 groups:

\- Information resources. For example, ""awesome list of awesome lists/arxiv papers on a topic/etc"", sites like [https://modelzoo.co/](https://modelzoo.co/) (list of ML models), [https://github.com/syhw/wer\_are\_we](https://github.com/syhw/wer_are_we), discord groups on specific topic, social network group with specific memes, etc.

\- Web-based service doing one thing. For example, yet another format converter (pdf &lt;-&gt; txt), service for remove/add geo information from photo, service to track some instagram go from private to public (don't stalk your ex, huh), [https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) but for beer bottles.

Why I want to do this things:

\- Monetize through PR. I think a library with 1000 github stars could be attractive to recruiters and increase my market value as an employee. It is something you can mention in your resume.

\- Monetize directly. For example, if I make a service (let's think about yet another format converter) I could earn money with ads.  I don't think it really happens, because it had to get a lot of traffic, it is like 1M traffic for 1k$ on youtube, I think Adsense is comparable. Maybe sell job postings placement or so.

\- Aquire some skills for making a startup. I don't know how to manage budget or manage a remote employee, but I think those skills are useful.

My current situation:

I don't have a lot of work experience, let's say it is &lt;2-3. I'm in machine learning / data science industry. I know python. Don't know any frontend stuff. I don't have leadership experience and don't know how to manage people on remote, but willing to know how. I can invest 500-1000 USD in month and up to 15 hrs per week. For this amount of money I can get 1 page front end on freelance or hire an intern from 2nd world countries to do some manual work like posting/promoting.

The question:

Is it good to invest money/time in such way or is it better to ""leetcode harder"" and go to FAANG for big buck / switch job or work harder for a promotion? What do you think?"
ck9u5r,4,2019-07-31,Did I screw up my internship? In need of advice!,CrazyKass,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ck9u5r/did_i_screw_up_my_internship_in_need_of_advice/,"This spring, a professor I had sent our local radio station an email, setting up an interview with one of the guys on the morning show there for me. The whole thing went well and I ended up getting the internship, even though it was unpaid and an hour away. I enjoyed it at first, another intern and I got along with the crew, especially one of the afternoon hosts who also was the one who would give the references (not to be confused with the guy I initially I interviewed with). 

Well, as time went on this summer, we were asked to do less and less, and the morning show the intern and I had assumed we’d be parting with and helping with practically ignored us until the end, when they had us on air once or twice. I started to check out mentally because I was driving 100 miles and two hours in total three to four times a week to not be paid and just sit around and wait for someone to ask us to do something. I’ve never had an internship so I had no idea what to expect, but not this. I’ve also been working two other jobs along with this just to be able to afford to pay for this internship (I also had to pay for class credit to be able to even work there unpaid). 

Along with all of this, the other intern received way more attention, was told that she was just like the other morning show host, and people around the office treated her great. I started a week after her but never even received a tour of the office. Last week was the other intern’s last day, and on that day we recorded a bit that included us and the morning show (which is very popular). She was focused on the entire time, told again and again that she was like the other host whom everyone loves, and even had her own segment. I felt really ignored and just not up to par. I left that day feeling sad and worthless. So, I did something that wasn’t the best idea. I didn’t come in that Monday or Wednesday when I was supposed to work, and didn’t email them asking if it was alright that I showed up one day that week (Thursday, which is tomorrow) instead of all three. I’ve been under a colossal amount of pressure to make money before my school starts up again and I’ve been extremely stressed over it.  Along with that, my mental health has been super poor and the whole not being appreciated at my internship has just made it worse. 

One of the morning hosts texted me asking “Are you coming in anymore? Just curious.” and now I’m so afraid they all hate me. This internship has been nothing like I expected and I’m so down in the dumps. Any advice on how to resolve it? The guy who does the references doesn’t seem to be too annoyed that I didn’t show, he said just to make sure I come in tomorrow to work on stuff. Should I talk to the other guy that sent the text? Should I tell them I’ve been struggling with my personal life? Should I say that I’ve felt pretty undervalued compared to the other intern? I don’t want to seem like a pansy or a weenie that complains or just a bad intern in general. Help!!"

I am now in the phase where I am applying for jobs. I have a portfolio with several projects, and have worked several internships for experience with no paying job yet.

The question is how should I be spending my free time to ameliorate my skills and make me good enough to get a job?  It seems to me the best learning for web dev you can do is 'on the job'. I think there is only so much you can improve and learn with online resources, which seems better suited for beginners. 

As far as practicing building pages, I feel like I've hit a plateau, and there is only so much I can learn from building another bootstrap landing page. I feel like I've been at it long enough that my skills are decent, and I am racking my brain for things I can do to reach the next level. Especially considering people say you can pick up bootstrap in a weekend. Though I know it is a complex learning curve, with a long road to mastery.

For the direction I prefer to go in, I have two choices. The first, many of my peers have pursued, that is front end development; working with HTML,CSS, and Bootstrap primarily for entry level. Building or altering pages to look like mockups.

The other option, I've had interviews for more heavy programming languages like Angular and PHP. But it seems that these jobs are looking for more experience, as opposed to the front end.

What would your suggestions be for me to concentrate my efforts on. What resources or activities should I be doing to improve?

I'm 21 years old, and a student at a good state school in the Upper Midwest (US). Enabled by several merit scholarships, I've spent most of college throwing caution to the wind and taking whatever classes seemed interesting. I've got an \~3.95 GPA, and am a few years into what has become a triple major: Pure Math, Computer Science, and Statistics. I'm part of an honors college. I'm an undergraduate TA for some calculus classes. I really don't want to sound like a braggadocious ass here, and I fear that I do - the point is, I've done fairly well for myself. I'm not terrible interested in grad school, though; I want to move on with my life.  


The issue is: I have done virtually no planning for after college. I stand to graduate in around 2 years, if nothing changes, and I have no internship experience. At this point, I've came around to the idea of working somewhere in CS, but I have no idea where.  


I much prefer, and frankly perform better in, more abstract fields. My favorite courses have been upper undergrad math. Despite doing well in CS so far, I don't code much. I'm not terribly fluent in any particular language, though I have some experience in a several. That in particular makes me worried. I find that when I do code, I frequently need to look at references to clarify syntax questions.  


Are there any particular specializations one right recommend to someone in my position? How are careers in these hypothetical areas? Salaries? How reasonable is it to stay in the Midwest? I have no desire to move to the Bay Area and live in glorified dorms."

Some info about me:

Recent college graduate. (Graduated May 2019)

Held an internship position with a fortune 500 company from Jan 2018 - Dec 2018, where I essentially taught myself full stack web development (HTML, CSS (bootstrap is my main go-to framework), JavaScript (jQuery), and PHP with Oracle databases)

Held a second internship position with the same fortune 500 company as a data analyst from Dec 2018 - May 2019 when I graduated college.

That internship turned into a full time position, and I am now a full time data analyst. I write a lot of SQL, generate Microsoft Power BI reports, do some web development, write PHP scripts to move data from one database to another, and play roles in large data migration projects.

Now that I am a data analyst at my day job, I still want to do web dev as a freelancer on the side. I'd like to start small, so I know I'll be able to accomplish the tasks thrown at me.

I live in the Detroit area, and there are many mom and pop shops I know of who have little to no online presence. Either they have a shitty website (and I mean SHITTY... so bad I could start from scratch and make a better one in like 5 hours), or no website at all. I know some of these shops are contemplating hiring someone to get them a website, because we communicated with them when I took my web dev class in college... We presented some of our work to them at the end of the semester, with the possibility of getting hired. Long story short, the adjunct prof who taught the class was a complete moron and basically fucked us all over on that project, leaving us all with very shitty projects that obviously would never get us hired by anyone. (Not allowing us to use jQuery or bootstrap, not allowed to use PHP til the last week of class when we're all busy with final exams and 20 other projects, being extremely unclear on what he wants, etc, etc, etc).

I would like to redeem myself, create a portfolio website, walk door to door to these businesses and show them what I'm really capable of. I don't yet have a portfolio site, because most of the work I've done is for the company I work for. So I can't post any of my work anywhere. I currently have some of my own work I can post up, but I still need to create more content for a portfolio site.

I am extremely driven and am willing to put in what it takes to make this a successful side gig. But here are some questions that I have:

1. Should I invest in a server to host these sites on, charging people to host their site on it? Or is there a good third party host which supports PHP? I see a lot of contradicting thoughts online, with some saying it's not worth it to run your own server (due to cost and inevitability of getting hacked), but others saying that is what they do.

2. What are the major legal issues I should be looking out for?

3. Do you think this is a reasonable option for someone who just graduated college recently, who has under a year of experience creating full stack sites entirely on their own? Or is it something you can only be successful doing if you've been working as a full time web dev for 10 years?

4. Should I be searching for work on sites like Upwork, or should I focus more on visiting businesses face-to-face, building a local reputation and getting customers through word of mouth?

Thank you in advance."

I have a very low GPA (2.5)  and right now doing my first co-op/internship. I worked really hard last year to do some side projects to find an internship and I was successful. I also created an online portfolio website to show case my web dev projects. 

My preferred field in tech are software development, web development and data science. But I know with me having a Bachelor degree and a low GPA,  it's harder to find a data science job . 

I'm looking for some advice to what should I do in my last year of collage in order to find a good full time job after graduation? Should I focus on doing more side projects or spending most of my time studying to get good tech certificate(s) like ""AWS Cloud Practitioner""? Or should I just focus on school and getting better grades? 

And if you're living in Canada, what is the best time to start applying for New grad jobs ?

Thanks in advance."

ckcyzq,1,2019-07-31,Should I accept the Internship extension or push for a part-time position?,twigy_balboa,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ckcyzq/should_i_accept_the_internship_extension_or_push/,"So I'm currently a UI/UX Design Intern that started the internship on February of this year. This internship wasn't supposed to start until the beginning of Summer, but because they had so many design needs, they offered to start the internship early. Fast forward to now, where it's been 7 months into the internship and the official end to the internship is coming close. My supervisor discussed with me what my plans were in either wanting to stay and continue work for the company or leave. I'm entering my senior year of uni so he offered to let me stay as a part-time until I graduate, and work full time afterward. That was perfect! Right before we ended that conversation, he told me he had to warn me that the company was currently in the middle of a hiring freeze so me being brought on board as a part-time may get delayed. I told him that was fine and to keep me posted. Fast forward 2 weeks, and now they are offering to extend my internship instead due to the hiring freeze. Having already started this internship 4 months early, I was really hoping to get hired part-time, that way I would be paid significantly more than the intern wage.

Thing is, the supervisor as well as other members of the dev/design team really like my work. Furthermore, the reason they wanted me to start the internship early in the first place was due to the overwhelming amount of design needs (our design team is super small). Not only is this still the case, but they have a giant project coming up, and they definitely need the help. I feel like I have the upper hand here. Should I just wait until they lift the hiring freeze? With all the help they need, if I reject the extension, my thinking is they'll have to push to hire me asap. I don't want to run into the possibility of accepting the extension and have that extension go on for a while."
ckd8v9,1,2019-07-31,First build - considering whether to use an older monitor or buy new,OwenTheAwesome22,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ckd8v9/first_build_considering_whether_to_use_an_older/,"So, title basically.  With some money from a summer internship, I’m upgrading from a laptop to a desktop that I’ll be taking to school with me.  I’ve been browsing this sub for a few days and my friends helped me pick out a build.  I’ve got a Ryzen 5 2600x and a GTX 1660 Ti lined up, and the build initially included a Dell 1080p 75Hz monitor.  In lieu of shelling out for a whole new monitor, I was considering using my brother’s old Element 27” 1080p 60Hz model.

[Pcpartpicker list here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/s3yXCb)

I guess my question is whether the monitor becomes a bottleneck if I go the hand-me-down route.  I play a lot of Apex Legends, so if I’m just looking at FPS am I underusing my build by using a monitor capped at 60Hz?  I’m also not sure how strenuous 1440p gaming is compared to 1080, but I’m basically checking to make sure that I can get full use of my PC’s performance once it’s put together.  I’d consider spending ~$150 on a monitor if it offered enough of an improvement over 1080p60.

ckdzqi,2,2019-07-31,How do I write a resume for a first time internship?,ltgenspartan,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ckdzqi/how_do_i_write_a_resume_for_a_first_time/,"I am a senior, and I am going to apply for an EE internship for the first time. The biggest reason that this is my first time applying for one is that my GPA is monumentally lower than everyone's minimum GPA until now, in which case the place I am applying at has no GPA requirement. I am sitting at a 2.23. Main reason for this isn't because I don't know what's going on in my classes (almost always) or being lazy, but that I've had to work shitty retail/fast food jobs to support myself since graduating high school. I fully have the passion to get an engineering internship, because where I work at isn't for aspiring engineers whatsoever, and I'm more than ready to start applying what I've been learning in classes (not to mention the pay is double what I currently make). I have taken all my core EE classes except for control systems, electronics, and senior project, and the only elective I've taken so far is computational emag. I haven't been able to do any projects by myself because of job reasons, except one for my microprocessor class. The job description says that I would be mainly assisting the full time engineers and shadowing them. Not the most riveting experience, but I absolutely want to have some kind of experience in the engineering world before I want to graduate.

With this info, how would I write a resume for the place I want to intern at? It is only for the upcoming semester. I have been in between jobs since I graduated high school and know how to tailor a resume for that, but not for something involving engineering. LinkedIn sent me a notification saying that the place prefers EE majors from my university, so it gives me a slight edge, but I don't feel I'm a strong candidate because of a weaker GPA and no outside projects. I would greatly appreciate some help in resume building, because I really want to start my engineering experience."
ckfvq1,3,2019-07-31,Graduate School Advice,lenu_l,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/ckfvq1/graduate_school_advice/,"I’m currently an undergrad in an ECE program, but this is my second bachelors degree. Weird, I know, but I decided that the career change was important and worth the loans.

I’ve been loving my program and landed an internship in power systems. This internship has me PSYCHED. I’ve been encouraged by a professor (power systems) to go ahead and apply my school’s graduate program without finishing the BS. 

Pros: My tuition would be waived (I would be a research assistant), the whole process would be accelerated, I wouldn’t have to do the undergraduate requirements that I’m not interested in (eg humanities classes). 

Cons: I like what I’m doing now (power systems) but I don’t think I’ve had enough exposure to anything else to be sure that’s the route that I want to go down. I’m having a fear of commitment. I initially began this degree thinking that I’d go into Embedded systems, but my exposure to that has been minimal.

Please respond with all of the opinions. Thanks!"

I live in Quebec Canada so im doing a DEC of computer science currently which is a 3 year program that allows me to get decently paying jobs in the field(50-70k) and i was also planning to go to uni to get my Bachelors of computer science which will take another 3 years and graduate at 25. But now i have an internship opportunity to work full time in a data presentation/manipulation job that can teach me much more than what im going to be learning in college currently. I am very interested in investing my money and save almost all of it currently so having more capital younger could help me in the long run but im just concerned at how this could affect my career in computer science. I could move up positions within the company and I will most definetly be studying and learning stuff on my own time. So is it a good idea to take this job?
