73igej,3,2017-09-30,IT - Network Security question,chexss,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/73igej/it_network_security_question/,"I am a 3rd year IT Network Security student working on my bachelors degree. I have zero IT work experience (used to be an aircraft mechanic in the military) and I also have zero certifications (as of now, but I am working on Security+, and possibly studying for the CISSP after).

The question I have is this..
I can either graduate in December of 2018, or June of 2019. My degree would be a bit condensed, and I would be taking 3 classes during summer, but I could graduate after winter quarter next year (6 months early). 

Why I am unsure if this is a good idea or not is because I would possibly not be able to manage 3 full time classes while working in an internship / job during the summer. If I do not get work experience then I will end up graduating with a bachelors degree, and 1-2 certifications, but with zero work experience. 

If I graduate 6 months early, I would be in the job market earlier then the majority of the other students who are graduating in 2019. However if I graduate 6 months later with work experience then it would be easier getting a job, and possibly starting with a higher pay because of prior work experience? 

What is the best course of action? Thanks for the guidance! "

Based on my feedback, it was because my manager didn't think I was interested in the work but he did think my technical skills were suitable.

I realize now that I would definitely like to do the same work at the same company and also submitted another application via the company's website.


Is there anyway I can e-mail my manager and let him know I'm interested despite him thinking I wasn't? I think he thought I wasn't interested because I spoke the wrong words and, when he asked if I like the work, I said something like ""I'm not sure if I'm doing it because i like it or because i have to"" - which was stupid of me.

Any suggestions on how I can address this or what I can add in an e-mail to him?

Thanks!"

This will be the very first interview of a company that I am passionate about applying to and I don't want to mess it up.

Here is what I want to know:

1. What are the stages of the interview? (How many? What does the phone interview include? What do the university interviews, on-site interviews include)

2. What topics do I need to make sure to study? (Will Basic DS and Algorithm suffice or should I practice graphs and such)

3. (I want to gauge how hard the interview is compared to Big 4 or Financial Banking companies such as Bank of America, JPMorgan &amp; Chase or fintech companies such as Bloomberg)
How are the interview questions(for the technical)? Are they an easy-medium on HackerRank or LeetCode or Medium? What kind of questions do they ask such as System Design questions, Caches? What do they emphasize their questions on?

4. Lastly, How was your experience like as an intern? I wanna know all about it, Thanks so much I truly appreciate it"

I am a junior math major. This summer, I participated in an REU at my university. I did work in computational fluid dynamics, and the REU cohort will be going to the JMM in January to present our work. I want to apply for another REU this summer in field I would like to explore more, and I'm not sure whether asking for a letter is a good idea or not. Warning for a long post. 

Background:
The summer was a rough one. My advisor is a poor teacher, but he was generally patient with me and helped me understand. He was fairly hands-off, and often gave little instruction. I needed constant help over the summer, and when I didn't get something he would just... do it for me, which was fine but I would rather have been given more instruction and then done it myself. However, I've learned a lot and I'm more comfortable programming and discussing the concepts and techniques we used. 

Now:
The project was supposed to be done at the end of June. It wasn't, and I take responsibility because my progress was on the slow side and our simulations took a nontrivial amount of time. We discussed wrapping up in July, but my advisor went MIA for the entire month and I didn't hear back until school started. I've told him that with my full courseload, teaching internship, and lab work I won't be able to work on the project as much, and he understood. However, the last time we met (August) he wanted me to troubleshoot the model, and I haven't gotten around to it due to some family stuff/classwork. I'm hoping to finish things up over fall/winter break, wrap it up in a bow and let him do what he wants with it. 

I was told that extending the project was an option at the beginning of summer, but since I haven't accomplished everything I want, progress was slow,  and he still has ideas, things have spilled over to this semester. For many reasons, I do not want to continue working with him after the conference in January, which is the ""official"" end of the program. 

Would it be inappropriate to ask for a letter of recommendation for another REU? I know it's an undergrad project and it won't be perfect, but I feel weird about it. Thanks.

Credit wise, I'm a semester ahead though (so next semester in spring 2018 I'll be a senior). Despite this, because the way the courses work out (i.e. my senior project is only offered in the spring and the requisite is only offered in the fall) I won't be able to graduate early. I also have had two amazing internships, the first one in the summer of 2016 which I was hired on full time after the end of the internship and have been working at ever since, and another this summer, 2017, where I was offered a job post graduation.

Here's where I'm feeling stuck. I have not yet taken some classes that cover a lot of what I learned at my internships and after talking to those who have taken the classes I feel I could test out of quite a few of them given the chance. When I brought this up with my counselor he basically explained they don't allow any of that sort of stuff and that I should be happy that the classes are easy A's. In essence, the most credit I could get for my internships is 3 credit-hours from the ""Internship"" class, even though I learned much much more. At first I figured it was fine and I would just take the ""easy A"" classes but as I sit through one of them this semester I'm getting more frustrated by my predicament as it feels like i'm wasting not only my time but also my money. Especially since it all seems a little bit superfluous as I not only currently have a job as a software engineer but I have an even better one lined up after graduation. 

At first I pursued transferring to a different local college but that would push my graduation date back which is the last thing I want. Now I'm looking into taking some of these Easy A classes online so that if I'm going to be forced to take them at least I can do it on my schedule which will allow me more flexibility to work as well as travel. Is there anything else I can do that I didn't think of? Where might I go about finding accredited software engineering/CS classes? I hope this didn't sound too whiny, so if you think I should just grow up and power through I appreciate that opinion too.

I watch NetworkChuck on YouTube and in one of his videos he mentions that people who have knowledge of networking, but can also code well are like ""unicorns,"" and I hope I can be one of these ""unicorns"" one day. (haha)

To pose my question(s): What would be an ideal path to getting to these end-goals, and in terms of skills, what should I be studying in addition to my schooling right now. I have a pretty firm grip on Java and can make my way around Linux (Debian) to a degree. I will for sure be taking a Python course in the near future, but in terms of OpenFlow, certs or other coding languages, I'm not too organized with my further-reaching future. I do intend on one day building a home-lab, but that is only once I'm able to get myself a internship or job pertaining to my field of study.

73p747,0,2017-10-01,Chances of getting into UCLA as CS Transfer?,toostupidforlife,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/73p747/chances_of_getting_into_ucla_as_cs_transfer/,"I know everybody probably hates these posts but I haven't been able to sleep for weeks and thought maybe this would help alleviate at least some of the insomnia, regardless of whether the feedback is negative or positive. At this point, I can no longer stand the uncertainty and just want to know if I should give up hope. Anyway here's a bit about me:        

Demographics: Asian Male living in Cali     

GPA: 3.756 currently, which is probably going to get to 3.83 or so by the end of this semester and around a 3.9 by the time I end up transferring       

Major: Computer Science            
Alt Major:  Mathematics of Computing     

Awards:      
- AP + PLTW Student Achievement in Engineering     
- First Place in Undergraduate Research Conference that was hosted at my cc    
- AP Scholar with Distinction      
- Dean's Honors List for every semester I've attended my school      

Extracurriculars:     
- VP of Alpha Gamma Sigma Honors Society    
- Ambassador Program (work 15 hr/week)     
- Software Development / Android Programming internship at local mid-tier company during first semester of cc.      
- MESA member (is this even an ec?)      
- Honors/TAP Program     
- Pathways Program      
- CCCP Scholars Program    
- Set-up a program where students from my cc can go to a local middle school that has historically been academically inferior to all schools in the region, and is comprised mainly of minorities in order to tutor them for free.      

Other Pertinent Info:       
- Both my B's were in math classes :(        
- GPA for CS classes is 4.0      
- Assist.org shows 5 CS courses that UCLA would ideally have transfers take, out of which my school offers 4. By the time I transfer, I will have taken all four of these.      
- I will have finished all prereqs by the time I transfer      
- I have completed all of IGETC aside from the Arts &amp; Humanities section (I asked around and apparently, as an Engineering major, we only need partial IGETC)      

UCLA is my dream school and I realize my GPA really sets me up for failure but do you think that I might have a chance at getting in to atleast my alternate major? 

Thank you do all those who end up reading or replying to this post!      

TL;DR: 3.76 CS transfer student

73pfod,5,2017-10-01,When I was younger...,Tinydoggo13,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/73pfod/when_i_was_younger/,"I swore to myself. That i would be famous. That I’ll be an actor and a director. I swore I’ll do everything it takes no matter how difficult it gets. I always wanted to be everything. A cop, a soldier, a homicide investigator, a psychiatrist.. everything. But if I’m an actor or a director I could live those lives or at least tell that story as a director producer.

When I went to do my diploma I swore to myself that 3 years from now on internship, I’m gonna do so good and impress the people there. I swore I’ll do everything and do my best of the best to get known for my skills. I swore i’ll do so good, I’ll be employed by the company right after internship.

Now, I am on internship. At quite literally the biggest media company in my state. I didn’t apply for the position. In fact, I didn’t apply for any. I didn’t care where I went. I don’t see the point anymore. I made a horrible first impression to them. By coming to the interview late, and my first day late. I Guess one of my lecturers who had me when I was in my prime referred me to them. Of course way back when I was offered several scholarships. One of the honour student in the deans list.

I’m quiet now. I don’t mingle or talk to people. I don’t follow them for lunch. I don’t anything. I’m either in the studio or outside filling my lungs with cancer. The first week itself the Vice President of the department I was under, asked me to do a side project. He talked to me as if he was a client and I had to produce something. He gave this job to me because he’d seen my portfolio. I was good. I was good before things went to hell.

I couldn’t do it. I said yes I’ll take the job but.. I’ve lost every grain of creativity in my head to make that happen. I mean I was never that Creative but at least I was something. I’m horrible at what I’m doing here. I know they think I’m all talk. Or I had a lot of help on my portfolio. Isn’t true but, they’re not wrong for seeing me as an incompetent intern. I was in the washroom one day and I thought about it. I remember swearing that I’ll do so fucking good here. I had flair at the point of time. I was popular. Everybody knew me. It was easy talking to people. But now, everything has changed.

Whenever they asked me what I wanted to do after internship, nothing pops into my head. I lie and say something to at least give them something. Last night. Last night I asked myself. Where do I want to go? What’s out there for me? And I realised. There’s really nothing.

I realised that there’s really nothing holding me back here on earth. Nothing. Nothing I can’t let go of. I have no friends. I live away from my family. I have honestly really nothing. My Best Friend? The one I was always there for when he really really felt like shit? He’s MIA. I think he thinks I’ve had it all settled. But it’s quite the opposite.

So. What’s the point of living if there’s really nothing to hold on to?"

I landed a job pretty early in my senior year at a company. I didn’t really know what I would be doing at the company, I was just happy that I had a job. I started working 3 weeks after graduation and immediately I didn’t like what I was doing. The company is an older traditional software company that has a rigid management structure and typical 9-5 hours. Everyone goes home after work and no company events or happy hour etc. I was in limbo doing random front end/backend API work like completing the intern work after they left for school etc. Now I’ve been put on our remote team that is 12+ hours ahead of my time. The team works with old Microsoft technology (vb .net). I have no interest in stack because it’s not something I want to take away with to advance my career. I’m not even sure I enjoy web development in general. My question is, should I quit my job asap and look for work elsewhere or stick with this for a few more months. So far I’m 4 months into the job and I haven’t enjoyed a single minute. Another question is how would I transition my career from development or Product management? 

Tbh I didn’t know much about how companies work or anything. I interned at a small web development consulting agency doing simple html/css/js and an office  that consisted of 10 people. 

TLDR; got a job at a company right after graduation. Work culture sucks and tech stack I’m going to be working with is C#/VB.NET. Should I quit and look for job elsewhere (only 4 months at the job)? How would I transition my career into product management?"

I'm currently working towards a B.S. in Informatics specializing in IT and I like the coursework but I'm wondering what I can do with it in the future.

73qd3q,8,2017-10-01,Deciding whether or not to take a gap year before submitting PhD applications,thaifilipinoguy,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/73qd3q/deciding_whether_or_not_to_take_a_gap_year_before/,"Hi everyone

I just wanted some general feedback if I should take a gap year to apply to graduate schools. I have an idea in my mind about what I want to do but I think my decision would be better informed if I heard some feedback from peers like yourselves. 

Right now, I'm in the midst of my senior year after a long seven years of undergrad and this semester I'm taking some of the most difficult classes I have ever taken. Simultaneously, I'm trying to studying for the GRE and draft both statements of purpose and personal statements. I participated in a full time research internship this past summer and did not have as much time as I wanted to study for the GRE and write statements with only two weeks of down time between spring semester 2017 and fall semester 2017. I'm feeling pretty burnt out and I'm trying to decide whether to focus my energy on my coursework or PhD applications. Right now, I don't see the point in evenly dividing my efforts between coursework and PhD applications and not doing my best on both. Here's some brief background before going into some pros and cons of focusing either on coursework or PhD applications: 

* Completing B.S. in biology with minor in microbiology at a California State University (CSU). Working on a honors thesis and going to defend in spring (2014 - present)
* Attended a community college and graduated with an A.A. in natural sciences (2011 - 2014) 
* It is taking a while to finish my undergrad because of switching majors/undecided on med/grad school and taking time off because of the illness and passing of a family member
* Three years of part-time undergrad research at CSU during the academic terms and two full-time research internships at a local cancer research hospital. I am planning to ask all three PI's for recommendation letters for my application. 
* Supervised a high school student in my CSU lab for a summer research internship and was a supplemental instructor for both chemistry and human anatomy for two years at my community college
* Awarded two research fellowships by the NIH (RISE and MARC) and multiple scholarships and nominations
* Two co-author publications in preparation with a possible third co-author publication also in preparation by the time I submit my application if I choose to do so
* Multiple poster presentation at home university and local university. A few oral presentations as well 
* Vice President of a biomedical research club for two years and member of a Toastmasters club
* About 700 hours of clinical volunteering in local hospitals (I was at one time planning to apply to medical school. I am ambivalent about including this on my application to PhD programs) 

Focusing  on classwork

* Pros: 
* Better chance of maintaining 4.00 GPA (I am worried that a lack of focus on classwork while working on PhD applications will lead to a downward trend in my GPA in upper division classes which may be troubling to admission committees. Also if I take a gap year then grad schools will see all my grades from senior year) 
* More time to focus on honors thesis research and present at a national conference (I don't know if these two things are super valuable to grad school admission committees) 

* Cons: 
* Less time to focus on studying for the GRE and drafting statements for PhD programs (I am scheduled to take the GRE on 10/31 and I don't see how I will have enough time to study for it with basically an exam/lab report due each week. On my Magoosh practice tests I have been averaging 150s for both quant and verbal and I have no idea what my writing score will be like. Writing always is time consuming for me and it would be hard for me to draft, rewrite, and edit statements this semester.) 
* Submitting half-baked applications and having to settle for a program 

Focusing on PhD applications

* Pros: 
* More time to focus on studying for the GRE and drafting statements
* Possibly save a year if I am accepted for the Fall 2018 term
* Submitting more well thought out applications and knowing I'm submitting my best work 

* Cons: 
* May lose 4.00 GPA and not preform as well in upper division classes

I could avoid making the decision to focus on either coursework or PhD applications by just taking a gap year and focus on my coursework and thesis now and focus on putting together my PhD application next year, but I just wanted to hear some feedback from others before shifting my priorities. Sorry for what turned out to be a lenghty post but any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I'm worried I've basically screwed up my chances at a career in a field I would enjoy working in because I graduated almost two years ago and have nothing to show for it beyond a few personal projects (a few basic apps/web apis) and my final year project.

I've had only 3 interviews since and the latest interview I had the interviewer was quite surprised how long it's been since i graduated and wanted me to explain, which I basically said I've been searching for an opportunity to grow my skills/experience and unfortunately haven't been able to find one yet. So that definitely wasn't the greatest explanation because I didn't get the job which made me realise that maybe it's been too long.

So my main question is how bad of a position am I in and can I recover from this at all or am i screwed? I feel my best chance is to either get into another field of work (which I have no clue what i would want to do) whilst I'm still kind of young, or do freelance web dev projects to build a portfolio of experience and hope that the quality of my work can outweigh the huge gap of unemployment I wouldn't know how to explain any better than how I explained it above.

I felt fairly confident going in, had gone over relevant formulas the prof heavily implied would be included.  I looked through the questions and recognized all of them as ones I had gone through and studied, then immediately forgot how to do all of it.

At this point it's more of the same old shit.  I never had to try much in school and excelled until I got to college which has repeatedly drop kicked me at every opportunity.  If I did not already have years of experience and connections from relevant internships (that I have been successful at and invited back to) I probably would have found another major, but the thing is despite the trouble I still genuinely want to become a mechanical engineer and finish what I started.  Every semester I've gone in thinking ""Ok, this time I've figured out what to do"" but what it seems to come down to is if I am to know something on an exam I need to know it the first time I see it, otherwise I have great difficulty learning things, and when I panic for a second on an exam anything I did learn disappears as I resume the default state of now knowing the subject.  Today it seemed that since I did not do too well on my first couple exams and felt good but not 100% going into today's, I assumed failure from the start and was overcome by this, forgetting what I had studied.

Has this ever happened to anyone else?  I am considering seeking psychiatric help even, although I am not sure where to get started with that (I already tried my schools counseling service which was not terribly helpful).

Sorry for the incoherent wall of text, but any advice would be great.

TL;DR:  How to overcome the fear of fear itself."

He has never lived on his own, and doesn't help my mom with the mortgage payment, do chores around the house, help with the car payment for the car she gave him, or even help with the cell phone bill. He doesn't have plans at all to move out, and has never held a job (all of them manual labor) for more than 4 weeks without getting fired. His last job he 'think he got fired, but never followed up' because he just simply stopped showing up and didn't communicate with his managers on why. He also would frequently complain about his coworkers, looking down on them because they didn't have a college degree. He would devise petty plans to sabotage them, like mess up their timing cards for their shifts and talk nonstop about how everyone hates him, blaming his unhappiness on them. This pattern repeats for almost every job he has, and he claims that he can't stay in any job because 'everyone is out to get me'. Personally, I wonder how every single coworker he meets is out to get him, or if really he's the one at fault. 

In addition, he also has never helped around the house. When I come home from college, I help cook/clean/mow the lawn, and my mom is astonished because she isn't used to having someone else help her. He refuses to help, but then gets angry when my mom or I don't cook meals for him. He complains to me that my mom stopped cooking for him when I left for college, and now he eats smoothies and protein shakes every day, never bothering to wash his own dishes.

He now mostly spends his time on his phone indoors. He also fussed for my mom to buy a laptop for him, which he only uses to browse reddit or watch dumb videos. He currently has no job and no social skills, and is extremely prideful and rude. I made food for him the other day, and he responded with 'you think I want that shit? fuck you' when I offered. There were leftovers the next day, which I was going to eat, but took the bowl of food away after saying 'you think someone would just leave a bowl of food for you? How much of it did you eat already?' 

I also think he has Munchausen's syndrome- where he constantly thinks he is dramatically sick in some way. Recently, he thinks he has needed surgery on his shoulder, surgery on his forearms, thinks he hurt his eardrum, and injured his back and can’t walk. All of these ended up not being anything, and every time I come home from college it’s something different. Any money he gets he spends on expensive tests and MRI scans, racking up bills and debts he cannot pay off. He goes to the gym every day and is a lot healthier than the average person, so none of these illnesses make sense to have if he’s able to swim a mile a day and squat 250 lbs (I’ve been to the gym with him). 

It's not like he wasn't raised right- My mom raised us the same way, I attend a prestigious university on almost a full scholarship for engineering, and secured an internship in NYC. I actively work on my own to I try to get anything I want in life, be humble and listen to people as much as I can. My mother is kind and generous, and I learned everything in life from her. I don't understand how he turned into such an asshole, and it’s not like he grew up depraved and without human contact.

Anyway, I could go on and on about how he’s entitled and piece of shit. He's a total loser and lets his pride get in the way of everything, and me and my mother can't take it any longer. Speaking to him is like walking on eggshells- if he hears something he doesn’t like he will shut down and forever be resistant to that idea in the future. He just needs so much to be corrected with himself that I don’t know how to help him.

My concern is what job opportunities and fields can this type of job help me with in the future if I get this as experience?

If you guys have any idea, I would be very glad to hear it. Thank you so much.

EDIT: I was really hoping for a junior / entry level dev job hopefully a first job but opportunities are few and far in between. Plus my resume needs work, I really don't have much experience (Software dev intern for about 4 months) and so I get why companies are not looking as much for me."

I am hoping to get some additional insight into my current career situation. First, I'll provide some breif background on myself and by job: 

* I have a Masters Degree in CS from a university in the United States. I graduated with this degree in May and have been working at my current company since then.

* The company I work for is a well known (in name), mid sized, international retailer. I am really happy with where I work; I like the company and the people.

* My role at my company is **Database Administrator**. I believe that I am adjusting to the role well and I am certainly learning a lot. All of my feedback has been great and I know that my managers think highly of my work, so far.  

**So what's the problem?** I was not hired on as a DBA, I was hired on as a Software Engineer. In fact, in the HR systems, my title is still listed as ""Software Engineer"".

**So why are you a DBA now?** After a couple of days at work, I was asked by my manager about my database experience. Having had lots of academic work in DBs (it was my Master's research area) and an internship that included things DBAs do. They asked if I would be able to fill a need they had at the DBA role and I accepted.

I still have the itch to write code and I think I may want to be a full time developer one day. 

**My Questions**:

* Should I be concerned about my future ability to gain a developer job? (I'm guessing this is ""YES"" but just looking for a confirmation)

* If I want to protect my ability to do development in the future, should I ask about picking up some light programming work, like small bug fixes? Maybe consisting of ~4 hours a week?

* BLS.gov rates the salary expectations for developers and DBAs to be about the same. Job outlook gives a slight edge to the DBA role. What do **you** think about this? Mostly interested in earning potential, honestly.

* How do employers view the DBA role as opposed to that of a developer? Does either role lend itself to more (different) career opportunities?

Thanks for taking the time to read and reply! :)

73wz4o,1,2017-10-02,What should I do after my job ends?,YouBetterTeaLeafIt,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/73wz4o/what_should_i_do_after_my_job_ends/,"Hello reddit! I set up an account specifically to post this! This issue is giving me a lot of anxiety, so I'd appreciate some help working through it.

Right now I have a part-time temporary job as a museum assistant at a small medical museum/library, which I got after working there as an unpaid intern. Most of the time I do research on objects, keep track of inventory and accessions/deaccessions, write some exhibit text, and do some light restoration work like cleaning and waxing. I really enjoy it, but it's ending in two weeks and I don't know what to do next. I've been looking for new jobs for months but I haven't had any luck. I interviewed for a job similar to the one I have now, but I didn't get it. After the interview, I realized I wasn't actually sure if I really wanted it. I feel like the answer of what I want to do is right in front of me, but I'm too close to be able to see it clearly, so I would appreciate some help brainstorming. Here's a little bit about me:

I graduated cum laude a few months ago with a BA in history, minoring in art history. I'm great at doing research and writing papers, but the thing I like about history is mostly the material culture of it, hence the museum work. I like being able to interact with antiques and artifacts and sort of imagine what it was like to live in the past. I like being able to tell when something is from the nineteenth century versus the eighteenth century, and seeing how the aesthetics change over time.

My plan when I started undergrad was to get a master's degree in art and objects conservation, but about a year and a half ago I realized I didn't really want to do that at all. It would mean taking two semesters of organic chemistry, and I'm not a huge science person, and then the career itself is more about science than actually dealing with the history of the objects.

I have around two years of museum experience, but it's all part time or volunteer, so less if it's prorated.

My favorite work environment is being in a room somewhere by myself totally zoned in on a task, preferably listening to music or podcasts and not having to interact with the public. I'm not much of a leader, and to be honest I don't particularly want to be. I like when someone tells me what to do and leaves me to get it done.

I don't want to do anything that would involve me being responsible for anyone else's life. I toyed with the idea of going to law school for a while, but the idea that someone could go to jail if I screw up is horrifying. I have trouble handling average day-to-day stress, that kind of stress might literally kill me.

I'm not good at sales at all, or really convincing anyone to do anything they hadn't already decided to do. I feel like if 
I tried to sell someone something and they said no, instead of trying to sell harder I'd just be like, ""That's fair,"" and walk away, and then die of starvation because I'd never sell anything.

I like being creative and doing historical research, and ideally I would like a career that combines both. I love digging into obscure primary sources to find information on a person or thing or event, and I love doing crafty things like painting and drawing and sewing. When it comes to visual arts I feel like I'm more of a copyist than an artist though. 

When I paint I usually work from a photo, since I'm not a huge fan of laying out composition or color theory or things like that. I'm a pretty technically proficient realist painter, but I have a hard time coming up with what to paint and how to arrange it in space. I like sewing and drafting garment patterns and I've been doing it since I was really young, but when I design things again a lot of the time it's copying from something that exists, or mashing together bits and pieces from a few different garments. I've made a few historical reenactment outfits, which is pretty fun.

I feel like I would enjoy being a freelancer, but I'm terrified of failure, like everyone else probably. I would really like to set my own hours and pick my own projects and possibly even work from home depending on what I would be doing, but I don't really know how to set it up and put myself out there and find clients. I'm having trouble finding work I'm even qualified for in my area, so going it on my own might be my main option in this economy.

If anyone has advice or ideas based on this I'd really appreciate your input! Thanks! Also sorry this is super long. I like to be thorough."

A lot of the classes I'm taking this year have relatively new material and the concepts are just really hard to grasp for me. For example, I'm learning about frame rotations and rotation matrices in one of my classes and it might just be the notations, but stuff is flying right over my head. My aerodynamics class is pretty similar in that I'm not retaining a lot of information. Same goes with a numerical analysis class I took last year (think ODE solvers w/ MATLAB). It takes me a while to process information. I can't remember the last homework assignment that I was completely confident in without looking at the solutions or asking for help, and this dates back to probably since I started college. I can spend hours on just a few problems at times, and still not truly understand what's going on. My grades aren't bad (around 3.3 GPA), but I honestly don't think that's a reflection of my intelligence. 

Outside of academics, I can also see this. For example, I'm a pretty slow thinker. I don't like improvisational situations and I'm not super witty. I watch a ton of Youtube videos about different engineering systems from Learn Engineering and other channels like that, but I forgot how stuff works within a week maybe. I have to constantly refresh my knowledge and have a hard time retaining information, like I've mentioned before. 

I think to compensate for my lack of natural intelligence, I work really hard. I live by the proverb: ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."" I study a lot (probably more than 75% of my classmates), but I'm not excelling. This has recently affected my mindset when I'm looking for internships. I really want to work at a big company this Summer (SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Spaceship Company) but I just don't feel qualified. Especially when they're asking for 3.5+ GPAs (and in SpaceX's case, 3.7+). I think that they do this to weed out students like me - hard workers, but not necessarily the most naturally intelligent. 

I don't feel dumb necessarily because I can tell my classmates are struggling just as much, if not more than me. But I don't like comparing myself to others. It's hard for me to truly grasp concepts and I'm worried that my brain doesn't have what it takes to be a great engineer. I know people in industry that complain about bad engineers (I'm not sure if they're dumb, or just lazy), so I know that it's not that hard to actually become an engineer. But how hard is it to become a great engineer? Does natural intelligence matter? How far can you get with average intelligence and a strong work ethic?

* I don't want  to live in milwaukee, or the midwest. I'd really like to live as close as possible to the pacific north west, or the rockies. Denver / Seattle etc..
* I want to at least try out other popular tech in a professional environment. I have plenty of project experience with Rails, Java, Python (data science and django) and unix, but no verifiable professional experience.
* learning and using other technologies is important to being a well rounded engineer and truly being able to discern the right solution for any given problem.
* money maximization is not a justifiable reason to sacrifice having new experiences.
* I'd really like to end up working at a non-profit or something at least environmentally focused.

The problem I'm facing is that it seems like most open job positions listed on indeed, or even peeking through the monthly hacker news ""who's hiring"" posts ask for at least a few years with tech I have no professional background in but would love to (Java, Python, PHP, Rails). How do I even get through the mass resume scan process if my background in rails is a year long school project and a github project I slapped together in an afternoon?

Should I try to start smaller first by finding something closer to me to build resume years of experience numbers, or would it be better to get into a different location with a .NET job until I can network and find something closer to what I'm looking for?

My biggest fear is getting pigeonholed to the point where I can't achieve one or any of my bullet-ed goals or experiences I'd like to have above.

I have an interview coming up in a couple of days with a big financial trading company and I am wondering whats the best way to prepare for it?
I have been working away albeit slowly through cracking the coding interview. I assume the questions in this book are aimed at full software engineer positions as opposed to the level I am currently at.
Are there typical questions that could be asked to be coded on a white board?

Typically my professor will post labs and give us 2 weeks to complete them, and I'm typically done in around 45 minutes. This is because I learned as much as I could before going back, but of course that well is going to quickly dry up in the next semester or two.

My question is, what are some good things to learn about, read about or practice in order to make myself better all around? I'm looking for things to do during winter/summer break. I know one of my tasks is to learn C++, because while we teach the lower level courses in Java, some classes I am taking next fall will be in C++ and I want to be semi-proficient in it. I just want to learn as much as possible so that I have a good background for upcoming internships.

I'm about to graduate with a BAS in IT Networking/Security. I have A+, NET+, SEC+, ITIL.
The part I'm worried about is that I did this whole program so fast by busting out gnarly course loads the entire time (so I could have some time left on my GI Bill to take a couple of CISCO courses for the CCNA after I graduate) that I didn't have time for an internship like most everyone else.
It's been suggested that I commission into the Guard for experience but I realllly don't want want to go back into the military.
Do you think that with the degree, those certs, and a CCNA, someone in the Seattle area would take a chance on me without the field experience?

Currently we are about 1 hour apart and see each other on weekends.  He will not consider moving unless he has a job in the area, and that makes sense.




The problem is that he doesn't get interviews. He barely gets rejection responses. He has been working at an auctioning company for about 10 years. He got it back in high school for some side cash, and is now working there full time. He earned his bachelor degree 5 years ago in economics with no specialized subjects or internships. The few interviews he has received immediately after college apparently did not go well enough for a second interview. One of his last interviews ended early because the interviewer did not find him to be a good fit. That ruined his self confidence in finding a job.




He is a smart guy, he now does a lot more office management work for the auction company rather than manual labor, which looks good for an office-based job application. He doesn't give himself enough credit and I think he shows that. He comes off as semi-unlikeable. He isn't ""chummy"" or talkative, he can be vague with his answers when he is uncomfortable, he doesn't brag, and generally has blunt honest answers which doesn't give the person he's talking to much to work with (conversation-wise). And I think that hurts him a lot on top of the fact that I don't think he changes his resume for each job he applies for. He can talk, he's not as introvert as I make him seem. Bring up football, basketball, ultimate frisbee, beer/breweries or MARVEL and he will come out of his shell more. But interviewers don't know that about him because he doesn't give off as personable.




Overall, I'm not sure how I can help him. Does anyone have any advice on how I can bring up this sensitive subject and how I can help him improve his applications/interviews? Has anyone been in this (his) type of situation? What did you do? Has he missed the boat for applying for a ""real job""?  I don't want to help him strictly for the reason that I want to move in with him, this isn't a relationship post. He deserves and can perform well at a ""real job"", he just needs a kick in the ass and I want to be the kicker.

7429bb,2,2017-10-03,Graduated with Information Systems BS in 2011 and left a great job in 2014 because I could not grasp programming. Unsure of where to go at this point.,corgi_butt,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7429bb/graduated_with_information_systems_bs_in_2011_and/,"Hi everybody. This may be a long story, so bear with me.


I was undecided in college (primarily a business school) for almost two years before I settled on an Information Systems degree. I enjoyed working with computers, so it naturally seemed like the best choice at the time. I lucked out and somehow managed to land a fantastic internship during my senior year. During my internship, I was given a project to build a dashboard application for dispatchers to use. I never ended up finishing the project, in fact most days I sat at my desk with no direction. After the first week or so, I was sent off on my own. I did not learn much during this time, and I kick myself for it most days.


Somehow after my internship, the manager I had reached out to me and gave me a formal job offer for after I graduated. I was to be a programmer analyst at a pretty big company, with a great salary and benefits. Obviously I took the offer. When I started my full time position, I was placed on a team for an application that had already been in place. I was to oversee and troubleshoot help desk tickets that had come in for that application. In addition to that, I was tasked with performance testing for new application releases, and some light Business Objects work (which I did not like either). I actually really enjoyed the performance testing that I did, maybe because it was the one thing that I was able to fully grasp and understand. I was trained on our application from a developer on my team, but when it came to the nitty gritty (looking at code and understanding why it worked the way it did) I often felt overwhelmed. I had never worked with anything on that scale. At that point, I determined that programming was not my cup of tea. I just did not have the right brain for it.


Fast forward to years later, I am still at this job but I have let work pile up because I am lost and too afraid to ask for help. I really wish I had gotten help sooner, because I dealt with a lot of mental health issues that went un-diagnosed until this past year. I found out that I have ADHD, coupled with anxiety that I already knew I had. Long story short, I ended up leaving my job (on good terms) because it was making my life miserable. I contemplated suicide and ended up taking myself to the ER for a panic attack during my last couple of weeks there. I was very depressed and ended up self medicating for a couple of years following the failure at my first real job. I was convinced I would never find a decent paying job again.


Since then I've been working as an office administrator at a small company. The job is very easy, which is what I was looking for at the time, but I am really worried that I've rendered my degree and experience useless due to the time I've spent out of the field.


Recently I've been in therapy and started taking medication, which has been a significant impact on my life. I realized that a lot of my anxiety and self loathing were caused by imposter syndrome. I am actually really good at my job when I have a clear understanding of what I am doing. I don't think that programming is for me, which is why I felt so underqualified at the time. I've started to rethink my approach and look at other positions that I can obtain with my Information Systems degree. I would be interested in working with the business side of technology more (systems analyst is one that I have in mind), and I think that my administrator experience could help with that. I am just at a loss for how to obtain these positions, as most of them require experience that I do not have.


I apologize if this seems really scatterbrained, as I am mostly writing off the top of my head, but I really want to get my life back on track and kickstart my career. If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it. 

TLDR: Earned my Information Systems BS in 2011, got a great programming gig out of college, realized I hated programming and left in 2014, spent the past couple of years working as an office administrator, want to know what my options are for pursuing a career at this point. Right now I am looking into certifications to bolster my resume, Server + specifically."

In my family my sister and I sort the clothes, my mom loads them into the washer and then the dryer, and then my sister and I fold the clothes. But my sister had classes in the morning today so I sorted out all the clothes (four people's worth) by myself and set up the laundry cart. By the time my mom was ready to do the laundry, my sister was home, so she (my mom) asked if one of us could help her roll the sock bin downstairs as there was about two week's worth of laundry in the main bag. Of course, my sister was in the room with the door closed so she ""couldn't hear"" my mom. Just as I was prepared to go downstairs with my mom my sister appeared suddenly and because I'm fucking sick of her always popping up *after* someone does something she should have offered to do (given I sorted out the laundry myself *AND* taking a cart downstairs BY ELEVATOR is so much less work intensive), I gave the cart to her and said she could do it. She sighed passive-aggressively the whole time while she put on her shoes and then stomped out. When she came back up she practically yelled at me to ""wipe the wheels clean"" which is fucking stupid because every time I've had to bring the cart downstairs, I wiped the wheels clean myself because that's part of the task. Then she slammed our room door shut while sighing all the way.

I fucking hate how she won't do anything until you ask her to, but when you ask her to she is a total fucking pain in the ass. Even the SMALLEST of tasks will send her into a passive-aggressive sighing rage. You could fold all the laundry yourself and if you ask her to just put away her goddamn clothes she'll act like you're asking her to stab herself in the neck with a knife. And it's the WORST because even my parents won't even bother asking her anymore because of this shitty attitude she puts up, and then I get asked to do things. Over the summer she didn't do JACK SHIT, like I mean she just sat around playing on her computer all day--no job, no internship, no *nothing*--and she wouldn't even walk the dog every afternoon, she'd just wait for my mom to come home and do it.

It's just **infuriating** when you're halfway through putting away the groceries and she comes out of the room and makes some dumb, unnecessary comment like ""Oh, mom and dad bought groceries?"" then sits on the couch on her phone without even offering to help out. God DAMN IT.

742rci,15,2017-10-03,Why do I feel like I'm shaming my parents by wanting to change my major?,ThrowawayStudent992,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/742rci/why_do_i_feel_like_im_shaming_my_parents_by/,"For context, I'm an Indian male. I study CS at a respected institution in the mid-west US. My father works as a development manager for a top-tier software company, and one of my second cousins works at IBM. Essentially, I come from a big software family.

However, I've been getting recurring thoughts of changing my major from CS to Business, which are bolstered by the high probabilities that I did A. terrible on my mechanics midterm and B. pedestrian on my intro CS class' midterm. 

In hindsight, I feel like I picked CS to make my parents proud of me. You have to understand, I love my parents to death. Seeing them disappointed or with looks of disapproval over something I've chosen or done feels like a knife to the heart. Also, as I stated before, I come from a big CS family; this means that when internships are brought up, I'd have options. That's probably another reason why I picked CS - the prospect of money. I originally was going to do BME, but I feel like that interest was also born out of a desire to make them happy.

I've been expressing the thought of switching to my parents for the past two days, and my dad has said that he would have no problem with me switching to business as long as I stick with it. However, when talking to him this morning, he seemed to sound disappointed about the whole thing. Even in prior times, he, along with my mom, chided me for having thoughts of studying business.

So here's the question: if my parents haven't expressed disappointment in me directly, have stated that they'll love me until the end of their lives, and seem OK/somewhat OK with my choices, why do I feel like I'm letting them down or making them look/feel bad?"

I've been working hard to try and manage my internship, senior project, other classes, and social life. But I feel like everything is suffering because I cant give anything the full attention it deserves.

I've worked for them for 3 months at this point and the amount of value that I perceive it giving me doesn't seem worth it anymore. I do not feel like I'm learning much any more from them; my shifts are generally spent finding random bugs/features to implement without much challenge. So now I've got the experience to talk about and put on my resume and cant help but feel that my time would be better spent really making my senior project shine. At this point the internship just seems like my lowest priority and its not fair to them. Am I underestimating the value of having an extended internship on my resume? Should I just suck it up and slave on?

At this point I'm really leaning towards quitting but I dont know how to go about it. The office is an open floor plan so telling the one or two people necessary that I'm submitting my two weeks notice seems rather awkward in front of everyone. But sending them a message on slack seems unprofessional. Also, in your opinion do I need to finish out my two weeks?

I have another internship set up for my last semester as a senior and am more interested in taking that one instead of being stuck to this company (if I had known this I would not have applied) but I have only interviewed with this company and have not gotten an actual offer yet. Should I send an email politely declining before I even get an offer to ensure another student gets the chance or should I wait until an offer is given to me? I might not even receive an offer and the problem could solve itself but I want to be sure I do not ""burn any bridges"" so to say."

I'm gritting my teeth a little since it's exactly what I wanted to avoid, but hopefully this will be a good learning experience and will open doors in the future?

What worries me, though, is that I've had multiple people who have been in IT for a while tell me that the longer you stay in IT, the harder it is to transition to the Engineering department. 

Is this true? It's scary to think that what I actually am passionate about and want to do professionally won't be possible because I wanted to work while looking for a true development job.

7458hx,4,2017-10-03,West Wing,skullkidsmask,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7458hx/west_wing/,"There's a wing of the Johnson Memorial Hospital that no one goes to. With not a single inhabitant, it's been deserted since I first started working there as a nurse.

I'm 29 as of now, and I had been working at Johnson Memorial Hospital for 2 years. I went through school to become an RN, and as my luck (or unluck more likely) would have it, Johnson Memorial was looking for an RN right after I graduated. The only reason I hadn't taken the job sooner was because I wanted to keep my options open. In the end they paid the most so I took the position.

The head nurse first placed me in the North Wing. That was our psychiatric unit. My every day duties consistsed of changing laundry, washing dishes, and performing routine check ins on our patients. It wasn't until my second year in my occupation that I was aware we even had a West Wing. 

The first time I heard of the infamous wing was when I caught a couple of interns gosiping about it instead of doing what they were supposed to. When I approached them, their faces turned pale and they got really quiet really quickly.

""What were you gossiping about over here?"" I questioned them. The first intern didn't tell me anything, he apparently knew he could get in trouble for talking instead of working.

""We were talking about the West Wing."" Ok, so the other wasn't as smart. 

I pressed them on what the West Wing was, but all that they told me was that it used to be the old pediatric wing of the hospital, but it had been deserted due to excessive degrading. It was covered in mold and rust and unfit to be used ever again. Oh, and nobody even bothers stopping by there. 

I left them to it, satisfied with that. Seemed like a perfectly normal explanation.

I was satisfied with it, that is until I happened to stumble by the wing. I paused outside of said wing, debating if I wanted to crack open the door and peek inside, when I heard a sort of dragging/scratching noise further into the section.

I was going to pry open the door, but something in my instincts told me not to. I'm glad I listened. 

Regardless, I went to visit the head nurse about it after my shift was over. 

""Excuse me, nurse Anderson, but what exactly is in the West Wing?"" I asked her.

Anderson looked shocked that I was asking.

""Absolutely nothing. It's been deserted for well over a decade. Why are you asking?"" She replied. 

When I told her about the scratching, she paled and quickly told me to never go there again. I promised her I wouldn't, but obviously we wouldn't be here right now if I had actually made good on my word. 

The next day, again after my sift ended (it's too risky to snoop during morning), I swung by the West Wing. 

This time, I heard no sound other than my own breathing, and the door looked same as the day before. I ignored the yellow caution tape and threw open the door so that I could step into the threshold. 

It was dark, and when I tried the light switch, the lights flickered but burned out again. What else could you expect for a facility shut down for 10+ years? 

Fortunately, my phone has a flash light built into it, and I was able to use it to guide me around. 

Needless to say, I did not see what I expected to. There was the much expected mold and rust, but overall it looked to be in better shape than what I thought. Although, there was shattered glass everywhere on the floor, so much so that every step I took sounded out an obnoxious crunch. 

I noticed some desks, but what really caught my attention was the giant broken incubator in the middle of the room. A large hole was gaping in the side of it, and the walls all had various scratch marks on them. I studied that area a bit longer before heading over to the aforementioned desks. 

Only one of them contained an interesting set of papers. The papers had a date from 2 weeks ago, but everything else was covered over by white-out. 

As I stood bent over the documents, a loud cry was let out and a single crunch that sounded exactly as it had when I stepped on the broken glass resonated through my very being. That was enough to tell me that I did not want to meet whatever this was yet. 

I grabbed the documents in a hurry, dropping my ID badge on the ground as I sprinted out of the room. I rounded a corner and stopped to catch my breath. 

As I was doing so, I watched as head nurse Anderson walked around the corner I had just come from. I waited until she was well around the bend to look and see what she was doing. I stuck my head around just in time to see her enter the West Wing. 5 minutes later, she came out scowling and holding my ID. 

I sprinted out of the building, just barely escaping. I got a call the next morning, saying that they were dropping me due to ""uncalled for behaviors"", and ""refusal to follow rules"". I accepted that, thinking it'd be the last of it, but a week later, I kept running into the higher-ups of Johnson Memorial, including nurse Anderson. It was unsettling, and I moved to a different city last month. 

I'm only bringing this up because recently, I've been recieving letters from unmarked adresses, but I think I have a pretty good idea who I'm receiving them from. 

I have yet to open them, yet I know they have to do with my career. 

And more importantly, what's in the West Wing of Johnson Memorial Hospital."
745bsz,20,2017-10-03,Severe test anxiety?,Tris42,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/745bsz/severe_test_anxiety/,"Sorry that this might be a long post. I'll try to put a good TL;DR at the end. This semester I'm taking 2 CS classes, both of them have weekly exams, and I've been doing poorly on them. The last one I took I ended up tearing up because I couldn't get it to compile, so by default I'll be getting a zero. As for the other class, I seem to be getting bad luck on the version I get, but I know could be studying more for that class. The one is weekly in the CBTF which I don't know about anyone, but that room is not a fun a place. My heart races every time I go in, I was crying when I left it today. Logging onto PrairieLearn sometimes even gives me a feeling of dread. 

I sit in office hours working on my MP about 12-26 hours a week depending on the length of the queue and how willing I am to skip dinner. I understand the material, but when it comes time to cold code on an exam, I forget trivial things and then it doesn't compile. 

Last year in the fall I was having the same problem with MATH 286 and ECE 210 so I made an appointment with the counseling center and went to them every other week for the semester. I found it helpful in the short term and I found out in order to at least keep some sanity I can't over 15 credit hours a semester. Hence, I'm delaying my graduation a semester to keep my semesters around 13-14 credit hours with 3 technical classes each. 

However, the same problems I had last year with exams is popping back up this year and I'm pretty sure it's test anxiety, but I don't know if it's worth or if I even can go back to counseling center. All they told me was to quit my job and my extracurricular activity. 

I was also considering filling out the academic screener intake form through DRES, but they want a detailed description of everything and why a counselor from the center recommended that I get screened. Except, she didn't recommend me last year, so I'm guessing I'd automatically get denied since I sought out resources already. 

I don't really know what to do. I'm stuck between a rock and hard place. If I do have severe test anxiety or something I'd like to get it under control before next semester when I take 391. This has been to a degree with every exam since I got here. Everyone around seems to breezing through classes and getting internships left and right while I'm just sitting here working hard but not seeing any benefits. 

TL;DR I think I have severe test anxiety and want to get help, but I think I'm ineligible for any services since I tried using them last year. "

As a student of the class of 2018, who's had just one boring internship and a worse resume than many who are unemployed now, this worries me.

Every semester mentioned below was paid for using financial aid. I am currently $13000 in debt.

2011- I started my IT Networking course. I passed all my classes through 2nd semester. I stopped attending after 3rd semester when my grades had slipped. I still got credit for an internship in 3rd semester.

2016- I decide to go back to college for the same degree, hoping I could pickup where I left off (3rd semester). I met with the program advisor. They told me that generally, course credits had a 5 year expiration. After researching, she gave me the green light on attending 3rd semester classes.

Day one of class- I was pulled into the registrars office to discuss the previous credits. I was informed that the credits would not be valid anymore due to the nature of the IT course itself. I was told that I would have to begin from 1st semester if I wanted to graduate from the program. After huffing and puffing about it, I decided it was in my best interest to suck it up and deal with it. After registering for semester 1 classes all over again, I passed all the classes with grades well above the required minimum.

Today (2nd semester, almost halfway through)- I was informed that the life of a credit in the program is being set to 7 years. After hearing this, I went to the registrars office to inquire about my situation. I was informed that the change is being applied (specifically) because of my situation. Yes, I was the reason this policy was being changed. Naturally, the registrar was dodging my questions and referred me to the dean, who I will be speaking to soon.

So here I am, with duplicate credits for all of my 1st semester classes, working on a second set of 2nd semester credits, and the financial debt of someone who would have already graduated from the program.

I really doubt the school is going to reimburse me any money. I feel that my time and a significant amount of money have been wasted. If the meeting with the dean doesn't end well, do I have a platform for a lawsuit? Are there any other courses of action?

If there are any more details I should provide, please let me know.

Thanks for clicking. My apologies for venting on the internet, I just had no idea where else to go. In fact, I should be studying for tomorrow's exam.



I am a upperclassman in college who has been suicidal since high school. This is likely due to the fact that I suffer from depression yet there are so many impeding factors in my life that are dragging me down by the neck.



A lot of people refer to college as the best time of their lives yet I am completely wasting it. Every weekend I am by myself in my room wasting time on the internet, or doing homework. I do not have a social life and I am so socially stunted that I do not know how to build one.



Academically, I am performing well for the most part. Unfortunately, I managed to get three WDs on my transcript because I refused to play the stupid game putting up with classes taught by terrible professors. I refused to stay in a place where the professors were of no help. I attempted a second STEM major along with my current STEM major because my school offers a program where I would have gone to an IVY League school for two years after my senior year. I gave up on the program during my second semester in it leaving me feeling like a complete failure.



Sleeping is difficult for me. Recently it has become easier but before it took such an incredibly long time for me to fall asleep. At one point I resorted to hitting my head against the wall to make myself ""sleepy.""



I'm undocumented in the USA. Because of certain circumstances, I cannot renew my DACA and will begin accruing illegal time when March roles around. I lived in this country for 17 years and there is the danger I will be kicked out of my home. My parents are undocumented too. If they get caught and deported while I'm at college (which is in a different state) there will be no one left at home to take care of little siblings who are American born citizens.



Because I am undocumented at a conservative college, a lot of students publicly hate immigrants like me though they do not know of my status. This impedes against me going out to socialize. I can't go to parties because I cannot enjoy the activities without fear of getting caught, arrested, and deported because I am underage.



One way to solve my immigrant status would be to get sponsorship. I have been interning at a prestigious company for two summers now and have been offered a third internship. I was hoping to do well enough at this internship to get hired and later become sponsored but because my DACA is expiring, I will be unable work in the USA by summertime.


I am infatuated with an undocumented girl. I cannot even attempt to build a romantic relationship with her because marriage is another way to attain a pathway to citizenship. I do NOT want to get married for papers but for love. It just sucks that I have to force myself to lose my infatuation with this girl and move one so I can eventually marry an American citizen assuming I can find someone desperate enough to marry me.


My life is a soap opera cliche. Turns out I have a half-sibling. I found out about this sibling after I started college. One parent cheated on the other and they were born. It is possible my cheating parent is sending them money to attend the most expensive university in my home country while they study for a fucking COMMUNICATIONS major.



Therapy isn't helping. I'm currently on another type of antidepressants because the last ones failed. My counselor constantly tells me about the plethora of positive qualities I possess ranging from intelligence to empathy. Yet every time I feel an iota of hope or positivity, it quickly evaporates.



I have this unnatural fear that I will be forgotten when I die. This keeps me from trying anything because I keep reverting to the same thought of ""What's the point?""



To conclude, I am so fucking scared of everything. I do not know what my future brings if it will actually bring anything at all. I find myself miserable in my home state, my college state, and I know I will be miserable in my home country if I get deported. Is there any advice or hope that someone can offer without repeating the same asinine rhetoric that gets tossed around?"

I have recently been extended an offer to work as an intern for a large defense contractor during the school year, and through the summer of 2018. This company is a huge player in the cyber field, it would be great to have my foot in the door here, and they might even let me acquire a US security clearance. However, my duties will mostly be basic data entry and assistance in various tasks throughout their operations, things that are not super relevant to things like IT infrastructure and cyber security, fields I would like to get into once I've graduated from school.


My question for you all is this: Do you think that waiting on this offer to find something more relevant to IT would be a good idea? As I said, it would be great to get my foot in the door at a big defense contractor like this, but at the same time I think it would be advantageous to keep my options open. I'd rather have an internship actually related to IT rather than just basic data entry and things like that, but of course there's no guarantee that I will receive an offer from somewhere else. It's definitely a tough decision. 


Also, as a note: Pay and things like that aren't super relevant to me at this point. The pay is competitive with other companies and housing/travel is something I will not have to worry about. I'm mostly concerned about the impact that accepting a job like this may have on my resume, and what opportunities I may be passing up by accepting an offer so early on.

2 of the companies asked to solve the data structure question where i had the right logic but i could not present in a clean code.(because i am not very fluent with Java/ python in programming terms but i am comfortable with scripting) 

other 2 asked a ton of theoretical questions (react vs angular architecture/EC2 importance/importance of closure in JS) where I knew the concepts but I could not explain them.

I have a B.S. already though in a different field entirely, and I'm a post-bacc. I have taken up to Calc III about a decade ago, and I've taken physics twice, and aced it each time, (though not calc based physics).

I've taught physical science, circuits, and engineering as a full-time teacher for nearly 6 years and did a damn good job of it, even winning awards.

I decided to go back to school to get my degree in electrical engineering and I thought it wouldn't be too bad at all considering how much I've matured and learned in the past decade since my last degree. 

It's only the second week and I feel like I'm drowning. I'm getting everything done, but just barely. I have really good time-management, but still find myself working more than 12 hour days, and I haven't even started my part-time job yet.

I'm taking physics 1 and calc 1, and ece 101, and I feel like I'm already lost in some of the classes. We're on a quarter system so everything feels like it goes by so fast.

I'm taking part in clubs, working at different areas on campus, and have long-term goals to get research experience and internships, but it feels like everyone I encounter in my department is so far ahead of me and knows so much more than I do. Even in my ECE 101 class, I feel like half the class already knows everything about circuits and stuff and I'm just inordinately stupid or something.

I'm not going to quit, because that would be stupid, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't feeling completely overwhelmed and I feel like my long-term goals are slipping away.

Did your first year go like this? If so does it get better? I don't remember my first degree being this overwhelming, though I don't know if that's just because I didn't care as much then as I do now about excelling in my academic career."

I have a Bachelor's degree that isn't CS but more like several courses where you learn the basics of several programming languages, then it's up to you to figure the rest out. So instead of picking up internships at large companies or hitting up career fairs, my first job search experience after graduation was go to the software jobs section on Craigslist and pick from a couple of companies there. 

But even after I stopped using CL for jobs a long time ago, the quality of companies and jobs didn't seem to get better over time. 

I once explained the situation to a former co-worker and he told it to me like this: ""you're a hired gun"". That is, I get job offers only to fix up bad messes, work on side projects their main employees don't have time for, or otherwise stay for one project, rather than to keep me around for the long haul. However, I don't want to be that guy anymore. I don't want to work for a places that don't have anyone from above to give technical direction, that don't automate their testing, that don't have formal build processes in general. As it turns out, I'm mediocre at that. I need my own technical guidance.

And what make that situation worse is I'm in a ""learning burnout"" of sorts. Spending my own time to learn the new tools and frameworks is taking a toll on me. I wouldn't mind doing this on company time, but local companies where I live expect you to know all the stuff beforehand. There was hardly anyone technical to learn from at the places I worked for.

I need to find work at a larger company that has a good selection of developers, that can talk shop all day and teach me what I've been doing wrong that I have to catch up on. My resume gets rejected so that needs work first. I'm not applying to the best of the best in the tech hubs, just larger corporations in my local area. Some of them are all tech and some are in other industries, but with a development team still. 

None of the types of places, where I'm supposed to go to grow as a developer, don't respond to my resume. All the jobs in there are contract jobs, except for ""Jr. Programmer"". I'll put my anonymized resume out there, as it's going to be important for this thread: https://i.imgur.com/kXxAaNA.png"

4)  ML engineer / data scientist

NOTE:  Not really interested in Computer Security or Low-level stuff

My concern about ""Programming Language Paradigms"" is that it won't go enough into depth into anything for the semester, and I already have some exposure to FP (however, don't know logic or ""data-driven"" programming).  Generally interesting topic to me though.  My concern about ""Computer Networking"" is that it will be TOO dense (shouldn't overload my course load), and overkill knowledge for any of the four categories above.  And I'm not particularly interested in the topic.  I do have to say though, gaining this knowledge could be VERY useful and help decipher all these cryptic error messages I would repeatedly get at my internship when simply trying to set up certain things.

If it does not, please do let me know and i will move it to the appropriate thread.

&amp;nbsp;

4 years ago, for financial reasons, I had to withdraw from my university.  I was a sophomore moving onto my junior year with decent GPA (at least for my standards, 3.7).  I am a business major for a fairly well known university in the states.  I’m an out-of-state student, so my tuition was off the charts (US Citizen living in another country, b/c my family lives/works there).  Since withdrawing, I moved back home and started to work in marketing - my parents knew people so they just let me work.  Started as an intern and worked for the sake of making money.   I’ve saved up quite a bit of money and have invested my money into online courses.  I was always curious about coding so i took a few coding classes and i felt like it was something i would like to get deeply into.  As a business major, I have border-line decided that i want to switch majors to computer science and switch universities as well. 


&amp;nbsp;



As i have worked for 3+ years, I have saved up about $25,000.  At this point, i’m more concerned about graduating than attending a big name school.  Of course it would be the best if i could find a middle ground - a school that is decently known and affordable.  


&amp;nbsp;


I’ve searched around and asked acquaintances, and have heard good thing about taking online courses to get a degree, or apply to a university that proves online courses.  I’ve looked into a school called ‘SMC (Santa Monica College) which was affordable AND provides online courses - which means that i could continue to work and take the classes online in my off-time.  Furthermore, they have a program that allows there students to transfer to UC schools depending on the student’s status - GPA and what not.  This program caught my eye, as I know that UC Berkley has a well-known computer science program, and at the moment, I guess i’m pretty confident that with my GPA from my previous university, transferring into Berkley will be possible.  


&amp;nbsp;


But the catch is, due to the financial difficulties when i was attending university, i have yet to pay off my last semester there.  I owe the school about $20,000.  Furthermore, i would need to pay that amount off in order for me to received my transcript, which i would need if i was to transfer schools.  


&amp;nbsp;


I have a few questions that i would like to ask the community and any insight or answer will be greatly appreciated, really.


&amp;nbsp;


As mentioned above, I want to transfer schools/majors.  If i do, i would need to take entry level courses (pre-requisites) for a computer science major.  Which basically means i have to take freshman/sophomore level classes again.  Would it be better to apply to SMC (or other suggested universities) as a freshman? or as a transfer student with my previous transcript.  IF so, this would mean that i would have to pay off the $20,000 i owe to my previous university.  Don’t get me wrong, i definitely plan on paying back the money, but i’m not sure if right now is the time to pay it off…  


&amp;nbsp;


If i apply to SMC (or other universities) as a freshman, I would have more money saved up and could potentially transfer into another school with more money on my back (to pay for tuition then….)


&amp;nbsp;


I have friends that have attended SMC and have transferred into well known UC schools - Davis, Berkley, LA - and even USC.  One side of me is telling me to apply so SMC and the other side is telling me to finish off the 2 years at my previous school.  


&amp;nbsp;


Besides SMC, i have looked into other universities that provide online courses - like Florida University - which is also apparently very well known, but the tuition is similar to that of my previous university to it isn’t that high on my ‘would like to go to this school list’


&amp;nbsp;


If you all have some advice, university/program suggestions, or any other general knowledge that may be helpful to my situation, it would mean  a lot to me.


&amp;nbsp;


Thank you for reading and wish you all the best :)


&amp;nbsp;


**TLDR**: Business major that had to withdraw from university b/c no money.  Good GPA (3.7), but no transcript b/c i don’t have money to pay off my tuition.  Want to switch majors to computer science.  Don’t know if i should apply as a freshman to a new school or pay off my debt to my previous school and apply as a transfer with my good GPA.  Also don’t know what schools to transfer to.  Im poor and want to finish college.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

For the past year I've talked with my mom about going to College A because it's close to home, next to an area with a lot of opportunities for internships and jobs, etc. etc. College B is a larger, more well known school that we haven't really talked about but I've always kept in the back of my mind.

But for the past few months, I've been looking at College B more often because I've always appreciated the college town right next to it, the overall look and feel of the college, student life, and the variety of clubs they have at College B. Comparatively, College A is really small and has not a lot going on in terms of student life from what I've seen, and due to it being built in the '50s - '60s, all of the older buildings have little to no windows, making it feel really lifeless and kinda draining. I feel as if these are ridiculous reasons, but if both me and my family are going to be investing tons of money into this college I want to make sure it's worth the investment.

As a result, my mom has stuck adamantly to College A because of the educational value and different opportunities they have, and I'm rooting for College B because I want to go to a school that has more than just academics going on. Her reasons alongside the educational value are that she doesn't want me being ""tempted to sin"" and ""going down the wrong path"" (Family is heavily Mormon, so this being brought up was inevitable). My issues with College A are the lack of student life (Relative to College B), the atmosphere of the campus, and to be honest, how close to home it is. I want to be able to live on my own during the school year, farther away from home. I want to experience living on my own, and feel as if I won't really have that kind of experience when College A is about a 45 minute drive from my home, where my mom can keep every little tab on me and has control over me and my actions.

I just want some advice as to what I should do, and how I can approach this situation the next time it comes up because this last time ended in an argument, and I'd much prefer to stay away from that. Thank you guys in advance, and sorry for the really long post.

**tl;dr - Argued with mom about what college to go to, and now in need of help trying to convince her that the college I want to go to isn't the physical representation of hell and that the education there is as good as the education at the college she wants me to go to.** "

74iavo,4,2017-10-05,"I am 34, I can't get hired, and I need your advice.",JobHuntThrowAway35,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/74iavo/i_am_34_i_cant_get_hired_and_i_need_your_advice/,"**Dear Reddit,** 

I am a 34-year-old male from Washington DC with an atypical resume. After one full year of job hunting and almost 400 tailored applications, I have failed to secure a single interview—let alone an internship or job. I am disheartened and immensely frustrated. 

I think there are a number of structural factors causing hiring managers to pass on me. I understand why these factors may raise concerns among potential employers, and I have sought to preemptively address and minimize those concerns. It’s not working, so I’m turning to you for advice. 

First, I think you need to know a little bit about my background. I have absolutely made some problematic career choices, but to understand how I got here you need to know where I came from. It’s a long story but directly relevant to my current situation. If you make it to the end, I’ll be thankful and sincerely appreciative.   

I grew up in a rural northern town, in an unfinished house that my father and pregnant mother built with their own hands. It had a dirt-floor basement, a plastic ceiling separating the main floor and the loft, exposed fiberglass insulation lining the inside halls, and I assure you the electrical wiring was not up to code. My father, who was a very talented but only semi-employed carpenter, graduated from high school. My mother had only a ninth-grade education, having given birth to my sister when she was 14. Needless to say, our family lacked access to social capital. 

My parents did not send me to school. Technically, I was homeschooled. That’s a mischaracterization, though; I received essentially no formal education. My “homeschooling” was not a product of the typical religious objections—my dad (who passed away when I was 15) had serious social anxiety and was, frankly, just a weirdo. So, I was largely left to my own devices. I grew up playing by myself in the woods behind our house, watching network TV (we didn’t have cable back then), and playing Nintendo. I didn’t have friends, but I am fortunate that I was athletic and constantly participated in organized sports from an early age; this provided important social interaction, and also helped me built a sense of self-worth.

It goes without saying that my parents’ decision to keep me out of school was horrendously irresponsible. I have serious concerns about the efficacy of homeschooling in general, but there are no excuses for consciously depriving your child of a quality education. I do not mean to speak ill of my parents, but I consider this decision passively abusive. Somehow, though, I turned out OK. I cannot explain why I am not extremely dumb. I consider myself very, very lucky. 

Fast forward a few years. I earned my GED at the age of 19. I have no idea how I passed the test, although I did so in the 95th percentile in each of the four segments. Having never gone to school, college was not a palpable thing for me. I knew it existed, but I didn’t really know what it was in practical terms. I had certainly never heard of community college, and had no plans to seek higher education. Long story short, I moved to Nashville to try to be a country music songwriter. (#ItDidntWorkOut.) 

After failing in Nashville (frankly, I probably quit too early and should have stuck it out), I moved back home with my mother. I was 21, and for some reason that I still don’t understand, my aunt—who had gone to college but with whom I had essentially no relationship—sent me an email one day and basically scared me into visiting the local community college and signing up for classes. I don’t remember exactly what she said, except that this was a crucial step if I wanted to make my life better. And I don’t really know why I did it—I guess I just had nothing else going on. I will forever be thankful for that email. I owe my aunt everything. 

I did visit that community college and I did enroll. And I found that I was shockingly good at academics. Of course, I had no math skills and had to start at pre-algebra, but I found that I was able to learn and enjoyed doing so. Somehow, my reading comprehension and writing were well above-average. I went on to earn my A.A. with a perfect GPA, and saw myself in a completely different light. It was the first time I felt good at something besides sports, and the first time I felt like a normal member of society. 

Of course, I was already 22 when I earned that Associate’s degree. And as you know, by that time, most kids are graduating with their Bachelor’s, and already have one or more internships under their belts. This is especially true for kids who went to excellent high schools, who grew up in families with lots of social capital. At 22, I didn’t even really know what professions existed in the world, and certainly didn’t think most of them were open to me. The thought that I might be a lawyer, or work for the government, or basically do anything that required me to wear a suit… it just wasn’t something I could even visualize. 

It was difficult, both academically and personally, to transition from community college to university. I wanted to move out of state for a variety of reasons, but had trouble sticking to a decision. As a result, I bounced. A lot. I ended up attending four different universities and changing majors four times before finally earning my first B.A., in English, in 2007 at the age of 25. In some ways, I don’t regret this lack of commitment. I think it’s a direct result of having to feel my way through everything, and experience everything for the first time. How could I have possibly known what I was interested in, or what I was good at, or what I wanted to do? It’s like my development arc was delayed by ten years. 

I graduated in December 2007. The great recession. A bad time to be an English major applying for jobs. But let’s be honest, I still had no idea what I would even do. I wanted to travel, so I did something crazy—something that I consider one of the best decisions of my life, but something that also set me on the problematic path on which I now find myself. I decided to go coach baseball in Europe. I went on an internet forum and found a job, had a skype interview, and got on a plane. 

It was great. It was the beginning of becoming the person that I am today. I spent three years there, working and traveling, and having my eyes opened to different perspectives. Watching the recession develop, and watching the fight over health care—all from a foreign vantage point—caused me to have a political awakening, and to realize what I cared about the most wasn’t baseball or literature, but public policy.

I had a lot of success in Europe and a lot of failures. In other words, I grew. On one of my trips back home, I met a girl. A few months later, she was on a plane with me back to Europe. And a couple of years after that, we were married. Talk about a whirlwind.

She was younger than me, from a middle-class family. Not only had she not attended college, her parents actively discouraged her from doing so; they more or less forced her to become a hair stylist. But she was and is smart as a whip; smarter than me, for sure. I don’t know why her parents didn’t see it, but I did. And after a while, she started to see it too. And she started to become intellectually curious, and to grow unsatisfied with the role that was handed to her. She wanted to go to college, and I wanted to go back to college. So, we packed up and came home.

That was 2010 and there still weren’t many jobs. While I was coaching, I was keenly aware that baseball wasn’t going to be a “forever” thing for me; I felt lucky to have the job, but knew I didn’t have the knowledge or skillset to climb high up the ladder in the States—and European leagues pay next to nothing. I hadn’t played in college or the pros, which makes it extremely tough to crack the ranks as a coach. So, during that time, I had started to thread some other needles. 

While I was in Europe, I parlayed my time in Nashville into a gig as freelance music journalist and editor. I had significant success, scoring cover stories for a variety of national print publications, as well as getting placement in alt-weeklies all over the country. To date, I’ve interviewed 15 Grammy-winning artists. I also worked as the managing editor of a highly influential online music publication, a role in which I was responsible for hiring and managing a team of about a dozen paid writers. 

I had also been helping my younger brother with his eBay business. He was into collectible card games, and I would help him manage his listings. I had done some random eBay work during “high school,” and could see that his business was good and growing. 

Some of you probably know this, but writing doesn’t pay much these days. One time, I spent two weeks interviewing and writing a cover story feature on a world-famous artist whom you would definitely know, and earned $500. That’s not sustainable. When my wife and I got back to the states and started going to school, we knew we needed to earn more money than that. She started waiting tables, and I took over my brother’s eBay business. 

The eBay business exploded. We went from a handful of orders every day to 500 in the span of a year; it became almost more than I could handle, and I made the decision to slow down my progress towards my second degree. This allowed my wife to work less, and to eventually not work at all. I wanted to give her the opportunity to focus on school and tap into her full potential, and thought that investing myself into the business during that time would lead us to a better and more stable financial future. But there were a number of problems with that decision. 

First of all, I was already 28 when I took over the business. But I had no real professional experience to put on my resume. Because of my background, I didn’t understand at this time why that was a problem—I didn’t know that it was harder to get hired if you’ve been out of the workforce for a while, or that it was harder to get hired if you were older. But I also wasn’t actually working in the field I wanted to be in; I wasn’t networking, or doing anything that would position me to get where I wanted to go. For some reason, I thought that at some point I would just be able to flip a switch and jump tracks. So for five years, I spent almost every waking moment building that business and supporting my wife’s academic pursuits. I did get my second B.A. in PoliSci and International Relations, and I did very well. But I didn’t join any organizations or do any internships. Having never applied for any type of professional work, I didn’t know how important networking was, and was under the erroneous assumption that GPA mattered. 

Oh, I did do one thing in my field during this time—I managed a Congressional campaign. I went well, though we didn’t win. It was valuable experience, and I also thought this would matter when applying for future positions. 

Fast forward again. My wife graduated from a Top 10 public university with degrees in both PoliSci and International Relations. In fact, she graduated with honors. We move to DC (Jan 2016), and she promptly secured a Hill internship, then an organizing job with one of the presidential campaigns, and then a job with a member of Congress—where she now works. 

Me, on the other hand? Nothing. She and I have almost the exact same academic profile. But despite the fact that she was a non-traditional student who graduated when she was older than most, her resume was linear and didn’t include the weird gaps and strange detours that mine does. At each stage of my life, I made the decisions that seemed best at the time based on the information that I had. In general, they turned out OK. I’m happy with, and proud of, the person that I am. I also know that I am exceedingly capable—I’ve been successful at everything I’ve ever done. 

But when we moved here, I had to wind down our business. We couldn’t afford to run it here, and it wasn’t what I wanted to do. My plan was to use our savings while we were job hunting. I never imagined it would take this long. And now, that savings is gone. 

I don’t know what to do. I started out applying for positions I want—Hill internships, entry-level positions with NGOs or international organizations. I studied democracy building and conflict resolution, and hoped to work in something related to those topics. But I’ve been unable to secure even the most basic work in those organizations. 

So, I started applying for things that weren’t what I wanted to do, but which aligned more obviously with my skills and experience. For example, I am a WordPress expert with seven years of daily professional use of the software. When I apply for positions such as “web content manager,” which specifically cite WordPress experience as a key attribute for potential candidates, I’m able to express in clear terms how I worked with the software in previous positons. Most of the time, I also possess every other requested skill. But I never get an interview. 

Likewise, I have seven years of professional communications experience with the aforementioned portfolio of clips in major publications. But I can’t get an interview for anything in the comms arena—not journalism jobs, not public relations or public affairs jobs, not even an unpaid press internship.

I’ve applied for jobs that I am directly and verifiably qualified for; no response. I’ve swallowed my pride and applied for retail jobs to hold me over until I find something better; no response. I’ve applied for jobs that I thought I’m capable of doing well, but which are a stretch based my experience; no response. I have tried to sell computers at BestBuy—it was a no. I have tried to serve food a CAVA—it was a no. I have reached out to temp agencies—they don’t even respond. 

A couple of weeks ago, I applied for an internship and heard nothing. I followed up, and heard nothing. A couple of weeks later, I got an email asking me if I wanted to schedule a time to interview. I replied swiftly and then heard nothing. I waited a week and followed up, and still heard nothing. It's exasperating.

So, it's difficult to tell this story. It's long, and meandering. This post (essay?) didn’t turn out as clear as I had hoped. But I think you understand the problem. 

Here are the structural factors that I have identified but don’t know how to get over: 

1. At 34-years-old, I should be a mid-level professional—people wonder why I’m not. 

2. Entry-level positions are hired out of internships; I can’t get an internship because of my age.

3. Hiring a 34-year-old for an entry-level positon is a high risk-to-reward proposition.

4. People read my resume without this background information and it looks flaky.
 
5. Even if I could convince someone I have the skills to succeed in a non-entry-level role, it’s impossible to hire me for that position over someone with a more traditional resume and more directly relevant experience.

6. It doesn’t actually matter how capable I am; most people who are interviewing candidates are looking for someone who fits certain stereotypes; they have an image of what kind of person they want, and I am never, ever, not even in a million years, going to match that image.  

7. There’s no direct linkage between any of the things I’ve done, and no linkage between those things and what I’m trying to do now. 

I have no idea how to convince people that I am a value-added candidate--that hiring me can pay enough in dividends to justify the risk. 

If you read all this, you’re the literal best. "

We went through Big O notation in my discrete class, but that's about all I know about the algorithmic side of things...I'm just not that far along in school yet. As such, I feel woefully unprepared and am certain I will bomb the phone screen. Also, the interview would be in about a week and a half and, looking at the information they sent me, there is no hope of getting up to speed.

On one hand, I would appreciate getting the interview experience in a live setting. On the other hand, I feel like my knowledge base is not at the level expected for the company, and having been on the other side of the table when interviewing candidates from my prior career, I know how much it sucks to have your time wasted by someone unqualified. I also don't want to burn a bridge with the company when I could be competitive with more time/experience (I have a very good math/science GPA so far).

I'm enrolled in 4 courses at the moment, AI &amp; Pattern Recognition, Parallel and Distributed Computing, Computer Modeling and Graphics, and Software Engineering.

I'm also an intern on a build team at a large software company where generally work 20 hours a week during the semester, but I'm allowed to go up to 40 as my schedule dictates. I should also mention my BS is actually in computational physics so I've got some fundamental courses (architecture, compilers, OS) missing which I may or may not end up having time to take, depending on when I propose my thesis project.

While I'm having a hard time deciding the exact sub-field I'd like to do my thesis project on (research and application are also both acceptable), I'm looking to get more into product development or some sort of simulation based programming as opposed to a dev-ops like role. Admittedly I'm also interested in AI but I'm nervous a PhD would really be necessary for a role in that field. I am having my time pushed to the limit and I'm a little concerned about being spread thin enough where my grades may suffer, so I'd kind of like to reassess priorities and am curious for input from this subreddit. 

Anybody have any insight on what their workload was like in grad school or otherwise and how it turned out? Would it be an unwise decision to drop one of my electives? At this point in the semester it would be recorded on my transcript as a withdrawal and not effect my GPA."

I have a return offer from a company and it expires on Oct 6. The company is one of the credit card businesses. I liked my internship and I wouldn't mind working there full time. However, I would like to explore other companies while I have the chance as a junior.

I spoke with the company on extending the deadline but it doesn't seem like I can do it. From what I gathered, their program for internships is small so they have to plan far in advance.

Right now, I am applying to the big tech companies. I asked Google on their time frame and they said it would take 6-8 weeks. I don't think I can get that much of an extension with the company.

I live in an at-will state so I can renege the offer. However, I don't want to renege on the offer because I would be interested in a full time position there.

I am trying to make my first side project to improve my resume and hopefully be able to get an internship. The problem I am facing is that whenever I start on side projects, such as Unity or Android Studio, I have to know how these softwares work, which is natural I assume. However, I feel like all I am doing really is just following tutorials and not contributing anything substantial to the project (like actual coding). From what I hear, if I put some kind of side project on my resume, I should be able to explain what I wrote, so if I just blindly follow the tutorials, wouldn't it pose problems later if I am unable to answer questions about my work?

Do you have any project ideas that minimize tutorial aspect of things and maximize the programming parts? (And hopefully look impressive on resume?)

Thank you. I hope it wasn't a stupid question."

I'm a freshman CmpE student and I'm looking at my future and what I'm planning on doing. I don't think I'll know enough to get a solid internship freshman year, however I think it's very possible that I could get one sophomore and junior year, hopefully setting myself up to get a solid job right out of college.

I'm thinking that in order to do this I'll have to get a solid resume built up, and right now mine is significantly lacking. I'm hoping to get a 4.0 atleast freshman year, and I'd like to supplement my resume with some projects and some CS related groups at my college. 

What sort of projects would I do, and what would I put on my resume? Ideally I'm looking for solo projects, as I'll have some group ones that I'll do with my cs groups.

If you need any more info please let me know! Thanks a ton!"

I've excelled here in the past and liked it, so I thought it would be a good idea to return here for another semester. However, what I didn't realize is that I'm pretty much doing the same job (I have more responsibilities but I'm not learning too many new things).

All in all, I feel like I'm wasting my time here and regret not seeking out other opportunities while I had the chance. My biggest fear is that while I've had a decent amount of work experience (3 semesters of internships) none of them are that related to the field I want to get into. I know it's probably annoying to hear about a young kid who has a lot of time to figure things out complain, but this is the type of thing that is making me crazy anxious and resent where I currently work (I have about 2 months left).

I am a 1st year PhD student in Machine Learning (more specifically recommendation systems and graph-based models) at a top 10 school for my program. To be blunt, I am having a miserable time. I thought I would enjoy the additional challenge and opportunity to learn more about a field i think is interesting, in addition to getting to do more research. However, I have been having second thoughts given the expectations of working 24/7 (or rather, this is the only way to keep up), complete lack of social interaction (grad students don't seem to care as much, many international students), and truthfully the feeling that research becomes just as monotonous as some of the engineering work I was trying to avoid, just much harder. I am guaranteed funding for at least 4 years (this year being a fellowship which is quite nice) and have the possibility of obtaining a master's in 2-2.5 years on the way to a PhD. 


Currently, my plan is to try to survive until I get my master's and then leave, but I was curious about whether even that is worth it. It seems like a ""free"" (not including potential income loss) master's is worth it, especially when my field of interest in Machine Learning which is quite math/theory based (unless you're just plugging into black boxe frameworks which is probably pretty common) but maybe in CS it really doesn't matter if you have relevant projects (or publications.)


For some background into how i got into this mess, I am 22 and graduated with a BS in CSE summa cum laude this past Spring with, as far as research goes, 1 publication in a good journal, 1 manuscript, and some random awards. I was president of my university's chapter of ACM and have had internships with Google and another top company (trying not to dox myself too hard here...). The internships were in backend web dev and Android respectively, so since my interest has shifted towards ML/Data Science/Mining, it seemed like grad school would be a solid way to pivot, and since i was able to get into funded PhD programs and enjoyed doing research in undergrad, it seemed like a good idea, but I am definitely struggling hard. Any thoughts, experiences, or comments are appreciated!

tl;dr: age 22, graduated with a BS in CSE, immediately started a PhD in Machine Learning, it is extremely difficult, feeling miserable, should I drop out and get a random swe job now, try to stick it out and finish a ""free"" master's to pivot into more ML-centric roles with possibly higher upward mobility, or should I give this PhD a second chance and wait before making any kind of decision.

I have just graduated from a top UC in California, with an Econ Major and a Stats Minor. I just realized that I love data, and math and wants to be a data scientist. Also I really like London as it is a very cool city with many things I culturally identify with. So I plan to go to graduate schools there for Statistics or Data Science. The school I am most interested in is University College London. But I am worried about my prospects. Here is my current situation:

- GPA: My General GPA is 3.45, but the GPA for my Stats Minor classes is about 3.7 ish (I hope this is my saving grace). The biggest issue with this is that I got a C in a Linear Algebra class I took last Fall. But after this, the grades in my Upper Division Statistics class has been quite good, hence the high Stats GPA. With these numbers do I have a good chance to get in to say University College London MSc taught programmes for Statistics? I heard that I should emphasize the upward trend in my GPA in my personal statement to divert the attention away from my bad grade? Also, I was also a transfer student from a California community college, does the GPA of my community college being taken into account? ( Note: The GPA numbers I mentioned above is only my UC's GPA)

- GRE: most of the programs in London does not require GREs scores. But should I still take the GRE to supplement the application ? Or the schools will not even look at it? I am not even sure they allow submission of GRE scores for programs that don't require it. So if I take the GRE, the only way to let them know is through my personal statement, is it advisable to do so? One last thing is that, since applications are opening very soon, the taking of the GRE will at least delay my application for  2 months since I need time to prep and take and get the scores back, is it worth it to do so because the schools are doing rolling admissions?

- References: This I think is the biggest issue for me. The programs at University College London requires 2 references, 2 academics or 1 academics and 1 professional. I have a professional reference already due to the internship I am currently having. But for the academic reference it is kind of hard for me to get from my Stats professors due to the fact that the classes is so short, so I did not have enough time to build rapport with any of them. I already asked one of my professor but it does not seem promising. Is there any tips to securing references with professors that you don't know too well so that they are not annoyed? I understand that the reference, if I managed to secure one, might not be the most stellar in my situation, but I have come to accept this fact. This a very important piece in the application, if I don't have this, then my application will not be completed at all. Please help!

Thank you all for your time. I would really appreciate any advices, anything at all. Again, please help!

74prpu,2,2017-10-06,Jobs and Internships??,life_of_distraction,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/74prpu/jobs_and_internships/,"I see this all the time here and I'm curious for the simple fact I think I may be missing something.

All too often I see on this board something along the lines of “Holy shit.  I'm graduating in 6 months and have no reverent work experience or internship in my major.  How fucked am I?”

My question, if you guys can answer-

It seems like a lot of you expect internships to be handed to you.  Which isn't always the case.  I get it.  Even at my college, internships are a hit and miss.  Even a work study is a hit and miss.  So, if for some reason you crap out on the internship-

WHY..WHY for the love of god WHY are you not going out during the summer months between freshman and senior year-or even during the school year- to a temp agency and saying “This is my major.  I'm a college student at (insert college name here) and I can only work (insert max hours here.) I need work experience in (insert field here) can you help me?”

WHY, oh WHY if you crap out on the part-time job, are you guys not thinking about going volunteering somewhere at some nonprofit?  Nonprofits, at least in my area, can never seem to get enough help.  Even if it's packing boxes of hygiene products for homeless folks.  If you are a criminal justice major and don't want to be a police officer, why aren't you going to some halfway houses, talking to them about volunteering your time to help the residents transition back into the community?  If your a computer science/computer programming major, and bust out on an internship, why aren't you going to a nonprofit and asking if your skills can help out 10 hours a week?  Why aren't you going to the boy scouts/girl scouts/scouting groups and helping the kids build a killer robot?  If your a biology major-volunteer with a group or start a group where one or two Saturdays a month you go clean up trash from local streams and park trails and spin that volunteering time as ensuring the local wildlife remained safe and you educated the public on the dangers of trash in local streams?

I'm a healthcare management major, and I to missed the boat on internships.  My college well..when it comes to my major, internships are few (maybe 5 or 6 slots open a semester) and 45 or so students fighting over them.  I wasn't even going to try and went to the local in-home hospice center on my own.  I told them I was looking to volunteer, and I had an undergrad certificate in human resources and currently employed as a home care aid, am majoring in Healthcare Management and can do about 8-10 hours a week.  I spend about 3-4 hours a week doing data entry for them and 4-6 hours a week walking families through the process of setting up hospice care.  Granted, it's not paid BUT when I do graduate, I can put down I have some experience in Healthcare Case management.  

From my HR point of view, putting down you volunteered 15 hours a month helping 12-year-old boys build killer robots and write simple computer programs is better than saying I have zero work experience in computer programming or IT.

Why don't more people do what I've suggested??  Or is it a case of you'll just that damn lazy and want shit handed to you?"

&gt;I've been greatly enjoying my time at Google as an intern and I'm very excited to have received an offer for a full time position. However, I'm currently going through the pre-hire process with (local-rival-company) and a few other companies at this time. Choosing where to work for the years to come is a big decision and I want to pick the company that is right for me. Before starting full time at Google in May, I will already have a full year of internship experience in Google's (X) department and I believe this experience will result in me developing skills specific to Google and gaining a better understanding of the tools used by the (X) department as well as the (X) code-base itself. For these reasons, I believe that I am of worth more value to Google than a typical new graduate.

&gt;While I am still willing to consider Google's offer as it is, I would be willing to turn down all other companies and accept Google's offer today if the annual salary could be increased from $69,000 to $75,000. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience as I am very excited at the possibility of solidifying my position at Google.

&gt;Best regards,

Should I mention the name of the local rival company specifically? Should anything else be changed?

Things. Are. Changing. Fast.

I'm 36 years old and started my Sysadmin days as an Intern of Systems Administration at 19 years old. I've been doing this in some capacity or another for the past 17 years. Lately, I've really been seeing some major changes in the marketplace and have been pondering on how to stay relevant.

Through my tenure, being a SysAdmin was pretty standard. Patching, building hardware, deploying servers, managing networks, group policy, AD, Exchange etc.

Then things like VMWare came around and changed the game a bit...but not terribly so. Everything was on prem and my role felt secure.

The past year or so, I've been seeing the writing on the wall. The general Windows Admin role is heading for some major changes. Between Azure, AWS, containerization, O365 (and all other cloud platforms), hyper converged systems, things are changing in a way that I don't remember seeing in my past.

I just wanted to see if this was something I was ""feeling"" vs. it actually being a reality. It seems like, more than ever, you need to take a look at what you're doing and start honing your skills. Whether that is getting new certifications in Azure/AWS, looking at cutting down your on-site data infrastructure and removing SANs and most server hardware and replace it with things like Simplivity to cut costs and provide performance or migrating to O365 for small/mid sized businesses or even containerization for companies that do a lot of development.

For the first time in my life, I am starting to feel like the low-level admin roles are in for a real surprise. You used to be able to sneak in with a base knowledge of Windows and hardware and make a good salary. I am feeling like more and more those days are gone. No more building a local datacenter on traditional hardware and just going status quo, you need to adapt, educate and prove you're worth your mettle.

I'm just curious what other's have out there for an opinion. Is the industry changing in a major way that we've never seen before?"

Obviously I'd done my research beforehand and prepared my questions and talking points. But the entire time it just seemed like he was in a hurry to hang up and move on with his day. It's always a good idea to make an interview a 2-way conversation, but he basically deflected my prompts with one or two sentence answers and kept asking me pretty dull questions about what I'd done and what I'd learned, etc. Obviously those aren't bad, but they don't differentiate you from anyone else. Add onto that the amount of times we were talking over each other because we weren't face to face.....  

idk, this was just such a big interview, and though maybe I did ok.... it just doesn't feel like I made a connection or convinced him that I would make a really strong impact on his team. Especially for a big opportunity like this, reducing it down to a 30 minute conversation over the phone really sucks. I guess it's just a skill you have to work on.

74r3jz,328,2017-10-06,The Pumpkin Spice Massacre,xylonex,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/74r3jz/the_pumpkin_spice_massacre/,"One thing that I find hilarious about this time of year is that there’s no actual pumpkin in Pumpkin Spice. The spice combination itself is derivative of a pudding known as Pompkin. Pompkin itself does not contain Pumpkin either. Sometime in the 13th century someone called a pudding Pompkin and through eight-hundred years of a telephone game we have gas station coffee being sold for an extra dollar and being called Pumpkin Spice.

I must look like an antisocial prick when I break from the social norm and order a venti caramel macchiato. I’ll stand in line at the local Starbucks and wait to order the same cup of coffee I’ve ordered every weekday morning since I started working this crappy desk job. Everyone in front of me will order some variation of Pumpkin Spice only for the barista to look at me like I just dropped a turd in the coffee pot when I asked for something different. It’s always the same ordeal. Some kid with a liberal arts degree that ended up slinging caffeine to attempt to make a dent in their student debt ends up trying upsell me into a Pumpkin Spice Latte.

This year seems especially bad. Everyone is eating Pumpkin Spice cookies and dipping them in their Pumpkin Spice coffee only to walk around with Pumpkin Spice body spray as they burn Pumpkin Spice incense. It’s reached a point that I honestly can’t help but hope some catastrophic storm would simultaneously hit New Guinea and India leaving the world completely devoid of nutmeg.

I’m getting ahead of myself though.

So fifty years ago some idiot got it in his head that he was going to revitalize downtown by hollowing out some of the buildings that surrounded the old courthouse and turning them into an office complex. If you walk around on the sidewalk you’ll see a bunch of cute little shops and chain restaurants, but upstairs the entire block of buildings has been turned into a cubicle farm where I have ended up assigned to unit 355.

My desk and work area is a five-foot by five-foot box with just enough room for a desk, a few filing cabinets, and an office chair I am convinced was designed by the Marquis De Sade. Every weekday from nine in the morning until five at night I am expected to spend a third of each day sifting through expense reports and customer invoices looking for errors. Sounds boring, right? Wait until you’ve been doing it for ten years. Last year our employer realized my job could literally be handled by software and my job description went from actually looking for errors to making sure the software they dropped an easy million dollars on was actually doing its job.

I literally get paid to sit in my cubicle and watch a computer do the job I was hired to do. Even though I work in a position that could best be described as redundant, I am expected to spend all that time keeping a keen eye on the screen. Managers walk the rows of cubicles like prison guards looking for anyone dumb enough to check their Facebook or browse Reddit on the job. Even if they tried, the corporate firewall is more restrictive than an overprotective mother in a bad neighborhood.

My cubicle is of particular interest to these middle-managers who only exist to drain anything that resembles fun out of our lives. Last week someone sent out an email to the entire floor that said Milo, the manager with a heart of shit, had been using the five minute break he had after doing a walk through the cubicle farm to duck into the manager's bathroom to rub one off while reading a copy of Mein Kampf. As much as I’d like to take credit for the email itself, I had nothing to do with it. Still, seeing as I was the only office worker without a paper pumpkin tacked up to my cubicle, I was the first person they descended on.

If it wasn’t bad enough that I have to sit here and pretend I give a shit about these invoices and reports, I have no less than three failures of human evolution peering over my shoulder at any given time to make sure I’m not sending malicious emails.

It didn’t come out of nowhere.

Last month they opted to replace the half &amp; half creamer in the break room with this off-brand Pumpkin Spice they had bought in bulk. I can’t stand the stuff personally, so I opted to drink my coffee black. Well that didn’t sit well with the overlords so the following week they replaced the coffee itself with Pumpkin Spice. Realizing I couldn’t get an inch of headway with those control freaks, I opted to bring a thermos with me to work. When they finally banned outside food or drink from the office I ended up writing an open letter to management asking if we had recently been sponsored by the Nutmeg industry and if they’d like some actual work to be done alongside their Pumpkin Spice Enemas.

I received my first write-up in ten years and was told another infraction would result in my termination.
Even though I didn’t author the email that called out Milo, they made no secret about the fact they wanted me gone after that whole debacle. If that wasn’t bad enough, I had to spent eight hours a day surrounded by an office staff that had started consuming Nutmeg like it was going to enlarge their breasts and grow their dick by three sizes. I had reached the point personally that I was smuggling bottled water in my briefcase and refilling it in the bathroom sink.

This all came to a head when Debbie, a senior citizen who may well have been older than the building, decided she was going to have a party in the break room to commemorate her exit from the company after thirty-five years of employment.

I’ll let you guess what flavor the refreshments were.

Attendance was mandatory which meant I couldn’t use my lunch break to buy real food. I had to stand there among a hundred other hungry employees all clamoring to get a piece of pumpkin log or perhaps an orange and black cupcake. If it wasn’t bad enough that I was being forced to sit in this clusterfuck of forced socialization, it was casual Friday. Everyone had come to work dressed in their Halloween costumes. I tried so hard not to snicker when Milo showed up dressed like a soldier. All he was missing was the SS insignia and the armband.

Attendance was mandatory, but that didn’t mean I had to consume any of the junk they had provided. As the rest of the staff filed through the line to get their fix, I stayed to the back of the break room and sipped tap water from a coffee mug in an attempt to blend in. Thankfully, the whole ordeal was over within the hour and I was allowed to return to my desk. Milo goose stepped through the aisles with no appreciation for irony as I pretended to give a shit about the data being splayed across my screen in rapid succession.

Roughly an hour after lunch was when I noticed Sean, a guy who worked three units down the row from me stumbling through the aisle clutching his temples like he’d been kicked in the head. Before long I noticed that even Milo had gone from goose stepping about to standing in the corner clutching his head. I stood up and peered over the walls of my cubicle to see everyone in the office was grabbing their head in some form or fashion as their moans and groans erupted into a chorus of discomfort and pain.

Debbie was the first one to start laughing maniacally at her desk. I looked over to see she was using the stapler on her desk to fire staples into the air while giggling like a child who had just discovered they had toes. Sean stumbled over to the coffee pot and poured himself a drink while Milo staggered over to Debbie and shouted, “That’s enough Debbie!” Debbie kept laughing as she turned her stapler toward Milo and said, “Pew pew pew” as she fired the tiny pieces of metal in Milo’s general direction.

Milo responded by ripping the stapler out of her hands and drawing back to slam base of the stapler against her face. A random coworker started to scream as Milo repeatedly bashed the small piece of metal into Debbie’s skull. The screams erupted into a cacophony of fear as Sean turned around to throw his coffee in to Milo’s face. Milo responded by turning around and taking a bite out of Sean’s shoulder before chewing the chunk of flesh he’d torn away and swallowing with an honest to god smile on his face.

I had no desire to stick around for the clusterfuck that was developing and threw any personal belongings I thought important enough to keep into my briefcase before ducking down and moving down the aisle of cubicles. Annie, the girl in the cubicle directly adjacent to mine had taken to writhing around on the floor with a stuffed animal between her legs while repeatedly shouting, “Oh yeah, fuck me Tibbers!” I broke into a jog only to find Kyle, another middle manager who had come in dressed like a pirate, waving his plastic sword around and shouting, “Argh me hearties!”

The exit door was blocked by two coworkers, Jane and Tom, humping each other like teenagers as Jim, the guy who worked the supply closet stood over them pulling his pud. I turned around to see the entire office had devolved into random acts of sex and violence and realized I’d have to wade through a sea of crazy to make it to the main door and out into the street.

There were six rows of cubicles between myself and freedom. Each step consisted of avoiding some different co-worker losing their shit like someone spiked the punch bowl at the loony bin with acid. Star, a twenty-year-old temp worker filling in for Sharon while she was out on maternity leave was using an exacto-knife to carve words into the back of a very dead Andre while saying, “Dear Diary, today I found out that Andre was planning on asking me to marry him!” As I tried to shuffle past her she swung the small knife toward my ankles and shouted, “Go get your own pen!”

I looked down to see the blood from the exacto-knife had splashed onto my khakis and tried to step over Megan the intern as she crawled on the floor picking nits of debris out of the carpet and shoving them into her mouth. With one row down I realized I was only going deeper into the abyss as I peered over to see the path was blocked by the mail cart and that Kevin the mail guy was using his scan gun to bash in Mark the manager’s skull while screaming incoherently.

I made it three cubicles down the aisle before I felt someone latch onto my shoulder and tackle me to the ground. Leslie, a woman I had talked to once or twice around the water cooler had jumped on top of me and said, “Do you think I’m pretty William?” Her gums were bloody and she was missing her front teeth. Blood and saliva dripped onto my face as I threw her off of me and stumbled to my feet shouting, “Fuck off!” Leslie curled up into a ball and screeched like a howler monkey.

At the end of the aisle I found Jessica cowering in her cubicle. Unlike the rest of the crazies she seemed to be genuinely scared. I reached over to tap her on the shoulder and she jerked away. I attempted to speak over the roaring chaos that surrounded us and said, “Come with me. I’m getting out of here!” Jessica grabbed my outstretched hand and we moved down the row a few paces before Kyle came running toward us with the blade from the paper trimmer in his hand. I jumped to the side as Jessica attempted to move around him only to meet the blade as Kyle brought it down hard into her skull. With the blade stuck he tried in vain to pull it from her skull as I pushed past him and toward the exit. No sooner than I had passed him he shouted, “I’ll have yer head William!”

I rounded the corner of the last row and found Milo stripped down to his boxers and sitting cross-legged on the floor surrounded by the bodies of our co-workers as he slapped his hands repeatedly against the bloody corpses and shouted, “Look Mommy! I’m a drummer!” I made it to the exit door and pushed against it only to find someone had chained it shut from the outside. I kicked the door as Kyle rounded the corner with Jessica’s head still attached to the blade. Milo smiled at Kyle who proceeded to bash Milo’s face in with Jessica’s severed head until it dislodged from the blade.

Faced with no exit and nowhere to go, I threw my briefcase at Kyle and broke into a sprint down the aisle and around the corner into the row along the far wall. With nothing else to lose I took the last few steps knowing I was about to collide with the window. I jumped through the metal and glass to fall down onto the sidewalk below.

I landed on my back but thankfully my fall had been broken for the most part by a folding table one of the vendors had set outside. I peered up to see Kyle standing at the window. He threw his blade down at me and it bounced off of the concrete before clattering to a stop beside me. I did a double-take and he had disappeared back into the chaos.

It wasn’t long before the court square was packed to the brim with police cars and ambulances. I sat with a paramedic as they prepped me for a trip to the emergency room. I peered out the window as I was taken to the hospital and noticed that several of my coworkers had started charging the police. I heard gunshots in the distance as the paramedic in the driver’s seat turned on the siren and drove off into the city.

74reyg,41,2017-10-06,Horrible interview for internship at G because of interviewer’s accent,youngcc3157,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/74reyg/horrible_interview_for_internship_at_g_because_of/,"I just finished my third interview with an engineer at G for summer internship position. However, it was one of the most difficult interviews since he had very thick accent with buzz noises in the background over the phone.

I spent too much time trying to understand him and his hints and eventually gave up and figured out my own solution(which happens to be similar run time to his solution). However, it felt like a very negative interview because I couldn’t answer most of his questions because of terrible communication and afraid that he would give negative feed back about me.

I sent an email to my recruiter immediately after the interview explaining the situation and expressed my frustration. How likely is that either I would pass the process or get another interview?"
74rlpt,3,2017-10-06,Should I pursue graduate school?,soccerintherain,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/74rlpt/should_i_pursue_graduate_school/,"TLDR:
What are your experiences with grad school and what is one thing you would say is crucial in getting into and succeeding in grad school? 

(Please let me know if this question is appropriate and whether or not I should post in r/GradAdmissions instead.)

Hi,

I'm currently a second-year mechanical engineering undergraduate student. I've always had a passion for learning, teaching, and developing new skills and recently I've been giving a lot of thought about attending graduate school to pursue a PhD and then perhaps a career in academia. I think I would find the dynamic environment of working as a professor (i.e. travelling, teach courses, conduct research, collaborative projects, etc.) enjoyable because a lot of those tasks align with my own passions and values. 

At this point, the main conundrum I am facing is whether or not I am being too naive about the expectations of grad school and academia. Perhaps I am romanticizing the process of getting a PhD or even a position at a university? Even getting into grad school? I have a perfect GPA and am about to start some research on computational fluid dynamics with one of my professors, but I have not published any papers, attended any conferences, and also have a limited network in the engineering faculty. 

Obviously, I hope to be able to publish a paper and attend conferences but I am technically limited in the amount of time I have left to do those things in my degree. I will be doing research until I start my third year in September 2018 (and that's about it), however, after finishing third-year (so May 2019) I will be attending the industry internship program that my school offers. This lasts 16 months and goes right up until my fourth-year starts, and then I will graduate in May 2021. I know that I could technically be doing research during the school terms (and that graduate school values research experience over industry experience a lot more), but I would prefer to focus on my studies as my courseload only gets heavier with each progressing year. Furthermore, I don't want to sacrifice the industry experience (that would most likely be crucial for me to get an engineering job) to do continuous research each year because I think it would be good to have a balance, and also a backup plan in case I end up not pursuing graduate school or it doesn't work out.

So I guess after this long text what I am really asking is if you have any advice on my situation. Anecdotes, criticisms...anything is welcome :) I am looking to discuss.

Backstory: Been programming for about a year now. Worked my way through FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project, so I've got a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. I also picked up an unpaid internship working as a junior front end dev for the past 2 months. 

Now: I've been applying to any and all web development jobs, in hopes of landing an interview and showing employers that I have the will to learn. I just got off the phone with a potential employer...very excited! The employer asked me some basic questions regarding the languages I know, and also told me that their company is looking for a junior full stack engineer and relies heavily on PHP lamp stack(?)/mySQL/Javascript/jQuery/Magento eCommerce platform. I was honest with them about how much I know and told them that given the opportunity I am willing to put in 10000% effort. They told me to brush up on my PHP, mySQL, and Javascript and come in for an interview early next week. 
 
What I'm looking for: HTML, CSS, and Ruby are my strongest points. However, that doesn't help me much for this job. I need a crash course in the aforementioned languages/topics. I don't want to waste hours on an imperfect resource, can anyone point me in the best direction?

I am forever grateful for any responses that help, thank you reddit! 

TLDR: newb, got an interview next week, plan to study all weekend, need a crash course in PHP lamp stack(?)/mySQL/Javascript(jQuery)/Magento eCommerce platform. "
74rwla,1,2017-10-06,Senior Mechanical Engineering Student that picked up a Computer Science degree.,LifeOfQuaz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/74rwla/senior_mechanical_engineering_student_that_picked/,"Hi everyone ! 

I am currently a senior mechanical engineering student at state college and I picked up a computer science minor this past semester. 
I realized more and more I want to pursue Computer Science as a full time career this past year. I know it kind of late finding my real interest during my senior year but I am happy with the journey that took me here. 

So essentially I am currently taking my first computer science class which I am breezing through (Python) but outside of that I have no side projects or internships related to computer science. Looking at everyone's else credentials has me worried that I might not be able to stack up compared to the competition out there. 

A little about me:
- Solid GPA
- Have internship and research related to Mechanical Engineering 
- Hopefully I can get a letter of recommendation from my computer science. 

With all that being said I want to go big when it comes to landing a job. (Google,Microsoft, etc.) So I have a few questions that I am hoping you guys can help me out with.

1. What personal projects can I do/start that I can add to my resume related to computer sciene

2. Can you guys think of any way(s) that my Mechanical Engineering degree can help land a nice Computer Science related job. (I can't, in all honesty)

3. What languages and/or skills should I learn over winter break (about a month) that can help set me apart from the rest 

4. Would a minor suffice? I do not want to stay too long in school but I am willing to add an entire major post-grad if need be.

Also I worry about my age, I know I am really relatively compared to a lot of other guys out there but I am three years behind everyone my age. "

For my first two years I decided on attending a local community college just to get my toes dipped into the scene and save money but now that I'm finishing up, I do intend on continuing to a four year school but I'm at a loss on how to even approach this.

My schooling was so cheap that I didn't need to take out any other loans that just the generalized on provided by FASFA services. It was only about $5000 a year and now that I'm looking towards other universities, I know that tuition can be as high as $50,000 though I'm not aiming to go anywhere with a rate that high. My plans are to move states, I'm currently in West Virginia and am considering the likes of New York, Massachusetts, Ohio and one or two other states. I'm fairly sure I SHOULD live where ever I aim to go a year before so I can establish residency and get in-state tuition but from there I'm at a complete loss.

I'm unsure how I'm going to pay for my schooling. My grades are pretty good, staying at around the 3.4/3.5 area but even from that I was a pretty underwhelming student. I wasn't apart of any clubs or sororities since I could never find the time to. I'm doing my internship right now but it's not providing me with any real substance to take with me. I'm not really sure how to approach this and I don't have anyone I can turn to who has been in this situation. I appreciate any advice or tips you can give. Thanks in advance.

Reading this subreddit has probably corrupted my brain.  The various horror stories have done nothing but make me feel despair.

I have no experience.  I have a CS/Math degree from a top Canadian university.  87% average or 4.10 out of 4.33 GPA according to the school.  No internships.  No references.  Graduated 4 years ago.

It sounds insane (I am somewhat insane), but I'm scared to even apply to jobs.  At least now I can pretend that I have a chance at a career, but if I face reality and find no job then I will have no reason to live.  I'm scared to draft a resume because it will probably be not worth the paper its printed on.

I'm working on a few projects, but sometimes I just can't even write a line of code without being crushed in anxiety and hopelessness.  It seems pointless.  Nobody will even care about these projects and the stupid ""personal project"" meme around this subreddit is likely way overblown.

Can anyone point me towards a plan that can actually work?  Can I get some reassurance?"

I want to become a professional software developer for a company with a good culture that is interested in solving meaningful and interesting problems. I'm not a complete beginner, nor am I an expert. I am reaching out here because I feel lost, unsure of a good strategy to get to my goal.
#Where I am now
My background is in liberal arts, but after a couple years in the working world, I've found a dissatisfying amount of money and intrinsic reward. Then I started looking for something else that could be enjoyable and profitable, and landed on programming. I started working on little games and reading programming books and tutorials and continued to enjoy it, enough to feel good about committing to going back to school to study it. I'm half way through my first semester as a CS student and wish I could code and learn as my primary occupation, but I have two part-time jobs and am taking a math class in addition to Java.

I feel disoriented, with a vague idea of where I want to go, and no confidence on how to get there. I've practiced Java a lot, interviewed people in different areas of the industry, read some books, read a lot of websites, listened to podcasts, done many online free exercises, made a personal website, started looking into contributing to open source projects. I wish I had a mentor to keep me on a good path, to help me recognize the golden opportunities, the wastes of time.

#Boot camp?
That's why I am considering going to a coding boot camp in January, but am conflicted. All the ones I've researched only offer various flavors of web / mobile development. I am afraid that if I go to a boot camp, I'd mostly only be eligible for jobs making imitations of popular websites and apps that cater to the lowest common denominators and prey on human weakness to extract money from people while not improving their lives in any meaningful way, perhaps even encouraging unhealthy behavior.

#Specialize?
I am not sure what area of CS would best suit my abilities and interests, but I think I'd like something like building tools for a company to automate or increase efficiency internally, or implementing new technologies and create new possibilities. Some areas that attract me are: space travel / exploration, robotics, prosthetics, artificial intelligence, transportation, renewable energy, humanitarian relief, education, human development, mental health, coffee, music, running, biking
Would a boot camp not be the best path to a job along these lines? If not, what would be better? A traditional CS degree? Keep self-teaching? An internship? An entry level developer job now? I appreciate any feedback.

74tli9,1,2017-10-07,Is my PC worth upgrading?,KriZ_herpaderpa,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/74tli9/is_my_pc_worth_upgrading/,"My current gaming PC is 4 years old now, used to run BF4 pretty decently, but now is unable to get enough frames in the newer games even on lowest settings.

I was wondering if you could give me some advice if upgrading still makes sense? I would like the upgrade to at least run the latest games on medium quality until the end of 2018, hopefully even a bit longer.

**Current PC:**

* ASRock Z87 Pro4 - Moederbord - LGA1150 Socket - Z87
* Intel Core i5 4670 / 3.4 GHz - 6 MB cache - LGA1150 Socket
* Crucial Ballistix Tactical - Memory - 8 GB : 2 x 4 GB - DIMM 240-pins low profile - DDR3 - 1600 MHz / PC3-12800 - CL8 - 1.35 V
* Club 3D Radeon PokerSeries HD 7870 jokerCard XT Limited Edition - Grafische kaart - Radeon HD 7870 - 2 GB GDDR5 - PCI Express
* Corsair Carbide Series 200R - Midtowermodel - ATX
* Samsung 840 Series MZ-7TD120 - Solid state drive - 120 GB - intern - 2.5"" - SATA-600


I am considering the following upgrades to it:

* A bigger SSD, because currently I'm installing all games on my old HD which is very slow. I'm thinking a Samsung 850 EVO 500GB.
* New video card, 1050 TI benchmarks look ""good enough"" for me and very affordable. Not sure if it'll be able to keep up with games in 2018 though?
* RAM: would 16GB be enough? Should I just toss the old RAM and buy 2 x 8GB DDR3?


Of course I came up with this with very limited knowledge, so not even sure if these parts fit in the current system."

I went back to university and finished my degree, and went back to work in May earning 58k. Part of the compensation package (as the pay is less than the industry average) also includes health benefits, and a bonus at the end of the year, plus training and certification.

I have had issues with this company since I started with them two years ago, some of which include:

1) Poor management and internal communication.
2) Late payments.
3) Bonuses not payed despite being a part of the compensation package.
4) Training and certification provided after two years, despite constant promises.
5) We are understaffed and all face a huge workload, having to work on the weekends as well.

I have stuck with this company mainly because the owner is an old family friend, but lately things have been getting worse. I went out to lunch the other day with my coworkers and they started complaining to me and have also experienced or felt the same issues.

I am seriously considering leaving the company at this point, however when I brought up the issue with my parents, my father (who is a manager himself) said that I should be grateful to the company for hiring me in the first place since ""so many"" university graduates have no jobs, and that employees who complain about management are rude and have no class or manners.

Am I being out of line here? Am I not seeing something here or being unreasonable?"

I have been looking for a full-time job since mid-August. Since then, I've been onsite with 3 companies, had phone interviews with a few more, and am still waiting on coding challenge results from a few such as Dropbox, Twitter--though I expect these companies will never get back.

I've had a total of 7 onsites since last year (stopped recruiting for full-time in February until August). For the most part they go well, but the feedback I usually get goes something like this:

""The team really liked you and thought you would be a good fit for the company. They thought you had good problem solving skills but we are currently looking for someone with a little more experience and the team would not be able to provide the training you need at the time.""

I realize if I had completely aced my interviews this would not be an issue. So I know that I should keep studying and improving my interview skills. On the otherhand, I am not sure how I am supposed to round out my profile and whether or not I should take some time off from applying to do so. I currently have one onsite and a couple more leads, but I am thinking I need to change my strategy before I send out more applications.

Also, I am a May 2017 grad which seems to be--from my experience--disqualifying me from about half of the new grad positions. Would it be unethical to say I am a December 2017 grad instead? This was my expected graduation date (I graduated early).

I have just graduated from a top UC in California, with an Econ Major and a Stats Minor. I just realized that I love data, and math and wants to be a data scientist. Also I really like London as it is a very cool city with many things I culturally identify with. So I plan to go to graduate schools there for Statistics or Data Science. The school I am most interested in is University College London. But I am worried about my prospects. Here is my current situation:

- GPA: My General GPA is 3.45, but the GPA for my Stats Minor classes is about 3.7 ish (I hope this is my saving grace). The biggest issue with this is that I got a C in a Linear Algebra class I took last Fall. But after this, the grades in my Upper Division Statistics class has been quite good, hence the high Stats GPA. With these numbers do I have a good chance to get in to say University College London MSc taught programmes for Statistics? I heard that I should emphasize the upward trend in my GPA in my personal statement to divert the attention away from my bad grade? Also, I was also a transfer student from a California community college, does the GPA of my community college being taken into account? ( Note: The GPA numbers I mentioned above is only my UC's GPA)


- GRE: most of the programs in London does not require GREs scores. But should I still take the GRE to supplement the application ? Or the schools will not even look at it? I am not even sure they allow submission of GRE scores for programs that don't require it. So if I take the GRE, the only way to let them know is through my personal statement, is it advisable to do so? One last thing is that, since applications are opening very soon, the taking of the GRE will at least delay my application for 2 months since I need time to prep and take and get the scores back, is it worth it to do so because the schools are doing rolling admissions?

- References: This I think is the biggest issue for me. The programs at University College London requires 2 references, 2 academics or 1 academics and 1 professional. I have a professional reference already due to the internship I am currently having. But for the academic reference it is kind of hard for me to get from my Stats professors due to the fact that the classes is so short, so I did not have enough time to build rapport with any of them. I already asked one of my professor but it does not seem promising. Is there any tips to securing references with professors that you don't know too well so that they are not annoyed? I understand that the reference, if I managed to secure one, might not be the most stellar in my situation, but I have come to accept this fact. This a very important piece in the application, if I don't have this, then my application will not be completed at all. 

Thank you all for your time. I would really appreciate any advices, anything at all. Again, please help!"

I’m in my senior year of college, a finance major at a school in Pennsylvania. I posted here about a year ago, which had been helpful, but I’d love to hear any more outside input for my situation. I don't regret majoring in finance, but it's nice to know I'm not limited to doing only that.

In the past, I’ve had a handful of internships/jobs, many of which were very similar:

 * Credit risk summer intern at an investment bank
 * Private equity intern in a country in Asia, where I did research on early stage tech companies
 * Wealth management intern at a small office near my university
 * Worked at a movie theater throughout high school

In the past, I had been dead-set on a position at a corporate/investment bank, but realized I don’t necessarily enjoy that path and I find zero fulfillment or meaning in that type of work. I’d be happy to jump into a business/finance role if I enjoyed the work I’d do, but I’m expanding my search to a much wider range. 

The things that I would value (but not necessarily requirements) in a career would be:

 * Fulfilling, meaningful work
 * Client or impactful customer interaction (consulting, advisory)
 * I’m very flexible location wise, with little-to-no preference for a rural/suburban/urban setting, as long as the salary adjusts accordingly. 
 * Normal, 9-6ish hours (45-50/week), happy to occasionally work extra (this past summer was 60+/wk)
 * The feeling of building something (tangible or not), and seeing substantial progress towards a goal or project, with an identifiable completion point in the future (I dislike ‘continuous improvement’ or monotonous repetition)
 * The option, but not the expectation to be friends with coworkers (I understand some ‘mandatory bonding events’ but I would dislike that happening constantly)
 * The option to work remotely (relatively early into a job), or a mix between home/office/client sites
 * I would want to work for a company for 2-3+ years out of college, hopefully learn something relevant to starting a company of my own, and later open my own company
 * Some travel would be best. Lots of travel would be better than no travel.
 * I have rough salary expectations, but the location and type of job could make this number jump around a lot.

Careers I’ve considered/applied to/interviewed for:

 * Independent strategy consulting for the government
 * Commercial banking, in a more regional city (not NY, SF, or similar)
 * Rotational Development Program with the finance division of a F500 company (I’ve interviewed with 4 different programs, some of which seem like cool companies)
 * Federal Budget Office, or work more closely related to political candidates (as a Congressional aide, or similar work, but not on campaign support)
 * Small, local government work in an interesting line of work
 * Investment analyst at a hedge fund
 * Investment analyst *not* at a hedge fund
 * Business Software Implementation Consulting (with travel)
 * Industrial real estate development (the company I spoke with noted long hours)
 * Residential land development (buy a tiny plot of land, build a small house/getaway cabin, sell)
 * Starting my own Business Automation Consulting company, for small businesses (though my programming skills aren’t very strong)

Other considerations:

 * I’m considering joining the Peace Corps at some point in my late 20s.
 * I’m also considering getting a Masters in Philosophy, though I understand it isn’t viable/useful career-wise.
 * I may eventually start my own company.
 * I’ll work for at least 2-3 years before making any of these big changes.
 * Years down the road, I'd like to run for political office.

Thanks for trudging through this long read. Any input is really, really valuable. Thanks."

**Quick Summary**:
----------------------------
- I'm 25.
- I received my BSBA degree in Computer Information Systems from a decent (but not great) university in August (2017). 
- My job experience is okay. I've got 3+ years of contractual IT consulting experience doing troubleshooting, hardware repair, and some systems and network administration. I've had a few tech volunteer positions and a 4-month position as a data-analyst. I also just ended a 3-month internship as a project manager at a fortune 500 company.
- I moved across the country to California for the internship, and am now living here looking for my next job. I refuse to leave the west-coast (I've lived on the east-coast and in the midwest for most of my life).

----------------------------
**Current Situation**:
----------------------------
It has been a month since my internship ended, and I am trying to develop my skills and my direction a bit while applying for jobs.  I have been furthering my skills/knowledge with network administration, as well as my skills/knowledge with web development. 

When it comes to web development I understand HTML5/CSS and JavaScript at an intermediate level. I am learning how to build a website from scratch using PHP and SQL for the back-end with Amazon RDS as a database. I'm also learning jQuery/Angular and Node for the purposes of using a web-crawler and search engine within the website.

At the same time, I am advancing my skills in PowerShell and Windows Registry to be better equipped for a System/Network admin role. 

----------------------------
**Problems &amp; Reasoning**:
----------------------------
I feel a little lost. I don't have enough experience/skills or the right degree to be hired as a Programmer. I could develop websites contractually, but it pays very little to do web development with CMSs (like Wix and Wordpress)on the scene now. 

I have the skills to become a System Administrator or Support Technician, but that industry is becoming automated, and the job pool is filled with veterans looking for work. In order to be competitive I have to not only learn what they already know, but learn the newer methods as well. Powershell seems to be a good place where I can do both, but it isn't enough.

I have many of the necessary skills, but not enough experience to be hired on as a Project/Program manager. 

I have toyed with the idea of getting into game development as well. I've even made a card-game app in Unity, but left it 80% finished. I enjoy game development substantially, but it takes me off the path of profitability and really isn't an option at this point. Can't afford to be a tester either.

Honestly I feel like I am an incorrigible jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none, and that I have wasted my time by not focusing on one thing in particular. In the last five years I have also taught myself to play the piano at a near professional level and also taught myself how to draw/paint at a similar level. However, I rarely visit my creative hobbies because I find they have doomed me to be unprofitable, and that kind of creativity doesn't get me a job or pay bills.

Additionally, I constantly feel that I don't know enough.

----------------------------
**Current Plan**:
----------------------------
I am pursuing IT support positions, and Business/System Analyst jobs. While working my day job, I will work on web development and try to get some particular kinds of websites up and running to generate some ad-revenue. But is this the right thing to do? One downside is having (what is basically) two jobs puts a strain on my current relationship.

Now, as I only have the knowledge equivalent to the first semester of a year-long Applied Probability and Statistics course, I don't think I can do much with fancy data analysis or machine learning. Hence, I try to focus on Data Cleaning and Visualization, which I can compensate the lack of knowledge by my coding skill. 

For the project, I intend to perform a study of 10 - 15 graphs, charts and their applications. For instance, when to use boxplot and what we can learn from it. I will choose some not-too-dirty data sets to perform basic cleaning as well. And all the code for graphs, charts and cleaning work will be available in both R and Python. There will also be brief analysis regarding descriptive statistics for each graph.
With that idea being said, do you have any advice or idea on which kind of graphs I should include and which datasets I should use to make those graphs? It would be great if we have a website that provides comprehensive information about various kinds of graphs.

Also, as a beginner, I am still a bit unclear about data cleaning. I know dirty data may be missingness, incorrect data, or bad-formatted data, etc. but overall, given a dataset, I may not know how to conclude when the data is clean enough for me to do all the work. So, I definitely need some advice on that too.

Please help me if you can. I value our kinds of input you gave. The project itself is a beautiful learning experience for me, which helps me a lot in the future. Thank you so much!"

Basically, the other day I received an offer from Eaton for a summer internship, and I have two weeks to decide if I want to take it.

The only two things keeping me from accepting is the location and other possible offers. The best case scenario, in four hours from my family (not ideal, especially when considering I live next to a major city, where there are other CS opportunities). Also, I don't have a choice where I'm assigned because they tell me after I accept the job offer, so I could be a five out flight away for all I know. 

Additionally, Eaton is the very first company to get back to me, and I'm worried I could accept this position, and a better offer could come along that I can't take. 

That said, I realize that I may not get another internship offer if I turn this down. Also, I really like Eaton and I'm interested in the work I'll be doing. I'm also very happy with the pay. 

In the end I'm not sure what to do. Right now I'm leaning towards taking it, but I'm still unsure. Any input would be really helpful.

For my first two years I decided on attending a local community college just to get my toes dipped into the scene and save money but now that I'm finishing up, I do intend on continuing to a four year school but I'm at a loss on how to even approach this.

My schooling was so cheap that I didn't need to take out any other loans that just the generalized on provided by FASFA services. It was only about $5000 a year and now that I'm looking towards other universities, I know that tuition can be as high as $50,000 though I'm not aiming to go anywhere with a rate that high. My plans are to move states, I'm currently in West Virginia and am considering the likes of New York, Massachusetts, Ohio and one or two other states. I'm fairly sure I SHOULD live where ever I aim to go a year before so I can establish residency and get in-state tuition but from there I'm at a complete loss.

I'm unsure how I'm going to pay for my schooling. My grades are pretty good, staying at around the 3.4/3.5 area but even from that I was a pretty underwhelming student. I wasn't apart of any clubs or sororities since I could never find the time to. I'm doing my internship right now but it's not providing me with any real substance to take with me. I'm not really sure how to approach this and I don't have anyone I can turn to who has been in this situation. I appreciate any advice or tips you can give. Thanks in advance.

If I asked too many questions I can make it less clunky by breaking this up and posting in separate posts.)

**Questions:** I'm a senior applying to ambitious colleges like Yale, but after I already set up to apply EA I found out my AP Calc grade is currently a D. My only chance to salvage this is one more test this term. 
**Should I consider dropping down a level or try my best to stick it out, and how will either option appear to colleges?**
**Will being bad at math make it look ridiculous for me to plan a major in comp sci/art?**
**How do my college choices look considering that I want to work in comp sci/art and possibly biology?**

---

Before now I've done well in highschool taking the highest level classes possible and getting all A's with the exception of 2 B's (Freshman math and APUSH). I'm interested in art, computer science, and biology, which is why this year I'm taking a lot of computer sci/art classes and Marine Bio ACP.

Last year for Honors Math I had a very loose teacher. I didn't learn much and probably only received an A because of how lenient he was. I've never really clicked with math and don't know how I made it this far, but this year my incompetence is really showing. I pass in all the homework and participate in class, but I failed the first math test with a 55% and currently have a D.

It's a really nightmare-ish grade especially so close to the EA deadline. Best case scenario, I'm hoping to study enough to ace the next test and push my first-term grade up a bit. I don't know if I can handle this class for the rest of the year, but is it worse to drop down or to keep going (and likely get worse-than-average) scores? 

Additionally, even though Coding class this year hasn't had any difficult math, will being bad at math make it look ridiculous for me to plan a major in comp sci/art?

---

**School:** Public High School in MA. It's a pretty intense school, so there are plenty of students with all A's and all APs.

**Colleges I'm applying to: (** Yale (EA), Brown, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, BC, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cooper Union, Tufts, USC, NYU, Northeastern, Pratt, Parsons
**Art colleges:**RISD, Calarts, Massart, MICA, SAIC, Ringling

**SAT:** 1560 (780 for both reading and math)
**SAT Essay:** 6 4 6
**SAT II:** Bio 760 Lit 770
**GPA (last year):** UW 3.8 W 4.7

**Last Year's AP grades:** AP Art (A), APUSH (B)
**Last Year’s AP scores:** AP Art (5), APUSH (3)
**This Year's AP classes:** Lit, Chinese, Psych, Calc
**Other classes:** Marine Biology, Coding, Video, Game Design

**Extracurriculars:** 
- Long-term volunteering at my school's ABA program for autistic students
- Long-term volunteering at a cat shelter
- Founding member of a creative online paper club (starting 2016)
- Started personal project to raise money for animal shelters, so far have donated a couple thousand
- Internship this summer at YMCA
- This summer I interned at an MIT Neuroscience Lab (Ironically, I can't apply to MIT because I didn't take a Math Subject Test.)
- A lot of stuff with art! I’ve been taking art classes inside and out of school since elementary, and I’ve been published in the Marble Collection and received a few Gold Keys and Silver Keys
- Joined the Ultimate Frisbee club this year

**Recs:**
- My Marine Bio teacher who was my Honors Bio teacher last year! I think she's happy to have me again this year
- My Game Design/Video teacher, whom I've also had for Media class Freshman-Junior year
- My mentor from the MIT Lab

**ORM(?):** I'm Chinese-American which is probably the most overrepresented minority, but I'm specifically Inner Mongolian which is less common. Most people won't see a difference so this is probably unrelated

74zqeu,1,2017-10-08,22F Student | USA to UK | Am I on the Right Path to Get Out?,skybeart,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/74zqeu/22f_student_usa_to_uk_am_i_on_the_right_path_to/,"I tried searching the old posts here and elsewhere on reddit but didn't have much luck finding a scenario close enough to mine.

I'm currently 22 and an American citizen studying at public university in USA. I'm in my fourth semester (not typical) and am applying to the Computer Science program at the end of this semester, currently I am not in a major. It's a very competitive program and I hope to get in so I can finish my degree in Computer Science.

Since I was younger, I have always wanted to go to school in England, but the costs have always been a huge deterrent (I saw them rise significantly in the last ~5 years when I first thought about attending) whereas I am in almost no debt doing my degree here, in-state.

I have been reaching a breaking point for years now, though. My sister died two years ago and living here makes me miserable for that and a multitude of other reasons. I want to leave despite trying to make the best of it here, but can't bring myself to find a way out I feel confident about. I tell myself finishing a degree here is the smartest option given the barely-existing financial burden.

I have a boyfriend who lives in the UK and is about to enter the work force, we've been dating since the beginning of this year. I finally visited England after all these years this past summer to see him, and I loved it. I stayed for a couple of months and it confirmed that's where I want to be, not the States.


So I'd like to live in England and ideally find a job there and work towards permanent citizenship one day. How can I best start working towards that now? I have considered a few options :

* I understand there is a shortage occupation list for the UK and I should aspire to find a job that's on it. I am just about to (hopefully) get in the major I want, finally. Should I try to look for an internship/work placement with a company in England that may want to sponsor me for a visa once I graduate? Is there any sort of best approach in finding those sort of employers? I understand doing an internship with a company doesn't guarantee they'll want to hire me post-graduation. Are the jobs on the shortage occupation list still my best chance going this route?

* A lot of what I have read says a couple's best bet is to take it to the next level with a civil partnership/marriage and getting a visa that way but, while I adore my boyfriend, I don't think I'm ready to ask him for that sort of commitment. If he and I are still together when I graduate, in 2019-2020, we could consider some sort of visa like that if I cannot find employment by then, correct? But it still would be a few years until I can try to get a job in England because of the stipulations of these types of visas? I guess it is also worth mentioning my boyfriend is okay with the long-distance but ideally would like for it to not be, but discussing something like this feels very intimidating for me right now. I wouldn't want to make him uncomfortable, as if I were using him or something.

* Probably the most insane option, I am still not really that far in my university career here. I could apply to university there, understanding very few, if any, of the college classes I have taken here will transfer and I would start from scratch on a computer science course there. But I will be in tens of thousands of dollars of debt to the US government since I would have to take the loans out from here. But is studying there a better way to find employment there instead of studying here and looking for a job there post-grad? Again I have mentioned trying to get my foot in the door early with companies by applying for internships/work placement before graduating but I do not know if that is a more effective approach.


I understand I asked a lot of questions. Any you can answer would be deeply appreciated. Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR** Currently new-ish American student studying at home but wanting to go to England. Not sure if I should finish degree here and try to network early to ensure way out, hope my relationship provides a way there, or try to go to university there to possibly increase chances of staying there for work and eventually permanently."
74zuhw,8,2017-10-08,Got an offer. Do I deserve to accept it?,throwaway758347,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/74zuhw/got_an_offer_do_i_deserve_to_accept_it/,"I recently finished up an internship at a decently known west coast company. However, I only was able to get in because my parents knew a department VP at the company who passed the good word for me. It became known to my other team members and my team lead that this was the case as I clearly was not initially qualified for it.

Now, after the internship ended, I was offered a full-time position, probably with that same team. I definitely felt under-achieving during the course of the internship compared to my other peers, all of whom were employees, some of which were recent hires as well. I did learn and improve but still.... I really suspect the VP connection was behind my offer again.

Would it be wise for me to accept the offer? I suspect jealousy and contempt from my coworkers because I probably did not deserve to be in there as much as they did.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses guys. I wanted to make myself more clear about the situation. 

I had a team manager/lead (Lead A) with whom I worked and the other devs on the team. Then there was an another upper level manager (Manager B) who was responsible for multiple teams, and who amongst other things decided put me into the team I was on. The VP was from another department and is not involved in the work of the department I was on.

I actually received a verbal offer a week or so before the end of my program. B had talked to A and my peers to find out how I did. Team lead A told B I did fine according to my last meeting with Manager B. However, I personally felt (this is how I felt, idk the actual truth) that I was underperforming, especially when I compared myself with other new full time hires, who were there for 3 to 6 months before I came.

I only received the formal offer recently, and after reflections wondered if it would be wise to go. As someone pointed out, I am worried about being ""stuck"" because other people might be resentful. At the end of the day, I still got along with everyone, I think."
74zwch,2,2017-10-08,Will double majoring look inherently negative to employers?,_Shal_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/74zwch/will_double_majoring_look_inherently_negative_to/,"I'm at a tough point at the moment for deciding my major.  I like CS and would be happy to utilize it for my future. But, I also really like physics and would also love to do as many opportunities as I could along with a CS degree to learn about it. The fact is that I like both subjects and would love to extensively learn both in college.

 I already know a double major generally won't make me look better, get me more pay, or expand opportunities.  If the double major does become too much of a hassle then I will drop a major (likely the physics one). As much as I like both majors, I know the importance of a decent GPA, social life, health, and internships as well.

We'll enough of my unnecessarily long premise (Sorry I ramble a lot, and now I realize I'm doing it again but in parenthesis). Do employers often react negatively to double majors? 

I will of course try my best to appear well rounded and experienced, but I'm worried if employers think it would mean the person is alright in two subjects rather than strong in one. If they do, are they immediately dismissive and should I emphasize how I can still be a strong employee from CS or will any things like internships will already help in that case?

I'm concerned since I could realize an issue with double majoring for me early on and drop a major, but I'm worried about factors I can't control.

If you want to drop any other insight then I'd appreciate that. Thanks in advance!

I am also doing my MSc in parallel and have two half days off, so that I can attend some labs and sessions. 

My company values work/life balance. Work load is proportional, no battlefield like or start up like cut throat environment. It is all serene here. This is what people here brags about all day long. This is the main reason I started here. This is what I want. I simply want a 9-6 job and that is it.

So as a result, I only work during office hours, and either study or just rest at home during evenings and weekends. I complete my tasks during the work hours and simply go offline rest of the time. However rest of my coworkers keep working related to the projects even during evenings and weekends although it is not called for. Some of them open about this ( as I can see from the messages at group chat at my phone ) and some of them are more silent and sly, yet they all do extra work.

Now, people can do whatever they want, competition etc I understand whatever. Yet their ambition is directly affecting me. We are working as a group and bounded by each other. Since they keep working extra they finish tasks earlier, and I look like I am lagging behind although I am doing what is just normal. 

I don't want my life to be about my job. I don't want to work overtime, I changed my career track because of this, found this great place and now what?!

I am content with working 9 to 6 and calling it a day. Our managers (two of them) are also new as leaders, and they are also busy with their other duties most of the time, so they tend to loose track of what is the normal pace of things and go like ""oh well if it is all finished, don't sit idle, here is another task, complete this before weekend etc."" I don't want to be telling them I am not there yet all the time. 

What can I do about this ? "

I hate the idea of trying to appease a company to get hired. I'm supposed to what... take on all these extracurricular activities, side projects, volunteer, and kiss ass to get internships? It's fucking pathetic and it's the same feeling that I get when I see people trampling each other on black Friday for a cabbage patch doll. It's desperation and the willingness to appease your self-imposed corporate masters for the chance to bust your ass and get what is relatively a fraction of your true worth in return. I am disgusted by the process of finding employment and the desperation of it. I am disgusted by corporate culture and the phoniness of it. No, I don't believe in the company's mission or vision. I want fucking money to eat and i'm not going to jump through flaming hoops in the hopes that you might give me the scraps off your corporate floor. Go fuck yourselves. I'd rather live in my car than spend the next few years busting my ass desperately trying to appease a company that only gives a fuck about how much utility I can provide them, but then turns around and acts like they truly value people and give a fuck about anything besides turning a profit. Everything is a competition, and I just want to keep an internal scorecard but it's so fucking irritating to recognize that everyone around you is kissing ass, sucking the teet and that's what gets them ahead. I'm not going to paint a smile on my face, take some pictures and post them to my Linkedin along with my puffed up achievements hoping to impress you. I'm tired of trying to impress people, but that's what achieving sustenance in this world has turned into. I'm not going to do it. I don't believe that Jake and Christi from recruiting are better than me.. so why am I trying to impress them? I don't believe anyone is above me. Not you, not the company CEO, not the president.. nobody. You might have abilities that are more valued by the market, but that does not make you better than me, and that does not mean I should try to appease YOU. I'm not going to do it. I'm not buying into the corporate world.
My only real option is to work for myself. There is no way I am ever going to excel in a company taking orders from and trying to appease someone else, nor do I want to."

I have learned so much on this wild journey so I wanted to share the ups and downs over last few months.


I finally feel like making traction in both product development refinement and marketing awareness. My friends and family have been very supportive in my venture.... especially my wife. One other area of excellent resources and knowledge is the local Ottawa startup scene. We went and meet with them during an open house and have been like another family since remember expand your network whenever possible. (Ottawa Collab Space)


Our product is starting to get noticed and reviewed very well. It is a high quality Bluetooth speaker made out of reclaimed Riverwood that is handcrafted in Canada. We do have a challenge of creating a niche market that demands HIFI, Style and Bluetooth connectivity but i'm confident we will succeed as we have a great product (just need to get it seen and heard)


As a design engineer that now has to wear multiple hats (marketing, accounting, sales, IT, etc) sometimes feels overwhelming but you learn so much. We are truly blessed to have all this information and tools available to us. So here is a list that I wanted to share with you to help others:


Website: Shopify (even a electrical eng can create a great website)


Must read books: The lean startup and Traction


Accounting: Wave (free book keeping)


Digital Marketing support/interns: Genm.co (we got the 2 best interns that we have now joined into our company)


IT: Google everything cloud based. Spreadsheets, Docs, Hangouts for IM, sharing files, etc


Advertising: Google Analytics track what works and what doesn't. Find new channels of marketing where others become saturated


Product Engineering : 20 Years of design engineering experience and the normal CAD/simulation tools. Simulate and test.


Product improvement: In our case we had a create 4 iterations before we could send out our MVP for testing as its a bit more of a premium product. We will be improving the electronics which i'm almost done so should be able to upgrade seamlessly.


New skills we developed: Setup business identity, trademark, patent research, branding, marketing/sales, networking, photographer and even model :)


Highlight: -When people hear something you spend almost a year perfecting love the look and sound quality


-Meeting great people along this wild journey of business and networking.


Lowlights:


-Since we are a premium build in North America product the price point is high. In today's society when people think Bluetooth speaker they think cheap plastic disposable one's from overseas. It's hard to create a ""new market"" of highend bookshelf speaker meets bluetooth simplicity.


-Creating an Indiegogo Video (I hate being filmed)


We are about to launch our exclusive Indiegogo presales in two weeks and am getting excited to showcase to the world.

A little about me: I'm 35, male, unemployed and unmarried (so I don't have much financial backing) and don't live in a tech hub. I went to a fairly standard state school for a non-STEM degree to get into web development.

Now I know web development can have the potential to provide a stable, well-paying career. I have not seen that much in my experience. I've only been contracted by very small companies for putting out fires, or for projects that they don't want their ""core"" employees to work on. These places underpay a lot to contractors, and do not make any permanent job offers to me. My professional network is also weak. Nobody I know is looking to hire software developers. I think my reputation works against applying to large companies.

As for my goals, it is to work in high-performance computing, in particular with aerospace. My example: adaptive resolution grids for fluid simulations. My reality: CRUD apps and CMS websites for small-med business clients.

Obviously good experience and talent can overcome that, but that's a lot easier said than done. I did not receive a lot of good experience, and see myself as a mediocre developer. So what are your thoughts about returning to college and doing it ""the proper way""?

The plan is getting a CS degree at a better school, get one or more internships from reputable tech companies, build connections with people from those companies, and receive full-time job offers. There are a few stated theories made about the hiring pipelines of many of these companies, giving new grads an ironic strength."

After clarifying with HR about the situation, I was informed that they are looking for someone to take over in IT. I am still skeptical that they will be able to find anyone in my town.

Perhaps I am overestimating my ability, but I believe that they will not be able find anyone better than me who lives nearby.

I will also add that they are going to get an MSP to handle servers. The MSP is 80 miles away and will charge about $140 an hour. I have no idea how involved they will be.

I talked to the school, they will talk to the person in charge of internships and ask for a plan from the company. If they will offer me a job, I will take it. If not then I will be leaving if they can not find someone to take over for my boss."

I recently got a few interns on my team, and because of some things I was appointed as a mentor for all of them. So since day 1 I started teaching them how everything works: what the MapReduce concept is, what Hadoop/HDFS/YARN do, why you have schedulers, what's Spark, why you have GC in JVM, etc. I also explained why in some places we did things a certain way, what're the tradeoffs, what can go wrong, what we can improve, and so on, so they would have some understanding on what's going on.

At some point, I spent two hours explaining how things work internally and why we're doing this one line change (yes, exactly a 14 symbol change), because I wanted them to understand the reason and not just do what I said.

I also had to do 1-1s, and I asked them if everything was fine and good, and they told me that it's the best internship they ever had, and I asked why, and they told that's because they get to learn a lot of things, and get a bigger picture. I was like ""OK"".

Few weeks after, I ask some of my friends from the field, if what I'm doing is what everyone is suppose to do… And I was told that it's not. Interns are usually given some research gigs that no one plans to actually roll out, but that research thing would keep them hooked, so after graduation they would consider sticking with the company.

This totally blew my mind as I've never had any internships and in my ideal world that's what it was all about: teaching, mentoring, explaining things, and so on. The whole idea that it's only to get them stick after graduation, didn't make sense to me, and I was really shocked by that.

So my question is: do I have a wrong concept for ""internships"" in my head? and what the ""internship"" is about?"

I graduated last year with double major in cs and math and decent gpa 3.3 from a top 30 well known university, and started working in a large tech company in Bay area. When I started, I got assigned to a devops team but still titled as software engineer. 3 months in, the job was okay with decent pay, but our team got impacted by a large scale of laid off on December. The entire project got wiped out and we all had to leave. 


Started applying again on March and was looking for a software development job instead of devops because I would prefer more coding. Applied to general software engineer position at 100+ companies but only received handful of interviews compared to 10+ interviews while I was in school. However, I wasn't offered a position at any of those companies because I only had 3 months working experience and was not doing software development. One of them asked me if I want to do support engineer/system admin., but because I am not so much into that role, I rejected and planned to to wait for 2018 new grad software engineer positions due to my lack of software development experience and my passion to code.


Okay, now 2018 new grad software engineer positions opened up and so far I applied to about 50 of them. Only received a coding challenge from Twitter and nothing else. I have projects in my github, 3 months software engineer experience and 3 months internship, done 200+ leetcode problems but not getting any interviews since Aug. when applications opened up. 


Also since the laid off on December last year, I worked at a local restaurant as manager/co-owner, should I put that into my resume as well or just put tech related experience?

Here's some context behind the dilemma I'm in right now: I'm a 20 year old guy from the Netherlands; I recently got a degree from a community college for IT Management -- during my last internship I found a place to stay, the company liked having me around as a first line support, and also because they find me sociable with the end users(the previous interns weren't like me is what I was told). They gave me the title of IT Engineer during the few weeks of summer where I kept working for them until my new school year started at a University, where I want to get my Bachelors in Cyber Security with Software as my major. 

Now my boss is really good at his job, he's the architect, the engineer and the system administrator. He's basically the entire backbone of our company, and during the move to another building he implemented large network changes; this cost him a lot of time and he sort of suffered from a burn-out (arguments with management, working too much). When I started my new school year, he got a new intern that he couldn't rely on too much, saying that IT wasn't the new interns passion, he wasn't very knowledgeable. Up until like two months ago, my boss worked as a freelancer for our company, he's now the IT manager; and he isn't too motivated to still resolve first line issues, and I find that understandable, every conversation I have with him he blows my mind up with new things I've never learned about. 

He proposed the following thing to me: 

* Quit your semester at your university, come work for me part-time, but, if you'd like to continue studying, do it during night school, and we'll pay your education. 

Maybe some of you would obviously say that I should go for it; but I'm having some thoughts against it;

* I really like being a full-time student, and being capable of experiencing the student life
* I don't know if I'm academically motivated enough to pursue night school
* What if I don't want to work at this company after I get my degree?

I've asked my mother for advice, but she just kept mentioning issues; what my question is: have any of you been in similar situations? What did you do? If you weren't in a similar situation, what would you do if you were? Maybe I should just ask one of my professors, I really don't know what to do... "

The first exam didn't seem too hard, but a lot of the questions were questions I was unfamiliar with as they weren't similar to the practice exam and homework.  I thought of the practice exam and HW easy, but the actual exam was an entire new world. I later talked to people who did well, and I realized that one of the biggest misses I did when studying was not doing any practice problems from the textbook/syllabus.

I already have a fairly heavy courseload (Discrete 1, Comp Arch and Intro to Linear Algebra). If i were to take 133, I would be able to have a lot of stress out of mind.  At the same time, I also didn't even do well on my first exam for Discrete as well, meaning I also have another class i'm panicking about. All of this stress and work is even preventing me from focusing on applying for internships.

My GPA isn't so hot (about a 2.9), and i'm trying to use this semester to help increase it. But i'm wondering if Chem 133 is really worth it to miss out my chance to finish up Chem 161 and move on to Chem 162. I can also reconsider about taking physics if I do make this decision. I know about the Final Exam Replacement Rule and having to attend remediaton, but there's a strong risk if I decide to stay.

So for those of you who have taken 133, how efficient was it when you retook Chem 161? And for everyone, what do you believe is my best decision? Should I go for 133 and make my life easier, or attempt take the risk of taking remediation and hope that I do well for the rest of the course?"

This is a legitimate bachelor's degree in computer science, and you will learn core CS fundamentals. It is a huge step up from a coding boot camp. Overall, I would give the program a B+. Don't go into this program thinking it will be perfect. If you went to a really good university prior to this, you will probably be disappointed with some of the lectures. That's ok. Think of this program as a second chance for your career. If you have the option to attend a reputable in-person university instead, definitely do that. But most of us don't have that option due to various university restrictions, work schedules, etc. I think this program is mainly for people who want to become software developers. If you already work in the field, or can self-teach and don't care about only being able to work for companies that don't care about degrees, certainly try to self-teach first to save money and time. But for most of us, a CS degree is the way to go to become a developer. Also, if you plan on only doing the bare minimum during the program, don't bother. **TL;DR:** I recommend this program for most people. 



**Advice for future students:**


I did not do all of these things, but wish I had. YMMV.

Before you start this program, sit down and do some soul searching. Why are you going back to school? Why do you want to be a developer? What went wrong in your old career? You will probably have some difficult moments during this degree. You need a motivation to keep you going. Write these reasons down if you want to.

Decide on how long you will take to finish the degree. I recommend two years, but three would probably be fine too. Four years seems too long and drawn out, unless you need to work full time during the whole program, have a family, and want to have plenty of time for projects. I do not recommend the one year track under any circumstances. You will be too overloaded with schoolwork, you won't have a social life or time to relax, and you certainly won't have time for side projects or internships. 

Grades are important, but not too important. Make sure your GPA stays above a 3.5. After that, your focus should be on internships and projects. And of course, make sure you're actually understanding the concepts in each class.

The recommended order of classes for each track is more of a suggestion. In my opinion, try to take these classes as soon as possible: 

* 261
* 290
* 340
* 325

261 and 325 are essential for technical interviews. 290 and 340 will help you get some projects on your resume. You also might consider taking 467 your second-to-last term, so you can put your capstone project on your resume sooner. If you need a GPA booster, go ahead and take 352. It's really not that bad. Otherwise, choose electives that interest you. 

Now for what I believe to be the most important part: Get an internship as early as possible, get as many internships as possible, and do as many interesting projects as possible. Realistically, one internship and one side project is probably just fine. It's better to do one thing really well than half-ass a few things. But internships will really make your life easier down the road, and the earlier you can get one, the higher the chance that you'll be able to get a really interesting one later on. After your very first term, start applying. It doesn't matter if you aren't qualified, just apply to anything you find. Even if it's not a great internship, even if it's an hour bus ride away, as long as you'll be doing some programming during it, just get something under your belt for a few months. Ideally, in the few weeks before you start the program, learn HTML and CSS. They're easy to pick up. After your first term, learn some basic JavaScript. That hopefully should be enough to get you a front end development internship somewhere. After that first internship, you can be pickier and get something that interests you more. However, do not feel bad if you have a hard time getting an internship! Keep applying, and hopefully you'll have at least one internship before graduation. Just don't be too picky and pass up opportunities that can help you later on.

As for projects, you'll make some decent projects in your classes, but try to make at least one on your own. Pick something, and stick to it, even if you get bored. Just get something finished. Also, one big project is more impressive than a couple of small projects. Projects and internships are what employers are looking for when you start applying for full-time jobs.

Interview prep: it sucks, but it's necessary. After you're done with 325, start practicing Leetcode problems, work through Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI), etc. Don't try to cram all your prep into the last three months before graduation. Space it out to let the concepts really sink in.

I think that's about it. I'm going to leave you with some resources down below for further reading. Good luck! It is a grind at times, but remember: it's only for a few years. You don't want to graduate with any regrets on how you could've done more outside of classes. You've got this!



**Resources:**


* reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions - can be a circlejerk, but overall, some very useful advice, especially about how the interview process works in general for tech companies. Just don't get sucked in and waste hours reading posts.

* http://calnewport.com/blog/archive/ - Cal Newport has great advice on how to be a student. Managing your time wisely and learning to focus are hugely important. 

* Github - there are many simple tutorials to show you the basics. I like this cheatsheet: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf



**My personal experience:**


I ended up only getting one internship in the program. If I had followed the above advice I have no doubt I could have had at least two good internships. The internship was fine, but only paid $10/hr and was a bit disorganized/chaotic. However, I ended up making a connection that later got me my job -- more on that later. 

I started applying for jobs in July and kept applying through the beginning of September. The application process for most companies took longer than I had expected. I applied to many different companies -- most local, some ""distributed"" (i.e. remote jobs) -- and many positions that I applied to I wasn't qualified for. I just applied anyway, because I've heard it's a numbers game and you just have to get your resume to as many companies as possible. Here are some stats:


* Applied to 48 companies total
* For many/most of the jobs, I didn't have all of the ""required"" qualifications
* At least 15 of those were long shots - I was really underqualified, tons of applicants, etc.
* 3 companies weren't hiring anymore - old job postings
* Most companies didn't bother getting back to me at all
* 8 companies gave me a phone interview
* 2 technical online tests
* 5 companies invited me for onsite interviews
* At this point, I dropped out of the running for all but 2 companies, so I don't know whether the others would've given me offers.
* 2 offers!


Both offers were good -- the companies each had some negatives, but lots of positives too. I decided to take a job at a medical device company doing C++! Starting salary is $82K plus annual bonuses. (I live in a medium cost-of-living area.) 

I never would have applied for this job because the job posting was for a mid-level developer. However, I was referred by an old co-worker from my internship who now works there, and that helped so much! That's another reason why internships are so important -- references and possible referrals (not to mention the possibility of converting your internship into a full-time position after graduation). I also spent a lot of time this summer (67 hours actually) practicing interview questions. I started with CTCI, but mostly used Leetcode. Don't neglect this crucial step in preparing for interviews! I wish I had spent closer to 100 hours practicing, but oh well. I also wish I had waited to apply to my first choice company until I had more leetcode practice -- I failed the technical test, but I was really close. One more month and I might have passed it.


Feel free to ask me any questions!

75bile,5,2017-10-09,How do I figure out a good career goal?,irockface18,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/75bile/how_do_i_figure_out_a_good_career_goal/,"I posted under the Career Advice subreddit asking for advice on beginning a career in higher education awhile back but now, here I am a little broken, confused, and just down right pitiful on searching my career path.

I am a 28 y/o female, spent 8 years in college just to get my undergrad because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do, changed my major 3 times, graduated last year, and now here I am still trying to find a career path that works for me. By year 6 I said to myself ""Okay...we need to get out of here and actually find a job."" I started college right out of high school with big plans on becoming a counselor - I would still like to...maybe. I really wanted to work with substance abuse patients, primarily suffering from alcoholism. Shortly in to college I found out a bachelors in psych wouldn't get me very far and I would at least need a masters to do any sort of counseling like I had planned. I wasn't gung ho enough to go right in to a masters. So then I got into an art major as that's what I have been good at my whole life. Almost get done with my degree, and boom...same thing. Can't find any kind of decent job with a degree in studio art. So I finally settled for something in the middle of the road with a marketing degree so I could use my creative side while understanding the responsibilities of working for or running a large company. Again, I had plans on working for a decent marketing or advertising firm but was shot down for the third time. Finding marketing internships were damn near impossible. The two that I had were bogus, did nothing to help me further my marketing career and instead I ran coffee around the office. After finally speaking with some insiders in some of the companies I wanted to work for I was told you had to know someone really high up or you had to graduate from an ivy league school to even get your foot in the door as most of the surviving companies were bought out from big companies in New York or LA. This burnt me out and graduation was barreling towards me and my dead end jobs weren't going to help.

Right after graduation, I found what I thought was going to be a perfect job for me at a local start up company. I was getting to create product ideas, market to kids who worked in the same industry as me, and it was laid back. I was on cloud 9. A month or so down the road and I noticed drugs and alcohol running around the office like a frat house. I was responsible for working trade shows and was put in motels out of state with prostitutes and drug dealers. I can't make this up! I struggled to find another job to get out of the crazy place I ended up and began working for a state agency. I felt things were looking up when I finally landed a job earning benefits but again, shortly after my bosses became toxic and unethical things were said racially and sexist towards me and my coworkers (yes I reported it). People were dropping like flies due to the lack of respect and pay. This was a common issue in the building. There is also no where else I would like to move in to within the company. It's been hell but I have been hanging on in hopes of something new showing up soon.

I am feeling so burnt out. I have ideas of the places I would love to work or types of jobs I would like but they are either far away from me and moving isn't an option or they just haven't hired me yet. I seem to be in a black hole when applying for jobs because when applying for entry level positions they say I am overqualified due to my degree but if I apply for anything higher, I get turned down because I don't have enough experience. All the jobs I apply for I can do blindfolded with my hands tied behind my back or at least close enough to it to make sure I can move up. I have had my resume reviewed and edited multiple times on top of everything else.

Right now I either want to eventually become an academic advisor at a university or work in human resources but I just can't seem to get my foot in the door anywhere to prove my work ethic and knowledge. What I put on paper does reflect me but I don't feel as though it's enough. Every time I try to research jobs I feel like I am staring at a blank wall I am so tired and bummed. The rare occasion a job pops up that is a perfect fit for me I do whatever I can to try to look awesome without seeming too needy and it doesn't work out. I just want to find a career. Somewhere I can start out low on the totem pole and work my way up after proving myself. I don't expect to land a high up job because I want to know the staff, the company, their policies, etc not to mention I can't hahaha!

I guess to sum this all up is is there any advice on ways to really find a good fit for me - such as helpful tips or tricks to find a good job placement with my career goals and current experience and education? Without experience in the areas I am interested in, what can I do to prove my worth and really show them how great of an asset I could be? I pride myself in being a hard worker and a quick learner but I just can't seem to stand out over those who do have experience. I know I am not the only one in this boat and I actually had a deep conversation with a successful stranger who said ""Don't worry, your twenties is all about figuring out those questions you have and yes - it's very hard."" I apologize for the length but just trying to give as much details as possible to help move in the right direction.

Thanks!"

75dv48,1,2017-10-09,Unsure whether to pursue MS or graduate.. with unique circumstances,embarrassedCSstudent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/75dv48/unsure_whether_to_pursue_ms_or_graduate_with/,"So I am currently in the fall of my final year at CSULA finishing up a long trek to get my BS that started at UC Berkeley. When I was at Berkeley my head was in the wrong place and having a grandparent die and a girlfriend that left me for meth led me to eventually fail out. Yeah I shouldve taken a year off, but I didn't understand how hard failing out of college would be. 

I entered CSULA a year after I failed out and started the finish up my degree. I am currently 2 semesters and a summer term deep and am doing very well, I have an overall 3.85 GPA from undergraduate coursework thus far, and generally don't find the school terribly challenging. Unfortunately, with my poor overall GPA (i left berkeley with a 1.95) and general lack of experience, I am afraid that I won't be able to land a job anywhere. Currently I have no internship experience, and on my resume just have a side job in marketing I am working now, as well as a few class projects (including a year long project in tandem with a real company from our required Senior Design curriculum). 

Personally I really would like to get work in Data Science in one way or another. I am currently taking an intro class to data science and will take the more advanced data science class next semester. 

So the following seem to be my options, and I am stressing out a lot over this and deadlines are approaching.

1- Finish up BS degree at CSULA, and apply for jobs off the bat in data science using my knowledge from the two classes I will have taken by then. On my resume I would have a couple class projects as well as some personal projects I am starting now, in terms of what is directly applicable to a job in data science. My only concern is that no matter what I achieve between now and then, a degree from a school with no recognition such as CSULA will mean nothing and I will be unable to find a job. 

2 - At a minimal cost I can become part of the blended BS/MS program at CSULA. This would allow me to potentially do a data science related research project as my thesis and have a lot more experience in the field. I would also be allowed to take more classes related to data science, such as statistics, machine learning/AI, graduate level data science... etc. I would be done with this program by the end of next school year and would be able to apply for jobs with a wider base of knowledge. Again I am afraid that name recognition of the degree from CSULA would be low and may not help me too much, but I may be able to make a case that it was cost efficient (would only cost me around $14,000 total). 

3 - Take the GRE and apply to other MS programs. I've always done well on standardized testing (34 ACT), and this way I can attempt to get a more recognizable name on my resume when applying to jobs. I am unsure whether or not I would be considered at decent programs but think I could possibly manage to get into USC due to legacy and my turnaround ""success"" story. However, this would obviously be the most expensive option and I'm unsure if it is worth it. 

If someone could help me with this issue it would be greatly appreciated, it is weighing down on me heavily and I'm already 24 without a BS, so taking another year off applying to jobs before I realize I need a MS is really not an option I would like to consider. 

Thank you so much for your replies.

75dxjj,2,2017-10-09,Should I take this video game QA internship offer?,fredrobin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/75dxjj/should_i_take_this_video_game_qa_internship_offer/,"Recently got an offer at N//vidia to be a Game Quality Assurance Tester. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, and am really interested in moving forward with a career related to processors/GPUs. I am also interested in obtaining a more hardware-related internship. This is one of my dream companies to work for, but I am unsure about the position that I am being offered. I've read a lot of pros and cons about working in QA, and ultimately it seems to mostly act as a sort of ""stepping stone"" for a lot of people to get closer to achieving careers in other fields, like development. In addition to this, the internship is in the Spring and it seems like I'd be one of the only interns there.

Should I skip a semester of school to intern at my dream company even if it's for a position that I am not entirely sure about? Or should I continue to apply to other internships in hopes of getting a more hardware-based position?

I'm hesitant about skipping a semester -- school was really hard for me to get through in the earlier semesters due to having a lack of friends in my major, but now that I've made a good amount it's gotten so much easier since I can study with them, etc. Taking this internship would mean that I would barely have any classes with them, and I really don't want to go back to how it was a couple of years ago (currently a Junior). On the other hand, I think working at this company would be a great opportunity and I'm not sure I want to pass it up. Any advice?

TL;DR: Got offered a QA internship for the Spring semester. Do not want to be in QA long term, and am hesitant about skipping a semester of school due to falling behind my friends/study-buddies, but this offer is at my dream company and I feel like this could lead to more opportunities to pursue my digital-design related interests in the future."

I am discouraged, stressed, and very lost so please provide me with whatever help you guys are able to. Thank you.

I graduated back in June of 2016 with a BS in CS from a UC (University of California) school with no internship experience. Fortunately, I've had interviews and made it to the final round with one company as well as one on-site with another (both through referrals). Unfortunately, I didn't do well and am still unemployed in the field that I have my degree in. I was applying but did not get many responses at all. When I do get some responses, they are usually rejections. It's been more than a year and I'm slowly losing faith in my ability to land a job in my major.

I've been a slump these past few months and finally worked up enough courage and motivation to get my a** on here and ask for your guys' help. 

These are a few problems that I've came up with from my observation I would love your guys' advice on:

1. I stumble and struggle to answer ""what kind of programming do you like to do?"" whenever someone asked me that question. I have some iOS development experience with an app I worked on released on the App store from my time attending an iOS app dev academy. I liked iOS development when I did it. Other than that, I've worked with Java, C, and shell scripting back in my academic days. So to answer that question, I really don't know what kind of programming I like. I've tried looking into backend, front end, etc but the explanation of what they are is quite broad so that doesn't lead me anywhere. What can I do to figure out what I like? 

2. Building on the first point, an interviewer told me ""you're a jack of all trades and master of none,"" which I agree to a certain extent. However, I'm not choosing to be a jack of all trades on purpose. I'm bouncing around different trades because I'm unsure of what I really want to do and focus on. Should I just pick something, like frontend, backend, etc and just focus, study, and find a job in that arena to see if I like it?

3. This is a question, what would your guys' general advice be for someone in my shoes who's struggling to find a job 1.5 years out of school? I'm defeated but I'm doing my best to change that so I would really appreciate any advice.

Thank you very much for your guys' time and effort. "

Basically I need an outside unbiased opinion about my situation. I've been working at an MSP for a little over a year. My first six months were unpaid as an intern, where I zombied together an SDN device that the owner claimed would sell for millions (it hasn't and it won't since I stopped working on it) and implemented an SNMP trapping VM or physical box across all of our clients. I also assisted in various pen-tests, which is what I'm really interested in. I know most places wouldn't let such a newbie do pen-testing, so I wanted to stick around for the experience. After my six months I got minimum wage. I was then given the project of implementing a completely new RMM system from scratch with pretty much no help and told to make it work in 3 months. I finished about 80% of it and am still working on it. 

I graduated in June. Originally when I was hired my employer said they would hire me full time immediately out of college with a salary of 48k. About 3 weeks before I graduated he changed his mind and said we would be part time until we got certifications. About a month after graduation he said he wanted to revamp all the positions, and basically put everyone at a T1 role with a pay of $15-19 an hour with the prospect of moving to T2 after 3 years of working there.  I know I will be doing the exact same things I currently am doing and nothing would change, even though T1 roles are ""only"" supposed to do helpdesk. He also started trying to bully out our only T3 admin, who also happens to be the employee that's been there the longest at a whopping 3 years. Do I struggle through the $15 an hour until I get my few years of experience and then move on or get out of there ASAP? Is this normal at other IT jobs? My boss said that he treats us very well compared to other IT companies, but he's always yelling at us and giving us 3 hour lectures about how we fucked up."

I’ve just started interning for the IT department at a company for almost a month now and I feel clueless sometimes. Here’s some background:

I’m currently in my last semester at a university majoring in MIS. Most of the classes I’ve taken at my uni are business related, and some IS courses like Networking, Data Management systems, and IS analysis. These courses don’t exactly correlate to what I’m currently doing at my internship (help desk, AD, setting up computers for employees, troubleshooting printers, etc). 

So far at my job, I’ve been given tasks/tickets that I sometimes have trouble completing because of my lack of knowledge with PC systems in a corporate environment. I ask questions when I can, but sometimes my peers don’t elaborate enough and I am hesitant to ask them to clarify.  

My questions to you professionals out there are:
-How long did it take before you had a good grasp of IT? 
-What can I do in order to maximize learning and improvement at my current job?
-What other advice do you have for newbies who have just entered the industry?

In South Africa we have an institution called WeThinkCode_, I thought this was the answer, it's a 2 year course followed by a year's work experience, kind of like an internship program. So I took the test. It was 3 sections, the first was a bunch of blocks that flashed in an order, you then had to click which blocks flashed. More and more blocks came on screen until time ran out. The second section was making shapes from other shapes. One of those puzzle games, where they show you an image and you have to make it using the shapes they give you. The third test was the only one related to programming in my opinion, you had to guide a car to collect all the stars using a loop and a certain amount of instructions. I unfortunately failed the second section so didn't make it into the course, this test was to see if you have a mind for programming and according to it I don't... So do I keep trying to code or do I look for something else? 

Edit: After failing I tweeted about doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I think they saw that because the following day I got an email from them inviting me to the bootcamp. Thanks for all the suggestions :) I really appreciate it. "
75f8jd,2,2017-10-10,Should I do GW Data Analytics Boot Camp?,ksoangxhc,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/75f8jd/should_i_do_gw_data_analytics_boot_camp/,"I am finishing my undergrad in math this semester while working on a freelance machine learning project. I have taken a good amount of modeling, stat, and numerical classes but my gpa is bad (mid-low 2's) Also I have no internships.

I tried making up for this with auditing some of coursera, datacamp for python, and eventually finding my freelance work but it seems like full time recruiters are very hesitant to continue with my app after seeing my gpa. (makes sense)

GW's boot camp seems the best for me, since the others will either require relocation or later finishing times due to prereq scheduling. It goes over excel, sql, python for ml (not neural nets...), visualization, hadoop, and ends with a capstone in 24 weeks.

I believe I can do this while getting another freelance project starting Feb 2018. Is the $10k worth, as I will obv try very hard upon joining it, or should I just spam job apps for anything related to data, soft eng, etc while doing freelance next year?

*GW takes a security deposit which, if I get in, will be paid in about a month so after that I wont be applying for full time jobs then. Thanks!

75fbs6,8,2017-10-10,My father is dying,dk_ad,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/75fbs6/my_father_is_dying/,"When I was 7 years old my father was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. I was constantly worried that my dad was going to die even though I wasn't really sure what that truly meant at the time. That period in my life was very confusing and is still a blur to this day. In 2005, however, my dad received a heart transplant from a 17-year-old kid who had died in a car accident. 

Now my dad and I have always been close even when he was sick. There were many things we did together just the two of us even though I have three other siblings. He would take me on long car rides while we would listen to NPR and he would always ask for my opinion on whatever subject was being discussed. He really was more of a best friend to me than a father. He told me everything and would even ask for advice on certain issues. After his transplant, he really passed down valuable wisdom like how to not let money control your choices, don't let the little things get to you, etc. I really looked up to him.

Things weren't as black and white as I got older. I got in a really bad, abusive relationship with someone for almost three years. He was physically and emotionally abusive to me and it really changed me as a person. This relates back to my dad because he knew about the abuse. I had shown him marks, bruises, mentioned the horrible things that my ex said to me but my dad didn't stand up for me. When I needed him most he failed me. I was a 17-year-old girl (broke up with the fucker at 20), I didn't have the knowledge or confidence to realize that it was not okay for someone to treat me the way my ex treated me. My dad definitely didn't want me to be with him but he never stood up for me. Even after my ex and I broke up my dad and he stayed in contact. Now, this event is significant because this really enforced this feeling that I am alone and feel I can't count on my family to be there for me in the way that I need them.

Fast forward to now...in mid-July I was away from home for an internship and received a call one day that my dad had a heart attack. Apparently, he didn't even know he was having a heart attack since he did not feel any pain just ill. The only reason why he went to the hospital according to my mother is that my sister said he needed to go. Again, it was a miracle.

Since then he has been in the intensive care unit. Doctors are currently trying to get him listed for another transplant, but unfortunately, the medical board believes he will not survive the surgery so they won't approve.

All my life I have been in a constant fear that my dad could die to the point where other hospital visits, surgeries, emergency visits have never bothered me. Now I suddenly feel scared like my world has been turned upside down. Everything just feels so wrong.

I feel angry, alone, depressed, anxious, dirty, nothing is right. I'm in school right now (and am expected to graduate in May) and my classes aren't even bad but studying has never been so difficult. I keep picking fights with my boyfriend of almost four years. The smallest things are getting under my skin. I'm slowly unraveling and for the past few months, I have denied that it has anything to do with my dad and it is just me. I keep having nervous breakdowns triggered by the smallest things. All my classmates are trying to find jobs, but I'm just here asking myself ""wha's the point of all this?"" ""why am I here?"" ""I myself can die, what the fuck am I doing?"" ""If my dad can sit in a hospital bed for months, I need to get over my stress and be strong for him""

I'm not sure what I'm looking for because I know advice won't change the situation. I just feel alone and lost. I just needed to vent."

Firstly, I play a video game competitively and I’m not sure if I should list it. I spent several hours a week practicing, scrimming, and analyzing with my team and I love it. The thing is, the game is still quite small. Tournaments have small or no prizes and viewership is somewhat low. Will this stop people from seeing it as “legitimate,” because I haven’t really earned much from my play? (for anyone wondering, the game is [Gigantic.](https://youtu.be/muLx0HxqWh) It’s super cool, check it out!)

Secondly, I’m doing this really cool internship during the school year. The thing is, my time spent there is during the school day for a class. It’ll likely have a lot of out-of-class elements like presenting at conferences, but should I not include it because it’s technically for a class?

75i5me,5,2017-10-10,I make 80k....should I quit and start over,LostandMillennial,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/75i5me/i_make_80kshould_i_quit_and_start_over/,"I'm 26 years old. I make 80k a year. I'm in a very powerful union and cannot be fired. Seriously, ppl who are drunk or high on the job don't get fired. I have great health benifits and a pension. And, to top it all off, can fully retire at 54. And I mean FULLY retire. Check out of life; I'm done, retired.

But....

I'm unhappy. I'm bored  I'm unfulfilled. I feel like lost potential. I had hopes and dreams for myself and I can see them slipping away. I feel like a cog in a machine; another nameless piece toiling away for someone else. I feel unappreciated and sad. 

My body hurts from the 12 hour shifts. I'm tired from working rotating nights and days. I commute. I breath in dust and stone fines. And on some days: honest to god cancer causing carcinogens.

I'm thankful for the union, but it causes a lot of drama. I can't move up. I'm stuck behind guys as young as me who've only got their high school diploma. Guys who's only previous work experience has been pumping gas or flipping burgers (Their father's got them this job). And because I'm so junior I am forced to do the shit nobody else wants to do while they hide and sleep. The animosity in the air is toxic.

I got here because of debt and fear. I graduated from university 4 years ago. I had debt. Lots of debt. Nobody was hiring. My industry of choice was in a time of transformation. I couldn't even land a part time unpaid internship. Seriously. And, even if I did, how was I going to pay rent and intrest? So I got a job.

I saved every single dollar. I moved back home. I lived in a shared apartment with strange men in one of the worst areas. Drugs, guns, hookers, my street had it. But I paid my debt off. 

Then I got this job, and the money started poring in. I saved some more and bought a triplex. I am a success. I make more than 95% of ppl I know. I've been smart with my money and am on pace to have a very wealthy retirement. 

I never wanted to be doing this. I grew up in a small farming community and always dreamed of escaping. I wanted to go into publishing, journalism, or copywriting. Something with words. I even considered teaching. But nobody was hiring. Not for teachers, not for editors, and especially not for writers. 

So now I'm at a crossroads. I can keep my life. I will have all my needs met and I can retire early. Ppl will continue to envy my life and success. Hell i can even invest mire and buy more property too!

Or

I can start over. 

I can go back to school for 1 year. Take a copywriting program and get a 25 to 30k job as a bottom rung copywriter. Then work my way up over time. 

I could ride my bike to work. I wouldn't have to breath in dust and carcinogens. I could go home at 5 every day. I could do something fun and creative, something I want to do, every day. 

But there's no guarantees.

My generation has no job security. We have no pensions. No health benifits. We are part time or contract workers. This is our reality. 

The fact I have one of the only jobs left that has a pension and health benifits and steady income and security is insane.

But I hate it. And, more importantly, I'm not proud of myself.

So here's the question: what would you do? What should I do? Is starting over only to join the millions of other millenials fighting it out over freelancer/contract positions worth it? Would it be ridiculius to make a massive career change for something like copywriting? Am I being a millennial baby? Should I just grow up? If this was any other generation they would be happier than pig in shit to be where i am. Should i forget my degree and childhood dreams and accept that I'm in a good place and just make the best of it?

Thank you

75i6c8,2,2017-10-10,Have you had your offer changed on you after you've accepted it? What did you do?,offerchangedwtf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/75i6c8/have_you_had_your_offer_changed_on_you_after/,"I had a great time at my internship last summer and was planning on returning, but from advice I received I decided to try out something new. I received a few offers, one of them from a well-known finance firm, and I ultimately decided to take it. I accepted the offer, then later cancelled my other offers and interviews.

The offer said:

&gt; Base salary is $X biweekly. Additionally, you will receive a payment of $Y as a bonus and can be used at your discretion. In addition, as an intern you have the choice between housing provided by us at no cost to you or a payment of $Y for finding your own housing.

Notice that the bonus amount is the same amount as the housing stipend. This is important. The sign-on bonus is roughly 20% of the total compensation (salary X number of paychecks).

The next day I received an email asking me to confirm the location, position, compensation, etc of the offer I accepted. I noticed they did not mention the sign-on bonus. I emailed the recruiter telling them of the mistake and they replied saying I am incorrect, the sign-on bonus does not apply to me because I accepted the internship housing. I won't assume malicious intent, but their refusal to admit their mistake is troubling. They are adamant that my interpretation of the offer is incorrect, when I don't believe anyone would find that to be the case.

Has a company changed an offer on you before? Did they admit their mistake or was it for some other reason? Would you consider this to be a red flag significant enough to cancel the offer outright, or would you negotiate for a better offer in light of the lack of bonus? I still have the backup of my previous internship (which would pay better than this offer sans-bonus anyway)."

Now I've been working at my company for a year and a half and school for almost a year, I want out.

I'm loving the developer life, but having some problems with our practices at work, and now sure what to do about it.

We have a typical lamp stack but we aren't using any new technology. No frameworks, no package managers, no testing, and word docs from our PM's for project feedback. This is so different than the time I had at my internship and I sort of feel like our practices are so far out of wack, and we are missing out on so many things that could make our products better and make our team more efficient. I've brought up a few things and our team lead is sort of willing to look into some new things/processes, but the majority of the other developers just complain about new stuff and have 0 desire to change the way they work. I don't want it to seem like ""I KNOW BETTER"", but our practices are not at all what I read about when I read about best-practices.

I'm still learning tons as a new developer, so I'm satisfied with that, but I also don't want to develop bad habits such as no testing/code reviews. Do I just sit still, keep me head down and focus on that stuff on the side on my own, or do I pipe up and keep mentioning it even if I'm the annoying new kid?"

Some background info for context: I'm a college senior studying CS, currently recruiting for full-time software engineering jobs. It's worth noting that I've been dealing with anxiety since I was in high school, but it's never manifested as a panic attack. Also, this wasn't my first ever technical interview nor phone screen; I've done 3 internships at different companies throughout college, although they each had fairly lax interview processes. I wouldn't say that I'm a confident interviewer, but I can usually hold my own.

However, that wasn't the case today. The interview started off well; the question was relatively easy, and I was able to quickly code up a brute force solution. When I began to write an optimized version of the solution, the interviewer noted that I had made a minor mistake. He was very polite about it, but for some reason, that completely threw me off of my game. At that point, my mind went blank, I got silent, and I literally froze up. It was all downhill from there. I sat on the phone for about 10 more minutes with the interviewer, saying close to nothing while he tried to give me hints. As the minutes passed, my heart started pounding, and it became difficult to breathe. Finally, I did probably the worst thing I could have: I hung up without a word. The interviewer attempted to call me back a few times, but I just let the phone ring.

I know that I've seriously fucked up, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle this. The interview was with a ""big N"" company that I'd prefer not to permanently burn bridges with. At the moment, I'm torn between emailing my recruiter with an explanation of what happened, and quietly waiting for a rejection email. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Please be nice, I've never actually posted on Reddit, so I'm very new to this formatting. Also, I am not actually in tech support, but this is a story from a few years ago at a Museum. 

**$me - 9kmm as an undergrad intern** 

**$nsup - my super nice, but not tech saavy, supervisor**

And so to set the scene...

At the time, I was an intern at a Museum in *major city,* looking to make my impending humanities degree seem more marketable. The Museum had a great IT guy, but the poor man was swamped with issues related to running a Museum with computers that hadn't been updated past Windows XP and users who sometimes struggled to turn their computer on. So whenever I, or any of the more knowledgable employees, encountered a tech issue we tried to resolve it ourselves so that he wouldn't have to make the trip to our little office. 

I was assigned by $nsup to assist with some research, but she quickly changed her mind when she realized that the laptop she needed me to use could not connect to ~~Reddit~~ the internet for accessing databases. 

&gt; $nsup: ""Oh that's right, this laptop mysteriously stopped connecting to *The Google*. Well I guess you can go ask IT guy to ~~cry over this computer~~ take a look at this.

&gt; $me: ""No, its ok, I'll take a look at it""

I thought ""hey, I am a young adult in a tech oriented world, I can solve this **quickly**"" 

 *one hour later* 

&gt; $nsup: ""Hey have you had a chance to look at the laptop? Did you get it working or should I just call IT guy?""

&gt; $me: ""No, but I feel like I've almost got it. I've tried everything I can think of so far. I forgot the network, I restarted the computer, I checked that other devices can connect, its plugged in to power so that should do something, and I spent ~~an hour~~ a few minutes looking up potential solutions. Just give me a bit more time!"" 

*$nsup stares blankly at me and my slightly crazed expression before nodding an affirmation* 

And then it hit me. I had fallen into the classic trap of the ~~lUser~~ overly educated user. As I felt my heart fall into my stomach, I slowly turned the brick of a laptop over in my hands and scanned the sides of the machine. 

And then I saw it. The little switch. Clearly labelled and laughing at me and my youthful ignorance. 

I slowly slide the wifi switch to **ON** and set the laptop down. As hundreds of emails flooded the damn brick with a bright, happy to be connected to the internet again, ding, $nsup looked over surprised. 

&gt; $nsup: ""Oh my gosh you kids are just so good with tech! Thank you for fixing that!""

I am really bored by the whole process and want to look for places that don't require me to study for these interviews. I had a terrible professor in Algorithms, and wanted to ask you guys what to do. The interviews are in the next 2 weeks, and I feel like I'm not ready, although each problem I can recognize and say which group of problems it belongs to. I passed one round of coding challenges, but I guess that was just luck. Somehow I just lost my will to study for this and really hate the process, as I believe no one can sum up years of programming skills in 45 minutes...

Ultimately, I currently plan to work in finance/consulting. However, I believe that a CS internship before then would be great in order to figure out if SWE is more attractive than the programming courses I'm in make it out to be, and so I'd like to get a CS internship this summer. 

How should I go about marketing myself to showcase the fact that my despite my inexperience, I have a knack for CS concepts?

I am trying to prepare myself for what to expect:

1. Is the final round a superday and if so what exactly is a superday?
2. what are some questions that I can expect?
3. are final round interviews based on your location preference or does everyone get invited to a final round in NYC?
4. Will i meet with teams that are interested in me specifically?
5. is it okay if i dont know the answer to every technical question and what would your advice be for handling ones that I don't know?
6. can you share your experience at BoA if you interned there (and share what position you held)?
7. how soon can you expect to hear back after this ""final round"" ?

Background: After junior year I completed a 4-month SW engineering internship at a Bay Area health sciences company. I didn’t know much about the company and it's products, but I was hired to a team doing exciting work that I could dive into immediately. I enjoyed my time there and at the end of the internship I accepted a generous full-time offer for that team.

4 months ago when I rejoined, I learned that the team had a new PM with a very different style of management. She prefers strict individual directives from her set master plan (kinda like we’re factory workers) rather than agile development, even though the team was performing very well by all metrics previously. She doesn’t take well to any resistance or questioning of her plan and it’s started to spur a toxic environment among team members (our tech leads are afraid to speak up). I still find the work interesting, but the tasks I receive now have very limited opportunities to learn from (as she thinks new hires should not be trusted with complex tasks), and I see almost no potential to get promoted in the near (or far) future. I’ve considered an internal transfer but since it’s a health company there aren’t many SW positions for new grads. 

So here’s where I need advice: I see a few issues with leaving for another job right now. First, its been a long time since I’ve interviewed and my algo/technical interview skills are super rusty at this point (as well as my github not being used). Second, I’m worried about how it would look to employers leaving 4 months into my first full-time job…wouldn’t they be worried I would just do the same to them? These are definitely unusual circumstances but how would I convey this to them? I’m not sure where to go from here…I don’t want to quit and start looking full time because I don’t have enough $$ to continue to live in the bay area with no job. Should I start applying now and grind like hell, or try to endure for longer so it looks better?

Thank you for the advice!!!

TL;DR: Toxic work environment 4 months into first full-time job and want to leave, not sure whether to stay longer or to start looking now."

I'm a college student and this summer (during my internship) I wanted to do some extra work in the free time I had so I started looking for some part-time dev jobs online. I found one for a pretty cool startup who promised to compensate me for the work I put in. 3 or 4 weeks or so of working there part time I still didn't recieve any pay and they were asking very highly of me and dropping random deadlines without notice so I decided to leave the job. My question is it worth putting the job down in my resume/linkedin?

I'm not sure because if someone background checks the people in the company might not speak very fondly of me. Right now I've put it down as a point under Software Engineer (Contractor) on my resume with a few other jobs I did.

75m20w,1,2017-10-10,How to ask for a raise....as an intern? Got a job offer from them so I'm transitioning into my job until graduation,thegrayexperience,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/75m20w/how_to_ask_for_a_raiseas_an_intern_got_a_job/,"To preface this, I'm a senior graphic design major currently taking 17 credits. I've been fortunate enough to have access to adobe software for my 8 years of high school/college career, allowing my to develop my program proficiency and accumulate experience. I'm a charismatic person who truly enjoys seeing a team succeed, even if it means picking up the slack myself. I'm not a cocky person, but I recognize that I am very talented for my age and have a lot more design experience than almost all my classmates. **TL;DR at bottom**

Right at the beginning of the semester, my professor sent me an opening for a local digital marketing firm. I applied, got the internship, and started on September 1 at $10 an hour. The place is great, and it's growing quick (they went from like 10&gt;25 employees over the past year and have a new office building under construction ready to go up by the end of the school year). I love the job and get to design ebooks, infographics, web ads, and a few other miscellaneous tasks. I'm not sure if their previous designers were not great at their job or what, but since I've been there people won't stop commenting how quickly I work and turn my projects around for them.This made me happy and in turn, start working harder to see how far ahead I could on my projects. By halfway through the second week, I had considerably caught up on my project list to the point where I was working on projects that were at least a week out from their due date.

On September 18, literally the 7th day I worked, I got called in to the conference room to talk with the designer I report to and our CEO. The CEO talked about how he's been hearing nothing but great things, how impressed he is that I've earned the whole office's trust so easily, how I've earned his respect, etc. Just really jerking me off and stroking my ego. Then he tells me he wants to offer me a full-time position after graduation, and even a more part-time position for next semester. Without getting into the whole 'where should I go after college/whats best?' discussion, it works really well for me to stay where I am, at least for a few years right out of college. I told him I would be interested in staying on with them and we go over what some details of how things will play out. This semester, at least for the time being, I'll stay in the position I'm in, but starting next semester, I'll be working more hours and take on more responsibilities (actually making some contact with the clients, etc.). After I graduate, I'll start working with them full-time with a full salary position. From my understanding, for next semester we might try to make it a temporary contract position so I'd be earning more and could start earning benefits and whatnot. As far as the salary position after graduation goes, he said we would talk about that more when it got closer. He made it sound like he's already very impressed and if I can continue to perform this way, they'll pay well to keep me around.

The issue is, I'm already doing a lot of work for them and it's getting a little overwhelming. They told me to let them know if it begins to be too much to keep up with, but I'm confident I can keep up as well as stubborn and not wanting to lighten my load. I'm currently commuting in (20 min each way) Mon/Wed for 2 hours and all day on Fridays, working remotely from campus whenever I can manage (I have freedom to work as many hours as I want within reason), as well as being on an hour-long conference call on Tuesdays.

The three current designers are: the girl I report to, who does mostly our websites; the other girl (who got hired two weeks after me); and me, who is now in charge of all our web ads, ebooks, and infographics. It seems to me that
I'm already working a part-time position and putting in hours around the clock all week, yet I'm still only making $10 an hour and not getting any other benefits. I don't mind grinding hard, I just want to make sure I'm being fairly compensated. At a previous internship I had (at a bigger corporation keep in mind) I earned $14 and hour, and it just seems silly how hard I'm working right now for so much less.

How should I bring this up to my CEO, and what would be a fair hourly rate to suggest? I was thinking asking for $15, I just don't want to seem greedy or anything and make him mad at all. I'm not super worried about it, considering that he's an incredibly cool and relaxed guy who seems to have taken a liking to me.

**TL;DR Started a new internship in September, already got offered a part-time and full-time offer, have a lot of responsibility, feel like I'm in a situation where I could fairly request a raise and my boss would likely be receptive to the idea.**"

When i took the job, i was told a ""few people"" work remote, so there might be some minor timezone differences. In reality out of the 15 or so people on this team, only 3 of us don't work remote, and one of them is an intern. A small handful of remote workers are based in Europe, while i am in EST, and the rest kind of spread out over all timezones.

In the last 6 months of me being here, i have felt like i have made no contribution. Everything feels like it is moving at a glacial pace. I ask a question, and depending on if it something only the European guys know, i might have to wait until the next day to even get an answer. Even worse is things like design decisions, take forever to get any sort of confirmation. Someone might give me the go ahead to do something a certain way, only to have the European or the west coasters pop in later on the day and say ""no you can't do it that way"" after i have spent hours working on it. It feels like a game of phone tag, and it is driving me mad.

Today we had our first ever real meeting since i joined, and our team lead basically told us that:

* We are massively behind schedule
* Everyone that isn't part of our European team is expected to work minimum of 6 hour overlap. Which starts at 9am PST (so 1pm for me)
* If we fail to do this, we won't be ""team players"", and it could very negatively affect any future opportunities. 

If i didn't have a family, i could probably do it until maybe something better works out, but considering i have a ~1.5 year old little monster, it completely out of the question. Me and the other east coasters complained, and we were told to ""deal with it"", and this was the ""best possible solution"" (which is completely bullshit since our team lead is the only person in PST timezone).

To me this is completely fucking unfair. I can't switch teams because my last performance evaluation was not great (due to me being hired and getting a mentor who not only had 0 time for me, but was ~6 hours off my timezone). I don't want to lose this job, it pays extremely well and with another kid on the way, i can't deal with this shit.

If i go over the team leads head and several of us file a complaint with our Director is that a bad idea? "

I am currently 20 years old and pretty done with college. This is my 3rd year, the first 2 I spent in a Computer Science degree which I enjoyed but my school forces students with no exception to go through 5 co-ops (paid internships.) I hate this because the co-op only pays $15/hr and I don't want to work for someone else. I own a small web development company where I do contract work and build software products and I charge $50/hr and work whenever I want so it makes no sense to do these co-ops. 

Eventually after being miserable for 2 months I quit my co-op and was forced to change majors so I chose business. This is an easy major but I don't have much interest in it because the information is outdated and it goes at a very slow pace. I can learn the content of these classes in a few days of reading. 

College seems kind of useless for me, even if my company falls apart I have a lot of work I've done and can point to in an interview and tech seems to be one of the most forgiving fields for someone without a degree. I'm not doing well in my business classes due to a lack of interest/difficulty juggling business responsibilities, social responsibilities and finding time for homework and studying.

My only concern is my web company is still new. I've made a decent amount of money and it seems as though I can support myself off of it but I don't have a massive stream of clients just yet. But I love doing this and I don't want to settle for something I don't like doing just because it's a bit safer. Living at home is an option but I want to try to live on my own if possible.

Am I crazy or does this make sense? I have a test tomorrow I haven't studied for because I'm trying to finish a site for a client and I just realized I missed 5 homework assignments over the weekend. It's so hard to juggle everything at once and school is hurting my business."

Who cares, gpa is meaningless. Have great work experience? No one bothers calling your references until they make the final offer. People would much rather work with a guy with a shitty gpa and poor work history but is the life of the party than an awkward, introverted, hard-working genius. Most work places sound more like happy hour than work places. 

Same with dating. Sure you may not be able to date online if you're short and fat but in real life your friends who love you can introduce you to cute girls who will adore you. 

Yes I know fat lazy guys who should be losers but because they're popular and have tons of friends, they have great jobs and cute girlfriends. He'll they may even live longer because loneliness is [more unhealthy](https://www.google.com/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/08/06/loneliness-deadlier-obesity-study-suggests/amp/).

I on the other hand bust my ass at the gym, school, networking, work experience, etc but it's a constant uphill battle because I set an awkward first impression or my blunt to the point nature puts people off. One example was discovering that a receptionist told her friend that i am very rude. I didnt know or thought i was rude im a get shit done type of guy. In todays world of sensitive, weak people it is a death sentence. 5 months of intense job searching and not one full-time offer. At this point I'm just looking for anything thst requires a bachelor's not necessarily engineering positions even though I have internship experience and a decent gpa. 

Also I have an easy time getting dates online and an ok time getting interviews but the meetings are where the struggles begin whereas most people struggle at getting dates/interviews but do well once they get them 

Even if I work hard at improving my social skills by the time I get to the level i want, it will be too late. I graduated college a bit late so by the time I get that 65k/year job most people my age will be making 90k/year die to accumulated experience. There s a stigma with age gap relationships and while a girl can be pretty in her mid-late 20s to early 30s, she will never be as good as she was when she was in her [early 20s](http://www.returnofkings.com/123977/5-things-i-hate-about-banging-women-over-30). Not to mention having to deal with being guy number 20 or knowing that she use to have likely more intimate sex with a popular guy I knew when she was in her prime. 

What's stopping me is upsetting my parents. My dad talked about a client of his who can barely function because his son commited suicide. I don't want that to happen to them, I love them too much and they did a lot for me. 

However thst isn't stopping me from giving mdma or extacy a try as it is used to get over social anxiety.

I can sustain us if she works part time and she wants to go to school again (I want her to too if that's what it takes to make her degree useful).  We're trying to see if going back for some classes might refresh her memory but after 2 years of not using anything she's learned at all she's forgotten many of the things learned and has no experience.    The guidance counselors at her old college don't want to help much and we made an appointment but it seems like they don't care. I'm really hoping you guys have some insight or recommendations.  

Edit: Also she had very good grades during her school, and I'd rather not go into the family stuff because the result is the same and I don't want to get all worked up.   

**Important:**  She's willing to start from scratch and go for one of those short careers if we can find one worth it, or if the career takes a year or if she somehow can get a bachelor's in the year she has left.   If not she's willing to go to internships now that she can but since she doesn't remember much I feel it'd be better for her to take some Refresher courses not sure if those exist.  

**TLDR** 

* Associate's in Business Administration

* great grades 

* 2 years out of school

* no internships 

* no relevant experience

* 20 hours of school per week time max

* 10-15 hours of internship a week avaliable if not paid if paid 20 


Not sure what to do for a career using the money and time put into that, willing to invest more into education but limited to 1 year and 20 hours a week (not including internships if paid) 

**end of TLDR**

The limits on time (weekly)  are because she takes care of the house since I work so many hours so our house life doesnt fall apart and so we save money on food since she makes breakfast lunch and dinner and takes care of the house and would need to work at least part time so we can survive paying for everything.

The limits on the  year is because that's how long I think I I can last working this many hours a week to meet bills with only partial help.  I just really want her to feel happy with what she does for a living.  

The limit on the internships would be treated as school time if not paid but if paid it'd probably be another 15 hours or so and we'll struggle at the house but we'll get the hang of it. 

I just wish we had better guidance.  When we went to school (high school) no one informed us what our full choices were.  No one had insight on what might be practical.  We had no one watching out or helping us and if we knew then what we know now we would have made different choices.  I really hope someone here on reddit has insight that can help us even now since we still have no one giving us that guidance. "

Tips for talking with managers/co-workers?,elves_cant_dance,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/75p5gb/i_was_raised_to_show_extreme_deference_for_people/,"One major issue I keep running into (especially during internships) is that I feel super uncomfortable talking to anyone in a position of ""power"" over me. I've never really had a great relationship with my parents; due to my upbringing I've been taught to show extreme respect to people older, etc. It's kind of awkward in the tech sphere, since it's been such a casual setting and a lot of people are younger. 

I see a lot of other interns who just click with other full timers or their managers, and I'm kind of upset that I'm not socially adept enough to manage that. Throughout my internships, I keep feeling like the odd one out of the team, and I struggle with feeling as if I have the right to speak. I actively feel as if I can't click with teams not because of the culture or my personality, but because of the way I was socialised. I click with other interns, etc., I just can't seem to interact with people with authority. I completely freeze up.

Even though I know rationally that they're human too, I can't help but mentally compartmentalize them as someone I have to defer to. 

Does anyone have any tips for interacting with them normally, and generally unlearning this aspect of my upbringing?"

I have no one to train me at the internship it's just me so I'm seeking out help, thanks in advance!

So the set up at the place is pretty simple for the most part except they have a server running some anti virus program that takes about a 3rd of the resources slowing it down and then one of the guys here backs it up to a hard drive which takes out every bit of it's resources and that DC is everything the file share, DHCP, DNS, email server. What would be an actual proper way to back that server up without it using every bit resources? Right now it's taking all night and into the work day to back up and that's obviously not okay because it's slowing down people working during the day. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated thank you!

Edit: after reading some support tickets from our MSP I believe backupExec is the program being used right now to backup to a USB docking station for an internal 2tb HDD."

I mean this in that I've always worked in *niche* environments. As in, learn a niche product, become an expert in it, and apply IT concepts in it to make things work. Thing is, when I learn the niche, I find new concepts tend to come few and far in between.

It pays well, terrible benefits, and my boss sort of leaves me out to dry in that he doesn't really *give* me work.

Apologies if this turns into a rant but wondering if anyone has ever encountered anything like this.

I'm working in a team where we provide common code modules intended to be used by other teams in a large company. I'm very stressed and don't know what to do.

- Every team uses us as a helpdesk. For even the most basic of problems. Once they include our modules, EVERY problem in their project is now blamed on us and 99.9% of the time it has absolutely nothing to do with us, but to ""maintain good relationships"" we're expected to help anyway. Nobody wants to take initiative, the slightest problem, emails are flying and if you don't reply in 30 minutes, it's escalated to senior management. Nobody seems to want to actually do their job. They get assigned a problem and then start shooting emails blaming everyone else this is such a problem and expecting the entire solution delivered to them.

- Interns have trouble setting up a dev environment is escalated as ""Mission critical blocker"". I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a principal engineer last week trying to explain why importing an Interface was not working, when I explained you had to import an implementing class to physically have the code run, he insists this is a critical problem with our platform (it wasn't even our code and if it was... really???)

- We are co-located, US and India. The India team does absolutely nothing. Infact, they introduce more issues having them here. They just push for visa sponsorship and if the answer is no, they do nothing. Management will eventually cave and give them promotions or raises as they have this impression we can't let them go.

- They don't show up to meetings. They do the bare minimum to complete tasks. No unit tests, no local testing, no documentation. They write garbage bug filled code and push it right to production as there is NO consequence. US team takes all the flak. They circumvent all process and code winds up in production that I had no idea even existed. When our build started breaking due to bugs, instead of fixing them, they shut off the quality checks just so the builds run to completion regardless of errors being thrown in the logs.

- My counterpart in India has been promoted 2 levels above me, just to keep him. I have not heard from him in 3 weeks now. We are meant to have a daily morning meeting. I have counted he has taken 43 official days off so far this year, and that's only what's tracked. Most days he's simply not there. In the project structure, I have more responsibility than him, yet because he is technically in a different reporting structure, his job title is now above mine and he tries to offload things to me and throw his weight around a bit. In the project structure, I need to ask him to do certain things but he doesn't respond to requests from me. I think he feels his title means he should not answer to me in any way. Asking management about it results in a shrug of the shoulders, they are being told from India management he is a great leader.

- My own career progression is nil. They have brought up several times i *should* be the tech lead but always excuses around budgets and so on. I'm a senior engineer and my responsibilities just increase and increase. I've just heard the one person above me, will be moving up and I will be filling more of his responsibilities but again, no promotion, no compensation, nothing.

- I used to believe in the product, but decisions were made overtime and shortcuts were made and now I feel it's garbage. I'm expected to take ""leadership"" when it's convenient. e.g. I have to listen to teams complaining and all their frustrations and trying to explain/justify why things in our code, are the way they are. But I totally agree with the complaints. But when it comes to doing something about it, I have no power. Offshore team will just NOT follow any process.

- I almost had an argument with an offshore developer last week. Had to calm it down as he was very worked up I wouldn't accept a PR. I knew from looking at it, the code would not work and asked for tests to be committed also. He said testing it was too much work. I said I know it's more work but it HAS to be tested, I can't approve a PR I know hasn't been tested and doesn't look like it works. He got so worked up. I had to calm it down, but then he went to his team lead who went ahead of merged to PR. I saw it the next day. I know this code does not work, but I will be the one dealing with teams when things go wrong.

- I propose ideas and improvements to management all the time. They are glossed over. They seem to feel ideas just create more work. Work they don't want to deal with.

I'm at my absolute wits end. I want out. But also finding it so hard to interview locally. The job market isn't awesome. It's mainly a lot of startups expecting Big-4 level engineers are entry level prices. The one's I've spoken to really seem to have no direction or product of value. I really just want a somewhat stable job where I can just do something with my career."

I'm a relatively recent grad (year out now...) looking to expand my portfolio and learn some new things. I studied CS at a top 10 public college but did not graduate with many projects or much internship experience (only 1 summer). I hardly coded in anything but java, but in the past year have taught myself some javascript/React.js and worked in Python a bunch. Now I am considering trying to get some specialized knowledge/experience in either data analysis or AI. 

My hope is that I can find some courses that will not only help me learn, but also include projects with a bigger scope than those done it tutorials. The artificial intelligence nanodegree ($800) from udacity seems to have what I'm looking for in terms of projects:

https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889

I'm also interested in EDX's offering because it can be used as credit should I eventually pursue a masters as columbia:

https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence

While I'm adverse to paying $1000 a month for a bootcamp, I really like the course progression offered here:

https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track?utm_source=classcentral&amp;utm_medium=ad&amp;utm_campaign=classcentral

Pandas/Numpy, databases, data viz, machine learning all seem like a good start which could eventually progress into more AI.

Thanks for looking at this!

My question, is, what would be preferable between the two in interviews? I hear a lot that companies only want CS degrees. And I mention age since I know that I'll be super old when I finish a CS degree. 

It sounds a lot like complaining but I honestly have had this stuck on my mind for a long time and just need an answer from this great community.

Edit2: If me being 24 is not something that I should concern myself with, then sorry about putting it there. All I wanted to say was that I'd be down at 26 with a bachelors while I could finish at 25 with an IT bachelors. Yet I didn't know which degree to have on the resume would be better."

ACT: 35c(35 in all sections), 8/12 writing. GPA: 4.0, no weighted GPA given. Going to take SAT II math 2 and physics this November.

ECs:

-Research at my state's flagship medical school through an summer internship program for sophomores and juniors. Very likely going to publish a paper with primary authorship next year, this year if I'm lucky.

-Research with a group my physics professor formed to recreate a classic experiment in physics, I'm likely going to be included in a publication in spring next year.

-Summer camp at my city's university specializing in computer security during my sophomore year, my team didn't do very well(placed 4th out of 9).

-Recognized nationally as a 3rd dan black belt in taekwondo, recognized 2nd dan internationally.

I'm planning on majoring in physics and my top 5 picks are Caltech, MIT, Harvey Mudd, Princeton and Stanford.

My questions are then:

-Are my ECs good enough right now for top schools like Caltech or MIT?

-Would taking a gap year be worthwhile?

My reasoning for taking is gap year is that I'd be sure that the two research projects I'm involved in would get published before I apply, I could pursue further research at the med school during winter and spring terms(I'd do that anyway regardless of whether I take a gap year or not, but I was thinking this would help my application if I did), I could take a greater courseload the rest of my senior year, and I could pursue more research elsewhere while not in school. I'm not sure exactly how I would accomplish that last goal though, which is my greatest qualm with taking a gap year.

Thoughts? Advice?

Math however, I got a 78 in Ap calc ab, and am now struggling in Ap calc bc. I might have only gotten the 78 due to the square root curve. The concepts seem to be hard to grasp. I do like math I'm just not the best at it.

In a career on the whole, the most perfect would be something like development and design. The creative parts of working with computers.

The careers that sound good right now are web developer+designer, software developer, applications developer, mobile app developer, and UX/UI.

 I don't particularly like science, so far I'm looking at a BA in comp sci at Rutgers. All the electives sound really great and I'll be sure to take the most important and recommended as well as get internships and study at home.

Would it be best to continue with this plan of a CS major or switch to ITI?
Personally, I'm going to see how well I do second semester when all the hard BC concepts come into play or when I get my Ap score. Majors don't have to be decided until second semester right? Calc 2 being a weedout class is very discouraging. My mind is stuck on the topic so I've come for advice to ease myself.

And also, would things change if I say I'm not planning on remaining in the US? I hear Japan is really big on IT at the moment but I also hear that CS majors can do IT work but IT cannot do a CS majors work. Optimally, I'd want a lifestyle with a great work-life balance and good pay.

Well, they got back to me and they're only offering the Business Intelligence internship.

I'm in pre calculus and am having an absolutely horrendous time keeping up. I have fallen behind on the homework which thankfully isn't a majority of the grade, and everytime I try to catch up it's like God himself is against me. I'll try to do the homework and then not understand the problem, I will try to click the ""link to text "" button and go to the textbook example but the textbook often skips steps and i can't understand what they skipped. I then try to watch the videos but you can't have both the videos open and the homework assignment at the same time so it's hard to keep a decent pace and sometimes it'll take me hours to get even 3 questions done.

On top of all of this i can't stay connected to any of the ucf Wi-Fi for more than like 10 minutes at a time so I sometimes sit there and try to fight to even get online.  Only to be introduced back to the same cycle of not understanding at all what to do. Wiley plus is of no help to anything so far. 

I have a test in a week and I'm trying hard to study but it just seems like in running into wall and wall of just stupid shit. And then I get massive anxiety and break down which is an obstacle of itself.

The professors lectures only help to a minimum as they are often disorganized and not very reinforceive and i often find myself trying to teach my self after class.

I'm a computer science major and I already have a very good internship in the field. I have learned so much from the internship that I would be confident in most jobs in my field. I KNOW I can get this if I can just get into a good study environment. What I really need is a tutor, and a patient one at that because I'm rather behind..

I've been to the MALL (math lab thing) which is a requirement but last time I went the person who tried to help me had a very thick Asian accent and i couldn't understand a word of what she was saying. I mean no disrespect but it didn't really help, only made me feel super awkward and just kind of agree with whatever she was saying.

All of this makes me question rather it's even worth it to continue classes. My fulltime internship with actual programming is a hundred times less stressful than this garbage and if I tried hard enough maybe I could get a job with my experience without a degree. 

If I don't find a tutor or something soon I don't think I'm going to a pass this class. It's almost like I was destined to fail this class with everything said above. 

Please help.


Tldr: need a pre calculus tutor, wondering if ucf have some kind of tutoring. MALL didn't work first time. Going insane in my membrane."

This was a bit more than 2 years ago. 

Unfortunately for me, I was suffering through a mental illness throughout college and high school that progressively got worse and worse. I hid it well from everyone, but yeah, during my fall semester of senior year, it all came crashing down. 

I had a 2 month phase where basically everything came crashing down, I was asked to ""voluntarily withdraw"" from university (basically expelled), spent sometime in jail (no conviction, thankfully), and some time in and out of hospitals. I spent a year and a half recovering and getting therapy, and the past few months mentally have been better, and I want to figure out how to start my career. My parents, fortunately, have been incredibly supportive during these tough years, and now agree it is a good time to start making a life out of myself.

My old school will not take me back, and I'm not sure if I should bother applying to other schools with my type of record. I'm thinking of just not getting my college degree, and basically taking the path of a college dropout. I've taken all of the CS classes so I have (or I should say had) the knowledge, but didn't complete my GEs or electives. I don't know if I can handle going back to school right now. Would it be possible to contact the recruiters/people I worked with at the old companies, explain my situation, and see if I can get interviews as a result? I did get return offers in the past but that seems like a different life now. 

Should I begin applying/interviewing right away, or spend a few months getting ""back on my feet"" so to say with CS concepts, leetcode, and side projects? I just tried, and I could barely implement a binary search. I'm pretty sure I can't do any nontrivial dynamic programming problems or anything with graphs. "

I'm a 2nd year university student in Sydney, Australia tossing up whether to continue with Computer Science as a degree, as I am also doing a business degree simultaneously. In the first two computing subjects, I scored around 60%, and did slightly worse on the first math subject (have a natural knack for math but have fallen behind). 

With my Business degree, which requires less time expenditure, my subjects have helped bring my average up to an average mark of 73%, and I've worked in a number of growth/marketing internships across startups and corporates (currently with IBM as a Marketing Intern and joining Deloitte Digital Consulting for the summer). I'm also involved with a pro-bono startup consultancy run by students.

I'm thinking of dropping Computer Science to maximise my time to thrive in subjects and jobs aiming towards the non-technical careers in tech (I prefer roles oriented towards customers and strategy), but am concerned that I'm giving up a great opportunity to develop technical proficiency (even though I don't see myself working in back-end dev). My career vision is to initially work as a strategy consultant/product manager/UX designer before founding a tech startup/joining an early stage tech startup. 

What would you guys recommend? How important is a CS degree for the path I'm headed down?"

Then i got assigned to a new project where everything went wrong, my new boss was a tyrant who forced me to work weekends and after hours, and wasn't fond of my way of getting things done (my job required good communication skills, he told me to use threats while i am more of a diplomatic person). Anyways as the company didn't want to switch me to another project i decided to quit after only three months (without having a backup plan, i wanted to take two sabbatical months). 

Now the thing is whenever i come to an interview, the first question to come is always why did you quit your old job? and whenever i respond that i didn't like the work atmosphere anyomre, i come up as someone who get bored easily and doesn't want to commit.

So i want to know how can i justify me quitting my job without leaving the impression that i am someone who gets easily annoyed and quits immediately when things go wrong?

There is one large UPS which is minimally utilized, and a handfull of smaller rack mounted ups. I am working on a system to analyze the existing state of things, and come up with an action plan / punch list, to go through during a planned outage to get things plugged in, in a sensible way. Sensible meaning just that devices with redundant PSU's are plugged into separate UPS's. Load is balanced across UPS's, and I finish with things labeled in a useful way and have it all in a spreadsheet for reference. So I am curious if anyone has done this, and would have any tips for me. Right down to details like naming conventions used on equipment to help make it clear how it should be plugged in.Thank you!

He's always had trouble making friends (he has some now but I don't think they're a good influence on him and none of them are into IT like he is) and I think maybe an internship would give him an opportunity to make new friends and kind of force him out of his shell.

I felt that I needed to get a internship especially since experience in my field was super important. I really dreaded interviews but I couldn't avoid them if I was to get a real job and become a productive member of society. 

So I signed up and sent my resume everywhere, got around 3 interviews in a week and 2 in another week.

Now, my first interview was average or a little below average. I didn't do that amazing but I didn't bomb it either. But the good thing was that it eased me into interviews. I became more and more comfortable with them. I was really dreading this one and spent hours practicing interview questions and etc.

The 2nd interview was much more better. The owner was really friendly and it eased my anxiety a lot.

After the 3rd and 4th I pretty much felt comfortable with interviews. Sure, I still feel some social anxiety. But the important part was that I had previous experience and I knew what to expect out of these interviews. 

On my 5th interview, I became pretty comfortable with interviews. 
Doing several interviews gives you confidence, especially because 

1. It feels more routine. Most interviews go the same way. You feel less anxious because you know what to expect. 

2. Interview skills require actually being interviewed by people you don't know. What better way to gain it then actually get interviewed. I practiced a lot of the social stuff I struggle with (eye contact, firm handshake, speaking clearly and understandably, laughing and smiling)

3. When you interview other places, you feel much less anxious in general, because you can always tell yourself (Even if I don't get this, I have something else).

Major: combined BSE/MSE in computer science, graduating May 2018

GPA: 3.77 right now, can hopefully raise it a bit by the time I graduate.

Work Experience: 3 software engineering internships - one with obscure startup, one at a fairly well known medium sized tech company, one with a very well known hedge fund. Accepted full-time job offer at the hedge fund as a front office software dev. This is distinct from typical tech jobs at e.g. investment banks, and pays significantly more than a software engineering job at places like Google and Facebook (not sure if this is relevant or not - I know business schools generally ask for salary history). Going to spend my summer in some kind of research or volunteering role. 

Extracurriculars: Nothing particularly special really - am a member of a fraternity and a few clubs and have significant teaching experience. Also spent a few semesters doing technical research, which will hopefully result in a publication sometime this year.  

GMAT: Plan to take in the spring, but 2350 SAT hopefully indicates that I can swing a 750+

Age/Gender/Race/Nationality: 22M, Indian, American citizen

Do I have a reasonable shot at top tier deferred enrollment programs? I know I'll be hurt by lack of interesting extracurriculars and what I imagine is a fairly typical applicant profile.

[EDIT] Thanks everyone for the encouragement! I am curious however about how much business schools weigh things like extracurriculars, unique essays (which necessarily require unique life experiences) and diversity in their admissions processes. My experience has always been that 'hard' credentials like test scores and experience are only enough to ensure that your application isn't thrown out, so I am (pleasantly) surprised by how confident these responses are.

76176d,3,2017-10-12,not sure if i'm going to go through with it but i just feel so empty,confusedpeaches,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/76176d/not_sure_if_im_going_to_go_through_with_it_but_i/,"Hey guys, I hope you're having a better day than I am. I'm a Indian - American fifteen year old female, and I'm currently a sophomore at one of the most competitive schools in country. As you can probably imagine, good times.
I've always been an A student, I was on the principal's list every year right up until freshman year. In freshman year after a disagreement with one of my friends, I was targeted and bullied verbally and through the internet by her. I felt like I had no friends, I got sick and along with everything, my grades dropped. I was pretty much a straight B student, which I personally don't think is bad, but by Asian standards, it means you're a fucking failure. I explained to my parents what happened, the situation got fixed, and I thought that by sophomore year, everything would be anew.
Sophomore year actually started out great, not gonna lie. My teachers are good, and my classes are interesting, and I have friends and don't face that kind of bullying anymore. Agh, I've been digressing so much I should just get to the point goddamit.
I take Chem Honors, it's a tricky class, and I'm not really a science kid, so it doesn't click immediately with me. We recently had our first test, which the teacher told us was one of the hardest ones we would take the entire year. It was lowkey difficult, the class average was a 60, and I got a 70. I was upset, because I studied and I honestly thought I could do better, but I realized that I should've studied more. I realize, Hey, I can't do anything about this now, so I'll just work on it more in the future! I get stuff cleared up, I ask my chem teacher for help, get some AP students to help me study, and I'm honestly feeling ok- like I've got it down for whatever test I'll take in the future. Because in my mind, tests are supposed to show you what you did wrong so you can improve, right?
Wrong.
I come home, and my parents look at me like I just murdered someone. They demand to see the papers, I show them. My chem teacher had said that some questions were really difficult- they were AP level, but my parents berate me over and over again for getting it wrong. I'm upset, but I'm like yeah, I understand why they're mad.
Their anger just escalates. They tell me I have no shame, no work ethic, that I'm a disappointment, and that all I do is frustrate them. And then they say, why do you disappoint us year after year? Couldn't you have learned something from freshmen year?
I don't know why, but that shit really got to me. I mean I get that yeah, it was disappointing for me to get such terrible grades ( in their eyes) but it's not like I asked for any of that shit. I didn't ask to suffer from an eating disorder and panic attacks and anxiety, and if I had the option, I never would've wanted any of that ( like any other human).
Now, it's like living in a war zone. There's venom in every word they speak to me, they won't even acknowledge me when they speak to me, and they've threatened to remove me from every extracurricular I participate in.  I fucking love my extracurriculars so much because I love to do them and also because I get a break from my hellish home life. I feel like if they actually do remove me from it, I'm just going to be so lost and unstable.
I have such a different vision for my life than my parents, and I'm just going to vent about it because idk I feel so much better doing it. My entire family is pretty successful but also fucking nuts. Sure, my cousins got into good schools (the golden child of the family goes to UC Berkeley) but they've also been stuck inside the house studying for literally 14 hours a day since they were five years old. And honestly, I get it. You want the best life for your kid. And some people flourish under those conditions, and I really respect that. They're going to go on to be great people. But the thing is, I am not them. I am my own person. And my parents can't grasp that one concept, that maybe I don't want to be confined in square for 18 years so that I can be chained in a rectangle for four more years so that I can get a desk job for 35 more years so that when I finally die and get buried in yet another box, everyone can say, "" Oh wow. She went to Harvard."" and then emotionally abuse their young kids who might have hopes and dreams of their own into becoming whatever their parent wants them too.
I honestly don't think I'm a slacker. By my sophomore year, I'm a member of the debate team, MUN, vice president of a business club at school, vice- president of a local non-profit that helps under-privileged kids, and I have an internship with a venture capital fund. HAhahh holy shit that was good practice for college apps LMAo.
The thing is, whenever I mess up, my parents automatically translate that into "" She failure. She going to be McDonald's worker and clean floors and toilets."" And that pisses me off so much because first of all, I truly believe that I'm not a slacker. And second of all, fuck you for thinking that being a McDonald's worker is a bad thing, and that cleaning floors makes you lower than everyone else. You're literally the lowest if you have the nerve to think that, at least in my mind.
And so now, the hell starts. There's going to be this long period where they show nothing but disappointment to me. And I don't know if I deserve it because sometimes I want to tell them that there are kids out there who really do do terrible things ( like those Slenderman murderers) and I really do feel like they are more ashamed of me than they would be of them.
Honestly, all this stuff takes such a fucking toll on me. I thought I escaped all the emotionally traumatizing stuff after the bullying in ninth grade but I just keep getting the same shit from my parents. I try to be strong through all the stuff honestly but I sometimes just want someone to hug me and say I'm proud of you and just make me feel like I mean something to them.
I know I sound so emo and spoiled and brattish and ugh I hate this I'm coming across as such a stupid kid and I don't know man I'm just sad and I'm crying and no one even cares and I'm beginning to think that if I killed myself it wouldn't even matter to anyone and quite honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet is because I feel too young and too afraid to die and I'm just trying to find something to live for and I don't even know what I want to say anymore. I'm sorry if you read the entire thing I just wasted your time."

From my prior internships (one of them was with IBM actually), I have experience with software engineering, product management, &amp; design. From what I understand, the AOM program has two start dates - in January and July. I'd be extremely interested in the July start date, as I'll have one year of full-time work experience by then.

My question is - how should I go about applying? Does anyone know when they're actively recruiting for these positions? Would I still fall under the 'new grad' category (despite having a job currently)? And, any advice for making sure that my application doesn't get lost in the void? Thanks!!"

761pce,12,2017-10-12,NYC Job Market for Juniors/New Grads?,jeyebrows16,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/761pce/nyc_job_market_for_juniorsnew_grads/,"Just for some background, I'm a CS recent grad with what I would consider to be a decent amount of work experience (previous internship, part time work, startup co-founder) who's been applying to jobs in NYC since around February or so. In addition to having extreme difficulty getting an interview (until recently), I've noticed some things that are concerning me about the job market for junior/entry-level candidates and wanted to see what /r/cscareerquestions had to say about it.

* **Low salaries**: First, I've noticed that most of the advertised salaries are pretty low for what my resources are telling me the market avg should be, a lot of which are in the 50-70k range and some even below this. In speaking with some hiring managers/recruiters, it also feels like I'm pretty consistently being low-balled (for gigs where the salary isn't advertised) or at the very least they mentioned that they're on a tight budget before I even bring up compensation. I figured that even entry-level salaries would be adjusted for such a HCOL city, and thus somewhat comparable to SF/the Bay Area, but am I wrong in thinking this?

* **Lots of competition**: On a few occasions I've been able to see other applicants or interviewees of the jobs I'm applying for and it looks like there are a TON of people trying to get their first software gig after going to a bootcamp like Flatiron School. I guess my question here is if NYC is disproportionately more competitive than other tech hubs, especially when it comes to the sheer number of self starters. I guess if that's true, that might explain the drop in entry-level salaries and maybe my next concern.

* **Few Junior/EL gigs**: Using LinkedIn, Indeed, and Stack Overflow, I've started to get the impression that true entry-level jobs for new grads can be pretty difficult to find unless you're looking at Big-N or other top tier new grad positions. Not sure if this is just an industry wide problem or if its worse in NYC.

* **Unprofessional recruiting**: Again, not sure if this is equally bad across the industry or if its worse in NYC, but I've noticed a lot of unprofessionalism during the recruiting process. Lots of miscommunication about the role, team, or decision to move forward, and in the most recent case I did a small project for a company, only to have them completely ghost me with no feedback about the code I submitted.

I guess this is a little more ranty than I anticipated, but I just wanted to get feedback from people on this sub to see if my concerns are valid or if I'm just an outlier. At this point I'm considering looking for work elsewhere even though I was really set on NYC for personal reasons. Better pay that will go farther and a less stressful interview process are sounding much more appealing.

761qdg,2,2017-10-12,Is a low-paying internship worth relocating for or should I keep looking for a full-time job?,bonratbonchat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/761qdg/is_a_lowpaying_internship_worth_relocating_for_or/,"Recently I applied to a job at a small company that was offering around $30k starting salary for an entry level job that is perfectly suited to my skill set. I received an email from the company expressing interest in me and said they definitely wanted to bring me in for an interview, but first they had to clear some things with the budget department before we could schedule anything. 

About a week or so passed and I received an email from them that said the position has changed and now they can only offer a $19k/year internship position, no relocation pay. If I am still interested, they want me to come to them for an interview. 

So normally, I would absolutely take the position. But it’s in an area that doesn’t have many opportunities in my or my fiancé’s field, and I’m not sure if relocating 6+hours for this internship is worth it. I haven’t responded yet because I don’t want to travel there for the interview if I’m not sure I want the job. 

Originally the plan would have been to work the 30k job for a year or so and save up to relocate to a city with a better job market, but with the salary I’ll be on now it’ll be more difficult to save as much. 

I know that it’s really up to me, but I would just like you guys’ opinion: what would you do in my position? Take the job or keep looking? "

Yet, since I was little I've also been very interested in design or any creative media (branding, motion animation, web design, etc) but have little to no formal education in design.



For a long time I thought of going for Front-End development or UI/UX jobs but there are some issues:

1. I have very little experience in the area, only self-taught Photoshop and web design from small personal unfinished projects and school assignments
1. It's looked down on in my country (Malta) as most jobs like full-stack or backend tend to get paid better
1. Most Frontend jobs seem to require at least 2 years of experience

My 'plan' was to practice and learn anything code+design by myself at home over the Summer after Uni. This way, I build a portfolio and apply for jobs with it by the end of the season.

Unfortunately, freelancing and self-teaching proved to be very difficult and it was getting more and more stressful and demotivating. Time was pressing and my ex-coursemates had already found software dev jobs and got their wages. This lead me to multiple depressive episodes and now, one month after Summer, I still have no job or finished portfolio. I thought about continuing my studies but the Masters course at our University doesn't cater what I want and studying abroad is too expensive.

763sal,13,2017-10-13,"How many interviews did you go on, and gap between education and employer expectations [employment] [advice]",ThrowawayGeofreek,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/763sal/how_many_interviews_did_you_go_on_and_gap_between/,"This essentially could be two posts of questions but I think they are heavily relevant to each other.

Currently I am a post-graduate student in GIS, with a foundation degree in town planning/geography. I am a newbie to technical interviews - which GIS ones certainly are. I have been to interviews with 6 companies now, all with at least 4 other applicants going for the same role.

My first question is 1) Is it normal in technical/GIS roles to interview that many times before securing a job?
The roles I go for are student internships, cadetships or part time entry roles.

My aching suspicion is that my formal course qualifications are no where near enough to qualify for even a student-level job. Like many other students here, my course is heavily focused on ArcGIS products - something the surveyors in my work experience firm laugh about, they say ""often students, when saying they have experience in GIS they really just mean ArcMapping"". My interviewers have grilled me about other GIS platforms that we don't learn - QGIS, PostGIS, MapInfo, and the expected programming languages - Python, Java and CSS, HTML - of which I only know SQL and a bit of HTML.

I don't want this to turn into a whiny post of an entitled millennial college student expecting a job, however I feel shortchanged and a bit disheartened that my formal (Masters) course is not covering the array of GIS programs and coding languages that employers expect candidates to demonstrate right off the bat. I may as well have stayed in my full time business analyst job and undertaken self taught coding and geo-spatial courses at night, and saved heaps of money.

My second question is, if it's lack of multivaried technical skills hindering me from getting past the interviews, what sort of GIS skills should I focus on to bridge the gap?
Self learning Java and Python is definitely in the books, along with QGIS and the skills the employers mentioned above.

All tips and advice appreciated"

So I applied to all these companies, and followed up with the recruiters a couple days later, thanking them for meeting me, etc. etc. and I haven't heard anything back

Some of my coworkers have also applied to these companies (but for full time roles) and have all heard back from them

I'm feeling pretty discouraged about it. If I miss a year of internships (i.e: I have an internship for all of 2017 + spring 2018, and no internship in summer 2018), will this reflect poorly upon graduation, when I'll be looking for full time work in the DC area?"

I see threads about how much IT is changing, and how everyone is going to become a Linux/DevOps/Puppet admin in five years. I haven't been around long enough to recognize the cycles/patterns in IT and am not sure what to think.


I'm pretty lucky. I graduated college last month, and have a great gig for an MSP as a full Systems Engineer. They brought me on as a intern twice and my opportunities and learning have only gotten better.


I'm pretty systems sided, working within the vSphere/Windows/AD/Exchange/Citrix types of ecosystems and am really enjoying things. I did my senior project on Citrix Deployments within AWS and setup a mock client-site with a VPN to my AWS VPC. 

I love the ecosystems I've built familiarity with in my job.
Just as I'm starting to develop *a little* confidence in my skills/abilities I'm hearing all of this doom/gloom/fear-mongering about the end of what i'm starting to get good at. 


I'm in a unique position in that i'm still kind of young (22), and am willing to learn new things. But I kinda like what I do now. I'm in a situation where the changing field **will** effect me, and I have to be ready for it. 


What should I expect?"

768n6q,3,2017-10-13,Can a 24 year old break into IT and make 70k/year before the age of 30?,knew_already,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/768n6q/can_a_24_year_old_break_into_it_and_make_70kyear/,"Hello all!

I am 24 years old, and I made some very poor decisions in my younger years. At least I was smart enough to finish my Associate's degree. It is a ""Business Transfer"" degree from a community college, designed to slide right into the remaining 2 years of my state university. 

Right now I am very interested in pursuing an Information Systems degree. Just to help you guys out, I would be attending Salisbury University. ( http://www.salisbury.edu/InfoSys/is_focus_areas.html )

They have three focus areas for this major: 1. Business Systems Analyst  2. Enterprise Application Analyst 3. Business Analytics Professional and 4. Network/Security Analyst 

All of these sound interesting and fun to me. Some of them say it's possible to obtain certs, so maybe those are the better options. 

If I pick one of these fields and start studying now, enroll in college at least by next Fall if not this Spring, do you think I can excel and land a job right out of college, eventually hitting 70k/year by age 30?

My girlfriend really wants to be a stay at home mom, and she wants up to three kids. I need at least 70k/year before taxes to maintain that, and I'd like some luxuries like eating out at nice places and vacations. 

The only current experience I have on my resume is from cooking jobs. I've toyed with HTML/CSS, made crude programs using javascript, built wordpress sites....

I used to make beats and I built beat selling websites (that never made much money), I used to be into graphic design....My dad has always been in to computers.

I have a raspberry pi laying around I could start to learn linux on....Unfortunately from 21-24 I've let my self studying and skills lapse a little bit, and I didn't keep a portfolio of all my personal projects :( I could probably find a github I made with some weak examples of me hacking up others code...but I feel like mainly I'm starting ""fresh"".....
One question I have is, given my area and school--is hoping to make at least 37-50k/year before taxes straight out of school unreasonable? Of course I will be active in my education/study and networking, landing internships, etc. I am willing to relocate.

Could I climb to 70k/year or more by age 30, while maintaining a healthy balance between work/study and my girlfriend and eventually kids?

She is 21 now (June, 1996) and wants the first by 25....that gives me around 4 years. Maybe I could stall until 26....and she wants to have three by 30....That's why all this time constraint stuff. 

Anyway, I think I'm ready to pursue a degree in IT because I've always been interested in computers. If it wasn't this it would be accounting/finance, and 1,000,000% sure I have more interest and enjoyment from tech related stuff than number crunching. Just like the job security and financial stability idea of accounting.

I may be starting late, but I feel like it's good because I'm sure what I want from life. 

I have horrible credit, but little debt. Would be taking out pell grants and stafford loans, EFC is 0. 

Where can I start for now? I'm about to look up the compTIA cert and see what that's about....I know I can start self study, but I think I would do better from a directed program that points me in the direction of what I want to study most on my own. Before I was studying skills that related directly to my attempts at building an online business. Now I'm just getting info overload! heh 

If I left anything out, please ask and I will provide info. I also plan to study micros system for restaurants, because I work at a big restaurant using this system now. Maybe I can find a way to get involved/improve this system for outside the classroom resume experience. "

Of course being a straight guy at a university renowned for having gorgeous women everywhere its hard to get my mind off of romance. I've been browsing through askwomen and dating_advice and noticed a phrase repeated a lot to virgin guys: why would anyone want to date you? Do you offer any value?

This is the same sentiment that the cracked article expressed. I can fairly confidently say I don't. At least not enough to be competitive with all of the other guys on campus.

I've transferred schools so I don't know anyone or have any groups to fall back on. I'm more alone than I've ever been and I'm starting to see its all my fault. I chose to play video games and daydream instead of work out or go to parties. I chose to spend hours reading music books and studying music theory only to still be unable to write my own music. I chose to be a lazy, low-value individual because I thought that things would eventually just get better. 

Turns out that my horrible high school years were actually the best part of my life. At least I had a few friends there. I'm 20 and havent got anything to show for it. If you asked me who I am or what I like to do I would stare at you blankly because I do not know anymore. Everything in my life just feels empty so that must mean that I'm empty on the inside. Sometimes I try to walk through walls because I swear I'm a ghost to most people. All ive ever wanted in life was a group of friends to banter with and a cute girlfriend to hold me at night. I clung to this stupid fantasy all while avoiding the pain necessary to make it real. 

I am the most worthless person I know. Ive taken my privilege and squandered it. I'm socially awkward, out of shape, depressed, cast out from normal society. I cant watch tv or listen to modern music anymore since its all about love and partying and whatnot, stuff that I will never experience. When I'm not angry and hitting myself for being such a f***up I just lie in my bed bored. Nothing seems worth doing if I have to do it alone. I want to have something of worth to provide to people, to friends, to women, but at the end of the day I'm just a ""nice guy"" and boring f***s like me are a dime a dozen.

I don't want to give up but I don't see a way forward that doesnt end in misery. I wish I could kill my personality and take on someone else's. How do I start over when I have no foundation? I've realized that I am the problem in my life but the only way to fix that problem seems to be to destroy myself completely. Help me please.

Now I got this Co-Op from Toyota for a Quality engineering intern in Plano. 

I asked 3 advisors and they all alluded to this being good for me since that puts me a foot into the Automotive industry and for salary negotiations. 

But I don't want to be behind. I'll be in classes with dudes who came 2 years after I did. All my friends will have graduated and left me behind. I get the idea that I can make more. But that's not my forte and it took me forever just to get the ones I have now. 

And I'm worried about the Co-OP. There no freaken information about it online. I read the reviews on glassdoor and there positive. But for fucks sake why don't they have atleast a youtube video. Will there be other intern? Will they be a lot? 

I'm afraid that I will make this decision and go to Plano (by Dallas) and bam. By myself in a boring office doing nothing interesting, all to come back in the may 1 year lost. (Due to classes being once a year at my school)

If anyone Co-Oped with them? Or know someone?

This would be easier if they had information about the experience. I'm betting my college experience on this choice.

As a result, I've been developing on ~4 separate projects (image processing, computer vision, autonomous robotics) that collectively make up my lab's current objective. Last year, I was 2nd author on a conference paper, but that is my only publication that has been released so far. 

That being said, a lot of my research is really coming together. Here is what the next semester is looking like for me.

- A conference paper that was recently submitted that will likely be published in January (2nd author) that we should hear back on in the next week

- 2 abstracts that have been accepted for a conference April (I am 1st author on one and 2nd on the other). 

- My PI also expects 2 of my longer term projects, which are wrapping up now with extremely promising results, to lead to 2 conference papers and a journal (not quite sure about the timeline on this).

I will be applying to comp sci master's programs at some pretty competitive places, and I know that having some of these publications could be really helpful to my application; I have really good grades (4.0 major GPA) and 2 very solid internships, but only 2 really good letters of rec, which concerns me a little.

I know that it's not a good idea to put submitted papers on an application before they are accepted, but is it okay to list papers that are accepted and not yet published, and if it is, how it is typically done?"

Cut to this semester at school, I was doing my due diligence and applying to other jobs. To my surprise, after just a 2 hour skills test I received a software engineer position from a major tech company. I was elated until I realized it was during the summer... at the same time as my other internship.

Obviously reneging on an offer is not ideal and would probably burn a bridge with a company that would almost certainly hire me full time. However, the other company is a much more intriguing offer to me and more in line with what I want to do. So a few questions:

1) Would it look bad if I ask the recruiter for the second company if they have the same position open in a different term? 

2) If I ask this, should I mention I've already accepted an offer or leave it vague?

I planned on doing both, the only drawback is how much time and effort it costs to submit a good resume and cover letter for the company I'm applying for. Should I focus on one or the other?

I graduated from a major state university earlier this Spring with a BA in English: my concentration was rhetoric—I am not some fucking lazy Lit. major that touches themselves whenever they hear the word “Harry Potter.” Currently, all the Lit. majors reading this are literally jacking off right now; I fucking kid you not. I witnessed it with my own eyes for FOUR STRAIGHT YEARS.

Anyways, since then, I’ve been applying to copywriting, copyediting, content writing, editorial, communications, marketing assistant positions, etc ad nauseam. It’s been well-over 6 months, and I haven’t received so much as a rejection email from anyone within my desired field—not to mention a call. 

Granted, I did receive an interview with a Fortune 500 insurance company—think that company with the talking duck, but a different company. The interview was for a claims position that started off at 45k, and I bombed it. Partly, I wasn’t very interested, because who graduates from college with ambitions to work claims? Secondly, 4 out of the 8 questions HR asked me dealt with whether I had prior experience with their software, medical billing, working in a professional office environment, and something else that I can’t remember—the HR lady literally began answering the questions for me as soon as she realized I was a recent college graduate: she hadn’t read through my resume prior to the interview. It was awkward, I felt awkward, she felt awkward, and nobody bothered contacting me afterwards. As Trump would say, “SAD!” 

Currently, while I’m not wallowing in self-pity, I’m working as a teacher’s aide for a special ed. classroom at a local public school. At this job, I am getting hit 50-100 times a day, cleaning up human feces and urine off of the floor and other people, and dealing with a host of other issues that I care not to mention. This job also pays less than flipping burgers at McDonalds. If it pays less than McDonalds, why not just work at McDonalds? McDonalds won’t hire me, because I’m a “flight risk.” So before some condescending bastard mummers something about, “Well, you’re clearly not willing to work for anything! That’s your problem!”Allow me to pose a question: have you ever worked a job where people are allowed to hit you, but you aren’t allowed to hit them back? The answer is ‘no’ you keyboard warrior. 

Now let’s talk about my past. I had a rough start to college. After my first four semesters, I had a lovely 2.68, because I had “other interests.” I also had a respectable major at the time—BBA in economics. I made As and Bs in Calculus and Accounting, but blew off easy classes like Bio 101 and ended up with a handful of Cs, because I skipped out on class, and the professors at my school loved to give “surprise” attendance quizzes that weren’t listed on the syllabus. Yes, I realize I should have been going to class regardless now. So, after a dismal display at college and really no real interest in economics, I took a year off and just worked as a cook. 

After that year, just like the phoenix, I emerged as an English major concentrating in rhetoric. I was ready to pursue my passion of writing, discourse, and politics. In short, I raised my 2.68 to a 3.2, did some research with an international nuclear scientist, and I was asked by two professors to co-author papers with them my final year—granted neither of those were realities, because I was months away from graduation…one of the professors even wanted me to travel to Greece with her and present it at an academic conference. In addition, I had managed to get three internship interviews within my desired fields; although, I was passed up each time. Still, I thought all of this was building towards something, like a fucking job. 

Although, today I realize that nobody in copywriting, copyediting, editorial departments, marketing or advertising firms, and even insurance companies gives a flying fuck about anything that I did in college. They want professional experience and professional, published writing samples; “Fuck that academic writing,” they say, “It’s useless, and we won’t accept it!” 

I don’t know what to do now. I can’t get a call back for an entry-level position that’s remotely related to what I want to do—writing. UpWork, a freelancing site, won’t even let me join their site, because I have no prior freelancing experience. I’ve posted ads on Craigslist for freelance gigs. I’ve received one response, and it was some student wanting me to write an essay for them…to which I replied, “Fuck off; do your own work.” I thought about law school for a while, but then I realized that the cheapest in-state law school is 20k a semester, and there’s no way in hell I or my family can afford that. 

I guess I’m just growing tired of getting hit every day and cleaning up shit every day. I feel like I’ve been chewed up and spit out; I feel like I’ve hit a rock wall, and I have ABSOLUTELY no idea what to do.

GPA and class rank (my high school sends weighted): 
3.71; 92 out of 349 (aiming for an A average for my first semester of senior year)

SAT/ACT:
retook and awaiting score (first score was 1160 with sub scores in 640 ENG, 520 MATH and 7-7-6 ESSAY; I barely studied but I definitely put in more effort this time around); 27 (32 READ, 24 MATH, and 9 out of 12 on ESSAY)

 three years

Other info:
- father went to Howard for grad school (medicine)

I think what I'm most concerned about is my GPA and standardized test scores. I'm definitely applying to UMCP, UMBC, Howard, and St John's by Nov 1st to secure EA, but I can't do ED for American and GW (they're reach schools anyway). Should I try to retake my SAT in Nov for my RD schools? Am I aiming too high? Are there other schools that may be a better fit for me (I can only apply to schools in DC, MD, VA, PA, and DE)? 

Again, thank you all for the help and I wish everyone else luck in their admissions!"

Haven't saved much in these cuz I'm only 23 (~50k + paying off 40k student loan, and ... ex-gf -.-*; from 16 month internship and 2 months working) 

But here's the big one I have ~250k in a joint NRSP from my dad's saving when he passed away when I was 10. RIP I wish I could trade the 250k for you :'(. My legal guardian had been investing it in GICs and 2% MER conservative mutual funds to my shock when I learned about it this year). I immediately had the funds requested to be moved over to TD e-series with 0.33% MER. But I feel considering the size of the asset, i should be investing in something with much lower MER fees. But I'm totally lost with all this discussion about ETFs, brokerages, rebalancing frequency and all these different potential fees and weighing the pros/cons of each.

Where is a good place to read and really understand these subjects and help me realize what I want to do. I want to invest that money for a long period of time, and use my own money for purchases such as frugal car, reasonable home. I want to get the lowest MER, rebalance as little as possible  (ideally 2-4 times/year and not incur crazy fees) and pretty much forget about my inheritance till I'm 35 lol (🔥 possibly).

Thanks sorry for long post. WABALUBADUBDUB.

TLDR. Graduated this year. Debt: $2k/$40k (gone by the end of the year)
Assets: ~50k (TFSA - Maxed, RRSP - starting to max, Employer Pension - Maxed), beater car (worthless but functions xD), leasing room
Inheritance: single father passed away at 10. Now worth (~250k). But legal guardian had it in GIC/Conservative Mutual Fund :( not her fault. 
Wanna know how to minimize MERs and understand how to interpret which brokerage is right for me if I do ETFs.

Edit: is there a way for me to compare different brokerages to evaluate total fees based on how I invest? Currently searching CCP ...

76fowf,434,2017-10-14,Ready Or Not,crypticcliff,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/76fowf/ready_or_not/,"“Remember daddy, no peeking!” my 6-year-old daughter says as she runs off into the woods. I stand in front of a thick oak tree, cupping my face to the bark. Our car, just 50 feet away, behind me, resting on the old dirt path. I wait a moment to give my daughter a head start. Then, I begin counting.

“100, 99, 98, 97…” I start, hearing the rustle of her feet fade into the void of silence in the woods. As I stand in this position, my mind can’t help itself but to remember the past. To remember the center of our universe. To remember Lynda.

…88, 87, 86, 85…

God, how can I describe Lynda. She was my sunshine. We met during college. I was on my way to being kicked out of the engineering program and I was really depressed about it. So depressed, in fact, that I decided to go to the college counseling center to work out my issues. That’s when I first met her. Brunette hair, just the most dazzling light brown eyes, and I will not lie, she had a body that could make any man take a double take and maybe a few women. I was already smitten before she ever introduced herself.

She was a psychology major who had landed an internship with the school to help guide other students back on track. Her time with me was supposed to be for 45 minutes, but we talked for over 2 hours. Have you ever just met someone you instantly had that connection with? The unspoken bond that could only come when the two perfect people meet at the exact right time? Well that was us for sure. As two broke college students, our first date ended up being 2 pizzas from the local pizza shop and Netflix.

As time went on, we became closer and soon we were almost inseparable. Granted I was still struggling with my major at the time, but she always believed in me. Staying up with me and quizzing me on certain terms and problems. She had smarts, probably would’ve excelled in the major. With her support and encouragement, I managed to keep my head above water in my classes and before I knew it, I was a B+ student and back on course to graduate on time with an engineering degree.

…77, 76, 75, 74….

Fast forward a few years later, I had graduated with a Bachelor’s in mechanical engineering and was working for a well-known company. Lynda landed a well-paying therapist position and was loving every minute of her job. I was stuck in the usual city traffic. That was the worst part of my day. A generic pop song was on for some background noise. If I was going to be stuck in a 4-lane congested highway, I wasn’t going to be listening to squeaky brakes and the occasional profanity. My phone buzzed in the phone holder that was attached to the windshield. Lynda, in bold white letters, faded in with a green phone icon bouncing lazily up and down. I tapped it, putting the call on speaker. She never called, unless it was an emergency.

“Hey hon, is everything alright? Did you burn the pasta again?” I asked in a joking manner.

“No! Okay, yeah, I did, but I’m not calling about burnt pasta. I have something to tell you.” She said in a serious tone. This didn’t sound good. Last time she had such a serious tone I was close to dropping out of college entirely.

“Well, what is it honey?” I replied, a pretzel knot forming in my stomach.

“I’m pregnant.” she replied simply. I scoffed and braked hard. The car behind me blared their horn but I couldn’t hear them. Did I hear that correctly, the love of my life, pregnant?

“Hello?” My wife’s voice echoed out of the speaker. I didn’t even realize a full minute went by as the recent news filled me with excitement.

“T-that’s great! Oh god, that’s f*****g fantastic!” I yelled, a gigantic grin on my face. Thinking back on it now, the people near me must’ve thought I had gone crazy.

“I couldn’t wait till you got home! I had to tell you right away!” she replied, her excitement matching mine.

“You know what, f**k cooking, we are going out tonight!” I said as explosions of excitement erupted in my belly. We went to our favorite Italian restaurant, a bit pricey but it was the place I proposed to her the night of our graduation. It only made sense to go back there. We spent almost the entire dinner thinking of baby names, what kind of crib we should get, when we should start a college fund, and even if we should put them in private or public school.

….63, 62, 61, 60, 59…..

Nine months later, I was sitting in the hallway of the hospital. My hands clamped together, squeezing tight as I heard Lynda scream in agony. My left leg was shaking uncontrollably while sweat was beading on my forehead. Soon one scream became two. I stood up, walking briskly to her hospital room. The door opened suddenly. The doctor, with his blue scrubs and mask on, congratulated me on my new baby girl. At 6lbs 7oz, little Angelina was brought into the world. Tears filled my eyes as I watched my wife hold our daughter in a loving embrace.

….45, 44, 43, 42, 41…

For 5 years, that little girl was my focus every day. I had gotten better at work and my boss noticed. Gave me a promotion with a raise. Angelina got bigger and soon was talking up a storm. She was popular and adored by everyone. Even our next-door neighbor’s teen daughter offered to babysit for us so we could have some time alone. If I had a watch or a remote or something to stop and just loop that time of my life I would have.

…35, 34, 33, 32…

One night, I was giving my daughter a tubby. Her toys floated in the bubble filled tub, bobbing side to side. Lynda was out grocery shopping, and I had to take on a couple motherly duties, which I didn’t mind. While I was washing my daughter’s hair, massaging her scalp to get the shampoo deep in her hair, I noticed something. The white foam was beginning to change color. What used to be cloud white was turning into a clay brown. I was confused. I pulled a few strands up, letting the hair slip through my fingers, only to be left with an oily brown residue on my thumb and index finger.

“Angelina?” I asked as I rubbed the brown liquid between my fingers.

“Yes daddy?” she said, not looking up at me, too preoccupied by her rubber ducks.

“Did you roll around in dirt today? I keep finding this brown stuff on your hair.” I replied showing her the odd liquid.

“Silly daddy, that’s coloring! Mommy didn’t like my yellow hair, she said yellow is icky.” My mouth dropped. Yellow hair, coloring, blonde. All those times where I had found boxes for hair dye, she kept saying it was for her grey hairs so I never questioned it. My hair has always been dark brown, just like the rest of my family. The thought had never crossed my mind that Lynda would ever do something like this. I confronted her soon after I put Angelina to bed.

 A screaming match soon started. Things were thrown and words were said. Before I knew it, I had my hands throttling her throat, her pleas and gasps weakening by the second. It didn’t last long. She was dead before 10 pm. I stared at her lifeless corpse, trying to connect the dots. She never even told me who the man was that she cheated on me with. It didn’t take me long to figure it out though. Why she always insisted to have the neighbor’s daughter babysit. How in the right light, they almost looked like sisters. I laughed because the truth was in front of me the entire time. I was just too delusional to believe it. I got up, grabbed the kitchen knife, and went over to their house to do what had to be done.

….20, 19, 18, 17….

After I came back from the neighbors, I told my daughter we were going to play a special game of hide and seek. What was so special was that we were going to play in the woods at night. She was so adventurous. She loved the little nature walks I took her on when the weather was nice enough for it.

The sound of a metal clang brought me back to the present. A shrill scream echoed out. Birds flew out of trees in a panic.  She must’ve triggered one of the bear traps hidden around these hunting grounds. I know I won’t get away with what I’ve done. I’ve killed 3 people and I’m sure by now the police are searching for me.

“…5, 4, 3, 2, 1.” I finish counting, pulling my knife out of my back pocket. With her screams being this loud it’ll be easy to find her. Ready or not Angelina, here I come.

Some background, I'm a senior in my last year of college pursuing a BA in Computer Systems and am applying for internships and soon jobs once I graduate Summer 2018.

Most of my free time was spent making music, however. I've always had a passion for coding and computers, I'm confident that I write great code and am talented. But am late on making computer science related projects and extracurriculars for my resume (working on it now).

That said, I have *plenty* of experience in audio engineering and music production. I've played in bands and put on shows with fully programmed lights and video synced to the music. I've produced, mixed, and mastered bands as well as made plenty of music in a wide variety of genres. Even did mastering for podcasts.

I just don't know if anyone cares. I have some albums I've done on my LinkedIn, and music related software I'm very proficient in, but I don't know if it's just crowding space or not.

## Preface
I have a strong programming background (Senior Computer Science Major with multiple internships), but I'm still very new to web development. I've built some simple static websites and a helped build a fairly complex serverless web application using AWS, but most of the the work I've done has been backend application development. The extent of my web development knowledge is basic HTML, CSS, AWS and some Django. I've also spent a little bit of time messing around with a VPS (Digital Ocean). 

## The Objective: Build a website with the following core functionality

1. Upload images
2. Find images other users have posted
3. Comment on images/rate images
4. Keep track of their comments and images via a profile.

I understand there are websites out there (Imgur) that provide this functionality. This would be primarily a learning project so I'm not super concerned about profitability.

## Learning Goals

1. Improve web development skills.
2. Build and deploy an actual service.
3. Figure out how to actually maintain that service once its deployed

## Questions

1. I'm relatively familiar with AWS, but very new to setting up a server from scratch (VPS). What sort of additional software/frameworks would I need to learn if I went the VPS route?
2. What languages/tools should I use for dynamic content? Django? Javascript? If so, Angular vs React vs Node? I'm not even sure where to begin here.
3. What sort of database tools should I use to store user content and information? 
4. What are some common mistakes a lot of new web developers make regarding website security?
5. Is what I'm trying to make too large in scope/difficult for my current skill set? If so, what sort of projects should I look at making to develop my skillset up to the point where I actually can complete this project?

I understand a lot of these questions are pretty involved and will likely have multiple answers; Any guidance or personal anecdote would be appreciated!

76gqn9,6,2017-10-14,"Withdrew verbally accepted offer, employer went ballistic. Thoughts?",eezmacc,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/76gqn9/withdrew_verbally_accepted_offer_employer_went/,"I am an undergraduate accounting student that has secured a full-time job with a great company. I graduate in December and found out last minute that I could not start with my company in January as I had planned and would have to wait until July.

During this time of year, accounting firms interview students on-campus for internship positions during tax season (Jan-Apr). I found out that I would be out of work during this time at the tail-end of this process and scrambled to find an internship. 

I accepted the first internship offer I got with a one-man accounting firm. He offered me the job on-the-spot, which I was not expecting, and I stupidly/nervously accepted. The pay rate was awful, but I figured that it was in the ballpark of what other internships paid. Several days after accepting, I found out that the pay rate was $5 (at minimum) to $10 less per hour than someone with similar credentials would earn. If I worked 500 hours’ total, this would amount to a difference in pay of $2,500 to $5,000 over the course of 3 months. I thought I would be passing up $3 an hour, at most, by taking this offer.

I accepted the offer on a Friday before a holiday weekend and I let this company/guy know the following Thursday that I could not accept/sign the offer given the pay rate. I called him, sincerely/profusely apologized and sincerely thanked him for the opportunity. He did turn away 2 other candidates because of me and seriously, I am sorry for that. However, we are 3 months away from mid-January, when this internship would start.

Once I am done speaking my part, he starts going absolutely nuclear. He told me that I am unprofessional, have no ethics, no integrity, and should be embarrassed. He told me I am ruining my professional reputation over “$800 before taxes.” I am disgracing my school, there will be consequences, this will affect me 20 years down the road, etc. He basically berated me for 5 minutes until he eventually hung up on me. Whenever he paused for a response, I just told him that I was sorry, I didn’t know, and that amount of money is significant to me right now.

I was really taken back by his response and cannot stop thinking about it. 

His point of view: I verbally accepted the offer and should honor this commitment despite the pay difference.

My point of view: The pay is not competitive (25%-40% lower), I should have known and never applied. However, if that $2500, $5000, or “$800 before taxes” doesn’t come out of his pocket, it comes out of mine. I feel like that is just business.

There is a part of me that feels like I broke a promise/commitment and there is a part of me that feels his pay rate is completely unfair. Also, even though I went back on my verbal acceptance, he still has 3 months to find someone else.  

I am hoping to get some third party opinions on this because I don’t what to think.

•Should I know about current verification tools/techniques before I go because I currently know nothing pretty much.

•What categories of questions would they be likely to ask?

•Would I be expected to memorize some VHDL syntax in written tests?

•How much about their company should I know about?

The test was something I had never done before. 

Basically, I was shown some inefficient code that calculates a Fibonacci sequence. 

The goal of the test was to provide a quicker and more ""time-efficient"" way to get the same result.
Now, I obviously know what a Fibonacci sequence is and I kinda know how to code it but the lead tech was sitting right next to me watching me type and I kind of blacked out and I forgot very basic stuff. Just his presence so close to me watching my every move was making me so nervous that I bombed. 

The actual goal he told me at the end of the interview was unit testing so that I wouldn't ""break"" any code if I was working in a hypothetical team. I hadn't done that yet so I couldn't continue.

Anyway, he showed me how to do it and now I know but is this a normal thing to be expected from a junior .NET developer? The job ad stated that no experience was required, just basic knowledge of the .NET environment, preferably of C#.

They offered me a 4 week (unpaid) internship as he did say that I had potential. He saw of my projects on Github.
Should I do the internship? It's the biggest IT company in my country...

(I'm a male).

Having always been a bit self-conscious about my pale skin, I had started at the time going to a tanning salon. It was always the same two ladies at the front desk and they always gave me great advice. They actually introduced me to a bed that was part water bed and part tanning machine. It soothed me and helped me deal with my crippling anxiety as well as give me a nice gentle tan.

So, one day, I enter the salon and,instead of the two ladies that usually worked there, I saw a girl who looked 15, maybe younger. I asked her where the two ladies were and she told me she was doing an internship at the salon and that the owners were gone for lunch. Well, whatever. I ask her for tokens for the waterbed thingy and that's where shit started to hit the proverbial fan. Teeny girl replied that the waterbed was under maintenance but, wouldn't you know it, they had a brand new tanning bed that I ABSOLUTELY should try. I ask her a bit more about that new bed and she tells me that it's the best they have and that it's called the PowerSun 3000, or something like that. Immediately, I ask her...""Errr, with that name, are you sure I'm going to be fine, given that I'm blonde and pale as fuck?"" ""Sure, it's extra safe!,"" she replies. ""So, should I book you for 30 minutes?""

Like an idiot, I said yes. Despite all common sense.

So, I entered the cabin and stared at the monster in front of me. It was about twice as big as my usual waterbed thing. Alarm bells immediately start ringing in my head, while the shy part of my brain tried to turn them off. I wasn't about to crawl back to the front desk and ask for a refund. I'm a man, dammit!

So, I took my clothes off. Yes, all of them.

The first ten minutes felt good. Kinda warmish.

The next ten minutes, I started noticing a mild headache.

During the final ten minutes, I was in mild pain and felt as if I had been placed in an industrial oven.

So, I left the tanning bed early. Two minutes early exactly. I had spent 28minutes in that thing.

I walked back home feeling exhausted and aching everywhere, a bit as if I had the flu or something. I went to bed and slept for a bit. When I woke up, I felt pain all over my body. I went to the bathroom and almost screamed when I looked at myself in the mirror. I was naked. While the parts that are always exposed to the sun (face,forearms,etc) looked only reddish, the rest of my body was a nasty shade of bright red. Like, red like the label on a brick of tomato soup.

I went to the doc, obviously, who diagnosed me with a second-degree burn on 85% of my body. He prescribed a cream and paracetamol (Tylenol).

Obviously, the Tylenol did nothing for the pain. Even having a single bedsheet on top of my body was excruciating. I remember once, my lovely cat decided that now was a good time to jump on my legs while I lying in bed. I think the scream that followed must have emotionally scared her for life.

Then, after a while, came the blisters. I had blisters all over my body. They were so large that sometimes they would pop during the night and completely wet the bed due to the liquid contained in them.

I spent hours and hours peeling layers of dead skin off my body. You've never truly loved until you've spent an hour trying to peel off dead skin from your still-painful balls at three in the morning.

All in all, it took me about three to four weeks to feel normal again.

My only regret is that I didn't live at the time in the kind of country where you could sue for millions for stuff like that. At least I could have consoled myself with bundles of cash...

TL/DR: went to a tanning salon and, despite having a sensitive skin, trusted the advice of a 15yo intern who wanted to make a big sale and sent me to the most powerful bed they had, which caused me a 2nd degree burn on most of my body and weeks of pain.

I'm a new graduate (May 2018) at a very non-target school (American private engineering university, but not known for CS at all; ""big 4"" and other tech-industry companies recruit at rival school but not here). Despite the lack of school reputation, I've had four great internships, two at small companies (software contractor for that big 2-letter conglomerate, and a defense contractor), and two at huge companies (a household name news publication, followed by a company within Yahoo!).

The most recent, the company within Y! (now Oath/Verizon, etc.), gave me a conversion offer, to stay at their NYC office. It's a great company and office - though what happens after the acquisition remains to be seen - and the base pay is pretty good, but no equity and small signing bonus compared to some others I've seen in the city (105k base, 5% bonus, 10k signing; other benefits promised in offer but no specifics).

Being used to applying for internships, it seems I waited a bit long to apply to most companies. I've applied to the companies I think I want to work for more than this offer, including the ""big"" ones, and so far got the Snapshot request from Google on Friday, and heard back for another evaluation-type thing from one other. I've had internal referrals to Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, but haven't heard anything from them. I've been applying to Apple, but from what I can tell they aren't going to hire new grads that aren't conversions this far out.

My biggest issue: my school is in the northeast, and the weather here is really bad (snow and unbearably cold most of the year). I've been in NYC the last 2 summers. I've had enough experience, and visited, to know that I'd vastly prefer Seattle (first choice) or SF area to NYC, and really want to finally be somewhere other than this state. Working at two big companies in NYC, a common sentiment is people wanting to go out west, but end up getting stuck in the area due to family, etc. - and I really don't want this to be me.

I also have some reservations working for, essentially, Verizon, as well as the nature of the work I'm doing. While I know it's highly applicable work (related to analytics), it's not the most interesting to me - I'm the ""C wizard"" type, and was working on some really interesting Linux kernel/hypervisor-mode stuff at the defense contractor, as well as in research at my university, and would much rather do this sort of (lower-level/systems) work.

Regardless of the outstanding offer, which has a deadline a week from tomorrow, I'm going to continue to see what I can get. I'd feel bad, but if Google or Apple or similar company in a better location with more interesting work happens to give me an offer later, of all the companies to renege on, I would not feel bad doing it to Verizon, and I know the people I worked with would understand, even if HR isn't happy.

What I wonder though - is this stupid? Should I just take this offer and see how it goes? Especially if I then move to another entry-level position at another company after a year - short lateral moves are questionable of course, but doing it once to change locations seems legitimate enough to me. But would finding such a lateral move in the first place be difficult after a year?

Certainly part of my dislike for NYC is having lived in pretty bad accommodations during the internships, and the salary should be enough to improve that at least slightly - though I feel like I certainly could get paid more, I'd be uncomfortable negotiating against myself by not having another offer. Is it likely that I'd hear back from any other company, if I can extend the deadline on the pending offer at least two weeks or so?

Any advice would be great - and thank you!

**tl;dr: have an okay, 1-week-exploding offer from ex-Yahoo! company in NYC, but I haven't liked NYC in the past, and the work isn't necessarily the direction I want. Have enough internship + research experience I should be able to find at least something else...**"

Some background, I'm an intern in some company that is a bit far from where I live, so it's normal for me to wake up early in the morning to be on the way to work before the morning rush hour starts. Yesterday the government issued an announcement that some establishments (I absorbed this information as schools only) would not have classes. I interpreted this as cancellation of classes because of bad weather. I was asked by a friend if I was free today the night before, but I said I wasn't because I was interning at a government agency and they still had to go to work even if school was out. I woke up at 5:30 am (really shitty cuz I am in no way a morning person), and arrived at the office at around 6 am. A few things were weird on my way to the office, 1) there was almost no traffic on the way, and considering that it was a Monday, this seemed very off; 2) the gates to the compound were half closed (they normally weren't). As I went down the hill to the offices and rounded the corner a guard saw me and told me that the offices were closed today and that work was canceled too. *Shit* so I calmly walk back the (to my estimate) half kilometer where I could catch a ride to where I could catch another ride that would take me home. Got off at my stop and walked a bit more so I could catch another ride to a nearby McDonald's to eat some breakfast (I normally eat breakfast at the office canteen, but since office was closed I was *really hungry*). 

Here comes the coffee. I didn't know that the coffee would wreck my stomach so as soon as I finished eating and went outside (by then a slight drizzle was falling, *shit*, didn't have an umbrella fml), my stomach started acting up. I waited for few more minutes, contemplating whether to wait until I catch a ride and take a dump at home, or just head back in Mickey D's to shit there. A few rides came passing by but they weren't going to stop at where I was gonna get off so I decided to get this shit out of my body (pun intended). 

Went to the rest room and saw there was no tissue. Fuck it, I need to shit. Shit was soft and wet. Fuck. Knew it was smeared all over my asshole. No bidet in sight as well. Contemplating using my underwear to wipe and dispose of it. Decide against. Hurry back outside hoping no one smells my nasty ass. I wait a few more minutes but still none of my rides were passing through. I see one that isn't what I would normally ride but it was good enough. I really needed to wash my ass with a bidet. Shit. I ride and pay, and a few minutes into the ride the vehicle stops and a bystander says that the driver is the only one going farther than the others, and that he should only go to a certain point (about 4 kms from where I live), because there was a **transport strike**. 

The puzzle pieces fall into place and I realize that the reason why there was little to no traffic on the way to work, why it wasn't a working day, and why no rides came by that stopped at my stop, was because **there was a fucking transport strike**. *fml*. I get off at the point where the ride circled back around and saw drivers protesting and shit. There was an alternative ride home but the cars were air-conditioned, and with me having my ass smeared with shit, couldn't bring myself to put that nasty torture on anyone else, so I decided to walk my ass home.

Passed by my friend's house and I told him that I walked back from the 5km away point up to here and his mom offered me food and I declined bc I already had breakfast. Walked a bit more to the main road, and here I saw rides I could take to where my house was at. The transport strike probably only affected rides going back and forth from the other road that I walked from. *fml*

Got home and saw shit smeared on my underwear. Felt like a child shitting himself. Washed up, but my insides still feel dirty, an hour later.

All in all I probably walked for an hour and a half, idk. I'm tired.

tl;dr, wasn't updated on current events, didn't know work was suspended, coffee wrecked my bowel movements, couldn't catch a ride home and had to walk 5kms, smeared shit all over my asshole and my underwear. 

*fml*"

- Internship said I could do 12 months.  Made research plans with a prof.  They told me legit last minute I had to do 16 months.  Ended up having to cancel plans with prof.

- Said I could work from home once a week after I had a bit more experience in the company.  Now its no, you can't.

- Lied about hours.  I'm working 45 hours a week, deal was 37.5  That's 8.5 hours extra a week.  And I don't even take a lunch break to eat!

- Completely inflexible.  Have to come in at 9 am.  No flex hours.  Nothing.

- The company is extremely frustrating, especially my superiors.  I feel angry with their behavior (aside from lying) and dread going to work.

- Pay is garbage

Realistically speaking, what can I do here? I'm pretty frustrated. Any advice for me?  I'm doing a software internship but am an EngSci student.  Honestly, regret working at this company.  It's small and is a piece of shit.  I have a very high GPA (3.9) and could have done better..."

I've been in the undergraduate for 6 years. This is mostly due to my taking on multiple ""internships"" which slowed my academic career greatly. I say ""internships"" because most of them had me working 40+ hours a week while taking classes. Needless to say I've had to retake a few classes. Anyways enough complaining, these internships have taught me more than my entire stint in academia ever has.

I self-studied and got my A+ in June 2016. Then I started Cisco classes last fall. I'm currently in Cisco 3, and just passed the CCENT. I'll finish my Cisco courses in May and then prepare for the CCNA.

I have a 16-month internship which helps my resume, but it has been pretty weak on the experience side. Mostly setting up workstations, loading Windows 7, swapping out hard drives... not a lot of troubleshooting experience gained.

I have excelled in the Cisco courses according to my instructor, and I feel like I have a good understanding of the networking fundamentals.

I just applied for a help desk job at the local hospital, and my questions mostly pertain to that.

1) Should I be looking for a job other than help desk since my concentration has been more on networking than PCs? I feel more comfortable configuring a switch/router at this point than I do troubleshooting basic PC issues (I know this is a problem that I must address as far as my training is concerned).

2) If I get this help desk job, do they typically offer any training or do I need to be able to go in there and start answering phones and solving problems right from the start?

I'm excited to get into the networking side of things. I'm not too proud to put in my time at help desk if that's the logical step for my career and my training. Any help is much appreciated!"
76okp5,8,2017-10-16,How do meetups work? Also internship clarifications.,brannith,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/76okp5/how_do_meetups_work_also_internship_clarifications/,"Good evening Reddit,

I have been a longtime follower of this stress-inducing subreddit, but there are a few things that seem to have conflicting answers or are not mentioned that I would like to ask, and would love for someone to answer!

First, my background. I am a current sophomore/junior at a midwestern big 10 university in the bachelor of arts in computer science program (I had switched from a different major, so while I just started my computer science classes, but I technically have all of my liberal education requirements done, so all I really need is like 30 credits of comp sci courses, and I am taking the courses a comp sci major would spread over a year in one semester). I also am getting a minor in math. Finally, I have a 3.7 GPA. I can graduate as early as December 2018, but I've listed my graduation as December 2019 on my resume.

My first question is about meetups. I visited the career guy recently and he yelled at me because I haven't done much thought into career development at all (I have retail and factory work experience, in which I was very successful and moved up the ladder quickly because I'm a hard worker, but I really had no idea how the professional world worked). Now that I understand the value networking provides, and I was wondering if meetups are a good way to go though that process, and also how do meetups usually go? I've always looked at them on meetup and thought about going, but I have no idea how I should dress, if I should bring anything, and how to talk to people so I haven't. I'm a pretty awkward guy (I don't think I'm shy, I was a very successful sales man, but I've only met one new person since I left high school, and I find it hard to relate to people. I definitely would rather spend more time coding on my computer than talking with friends, so I suppose I haven't invested much time in that, but I when I have tried to make friends or talk with people, I screw it up a lot, so I'd like at least some idea of what I'm getting into so I can prepare.) 

Also, when should someone begin applying for internships? Most people on reddit use school years to gauge this, but I'm unsure of how to interpret that. I'm taking an intro to data structures this term (which is basically like Java for dummies) and next term I'm taking the for real algorithm and data structures. Are these good prerequisites for beginning to apply? I do work on leet code and CTCI on my own, but I don't have a good background in like 25% of the data structures and like 40% of the algorithms, am I not good enough to begin applying? I also have a good background in a lot of programming languages and common APIs. Also, how important is the cover letter and what are employers looking for on a cover letter from an intern? When I try writing mine it just feels like I'm incoherently listing everything I've ever worked with ever, so it just sounds messy and I never end up applying.

Finally, my third question is how valuable is Linux experience? I only ask this because while most of my classmates have never seen a command line before, I have pretty intermediate Linux experience, and I can do most basic Linux system administrator stuff from memory (like crontab, iptables, ssh, xorg, deamon management, NetworkManager etc). Is this worth bringing up at all or should I just put in on the bottom of my resume and leave it at that? I suppose I know how to roll an RPM as well, but that's the only thing that I think is marginally software development related.

tl;dr : How do I git gud?

* What are meetups like and should/how should I take advantage of them

* When is a good time to start applying for internships (and should I lie about my graduation date on my resume? i.e. push it back)

* Should I worry about writing the perfect cover letter, or just read like five articles about the company and list off everything I've ever done?
(I know this has been asked, but I've heard just about every answer)

* Does anyone care if you are some compile your own kernel Linux user if you're applying for something non-devops?

Thanks Reddit, I truly appreciate any response!"

Near the end of last month I was contacted by another company. They interviewed me and extended an offer which I accepted last Monday! I'm super stoked because I've only ever had low-paying restaurant jobs.

I can do them just fine when the interviews over, but during I'm a mess.

76qwrv,1,2017-10-16,Seeking advices [Complicate-and-Verbose™ post inside],Drakendan,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/76qwrv/seeking_advices_complicateandverbose_post_inside/,"**TL;DR** is there if you scroll further down, as a forewarning c:

Hello everyone, I have been having many thoughts lately about my professional career and the current situation I live in. To give more clarity: I'm 28 years old, live in Switzerland as an expat, my permit to stay will expire in February with a risk of not being renewed. I have been here since a year and half, learning a good deal of German, though not up to the level I'd like to. 

Point 1: I have had many difficulties finding a job, and after an internship that ended in February I have been seeking since then. The market here seems to delve more into Managerial/Pharma positions, though there are other minor possibilities if you are a native English speaker or have a very good understanding of Swiss-German, which I don't have.

Point 2: my lack of skills. I have studied for foreign languages and economics, but my degree (BA, 3 years) is a very poor degree that was undertaken during a time of strike in Italy for the reform. We lacked professors during lessons, and many studied by themselves up to the exam days. The notions were really general and not really in focus, and I feel like I lack skills in Translation, Interpreting and Marketing in spite of everything. 
I have not been able to discuss my thesis with my master, for personal problems with a professor which I prefer not to discuss at the moment, suffice to say corruption on her part is involved and it's a source of resentment in universities for me.

**Point 3, the most important:** I am unsure of what I would like to do now. Or better, I'm at a loss. I constantly seek out possible new professions, possible new workplaces I can try my luck at. While my education mostly consisted of foreign languages and literature, I am not sure what I would enjoy doing in my life. I often take tests and have ideas: from physical work to office work, I came to understand that there are few branches, in which I have even little to no knowledge or just layman knowledge, that I would like to expand onto. My primary desire is to be able to make a difference for others while also helping myself and my family with a steady income. I have interests in Psychology, I have been helping friends and non online and in real life for years with advices. Even yesterday evening I have been doing that kind of thing with 7 people at the same time. 

I have been thinking that maybe I could become some kind of certified online consultant or online therapist (there was a website I had saved somewhere, but I can't seem to find it. Even non-online would be good of course), since it comes naturally to me to aid others. I do enjoy translating stuff, because i realized that I get to acquire knowledge on various subjects, and that's something I enjoy doing. This is why I often wondered about being an Information Broker, or a Proposal Writer. The second degree I was aiming at before the whole corruption thing happened had legal notions in it, and I do am interested in Legal work as of lately. I think one job involving translating and reviewing patents, or being a sort of paralegal/legal assistant would make me happy. I've looked into the possibility to become a Negotiator, or Mediator (my BA is Science of Mediation Languages, but in reality what was there to learn of mediation was present in the Master and obtained through personal interest. It was just a very poorly made program that was replaced right when I graduated).

Aside from that, I don't really know what I could appreciate in the long run: first because I can't seem to be able to get even trial days accepted (they just hire whoever has the most qualifications or is native from here), secondarily because I'm afraid that workplace ethics, bad colleagues and being pinned to repetitive tasks that wouldn't explore the full potential of a profession would make me really regret making this kind of choice. 

There are many jobs I have looked into, done various tests, checked various websites, even on the psychological importance of potential on work. 

I am not really sure what I aim to get from here, maybe some consulting myself, orientation, advices for how to face these difficulties I deal with since one year, along sadness, feeling of unworthiness, regretting how my life went here and there, which I shouldn't even think because ultimately it did help me become the type of person I am, and I saved some life during it.

**TL;DR IS HERE**: I'm looking for advices on how exactly to proceed from the situation I'm in: a seemingly useless work experience and lack of specialized skill, saturated and small job market where I live, uncertainty on the future. Any opinion, feedback, advice, and anything more you'd like to add, is absolutely welcome.


If you don't mind reading futher, here are some information on myself, and a list of links at the end:

- I'm an INFP, 28 years old

- Interested in jobs related to neuropsychology or consulting/therapy, I am happy when others are. Lately I have been realizing that I feel some kind of connection with those that have mental illnesses or were victims of abuse, if anything because that's what most of my friends are. I feel like I want to help them live a life to the fullest and be back to feel better, especially since I have always been marred by others than simply my own decision, while they could have something better than me if not for these dreadful things.

 
- interested in working in Non-profit/International organizations, like WWF and similar. The reason is that I want to help the planet and the people in it, yadda yadda etc.; mostly I am happy when I know I can make a difference, and while I am shy and might not like dealing too often with people, something akin to an activist or even assisting in a non-profit company could be of my liking.


- legal companies, laws and regulations, mediation and arbitration. I have done this my whole life without being paid, exactly like aiding others with advices on careers, relationships, abuse, and so on. I think it might be interesting to explore this more in detail, especially because I don't appreciate unfairness and maybe, no matter how difficult the job is, it could really be an easier career path.

- HR, as in, helping people find a job and doing a better HR that focuses on the potential, not on screening, of most individuals I deal with. Hiring interests me, because I'm having many problems with it, and many companies seem to say I would be very good for the job, if only I had some more certifications (by doing years of learning again) or experiences.

- Interested in physics, astrophysics, chemistry, am generally computer-savvy but never learned programming. What I'm really interested in lately is Ethical Hacking, White Hats, helping to find owners of cp, abusers, traffickers, and so on.

- Photography: I find it's one of the best arts skills I have, and with the right equipment and courses I could possibly manage to make a job and a living out of it. Though I am totally in the dark for how to go about it, I've been checking some courses and will basically need to save for a possible camera and/or lens later on. Which one, that's still unknown.

- Writing and reviewing: being a writer is something I long for, especially if I become a successful one and can make people dream, write decent stories, good morals, explore issues of human nature and behaviour, reporting news or mistreatments, and so on. Which is also what interests me on sociology and analytics.
On a side note, I always wanted to become a game journalist, but the state the industry is in at the moment makes me very disappointed on the outlook of it.

- Medicine and Psychology: I have often being told I'd have a bright outlook as a neuropsychologist, and would be interested in psychological emergency/first aid. Aside from that I often wanted to be good at medicine, and I'm interested in emergency medicine and procedures, working in a hospital or ambulance, and so on. Though I am not completely convinced of all this, and I believe it's more of something that maybe I just want to keep as an interest.

- biology and other sciences: biology, veterinary work, shelter and marine activities, physics and astrophysics are some things that I am very interested in.

Some resources I've been using, in case anyone is interested:

The attributes I bring are being both a coder as well as enthusiasm to learn and innovate. Not only am I more comfortable around programming but also learned how to communicate better with troubleshooting, supporting, preparation, and researching, especially when it comes to performing under pressure. I like to dive into new things such as when I helped with database migration with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory where our data migration fostered efficient project management. I can learn new things quickly, such as when I learned the PHP and the Laravel framework as a junior programmer at my other former employer. I also explored VueJS in a way that tested my abilities and led to the creation of a user-friendly CRM that is utilized at the company as well as for customers. Communicating technical concepts comes naturally to me for technical and non-technical audiences. As an intern at a Fortune 100 company, I worked with a team on making an email templating tool as well as a personal project where I was the backend creator of a database tool with Elixir and Elm languages which we learned on the job. This saved our colleague 60 hours of work a month for the templating tool and another 40 with the database tool.
I am hoping to start immediately. You can see my projects using this technology and more at the GitHub link I can provide you. I have project to show I can code as well as analyze ideas. While I am a self-described junior, I can certainly make a good team member with learning quickly and having natural curiosity.

76rewz,12,2017-10-16,Considering discipline switch from computer to mechanical,Ubcsoulsucker,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/76rewz/considering_discipline_switch_from_computer_to/,"Hello r/EngineeringStudents,

I'm a current mechanical engineering student (mechatronics option, if it makes any difference), considering switching to computer engineering. I have spent quite a few hours searching on engineering related subreddits and other websites, but would like to finally have some direct advice to my situation. Grad school may happen in the future, but is not a consideration right after graduation.

Here are some of the reasons why I am considering the switch:

1. It seems that pretty much all sources, online or people around me, indicate that salary is going to be better with a computer related field. A good entry level salary is important to me. Oil and gas is a no for me.

2. I am currently doing a manufacturing internship, and I am not satisfied with my work. I understand that one internship tells barely a fraction of the whole story, with ME being such a broad field, but it is pretty much the only engineering work experience I have to base off so far.

3. From anecdotal sources, I seem to hear a lot that with ME, majority of the jobs are quite non-technical, and involves a lot of documentation/management as opposed to actual engineering, whereas with CE, the industry seems to match the expectation more. I would very much prefer technical jobs.

4. I'm finding that ME is more of a knowledge based field more than a skill based field. My preference is the other way, which CE seems to be.

5. There seems to be many more jobs in the computer field, even just looking for an internship.

6. I am spending a lot of time in student team, and it can be quite draining and time consuming. With CE, it seems that you can easily build up resume with personal projects, paced as you wish and without such time commitment to a team.

7. I have enjoyed what limited experience I have had with programming/coding.

My concerns about the switch:

1. I am currently doing very well in ME, as far as grades are concerned. I am worried that I am making a switch without really knowing what's out there, and what's possible with ME. I am also worried that me doing well in ME will not correlate to how well I do in CE. All I have to go off at the moment to assess this is that I am good at math/physics, and I have taken an intro level programming course that I also did well in.

2. The switch will delay me by a year, and will also mean more tuition.

3. I hear a lot about how saturated CS/CE is becoming, and that the field is going to slow down.

4. I will be behind other CE students; I am going into third year as an ME, and if/when I switch, I will be onto my second semester of third year. I'll only have ME internships list on my resume applying for CE internships.

5. I still do like the things I'm learning at school in ME. I love designing moving things.


I understand that there really isn't a correct answer to this, and I am just trying to gather as much information as I can before I make a decision. I would appreciate any input!

I will provide some background information and ask for your opinions on choosing between two schools: Drexel or Colorado School of Mines. Both have pros and cons and I would appreciate any guidance you can offer. 

&amp;nbsp;

 My first bachelor’s was in biochemistry, and I worked for a year at a chemical plant in QC afterwards. This experience in addition to another with an engineering group during my first degree has convinced me that I should pursue a career in engineering. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point I have spoken to many academic and practicing engineers and have determined the best course for success taking into account my financial situation and prior classes is to pursue a second bachelor’s as a transfer student, and then a master’s in a BS/MS program. I have already taken many prerequisites from my previous degree (calculus 1-3, linear systems, physics 1-2, chemistry 1-2, organic chemistry 1-2, python programming, circuits). My end goal is to practice in industry, not to stay in academia. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have been accepted as a transfer student to a few schools and I am deciding between Colorado School of Mines and Drexel University. 
&amp;nbsp;

###Drexel Pros
- Co-op program with three, 6 month paid co-ops built into the schedule
- Solid engineering program
- Graduate coop, for MS non-thesis with practice

&amp;nbsp;

###Drexel Cons
- Will take about 2 years longer due to co-ops and a start time this April instead of January 
- Not super enthusiastic about Philadelphia, though I am willing to live pretty much anywhere to pursue my goal

&amp;nbsp;
###CSM Pros
- Very rigorous and well-respected engineering program
- Availability of a 6-month paid co-op built into the schedule, though not mandatory
- More deeply connected to energy industries, which I am very interested in
- Golden Colorado seems like a lovely place to live. 
- More interesting MS with thesis research (to me) based on a survey of professor’s research and past theses
&amp;nbsp;

###CSM Cons
- Will have to retake physics I and II (They have specific requirements for the courses even though my previous courses were from an accredited program)
- No MS with practice option, either MS with thesis or non-thesis
- Might be able to do a graduate internship, but not as part of the official program

&amp;nbsp;

Generally, what the decision comes down to is spending an extra two years at Drexel over CSM due to co-ops, and the decision to pursue an MS thesis or non-thesis. I would like to hear your opinions on whether having more co-op time in school or more overall time in the workforce (graduating earlier) would be more productive. On one hand, it makes sense to start working as quickly as possible because I am behind on time as a second bachelor’s student. However, my initial success in finding a job may be benefited by having more co-op experience. Additionally, for practicing in industry would you recommend pursuing an MS thesis or non-thesis?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks again for taking the time.

Most suitable graduate program is..?,AlkaKadri,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/76sxzi/chemical_engineering_and_mathematics/,"I'm a newcomer to this subreddit, so apologies if I'm asking the wrong questions here. First, here's some background as to how I ended up where I am...

After my first year of general engineering, I ranked the Chemical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering specialization as my top choice, and got admitted into that. I sort of felt like I'd forsaken my life-long passion for mathematics, however, and decided I would pursue a minor in that over the summer term by enrolling in 8 courses (crazy, but I got through it with a 4.0). Fast-forward to my 4th year on internship, and minor's now become a full-blown degree in Pure &amp; Applied Mathematics. I've really been set on pursuing a top graduate school after I'm finished from my university, so I've worked hard to maintain a GPA of 3.93 while completing 51 courses in the past 3 years. I've also got a summer's worth of research experience with stem cells (part of the BME requirement), and I'm working an R&amp;D position at a polymer company for 16 months.

The trouble is, the more I explore graduate school options, the more I realize that ChemE and Mathematics don't mix together as well as other Engineering degrees (say, Electrical Engineering). I was initially going to go for either a Materials Science or Chemical Engineering masters/PhD, but lately I've been looking into programs like engineering physics and computational/mathematical engineering, and those seem much more aligned with what I'm passionate about exploring, but they contrast with my past research experience very poorly..

So I guess my question is, to people that are more experienced in any of those research areas, would you say that graduate schools will take a ChemE + Math major seriously applying into them?"

Well, during early August, the employer sat me down and basically said we don't need you past the summer.

Sometimes I just feel I'm unlikable, but I have close friends outside of Cornell that are older than me and graduated, so I don't think realistically that's the problem. At least I hope not! I've been told I'm kind and affable, albeit a bit shy and awkward at times.


I also just find that CS is especially clique-y, and it seems like everyone has friends in their classes and people they can study with or just people they can cluster with and I'm just left out or treated like a fifth wheel when I try to talk to people. I also live off-campus so there aren't as many opportunities to meet people since I live around mostly families and working professionals, rather than a lot of college students. And being a woman, I feel especially embarrassed because it just seems like you're supposed to be able to make friends so easily and be sociable.

It seems like making friends is like applying for internships and the application window has closed, since everyone has found a friend group and isn't as interested in letting anyone in if they're not a mutual friend. 

I guess I'm just ranting because I'm lonely and it feels almost impossible to make actual friends because you have to have friends to make friends. "

I was originally going to go to school to study Chemistry but from my first programming class I was hooked. I graduated last Winter from a pretty good school. Time management was tough for me at university and I struggled in almost every class. I have no actual projects as I was already struggling to pass my classes. Ive applied to hundreds of places as an intern and a new grad. In most cases I end up getting ghosted or being instantly rejected. I even got an interview for a local company at my schools job fair and bombed it and didnt get anything out of it. Im starting to think that Im just not smart enough to be a good programmer. Everyone here talks about basically curing cancer and getting into these amazing companies. I cant afford my rent working at this coffee shop and Im too exhausted after work to solve immense amounts of algorithm problems.

tl;dr realized going into this industry was a huge mistake and that the american dream is dead. Some days I almost refuse to believe how well people are doing on this subreddit. Fuck computer science"
76vuc3,6,2017-10-16,Graduating from college with an engineering dream job but something is telling me I don't belong there. What should I do?,dronesters,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/76vuc3/graduating_from_college_with_an_engineering_dream/,"Over the summer I was a an engineering intern at an amazing tech company that makes revolutionary tech toys and robots. It is pretty much a dream job and I know so many people would kill to be in my position. 

The internship was extended into the fall and I was just recently offered to continue after I graduate from college this semester. I do really enjoy the company and the people but there is a little voice inside my head telling me that something isn't right. 

I can't pinpoint what the primary reason is for these feelings but I imagine it is sorta a combination of a couple things including: 

1. Because it is a larger company I don't feel like I have a lot of ownership or impact on the projects I work on. 

2. I hate the feeling of my life becoming so repetitive and going by so fast when working in an office environment.

3. I feel like there may be more to life than working a full time office job day-in day-out.

Now there are also some other things to consider that are important to the situation. 
1. I have 100k in student loans and this may be my best shot at paying those off quickly.

2. I could learn a lot of valuable skills from the people that work at the company because they are all phenomenally brilliant.

3. Working there could help give me legitimacy within the field and get me further in the tech industry. 

So, I am just lost on whether this is an opportunity I should pursue or not. I could continue working at the company until I get completely frustrated with the lifestyle and quit then or I could take a risk and go on an adventure to try to find something that better suits my lifestyle and work desires. I'm all for taking risks and going on adventures but I am afraid of giving up a really amazing opportunity to pay off some loans and learn/ grow within the industry. That being said, I am very self-motivated and know that I will learn and grow whichever option I decide to pursue. 

So, given the pros and cons of the situation, how do you all think you would approach this and which path do you think you would take?

Let me know if there is any more info I can provide."

I was looking at my course requirements and I have free electives. If I plan those electives accordingly I can definitely get a minor! I don't know exactly what I want to do when I graduate, which makes this selection harder. My school offers pretty basic minors. I've read some places that things like psychology, business, etc might be beneficial because they set you apart from other engineers. I feel like I am most interested in Computer Science though. Math and Physics are also options. I just don't know what would be most useful. 

Do employers care about minors remotely? 
I have constant anxiety because I feel that no one will want to hire me due to my GPA (~3.0)
I heard that a minor will kind of improve your resume if you have a less than amazing GPA.

I also heard that internships are really crucial because they provide work experience. The idea of internships scares me so much because I'm not super confident in my abilities and I don't want the company I intern at to think I'm braindead or unqualified to be an engineer. Have you done an internship? What was it like? Was it hard?

I've applied to a few internships, but most of them are out of season and don't start until next spring/summer. My job experience is lacking to say the least. I held down a recurring seasonal job at a company about two hours away for three years before quitting to pursue school full time. 

I'm running out of options and I fear my degree is losing credibility by the day. Do I continue grabbing at straws, hoping to snag a full-time position, or step back and focus on an internship? Is there anything else I could be doing to boost prospects in the mean time?

I'm not saying that they get this job with no experience, of course. But I'm wondering anybody ever gets such a job as their first job, i.e. they have absolutely nothing to put for their previous work experience on the job application, not even a minimum wage retail job.

Is a bachelor's degree really all you need? Even if you've never worked or had a boss before (other than college professors), would it be possible to land a job as a software engineer? Or do you need an internship at the very minimum?"

I walked through my thoughts thoroughly before writing anything down, put up good edge cases, and then solved it with the best worst case run time. Interviewer put up one edge case I missed I understood it immediately and rewrote my algorithm to adjust for it. Then he asked me to write the best average case and I again walked through my thoughts and wrote it down. We finished with plenty of time and had a nice chat about their company, mutual interests we shared, and then my personal passion for tech. I think I might have even finished the interview early. Not to say it was perfect but I feel like it was a good interview.

I would be thrilled to learn another language, so a language barrier is not a major concern. I'm particularly interested in Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany and Canada.

I have recently graduated with a degree in computer engineering (July '17) from a reputable university, and am now looking for computer science MS programs, with an emphasis on machine learning and / or natural language processing. I intend to get more research experience over the course of those two years, and most likely pursue a PhD upon graduation.

Unfortunately, I have no publications to speak of, and a subpar GPA (3.37) due to a health problem in my junior year. However, I managed to graduate in time with a heavy workload, scoring 3.6 on average in my last three semesters. I scored 115 on TOEFL, and am going to take the GRE next week. I had a research summer internship at a robotics lab (involving deep reinforcement learning) and another R&amp;D-ish software engineering one at a major defense company. I have good references from 2-3 professors as well.

**$LK** - Me  
**$IAMA Mac** - Impatient User  
**Software** - In house software developed only for Windows machines that did something I forgot.  

*It should be noted that the mac's in the edit bays were not running Boot Camp, Parallels or any other software that would normally allow software built for Windows to run on a mac. These were your normal, vanilla flavored iMacs. There was a lot of software developed in house that made certain jobs easier for certain departments. This particular intern had finished editing a piece for a show and couldn't get it to play, therefore it was b/c of missing software, not b/c of impatience. This typically happened b/c they would finish the edit, ingest the piece and then immediately try to play it back and it wouldn't b/c ingests are not instant, despite what they would have you believe. Especially on a heavy day like this one.*

&gt;Tech services, this is **$LK**....standard greeting, blah blah blah.  

&gt;Yes, this is **$IAMA Mac.** I have a Mac in my edit bay and I am missing software I need to do my job.  

&gt;**$LK** - What software?  

&gt;**$IAMA Mac** - I need **software.** It's not on the computer in this edit bay, it's missing.  

&gt;**$LK** - That's b/c you're on a Mac. It only runs on Windows. Why do you need **software?** What seems to be the problem?  

&gt;**$IAMA Mac** - I've ingested video and it won't play now. I need **software.** Someone loaded it for me on this computer 2 days ago, now it's gone. Look at ticket# 12345.  

&gt;**$LK** - That notes on that ticket say they came to edit bay XX, which also has a mac, and the tech said it was working by the time they got there. You are currently in YY. Also, the video you ingested earlier isn't finished ingesting. It appears that you started it 2 minutes ago. It's queued and waiting it's turn. It should play normally after it has finished.  

&gt;**$IAMA Mac** - Well, they loaded something that got it working. Here, check ticket# 67890 from yesterday.  

&gt;**$LK** - That one says that file was not fully ingested before you tried to play it, like the current one. After the ingest finished, the file played normally without any input from the tech. You were in bay XY, and no tech came down. You are in bay YY today. I'm certain the file will play just fine once the ingest has finished. It will send you a notification once it's done.  

&gt;**$IAMA Mac** - Well, someone did something.  

&gt;**$LK** - Not from what I can tell. It appears that both times they just let the ingest servers do their job, but I will send someone down to take a look at it.  

*Put ticket in as low, write up detailed notes in the secret part of the ticket about user not waiting on ingest to finish before trying to play, sent ticket over. Skip ahead 15 minutes, ticket still hasn't been picked up by anyone. Got a call back from $IAMA Mac fully expecting her to be 7 different kinds of angry b/c no one had come to her edit bay yet. Got surprised when she was actually happy. She said that she kept clicking the play button and it finally started playing. Thanked me for being magical and fixing it before someone came down.*

TL;DR - User has no patience, nothing was actually broke. Called me back to tell me I was magical b/c I had *fixed* an issue. Didn't do anything apart from putting ticket in low and wait....and put away the magical wand of the Lambs."

* Bachelor degree in Computer Science
* Around 3 years of full time work experience as a web developer and 2 years of internships
* Fluent in english and portuguese; A2 German (still studying but won't reach fluency before i move)
* Around 10k euro in savings


**What i'm looking for**:

* Better quality of life in general than my current country (Brazil). 
* Availability of web dev jobs where the spoken language is english
* Good public transport (don't have driver's license nor do i want to get one any time soon)
* Good health care system (i don't have any big health problems that i know of but i have dealt with depression half of my life so easy access to mental health treatments like therapy is important to me)


I was seriously considering moving to Berlin since i have a couple non-german acquaintances there and also my german language exchange partner goes to uni there and maybe she could help me deal with bureaucracy in german. But after reading a lot about how hard it is becoming to find a place to live in Berlin i got second thoughts, specially because i never considered any other cities. My initial plan was renting a place on Airbnb for around a month and during that month search for a more long term residence (likely a WG) and interview for jobs like crazy (will try scheduling some even before setting my feet in the country). I focused in Berlin because of knowing some people there since i never lived somewhere where i didn't know anyone at all. I've been to a few european capitals but they were just short term visits. I wouldn't mind living in any of those but i don't really have a real grasp of what would that entail since i never ""lived like a local"" in any. I don't have the urge to live in any of the ""cool places"", i just wanna move somewhere where i can build a decent life for myself. I don't aim to live in absurd luxury, just earning enough to pay for the essentials plus to keep a gym membership, buy the occasional books and videogames, build some security savings and maaaybe travel once in a while would be great.


**So what are your opinions? Any suggestion of cities that might fit my requirements? Any places in which you guys lived and had a good experience only speaking english? (I don't mind learning another language, in fact i like doing so but ofc that takes a lot of time so i need to be able to rely on english at least initially) Also if you have an IT background it'd be great to hear about which technologies are in high demand in the cities/countries you suggest me.**

Thanks a lot in advance and have a nice day :)

There were a few points where I made some simple mistakes (forgot a return statement for a recursive function, etc). There were a few things I didn't mention until asked (like I figured floating point precision errors would be obvious to anyone using a certain function). There were a couple instances where I misunderstood what the interviewer was asking about (especially with Big-O questions, I knew the answers, I just didn't realize which part he was asking about). I also spent a bit longer than I probably needed to explaining some things. 

Overall I felt pretty good! This is my second set of interviews from Google (third, but I had already accepted an offer the first time). It's especially nice since I come from a non top-N school."

At my college, I'm taking a course on system architecture currently. In the coming semesters I plan to take courses on distributed systems, intro to Parallel Computing, compiler design and implementation, operating systems lab and advanced OS lab. With my core requires I still need to take a course on programming languages, either an intro to A.I. or graphics  (not sure what is good for me being a systems guy), and a Capstone (Sadly my university doesn't have a Capstone course for systems focus so I need to choose between a graphics one or Web based one or A.I.  based one and possibly a software engineering one). The courses mentioned previously (before core part) are my electives. Sadly, due to poor test taking and problems with my family, I've been unable to maintain a super strong gpa so internships are a challenge for me to get. I keep trying though. I also have trouble with making my own projects at this point time due to what's going on at home. Hopefully, things will clear up closer to graduation. I do have an interest in security (more of a hobby for me). So, I've been learning more about security topics on the side (summer), and took a course in information security. My goal is to be an OS developer or maybe even a system administrator. Here's my questions for you cs members out there..
  
   1. Is there any topics in OS I'll need to learn on my own not taught during your studies as a cs major?
   2. What are good certifications to get as an OS developer and for my security hobby?
   3. Are the courses mentioned for the upcoming semesters in systems good? Is compiler design a good choice?
   4. Any potential internships for a systems guy? If so, what are some good companies to go for and what positions?
   5. Are companies really that picky about gpa? Chase  (bank) stated if you didn't have a solid 3.2 then you wouldn't make the cut as an example.
   6. If you want to learn to build your own OS from scratch, what are some good reading materials to look at that focus on this?
   7. Any tips for success in this particular branch of computer science after college to succeed and get decent jobs in systems?

771oxw,1,2017-10-17,Should I quit my job?,RoAlJo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/771oxw/should_i_quit_my_job/,"So I started a new job a couple weeks ago and it's my ""first"" job since I fell ill about three years ago. (Though I was working form home for the last year.)

It's an office job, nothing new really. I've worked in an office before for about 4 years, before that I worked for 8 years in a school.

Anyway, this new job... I hate it. I feel depressed just thinking about going there. The work is *okay*, not the best but it is interesting and I'm doing good at it as people have told me. The people I work with... they're not the best. Some are okay but most of them aren't very helpful.

For instance, I and the new starters were told that if we had a customer treating us, we can transfer them to this automated line that will basically tell them they need to calm down or we will end the call. I had a guy calling me a terrorist, saying he is standing outside waiting to beat me up, that he was going to make a youtube video of me and a load of other crap. It was annoying and the call wasn't getting anywhere so I wanted to transfer him and then if he came back see if I could help him out then. Only thing was, none of the staff would let me transfer him to that line. I ended up sitting there for an hour listening to him make threats while I just sat there repeating myself, offing help and trying to progress the call but it got nowhere. Thankfully he hung up the call.

That's just one example of how ""bad"" the company is. The other thing was we had an hours worth of training and then we were thrown on the phones. We knew nothing and one girl quit at the end of the day because we basically had zero help, so their training skills are subpar. Also, they missed out A LOT of vital things in the training so a lot of the time we would have to ask them what are we meant to do and we'd just get looks like ""you should know"".

The other day I was moved to a new desk which is meant to be my desk and it was filthy. Sticky drink stains, the draw was filled with crap yadda yadda yadda. Not too much of a big deal, I decided to just clean it up. Ooh but nope, my boss stopped me and said I have to do it on my own time. I asked if I could at least wipe it down quickly so I'm not working on a sticky surface but nope, wasn't allowed to do that either.

Then there's how the company is run. We're not allowed sick days, this includes hospital appointments. If we have one that comes up we can't have the day off or whatever. We're not allowed to look for another job if they find out we are we will get fired. We're not allowed to be studying or wanting to go to Uni. They basically don't like the idea that people might ""leave"" they only want people staying for as many years as they can, which is fair I guess.

but that said, there's not much promotion in the company, They don't really have ""managers"". They have the owers, one manager and that stay downstairs. Upstairs are just us call centre workers and we're pretty much left to do what we want. Which is cool and all but that means there's no chance for you to go up in the company. They do have this one thing where if you pass the ""training"" you get a little pay rise. Though some people have been there for about five years and haven't passed the training.

And to add, I'm not the only new starter that hates it there. I started with two girls, and all three of us are looking for a new job. Ther were five people who started before us and one of them remains. One had gotten fired for calling in sick, another got fried and everyone assumes it was because he was job hunting. Then the other two quit on their own accord. Also, adding to that, they hire about 3-4 people every two weeks yet the company only has 40 members of staff total.

Now another little bit of important information. I'm meeting a friend in London who I haven't seen in years. We're meeting in December so I will need money for then. Of course, Christmas is around the corner as well so I will need money for that. My initial idea was, I would stay with this job until December and then I would quit and then find a new job in the new year. (We're not allowed to take holiday.)

Though I am already HATING this place. I feel exhausted just thinking about going back there. Like I said, I don't mind the work that much, it's quite interesting, however, the way the company is run is shit. I used to work in Mc Donalds and I would go back there compared to here.

I could job hunt while working here but the only problem is the shifts are so awkward, I keep missing calls and not being able to make interviews. I had a call about an interview but by the time I called back they said the jobs gone. This week every day I'm working 7-5/6, which I don't mind but like I said, it just gets in the way of finding a job.

I asked my friend for advice and she said why don't I call in sick tomorrow and just take a day to think things through, but I can't or I will get fired. (One of the new starters needed to take the day/morning off, which they mentioned when we first started, as she had a hospital appointment but the company said no. Even though I and one of the other new starters said we'd cover her shift.)

So yeah I don't know what to do. I don't want to stay here, but I kind of ""need to"" so I have money for Christmas. Though this place is really taking a toll on me, especially mentally, and I have only been here for a few weeks.

Oooooh and I forgot to mention, I'm actually working two jobs at the moment. One is an internship that isn't paying a lot, or at all. But it's helping me develop my skills and stuff. I told this job about this and they told me I have to quit the internship. I stated I wouldn't let it get in the way of the job but they said that they won't hire me unless I quit it. So I've told them I've quit it when I haven't. So, I'm not scared of work or working hard. I did have a few years off of work due to health reasons (Crohn's disease, which I haven't told this job about) but before that, I worked 10/12 years straight.

So yeah, any advice and/or suggestions would be fantastic."

I’m an acting student but I’ve always enjoyed programming and decided to pursue a double major in BA Computer Programming and Applications as I needed a few extra credits each semester to keep my scholarships. Everything’s going fine, but since I started a year late I’m trying to play catch up in the program. As much as I enjoy this, this is primarily going to be my “day job”. Since my schedule is getting bogged down and I have to do summers to keep up,  I’m missing out on some great acting classes and the opportunity to do either summerstock or internships in the summer. I’m wondering if I should just do a minor which is a way less rigorous courseload (won’t have to take as many maths/sciences) and work on side projects. Does not having the actual degree (which is a BA not a BS) hinder me significantly long term?

I've been a long-time lurker, but this is my first post, and I really would like some opinions from strangers on this matter. 

I just got a new job and moved across the country for it. It's a good job; decent pay &amp; benefits, in a nice area, and with a notable university, doing marketing communications. Problem is what I thought I applied for isn't what the job actually is. And of course these things were made apparent soon as I got there and signed a lease.

The main problems are:

1. My title went from Marketing Communications Specialist to Communications Assistant (so a step down from what I thought)

2. I don't actually have a desk or workspace of my own. I get to share a desk with the interns. Nothing against the interns, but not having an actual workspace makes concentrating on something for 40 hours a week difficult. That and I am physically uncomfortable the whole time. 

3. My supervisor complains of all the work that has to be done and how they're too busy, and then proceeded to give me busy work to keep me out of the way. 

4. Until now, the position was a part-time administrative assistant job. And I heard at a company lunch the previous employee wasn't happy either. 

5. I have had literally no training. On anything. 

6. My supervisor told me to schedule weekly meetings for the first month for us to chat. I put them into her calendar, and sent a confirmation email on the dates. Never heard back, so assumed everything was ok. She then booked a branding meeting in place of my meeting and never said anything. So it was nice being forgotten on my second week.  

7. I saw today the department is hiring another Communication Strategist. So apparently there's work to do but I can just sit there and twiddle my thumbs. 

So now that I've wrote all this out, I think I might have accepted an entry-level job that appeared to be more junior or middle, because of the pay and reputable university (I'm not entry level). And the above issues bother me, because if you're not absolutely essential to the department's functioning, you always risk having your salary (job) cut from the budget next year. I've been here 3 weeks and hate what I'm doing; it's not a step up like I thought it would be. It's like a move sideways, just with a better salary and better university. I'm afraid if I stay here any amount I won't progress with my skills and will just be looking for another job in a year. Then of course, I moved so I don't know anyone or have any friends, and since my job is so unfulfilling I'm starting to feel myself slip into depression from having nothing worth getting out of bed in the morning for. 

Should I start looking for something else, or am I crazy? From past experience, if a new job isn't looking good after a month, it's time to move on because it most likely won't get better. But I'm not sure. All I know is it's literally uncomfortable to sit at a table all day, and I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing, and no one really seems to care or have time to flush out my job duties, since this is a new position. And having a meeting didn't seem to work, since my supervisor didn't show. I don't know why they hired me at all. 

Let me know what you think. "

I did one internship at Morgan Stanley last summer (uncle had some connections), and someone recommended I tack on a double major in comp sci. I had already taken a good amount of programming classes and think that comp sci would be doable, so I switched my major to computer science and mathematics (1 interdisciplinary major).

1. Math
2. Econ
3. Comp Sci
4. Econ and Math
5. Comp Sci and Math

I don't want to (and won't be able to) triple major, but I do think that some combination of these three things would be good for a job in finance. Any advice?

I am a full-time university student. I always have morning classes that start at 7 am or 8 am but I get up at 6 am just to commute over to my school. I aim for a career in Psychology and still deciding on a concentration. i also am part of a club on campus to build my connections and my career for the future. 

About the work environment...
I work in a very fast-paced environment. It deals with a lot of communication and that form of communication uses the Japanese language. We say it loud and proud, as it is part of the job, as a way to make the process fast and efficient. This is also entertainment for the customers. 
The place itself is very tiny and can fit a maximum of 30 people. We deal with big sets every day, like most restaurants, and we continue serving until the 11:30 pm cutoff. Even then we still serve customers and I don't get out until 1 am. I made a few good friends there and we hang outside of work sometimes. The place itself promotes a family culture. 

The situation...
I have pondered to quit this job since August but I can never bring myself to quit the job. It is only 5 mins away from me, I get an average of $100 within 5 hours of the work shift, I work on the weekends (Friday, Saturday and sometimes Sunday). A challenge to get up in the morning when I work on a Sunday but somewhat bearable. The reason I want to quit mainly is that there is work drama and management problems, the job has affected my sleeping schedule and can sometimes get in the way of my studies for school, I miss spending time with my family on the weekends..., I have opportunities open to set up for my professional experience on weekends but would be cockblocked by my job and unreliable co-workers. 

Plan B...
I do have a plan if I were to quit my current part-time job. I have set in my resume for 4 internship positions for the summer, My friend said he can recommend me to work at an ice cream shop with him once they open ( a change of environment from the pressured environment) and been saving up enough money to last me for the next semester of school.

So I ask all of you, what do you think? What would you do in my position and why? I am very in the middle at this point. "
774jij,11,2017-10-18,Gap Year or Transfer?,sadsaucer,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/774jij/gap_year_or_transfer/,"TL;DR: smart slacker + extenuating circumstances + near-spiritual transformative event(s) = no idea what to do in terms of college, please help. 

I'm what most people would call a ""smart slacker."" I got good grades throughout elementary school with minimal effort and have ivy-caliber standardized test scores, but never really developed any study skills and have been falling behind ever since I started to attend my current high school, which prides itself on its selectivity/academic rigor/college matriculation statistics. I've always been a procrastinator with bad personal habits, but upon attending this high school I started to procrastinate to the point that it affected my entire being -- I was constantly pulling all-nighters that were spent wasting time instead of doing homework, constantly sleep deprived, constantly late, never did any work, barely paid attention in class, hardly showered or brushed my teeth or kept up with self-care in general, handed in long-term assignments months after the due date, and crammed for every test and as a result I never actually learned any material long-term. I seemed to construct an entirely new identity surrounding the belief that I was a lazy, unmotivated, undeserving, unintelligent bad student. I got the first C in my life in my junior year (I'm a senior now). 

To add to all of this, I think that, in retrospect, my personal life had a very negative impact on my personality and academic performance. My dad was arrested after an abusive incident with me last year, and after some therapy and reexamination I've come to the conclusion that he was both verbally and physically abusive towards me (and my entire family) throughout my childhood. I also think I was in a state of suicidal ideation from 4th to mid-11th grade, with periods of possible undiagnosed depression and anxiety interspersed among those years. Last year I had a sudden mood shift, in that I felt genuinely happy for the first time since early childhood, which might be related to the fact that my parents were getting divorced and the court issued me an order of protection, so my dad was forced to move out and couldn't contact me without further legal repercussions.

This past summer I had a paid internship that, in combination with this series of events, really led me to change my worldview and perspective on life in general. I realized how unwarranted my extremely pessimistic outlook on life was and how much privilege I have to even expect to go to college in the first place. I realized how incredibly dumb it was to go to such an amazing high school and not learn anything because of my bad habits. This gave me the most powerful motivation to improve myself as of yet, and I started to try to cut down on my bad habits and build up good ones. As ridiculous as it sounds, I feel transformed; I've somehow managed to escape the cycle of negative thoughts and self-defeating behaviors, but it isn't easy to do and it's obvious that I'm still a work in progress. I'm doing better than I ever have in almost every aspect of life and I don't constantly think about killing myself anymore, but I'm still so far behind the majority of my peers and it's so demoralizing to be doing better than my past self but not be performing up to standard. 

This is where my question rises: it's college application season and I have no idea what to do. While I'll probably apply to some reach schools and would definitely love to go to an elite university, I don't know if, in my current state, I'd be able to handle the rigor, provided that I even get in. I know that I have the capacity to do very well academically, but bad habits don't change themselves overnight and it's going to take some time for me to get to a point where I can handle everything in a healthy way. I don't know if this will take a few months or a year or longer, and in the meantime it would feel kind of risky to matriculate at an academically challenging school, especially considering the prevalence of mental illness on campuses nowadays. Because of this, I don't know how I should present myself -- should I be entirely candid or fluff up my application like everyone else? And aside from that, I'm not really expecting to get many acceptances from elite universities and will likely end up at a state school or similar, but I can't see myself graduating from any of my in-state schools; I'd constantly be pushing myself to transfer somewhere ""better."" I really love the social environment of being surrounded by people who are curious and driven and so much smarter than I am, where students are constantly doing great things and have conversations that switch from silly topics to intellectually stimulating topics in a heartbeat. I feel like this type of environment would be hard to come by at a non-elite university and I know that I'll feel like I'm not accomplishing my fullest if I end up graduating from an in-state school, which leaves me with two options: transfer during my sophomore or junior years or take a gap year after high school and reapply to colleges. I'd prefer to not transfer because that would feel so jarring and fragmented, but I know that the logistics of taking a gap year won't boost my application unless I demonstrate some kind of increased academic capacity, which would probably be hard to do if I'm not attending school. So... I feel so lost, what should I do?????????"

I have no formal degree background in web dev but I want to start steering myself into that field - in terms of getting practical development experience, are there any internships or suchlike that anyone might recommend? Or alternatively am I best to try freelancing a bit?

I appreciate my lack of a degree may hamper me.

Thanks in advance!"

I did feel like I was improving but...

1.) It was starting to cut into time that I should have spent on studying. 

2.) I'm entering my 3rd year and I don't think my skills will improve significantly by the time I graduate.

Would it be better to just wait until the summer to focus on interview prep (assuming no classes and no internships)? 

It would be interesting to hear how others have approached balancing interview prep with school work. "

I owned two houses prior to getting married, one I lived in and the other I was renting.  After getting married, my wife decided she wanted no part in rentals or owning a home.

Essentially, I was given the ultimatum to somehow get rid of both homes or else.  We had plans for both of us to go back to school, and neither house was going to sell very well.  I made the poor decision to stick with the ultimatum to not lose my marriage at the cost of letting the houses be foreclosed upon.

The plan was to declare bankruptcy, go back to school, and start over; however, in Virginia, the creditors auction the homes and go after the debt remaining after auction. I just got one of the summons in the mail for court regarding the remaining debt.

What can I try and do to protect myself in some way?  I'm a full time college student, working few part time hours at an internship.  I am currently a week away from divorce which is financially burdening in itself for lawyers.  I don't expect to be able to afford one for these two debts.

Any help is appreciated and I'm thankful for your time."

I feel like this is the end of my journey.

I've failed so many times, my luck ran out. I was dropped out, almost killed myself, and I saw a glimmer of hope when I enrolled in Uni again. I was thinking if I take psychology, it would just go away. It was fun at first, but things got out of hand when I took an entrepreneurship class.

It was there, two years ago when I'm sure that I wanna be an entrepreneur. I was excited, I finally found it. I finally found what I really want in life, I was so sure that this is my path. I postponed major internship positions at major companies, I postponed my final thesis to work on my startup. It was fun at first, I got to meet people that shared the same passion as I am, I was meeting people that I would not normally meet if I was just a student. I am somebody.

I delayed my graduation, I'm not the type of person that can focus on two things at once. I can't focus on both a thesis and running a startup. No one was using the site, no one would buy our product, the development timeline is so delayed. Everyday it would be the same routine, opening Google Analytics and seeing 0s everywhere, and cold calling potential customers. It's frustrating. Not only that, I started this journey with my girlfriend. Being a bipolar herself, she's also suicidal. Numerous times we sat down and cried, to the point where we planned to just kill ourselves.

Now I'm a different person. I thank God that my mother is still supporting me, she's very empathetic towards my ambitions. But for how much long should I torment her? I don't have a degree, I don't have anything. I'm doing something towards nothing.

Numerous times I planned on killing myself. I shrugged it out in the past, but now it just keeps getting real. I found a few spots where I could just jump or crash my car. 

Thankfully I can still think clearly. So many people depends on my life. My friends, my coworkers, my family, even my dog. I know they still love me, but I'm not sure if I love myself."
777qnp,1,2017-10-18,[Internship],My_new_throw,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/777qnp/internship/,"I have a couple of problems and would like insight. So in June I took an internship with a fortune 300 company in their product support. In the interview they stated that they were looking to hire someone on afterwards. I said I was very much so interested in that since that’s what I was looking for. The internship itself went great. They asked me if I wanted an extension on my internship and I accepted. After a while the work stopped coming in. I had to ask for new projects and sometimes they don’t have anything for me or they gave me to another department because they had something for me. I also stopped being included in a lot of emails and meetings and a boss had been avoiding me. 

I know why all this is happening now. I have 2 bosses, 1 of them is the boss of the other and she’s getting switched to a different team. Which is probably why she’s been avoiding me and not accepting my meeting invites to touch base with her. Nobody really knows how this reorganization is going to be settled once it’s all said and done with. The other boss has been helping me since I was hired and I mainly see her for new work. Sometimes she doesn’t get back to me. Recently, they asked how much longer till I graduate and I said a year. They said thanks. 

This morning I was messaging my coworker about the reorganization and he told me it’s a fat chance they’d give me a part time position. He said you would have to open an employment ticket and wait a few months for HR to get back to me and he mentioned how they only want someone who is full time. He also said that HR just hired a bunch of sales people who have been twiddling their thumbs so there isn’t justification to hire someone in product support if the sales quota isn’t being met. 

Any advice, comments, anything at all is welcomed. I just want insight on how other people, who probably have more experience than me, would handle this.

777qzy,9,2017-10-18,Point of undergrad research?,dataispower,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/777qzy/point_of_undergrad_research/,"I'll be on the academic job market in the next year or so, and I'm most interested in teaching-oriented positions. I know that undergrad research is a big deal for those positions so I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately, and I wanted to get some opinions from professors that actually oversee these experiences.

I can’t decide if the point is to either:

1) get undergrads experience doing actual research by doing lit reviews, identifying gaps in the literature, etc.

or 

2) simply getting them involved in research by having them prepare or run experiments, or help build an experimental platform

I would think that option 1 would be the best preparation for future research positions. However, they typically don’t have time to do this and they may not have the background to even have a deep understanding of the material. So that would lead me to the second option. But my issue with the second option is that I don’t feel like it really prepares them for research. I did an REU, and it was more of the 2nd-option style. I built a platform for a PhD student to run experiments. It helped me immensely in learning applied techniques (in my case, computer programming), but I didn’t read any papers, I didn’t run experiments, and I didn’t help write any papers. When I look back on that experience, I don’t feel like it helped prepare me for doing research in grad school. Learning applied disciplinary skills is good, yes, but that is the point of internships.

So I’m wondering how do you approach undergrad research? Is the point to simply get them involved in any way, shape, or form? Or is it to get them legitimate experience to prepare them for what they would do as a professional researcher? "

7790gt,62,2017-10-18,The Yawn,mrmichaelsquid,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7790gt/the_yawn/,"It’s strange to think something that signals boredom could be the cause of such nightmarish anguish and misery. People always fear zombies, serial killers, terrorists, active shooters and nuclear attacks as reflected by TV and motion pictures. The irony of the events that unravel the world is just another finger in the gunshot wound, twisting painfully as if to shame it. Not a bang, not a whimper, the world ends with a yawn.

I had applied for and been granted my masters to please my parents, not yet enticed by a world of thesis papers and internships. I had ambitions and dreams that soared broader and higher, I’d always felt I was special. I’d not yet been dashed onto the windshield of life as so many are when they seem to realize we are all one and the same. Quietly aloud I said “this guy knows what I’m talking about” with a raised brow as a student named Jacob yawned during our lecture, drawing the attention of the class.

The student, no more that 20 meters away, let out a sound that swiveled the heads of nearly the entire lecture hall. The loudening groan of a hearty yawn, rising from his wide stretched mouth. The perturbed teacher crossed his arms and stared over to elicit the reaction of a few hushed snickers. Jacob continued that unending yawn, however, flooding what seemed like utter defiance and immaturity across the class to the point it became very uncomfortable. “Am I losing my connection to the youth?”, the professor joked with outstretched palms, drawing forth a few chuckles from the class. The tone changed quickly however after that awful, crunching sound began.

The human jaw is capable of nearly 270 psi, the muscles are immensely powerful, allowing us to chomp through the toughest meat and survive as long as our teeth are intact. It’s these powerful jaw muscles that widened that student’s jaw into a grotesque, wide oval that stretched until that sickening cracking sound rattled my core and created gasps, yelps and nervous whispering throughout the class. We all heard the snapping sound of jaw bone and knew something was terribly wrong. His tormented howling groan from his impossibly wide mouth of the magnified yawn dug viscerally and we watched as the yawn’s shivers built into severe convulsions.

The teacher realized this and came to his aid, removing his phone to call 911 but I watched as his other hand reached upward to cover his own mouth. That pesky little contagious feature of an act meant to keep us alive with oxygen ended up stretching that teacher’s mouth beyond what seemed possible under his cupped hand. The hideous cracking sound, followed by the quivering of his head only the most fulfilling yawn can deliver, and soon blood flowed red down his graying moustache. The teacher's ears and nose trickled red but his mouth, his mouth began to flow as a waterfall of deep crimson poured outward from that massive, bone-splintering yawn. 

I rushed out as best I could, the screams now registered as did the flurry of running students, some covering their mouths as the class fled that auditorium in panic. People were tripped, shoved and trampled as survival instincts kicked in. I jogged out onto the streets of the bustling city and breathed deeply and methodically through my nose, using my focused will to keep my jaws locked closed. I walked briskly away from the screaming, crying crowd that spilled out onto the streets behind me, towards the river’s edge and away from the chaos.

The amber alerts soon began rattling phones and delivering messages, unknown airborne contagion suspected, cover mouths, stay indoors, towels in door and window gaps, tune in for further instruction etc. They had absolutely no idea what this was. They had no idea this epidemic was a false instruction that tricked our bodies, but who could have possibly predicted it. Our entire being is full of fail-safes that keep the toxins filtered, the irrational thoughts contained, the bacteria bombarded by white cells. We like to think our bodies can’t be tricked into self harm and we trust them, so it is hard to accept how easily our anatomy is duped. The next few days of sheer horror and widespread panic revealed just how easily as isolated wealthy couples in their hermetically sealed mansions bled out from spilling, snapping jaws by their own rebelling musculature in those quivering yawns of death.

Emergency oxygen tanks were deployed by FEMA to try and keep the fatal, contagious yawning at bay. Scientists failed to produce any useful findings aside from it having possibly resulted from an undetectable virus that masks itself beyond detection. Others blamed a mutation within our genes that ended up backfiring, an artifact of evolution. Nothing was of any true help, however, and nothing will help. Practically no one can unsee, unhear or completely avoid that triggering signal that causes the muscle memory to backfire. People are simply biding borrowed time from the enemy that is their own body, ready to fold open their face with a crack of the mouth, leaving them to bleed to death and to rot. 

After that last class a few days ago, I walked carefully, due to the cloud of custom muscle relaxers I created to protect me from my apocalypse to the river, to the boat I’d purchased on the pier, my fully stocked blue catamaran I’d spent my bloated tuition money on. I know the domino effect I’d set in place will play out by the time my supplies ran thin from the computer simulations I’d ran all semester. I knew roughly when the world will be silenced from the chain reaction when Jacob, who will soon be referred to as patient zero, gripped my pricking handshake in introduction. 

I sit now in the warm sun on the water with my solar charged cell phone, ready for the month-long epidemic to play out and a message typed for those I selected to survive. I’d share it but it's just a set of instructions and I'm sure I already bored you, possibly enough to stir a yawn, and time is already so short."

I'm currently a sophomore looking for an internship for Summer 2018. I'm currently feeling a little discouraged right now though: I've gotten quite a bit of online coding challenges and on-campus interviews that I generally do fairly well on, but I always seem to get rejected and can never advance to the next stage. 

Yesterday I took an on-campus assessment with Amazon, and I passed all the debugging/coding questions, and I'm pretty sure I did well on the multiple choice logic. Then less than 24 hours later they said I had been rejected (which really sucked since they said to expect a response in a couple weeks -- was I really that bad?) 

What can I do to make that extra push to move on to the next round of recruiting? So far only one recruiter contacted me back with feedback, and he basically said that while my resume and coding challenge met their standards, they preferred people who have taken more courses under their belt. Could this really be all there is to it or could there be something else?

We're pretty well known for CS (I think) and have people get hired from Blizzard/Google type places all the time, as their headquarters are pretty near us. I'm not majoring in Computer Science, but more of an off-branch geared towards project management/user-oriented design. I think both fields are interesting, but would like to slowly turn into a developer. I changed majors from CS to the off-branch, and kinda-sorta regret it.

**current situation**

I currently work as a QA Analyst at a smaller company with about 30 employees total (including CEO/assistants/interns...EVERYONE). I mostly do manual testing, but they have been talking about automating their work for a couple months now. They say the project is in the works, but no real movement has been made towards it. QA is developing scripts, and making pull requests, but they aren't really being setup to run continuously, and when I asked if I could try getting them up through Jenkins (I built a series of test scripts and set it up exactly how they do on their build server successfully), but was bounced around employees, and never gained access. 

I really like the work I'm currently doing. I learn a lot, and not just about QA, but because it's such a small company, I can ask around for help on whatever topic I need. I *feel* like I would be able to move in any general area I wanted, and there would be lots of help from my coworkers. Comparing what I know about server-side operations and the SDLC in general is crazy, because I feel like I knew almost nothing. I like the atmosphere, and I enjoy coming into work. I have a full time offer lined up for when I'm ready.

**dilemma**

I received an offer to join a pretty large company (they make lots of consumer laptops, storage, etc..), and I would be getting a 25% pay raise. When I was being interviewed, the interviewer told me that he was once an intern, and was hired after he finished school. They said most of their day consists of developing test cases, with over 3000 for a single product. In comparison, our largest test suite we have (not even being ran yet) is about 60 cases. I'm not working directly with server-side operations (which is what I have come to enjoy), and would be in a corporate environment where I assume QA doesn't have as easy access to ""real"" developers like I do at my current job. 

Should I stay or should I go?

**tl;dr:** 25% pay raise to go to a bigger company and risk not having a job after school? i'm happy with my current job and think I can learn alot there

Thanks to that degree, and maybe some personal hang-ups, I'm having a hell of a time trying to make it out of my parent's house and towards a fulfilling life, etc., etc. I feel like I should also mention that I'm a gay male who's painfully cis-conforming, but you'll see how that comes in later.

Anyways, I got out of college with a degree and a tiny bit of experience at the school paper. I still have a couple of professor/contacts and some friends I stay close with, but most everyone has gone separate ways. 

My ""working life"" started with volunteering for a nonprofit that specialized in historic preservation--think old houses, buildings, people. (not literally, but most preservation folks were pretty old) I worked there for free for about five months, after getting caught up in a relationship for the few months after I'd moved home &amp; pretty much not doing any job searching whatsoever.

I got a job with an automotive service center through one of my coworkers at the preservation place. It was a decently-paid full-time job, and the first full-time job I'd ever had, and I hated every minute of it. My coworkers were miserable, I worked long hours without knowing when I'd leave every day, manager was terrible, there was no training, the whole nine yards. Long-and-short, even though I love cars and enjoyed being able to drive some cool ones at that job, I ended up quitting after a year on the feeble promise of another unpaid internship.

This second internship was with a magazine, and actually gave me the chance to get some solid published material. A couple of months into the magazine internship, I got a job at a fast food restaurant that I kept for maybe five months, before quitting out of the same miserable feeling. The magazine was great, when I actually had work to do, but again didn't pay. 

So now I'm at the present day, still living at home and resenting the very conservative area that I went to high school in, feeling like there's almost no way out. 

As I see it, my two options are: Go back to school, which means incurring debt and starting a program that I'm not really that interested in or; fulfill a years-long dream of moving to Denver, where I have a ton of family, there's a more inviting liberal atmosphere, and I feel like I'd be more able/happier to pursue and discover myself a little bit. Basically, my heart is in Denver, but school is something I feel like I HAVE to do in order to even find a job to support myself (which equals stupid student loan debt, which equals probably staying near my hometown forever, semi-staying in my comfort zone)

To anyone who's had the fortitude to read this far: do you have any advice??"

I'm a bit older and kind of trying to make the best of my time as I do feel like I should not be in school right now. (Man am I glad I decided to pursue CS though)

Here's my issue, I'm worried that if I apply this month that they will contact me before I finish my Intro courses. I'm just not ready for a technical interview... I'm working through heap sort at the moment and I'm just starting firecode

However I only have a year and a half of school left after this year. So 1 summer left after this upcoming one. Maaaaaybe 2. I'm graduating earlier than other students since this is my second degree so I'm feeling some pressure.

I got an internship first year and they gave me a part time developer offer for during the school year and a return offer for this upcoming summer. I'm working in .net and the work is not very difficult. I mostly do bug fixes and add small new features to legacy code. I personally don't think I'm that good. Better than most of the other students but my friends working at big N are miles ahead of me. My senior developers have told me that for my experience I'm doing great but they can tell I'm a student.  My design choices are not optimal. At least I'm getting experience though right?

I'm mostly worried that if I graduate then I'll be locked out from the Big N. Are the recent grad interviews(1-2 years post grad) way more difficult than the internships :s?

I'd love any advice. Is there a list of material we should know by second year to apply to bigger internships? Should I just take the return offer this summer and focus on learning as much as I can and then apply?"

Over the past summer, I interned at a ""Big N"" company. I applied as a returning intern after the internship ended, and went through a couple interviews not too long ago.

However, since my final (technical) interview, I haven't heard back from them in exactly two weeks.

What exactly might be happening here? I will admit, I didn't too too hot on the technical portion of the interview, but I am pretty sure that internship performance is considered more heavily for returning interns.

My mentors also told me that they would love to have me back, so I do not think it is my internship performance that is negatively affecting my application.

I also e-mailed HR yesterday to see if there are any updates, but have not received a response yet.

Would appreciate any thoughts regarding this.

Thus far, I have two offers on the table: Workday and Walmart. There are a number of pros and cons to both... 
Workday offered $40+, is located in California near SF, and pays for housing... but they use Xpresso which is their own proprietary language and it looks to me like you're just visually linking data structures together to program (from the pictures I found online).

Walmart offered half as much money &amp; is located in Arkansas (I go to school in NYC so this would be a huge change for me) but they pay for housing and moving and the languages I would be working with would be Javascript and Angular which are a lot more transferable as skills. I'm also interested in exploring ECommerce.

I've had three internships so far, two small companies and one larger one (NBC) so I'm not desperate for a big name on my resume. 

What do you think looks better on a resume? Do you think one internship would help me land full time roles over another (at other companies, not sure if I would want to convert to full time with either given the location)? Is it better to take the money for the summer or sacrifice the money and location for the experience? I'm not strapped for cash so the money is not essential but its just such a pay difference &amp; location difference that I'm not sure what to do."

77ejuz,1,2017-10-19,[France] Up to 500€ for a computer science laptop,Shywim,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/77ejuz/france_up_to_500_for_a_computer_science_laptop/,"* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
300€ to 500€, France

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Battery life

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
 I don't care about thinness as long as it doesn't look like it was build in the pre-2000 era

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 I will be installing Linux (ArchLinux in particular) so I don't really care what OS come on it as long as the material is supported in Linux.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 13""

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
 The laptop would need to run IDEs such as those from JetBrains (IntelliJ) for my J2EE assignments or Android projects and I will be using vim for everything else. I don't care if compilations take time for bigger projects or that the laptop is unusable in the meanwhile as long as I can edit smoothly in the IDE.

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 No game required

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 Build quality is a must I guess, since I'll be walking to university everyday with it. I'll be mostly using a 60% mechanical keyboard so I don't care about the keyboard. I don't need optical drive, touch screen, biometric reader or any other fancy things (apart from a jack output which may be fancy by today's standards, heh)

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

So for background, I began my first year of my master's degree and our university require us to bring our laptop (because they are unable to setup properly their computers) so for now I bring my 17"" laptop for a 30 minutes walk everyday which is a bit heavy and have a poor battery life (max two hours). It needs to last my two years of master's degree (where I'll have to do 2 internships) and preferably my first years of working (bonus if the laptop is ""easily"" upgradable).

I need some battery life since I have some days where I will be 4 hours in a room without (reachable) power outlet. I don't require a *new* laptop, but I prefer refurbished to simply ""second hand"" though I am not against that.

I often see Thinkpads like the x230 being recommended, but I was wondering if there's anything better since this laptop has been around for awhile and I also saw the t440s and the dell inspiron 13 on lappylist.

Also last thing: I have a spare 4GB DDR3 if that can make the difference between two laptops of different prices.

Thanks in advance."

Are there any websites that you guys would recommend for someone fresh into OOP to start interesting projects that require a decent portion of research/practice on my behalf?

It's a little too late to be asking this question right now as I've accepted one and declined the other but people around me are telling me I didn't make the best business choice, mainly out of fear of failure. Hoping you can share your opinions about the situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

My basic profile:
M, 25, advertising. 2 years of relevant industry experience (3 if you count internships). Came from handling political clients, looking to ""sell my soul"" and go into corporate. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the basic breakdown of the two companies: 

**Company A**
&amp;nbsp;

**Type:** &lt;10 years old, start-up-ish ad tech company still in early venture funding stages
&amp;nbsp;

**Level:** Individual contributor
&amp;nbsp;

**Compensation:** Lower 60s, 70s if including bonus
&amp;nbsp;

**Pros:** Usual young, small company benefits (Unlimited PTO, gym reimbursement, commuter benefits, lenient WFH policy), solid team and even better managers (just from the interviews, anyway), company stock options, great list of clients that I can get my hands on, expanding so possibility of moving up is high
&amp;nbsp;

**Cons:** Unpredictable, longer hours, lower salary, unpredictable future (will it be acquired by a big company? could it fail? IPO?)
&amp;nbsp;

**Company B**
&amp;nbsp;

**Type:** Big name player in the industry, international
&amp;nbsp;

**Level:** Manager
&amp;nbsp;

**Compensation:** 90s base
&amp;nbsp;

**Pros:** 50% pay increase from what I am getting at current job, moving up as manager, predictable hours (standard 9-5, which is unheard of in my industry), great brand name to have on resume, 
&amp;nbsp;

**Cons:** Seemingly nonchalant team, one boring client, benefits aren't as good

&amp;nbsp;

I chose to go with Company A, for a number of reasons.
The thing is, I have no previous managerial experience other than mentoring and guiding interns. My previous manager liked to micromanage and I had no freedom in being able to test out my ideas, so I'm not sure if I have any sort of knowledge to pass along and mentor a team. I just wasn't sure if I were ready to be managing anyone full-time yet and the last thing I want to be is an incapable manager. On the other hand, everyone is telling me that I'm selling myself short and that I should believe in my abilities - and that B's job offer (among other manager job offers I received) is a testament to that. So, do you think I made the best choice or do you think my self-doubt and fear of failure got the best of me?

TL;DR - Doubted my abilities and took an offer as an individual contributor at a smaller company, declined a manager role at a renowned establishment despite a hefty pay increase. Am I an idiot?

I know mostly big n companies sponsor an internship visa, so I applied to most well known companies. The application to offer ratio was close to  1:0. When I applied for internship locally (in the Netherlands) the ratio was close to 1:1.

I know some companies prefer local software engineers over international, or think there is too much hassle to get me in the US,  or think the application is simply spam. 
But like I can have an internship for 3 up to 12 months, so I would be producing more results than someone who has a 10 weeks internship.

Major Northeastern US City, consulting job:

- Salary: 76.5k
- Signing Bonus: 5k
- Healthcare, standard benefits, etc.

Good ol' Software Dev Job, major Canadian city (where I studied and currently am now:

- Salary: 62k
- no bonuses
- standard benefits (health coverage, vacation, etc)

I was drawn to the first job at first, because it would have been a new experience in a new place in a new field. However, I ended up taking the second job, mainly for personal reasons. I'm about 5 months in at this point, and to be honest, I feel pretty depressed. I mainly look the job because my girlfriend (who I've been with for a while and we are definitely serious) was doing her masters, and I didn't want to be that far for however long (2 years at least). She also has no interest at all in moving to the USA, for many reasons (Trump, no free healthcare, Trump, etc.)

However, I always wanted to go back to the USA, and still do, mainly because I feel like it'd be a lot better for my career, I am a US and Canadian citizen (so it'd be easier to go back), and all the ""innovation"" in CS (in my opinion) is in the USA. I also just miss a lot of things about the USA (the culture in general), etc, you get the point.

Working at the company I'm at now (major US company) has made me feel more like an asset rather than an employee than I did at either of my internships (one at a startup here, one at a very big US company in the midwest USA). The reason I feel this way is the following:

- we are paid much less than our US colleagues who I work with on a daily basis

- our office, while in a good location, is not nearly as nice as the US locations (from what I've heard from people who have visited)

- our office is kind of depressing (cubicles, not many windows, everyone is kind of cramped)

- I am working on a super boring project that is mainly for internal use for now (won't be used by end-users for at least 2-3 yrs)

I basically feel like I let myself down a bit by taking this job (it's not at all what I wanted to do after I graduated career-wise) but I felt like it was the right decision (life-wise) and I'm just trying to suck it up until the time comes where my girlfriend and I could move somewhere else, or I get some incredible opportunity that I will not be able to turn down. My girlfriend essentially told me a few times that I am being dramatic when I tell her I think the US is significantly better for CS jobs, and told me to suck it up because engineering here isn't really that much worse.

Is she right? Am I being dramatic? Did anyone else here feel like this after graduation? Do you have any advice for me? I honestly don't really look forward to going to work every day, and although my job is ""good"" by the standards of other people I know in the same city/field, I just feel like I could have done more.

Thanks for reading."

 My only real world job experience outside of working at a fast food joint was in high school when I worked at a summer camp teaching merit badge classes (Kids 11-18) and this pass summer I worked at another summer camp teaching coding camps to younger kids (7-13). I always enjoyed those jobs/teaching which is just another possibility that I have running through my mind. I think if teacher were paid more I would just run with that
but I am just not sure. 

I grew up in a home that was in the lower-class so financial stability has always been something that I've wanted. I hate all of my feeling of uncertainty and worry. When I first came to college I went to a doctor about depression/ anxiety and was put on medication which i am no longer on. Am I just having bad anxiety about everything?

He's not necessarily being rude to me, but doesn't seem even a tiny bit interested in what I have to say. I also have noticed that he seems to be avoiding me a bit, rushing out of the classroom as soon as the class is over (normally he would wait for me) and being excessively busy at work (we're both interns at the same place -- we don't really have that much to do). I do know he's been going through some rough things recently, but I'm also aware that he has been seeing other friends. I've been thinking about asking him what's up.

I really am not the kind of  person to do this. I hate appearing 
 vulnerable  and  coming across as dependent, and there is 
 a  chance I might be completely wrong about the whole thing and the situation isn't about me at all. But I'm also very upset by the way he has been acting. We talked a bit today  and  it was pretty bad. He was struggling to maintain eye contact and the conversation felt forced and left me feeling very cold and disappointed.

I want to start with a little background. I am a Software Engineering major graduating in December. If everything goes as planned I will graduate with a 3.8 while being in multiple honor societies. Two summers ago I had an internship where I worked on developing an iOS app. Last summer during the first week of my internship I found out I have a liver disease that requires a transplant and I had to quit to deal with the anxiety of that. I eventually spent some time that summer working through an android programming book.

Is it unrealistic for me to try to get a job in a specific location? I have been trying to get a job in Colorado but I've only been able to get a single phone interview. I have had my resume reviewed by multiple places and there shouldn't be a problem with it.

I really don't want to work anywhere else. The whole point of college for me was to be able to get a job in a place I actually want to live. I also don't want to take a local job to gain experience because I don't know how long I have before I start to feel the effects of my liver.

I met with my adviser today to talk about scheduling classes for next semester when I would be graduating, and she told me that I could actually graduate this December due to some elective loophole that I wasn't aware of before.  I'm also going to march my final year of DCI this summer because after that I ""age out"" and can never do it again, even though I know it's not a great career move.  I don't have a job lined up for after I graduate and I haven't really been looking very hard because I didn't think I was going to be able to work full time until next September.  But now I have a semester off and I want to use it productively, but I don't think that many companies will want to hire me for 5 months knowing that I'll have to take off 3 months for the summer before I can work again.  I've also had a part time job in food service for my entire college career and I'd like to move on to something more CS related as soon as I can.  So I guess my question is what kind of job could I find in the next 2 months that would look like I wasn't wasting a semester? And also how bad will it look if I graduate in December and can't find a ""real"" job until September?  Prestige and type of work isn't that important to me.  Plus I'm still reliant on my parent for a lot of things so pay isn't even a huge factor for the Spring.

Need Advice!",megalomaniac678,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/77l0eq/computer_science_entrepreneurship_real_estate/,"I did my undergrad in Computer Science from a top 5-10 university (world), with a bad GPA. Post that I had a good work experience as a Software Engineer in a Fortune 1000 for the next 3.5 years, then went on to start a tech-company that failed and had to be shut down within 2 years, then briefly worked in my family's Real Estate business where I sourced a few profitable deals. After 6 years of undergrad, I enrolled in MSF @ Baruch, NY which is a fairly new and unrecognized program. 

My main target has been to learn about investing, particularly in the areas of Venture Capital / Private Equity. I belong to a decently wealthy family and want to embrace new and upcoming enterprises, specially in tech, preferably as an angel investor. However, I want to get industry experience and want to work for a firm before making any kind of bets. Thats only wise.

As far as my understanding goes, the route to institutional venture capital is either IB (for a while) or having succeeded in running an enterprise or two. 

Getting admitted into Harvard or any IB worthy uni is quite unachievable in my situation. And doing an MBA from any other uni seems avoidable to me for it costs a fortune and again, is most likely not going to land me into IB. It didnt make sense for me to join a random MBA program. So I decided to go with Baruch, a public uni, and chose a program which was closest to what I actually want to learn ( Actually closest would be the MFE program at Baruch which is top-notch. I would try to transfer into that. Its difficult, but I digress )

Finding an associate level internship in IB from Baruch (non-target MSF program in New York) is also quite difficult. I am currently looking for internships in mid-caps, preferably in VC firms. But I am not really able to find a lot of good opportunities. 

My question:
Given my background in Computer Science (could qualify as quant background), Tech-Entrepreneurship and some Real Estate Investments, what should I focus my energies on and make efforts towards among the following:
1) Find internships in VC firms, something I really want to do.
2) Keep trying to find something in IB
3) Refocus on leveraging computer science background and applying it to Finance while pursuing MSF and find opportunities accordingly. (Fintech / Blockchain)

Scrapping the MSF altogether and trying for an ivy MBA is not an option. a)not very plausible b) I am looking forward to move  forward

Any suggestions / criticisms are more than welcome. tia.

77m1hd,0,2017-10-20,Where do I stand now in regards to reach schools?,dragonquestjunkie,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/77m1hd/where_do_i_stand_now_in_regards_to_reach_schools/,"Posted earlier, but quickly engulfed in a sea of SAT topics!

I’m from the WNY area looking at a variety of schools. University of Buffalo to John Hopkins to Stanford, you name it. Very big interest in Radiology and nuclear medicine (I love science). However....I am unsure of where I’d stand in the more prestigious schools. Here’s a bio about me:

* BACKGROUND: 
* White Male, 17, from family of 4 
* AGI less than 65k. Middle class for my city.
* Grew up in a pretty damn impoverished area of NY

* ACADEMIA: 
* 98.30 GPA as of now in my school (very unusual system, I know) 
* Factoring in EVERY class I have taken including gyms and FL (do those count?), weighted GPA of ~4.78 
* Took many AP classes (World 4, Chem 4, Lit 4, US 5). A+ in all except World (A) 
* Enrolled in Lang, Gov, Calc (love) and excelling 
* Nominated for scholarship for Clarkson University (I have no interest in going but still nice) 
* High honor roll 
* Qualifies for Advanced Regents Diploma with Distinction

* EXTRACURRICULAR: 
* VERY involved in school’s theater program. Member of Drama Club, theater intern at my school, active in 24hr Plays (students audition, write, direct, rehearse, perform short plays in 24 hours...and I directed this year!), active in high school musical productions (was Pinocchio in Shrek for 10th and Link Larkin in Hairspray for 11th!!) 
* Member of school Concert Choir starting 12th grade 
* NHS (was not accepted to be an officer, apparently it was a “mistake” on the advisor’s behalf...lol) 
* Board of Directors for Class of 2018 (fundraising for Prom and Class Day basically) 
* Scholastic Bowl in 10th (being a lead in 11th grade unfortunately rendered me unable to participate that year) 
* Yearbook 10th grade (photographer and designer for theater pages) 
* Blood Donor with UNYTS (I absolutely love donating blood) 
* Belongs to a prestigious leadership program for my area (will not name here, trying to maintain some semblance of privacy after announcing my AGI)

* TEST SCORES: 
* Yikes 
* ACT: C33, M29 (ugh), R34, E33, S34 (woo), and.....W6. This writing score depressed me, but my other achievements in English subjects must mean something! 
* SAT: 1450 with 760RW, 690M with 16/24 essay (if only I could mix and match!) 
* Did not take subject tests. Risky, I believe. But what can be done now, am I correct?

Other than all of this, I’m not sure what to include. Maybe that for my college essay on the Common app, I was planning on choosing prompt 7. I think I have a good essay laid out for a character flaw (overthinking) and how I began to transform/change for the better (can even relate to desiring knowledge rather than desiring the best grade possible depending on the anecdote I choose). Other than that, I just kinda want to know if I even have a .0000000001% chance of getting into any big name school. UB would be a cinch, though, and the presidential scholarship could definitely be in the cards for me. Not to mention that my tuition would be basically free due to the Excelsior Scholarship.

Obviously, I would be more creative with the essay. I label myself something akin to a “chronic overthinker,” obviously changing that up a bit because that phrase is a bit cliche. Anecdote will probably be about this project I had to do in 10th grade to answer one question: How should the Holocaust be taught to our youth? There was no instruction sheet or rubric, just my teachers advice to use whatever medium you’d like. And I literally cried because I had no guidelines, no simple 5-step outline to get an A+ or anything :P Basically, i had to overcome this dreadful mindset and actually investigate the topic for myself. I ended up making a presentation where I detailed the stories of Holocaust survivors of very varied backgrounds, explaining that rather than focusing entirely on the horrible figures of the holocaust, there should be a focus on the survivors and their backgrounds, which may lead many to research their own family history and possibly discover a connection to a major historical event. obviously I will embellish a bit but it’s just a rough sketch as of now. I'll definitely capitalize on the transformation from a student who really only wanted great grades and a strict game plan for everything to someone who's willing to truly explore an interest of mine and seek knowledge.

Also, Stanford has become a desired reach school for me (and by reach I mean REACH in all capital letters and pronounced “reeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaach”). But I am very interested in Humbio, especially because they offer a BS in it now and it sounds like an interesting major for premed according to my research.

EDIT: I did not know how to format on Reddit! sorry :)"

i’m really anxious about my application and college choice because i don’t really have the grades or scores (i’m almost there) for the schools i want to get into. I’m really only aiming for MIT since I’ve had s good history with the college. (hackathon, private interview etc).

* I started programming at 6
* I started my internship at google at 13
* I influenced my lib arts school to get stem and mandarin (i’m african smerican)
* I’m captain of the software module in my robotics team
* I’ve created numerous apps and made around $2,000 from selling my software
* I made $800 when I was 11 selling minecraft cheats 
* I’m creating an app for my mother’s company to keep inventory since the application they currently use is too expensive and lacks the features they neeed
* I took the AP CS test without actually taking the class and got a 4 (had to take it in mum principals office lol)
* I’ve won numerous hackathons (Clarifai AI, MIT Codex)
during my sophomore summer I taught high school seniors how to program in c, python, js and other web languages (minorities)
* I’ve created my own programming language to hopefully help people delve deeper into assembly
* I have a software orientated blog (does this even matter lmao)
Because of me my school now offers all honors STEM classes and even AP CSP.

i’m teetering on changing my list because i don’t want to waste my time with MIT if it’s a pipe dream.

This is a situation my brother is currently in. He started an internship that is about 15-20 hours a week and when he started, it had a clause that required a 4 week notice for resignation. Has has another offer for a new (and much better) internship, but its not really reasonable to tell his new employers that he can only start in 4 weeks. 

My understanding is NJ is an at-will employment state, but I'm not sure how his contract changes that situation. My question is

1. Does he have to respect the clause in his contract that requires 4 week notice?

2. If he does not and simply gives a 2 week notice, what recourse may his current employer have?

My advice to him is that he doesn't need to abide by it, and that 2 weeks is more than enough time for them to adequately fill his lowly intern position. At the same time, I don't want to open him up to any liability. If there is any more information I can provide to clarify his situation, let me know! Thanks in advance!"

I studied for 3 years computer science and i know the basics but i never studied hard and i'm not that good. After these 3 years, i took a specialisation for my degree : embedded systems. I learned the basic too but i don't feel that i'm good in it (by reading document on the internet i'm aware that i know a little in this field). 
Last year i made a cool 10 month project with friends (a drone with vision processing) and we did well (student &amp; teacher were impressed) and i found it soo cool doing this. But when i read internship &amp; job offer i dont feel that i will be able to do what they ask.
So is it normal that i dont feel confident about my knowledge ? Did you feel the same when you were student ? 
I dont know if i want to work in a small or big compagny, in what kind of compagny i want to work in, what kind of work i want to do,...
Basically i'm looking for an advice/question that can help me to find my futur way.

Due to some setbacks(major change and class repeats) I will be graduating a few months after the spring semester, at the end of August.  

I am really confused about when I should become proactive about applying to jobs.  I know alot of people graduating in May who have already been applying and accepting positions.

I dont plan on going to any huge companies, but I want to relocated to Boston or another new england city and work at a medium sized company.  

Since I am not trying to go for google, amazon, etc. I was imagining they dont fill up dev jobs a year in advance, and more of when they need them, but maybe my assumptions are completely wrong.  

I was thinking about starting to apply around the end of winter break, like beginning of February?

I go to a large school with a pretty reputable CS program and have had several internships and a few side projects so im not terribly worried about qualifications if that matters at all

Thanks for any help!"

The problem is there's only so many hours in the day.  Currently I wake up at 8am, sleep at 12am.  Gym in the morning, eat lunch, do schoolwork/study, then night classes and get home around 9, eat/shower/etc, and about 1-2 hours downtime before bed.  Weekends is mostly spent on schoolwork.  How do I make more time to start a side project to put on my resume before it's too late?  I'd rather not remove exercise from my routine since it helps keep me level-headed when school gets to be too much sometimes."

77p5w5,2,2017-10-20,Help with Reverse Geocoding Large Dataset,ryanosaurus03,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/77p5w5/help_with_reverse_geocoding_large_dataset/,"Hi,

I am an intern helping a company with data analysis, but I am running into a lot of issues. We have over a million data points that also have lat-long coordinates with them.

I want to reverse geocode the coordinates in order to get the zipcode for each piece of data - what would be the best way to do this? 

I was using R and tried using the reverse geocode method through Google, but that limits the amount of queries I can make a day, and, without paying, doing 2500 points a day for 1.4 million data points is going to take a really long time. 

I then found [this link](https://dmbeskow.github.io/Reverse-Geocode/) and attempted the fourth method he suggests. The fourth method requires downloading an excel doc (for the area the data was collected in) of zip codes (with coordinates), and then using a distance formula to find the closest coordinates between the two and matching a zipcode based on what is closest - however running the rdist.earth method requires 12,000gb of memory due to the amount of data, which makes that not an option.

Within R, I also have attempted making our data into a SpatialPointsDataFrame and overlaying it on a shapefile of zipcodes, or doing the point.in.poly function, but I always run into errors that I can't solve. I do not have any experience doing spatial analysis in R, which is my biggest barrier when working with the sp library.

I have tried switching to python, however I haven't used python before and a lot of the packages/advice I have found recommends using some other website's API to reverse geocode the data, which usually limits the amount of queries per day, even if you do pay.

Any help or advice someone can give? Maybe even pointing me to some tutorials that can help me out would be much appreciated. However, the large dataset still worries me because most functions will likely have trouble running on this many data points."

* I'm a junior now.
* This past summer, I got paid the equivalent of $100k/yr + housing to intern at this place in a medium COL area at Firm X.
* I got a return internship offer for the same pay exactly at Firm X
* I got another offer from a VERY similar firm (firm Y) in the same area. Equivalent to $125k/yr + housing.
* I enjoyed working at Firm X and don't think I like the culture at Firm Y as much. So I sent an email to my Firm X recruiter, asking if I could negotiate my offer at Firm X for returning internship. I didn't say exactly what I wanted, just that I'd like to schedule a call.


Now I'm kind of realizing interns don't really have much negotiating power so I think I made a fool of myself. Was this a dumb move? I really don't want to damage my relationship with Firm X because I generally enjoyed the work+coworkers and the full time benefits are good


EDIT: I should also note I don't really care that much about how much I make over the summer, but rather am more concerned about the potential salary of a full time offer

EDIT 2: Just got off the negotiation call. They gave me the ""we'll have to discuss these with our team"" speal. We'll see how this goes.

EDIT 3:

Sort of successful, got firm X to bump the pay up to $115k/yr equivalent for the summer and a $5k intern sign on bonus"

I know they use Javascript, and ideally I’d love to get some professional experience and mentoring with that. Also, I want to put my face out there so they’ll remember an actual person when they get my application. 

I’ve never had any kind of networking meeting before, I’m a bit nervous, and I’ll take any advice I can get. I’m not the smoothest person, but I think I come across as at least normal enough during job interviews. It’s generous of the guy to meet me in the first place, so I don’t want to take up too much of his time. I’m also not sure what to wear, I was thinking either nice jeans or slacks and a button up shirt, don’t want to look sloppy or too stuffy. Thank you in advanced for any words of wisdom!"

So like the title says, I graduated from one of the better Cal state schools with my Bachelors in computer science back in March. I started looking for jobs maybe in December or so of last year, but didn't really get invested into it until I graduated. I live in the greater Los Angeles area, so I looked all around. In total, i've probably done about 13-15 interviews in total now, almost all of which have been for full time jobs.

I should say now that I have zero experience in the field outside of school. No internships or anything. When I was in school and summer time came around, I chose to do summer school instead. It worked out ok in that I was able to graduate in under 4 years (in a major where the classes are horribly impacted mind you, the vast majority of students take 5 years). But now, I feel like I haven't been able to get a job because I have no experience. And now i'm getting very worried that when companies see that I graduated back in March and don't have something yet, that there must be something wrong with me.

As of late, I've been aiming more towards internships. I'm very fortunate that my family is understanding, and would be more than ok with letting me live at home if I got an internship. The problem though is that many of the internships I see say that they are looking for people who are still enrolled in school. Is this something I could just ignore and hope they don't mind?

My resume is ok besides the no experience thing. I have some projects I worked on on it, including one that won a prize at a hackathon. I didn't have the best GPA (about 2.8 from what I remember), but I don't see many places that care about GPA besides high end places.

Feel free to ask any questions of course. I would just like some advice on what I could do to get my foot in the door. Like I said, i'm really worried that if I take any longer then companies aren't gonna hire me, and then what? Would I just be screwed? I did do my first interview with an internship 2 weeks ago, and it went very well. But then they called me a week later asking me about my GPA and why it was lower. They said they would get back to me in the next week or 2. I really want this job, and It would be amazing because it's literally 5 minutes away from my house. I made sure to tell them that too of course."

She was the most beautiful and funny person I could have ever met. I was going through rough times dealing with being a 19yo with no college degree, living with band mates, delivering pizzas, playing music I hated, smoking more weed than one ever should, ecstasy, acid, whatever I could get my hands on and she was my light that led me out and gave me life. Just a few months a condom broke and she became pregnant. Being young and in love we were going to make this work. I quit the drugs, moved out of the band house, got a second job, worked 60 hours a week to make money to provide for her and our soon to be born son.  Shortly after he was born I was lucky enough to know someone working at a call center that helped me get in and I was able to work one job that made the equivalent of my two full time jobs. 

I pursued this line of work, went to school, learned a trade and started doing tech work for law firms and got really good at what I did. 

I never stopped loving her. I provided everything, was there for everything, never faught or raised my voice. I enjoyed making her happy. I learned to cook well so I could make nice meals for my family, I enjoyed doing all of the family laundry, dishes, house chores.. I just want my family to have a nice home and have the best and if that means I work full time and take care of everything.. it is completely worth it. Eventually got hired at a legit tech company making decent money and we decided it was time for our second child.

We had our second and was happy to complete our family. As she spent time with the kids and took classes part time three years later she eventually graduated with a bachelors degree in the line of work she wanted to be in.

She got hired at her last internship at a place she hated and had nothing to do with her specialty or her degree where she eventually met someone she worked with.

After 9 years of loving her with every inch of energy just Sunday she broke it off with me and told me she was not in love with me anymore and hasn't been. She was talking to someone else now and wanted to pursue this.

I now sit in a room in someone else's house alone... with no kids that love me.. my best friend and partner of life has shown me that everything I am today and have become means absolutely nothing and has wasted so much time.. 

For doing everything I thought the best father, lover, and friend in the world should be doing I am rewarded by being in a dark room alone.. Alone with debt, with no one to cook for, to clean for, to provide for, no one to appreciate me.. no one to talk to about my bad day at work with. She gets to be the one happy.. with our house, with our kids, with our life that I should be in but am not..

I've held the phone in my hand looking at the phone number for help..debating on why I should even continue to try because it just isn't worth it.. For doing all the right things you still get screwed and that is the way life works. 

I don't eat anymore.. I don't sleep anymore. I tried to go back to work yesterday and today and it all just seems meaningless because the reason why I was there to begin with was for her.

I'm just running on auto pilot now..doing things for no reason at all. For some reason still trying but I thinking I'm losing the battle.


Someone I know wasn't going to use these so they gave it to me. I think I know the way.. I ...well.. I'll let you all come to the conclusion.

My gpa right now is a 1.9 but I'm doing great in my classes now and will be above a 2.0 next semester. Can I still try to get an internship?

There is an engineering and computer science career fair at my university this upcoming Thursday. I am a Senior and my concentration is game engineering. There is gonna be one game company there, a mobile games company under EA. There are also a few software companies I wanted to try as well. 

I have made a functioning Java game(But it's been over a year since I've made anything beyond super basic with Java), a couple basic Lua games, a GameMaker basic game, and some 3D models I've been working on. Will these projects be enough to overcome my GPA? I've also been learning Unity on my own but not enough to make anything substantial yet. Would that help? Are there other things I should make to add to my resume real quick before Thursday rolls around? I plan to go to a resume workshop at my college on Monday as well.

I contacted two different members of the EA company on LinkedIn and one added me as a connection, but hasn't so far responded to my message I sent along with it.

Thank you for any advice!"
77rly0,30,2017-10-21,Lying and getting into major companies?,microsoftLiar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/77rly0/lying_and_getting_into_major_companies/,"throwaway for obvious reasons but the context of this is a top 10 CS program/uni oh and sorry about the salt. also the question is vague because I can't mention ""res_me"" or it'll be automatically removed but

**TLDR** it's about someone lying on their res_me.

There's this one guy who has a reputation (with anyone that has worked with him) to be a major leech. But he takes it a step too far by lying on his resume. In one particularly blatant case he lists a project that won prizes at competitions/hackathons as his and that he was a developer for it. It's blatant because any cursory check to the original repository will show that he has not committed a SINGLE line of code for this. Indeed he did not contribute to this project AT ALL. This is just one example but it's the one that's the easiest to verify that he's lying.

None of us thought he could get away with this stuff so easily. He once even downloaded a project that someone made and then uploaded it onto his github like he made it then when the original developer confronted him about it he simply said it was an accident (???) but never took it down. Much to our dismay he has gotten past first round interviews for Big 4.

One person even emailed the Microsoft recruiter on our campus directly saying (of course very professionally) but there was no response I suppose since the recruiter is too busy.

How can someone get away with this so easily? Why pour blood sweat and tears into projects when you know someone can just put it on their resume, focus on coding interviews, and then get internships with Big 4? What can be done?"

Currently I'm a junior in college and this semester is very tough. It is tough for a number of reasons:

1. I'm taking a lot of classes
2. All my classes are very hard and have a ton of work(trying to keep up my very good gpa)
3.Trying to find internships for next semester
4. Be there for family/deal with heavy issues
5. Be there for friends, especially after tragedy(I don't even hang out with friends anymore)
6. Dreaming of having my own life(constant spacing out and excessive sleeping)
7. University commute is very long(30mins-1hr)
8.I am poor, too busy to work, and if I work not work study fafsa will reduce my funding
---i live at home

I look around me and I see these stellar students who seem to be doing everything with their lives. They study abroad, work, internships, take same class load as me and they live away from home.

 I study and deal with so many problems that aren't related to school or my career interest. I just feel so behind and think ""what do I have to show besides my Gpa and LSAT score to a law school which would distinguish me from everybody else?"" Absolutely nothing. 

I want to work, join clubs, live out my youth, keep up my gpa, workout and do good things. However personal life seems to hinder me from doing such things. I am mad that I can't find a way to be as stellar as my classmates.
 
How do people balance their lives? What can I do to get control and push through academics and personal problems while also accomplishing other things?"

&amp;nbsp;

Aristespha’s faintly glowing, violet eyes examine and study the four remaining swords as Stalwart Sword representatives urge passersby to try their luck at pulling one out.  She guides back her very long, silvery blue hair, allows it drape wavy runs upon her back, and refocuses her vision to the empty rocky pedestal.  She idly runs her fingers along her extremely long, pointed ears, and brushes stray hairs off the tips behind her head.  She rest an ivory skinned hand upon one side of hip, shifts the weight of her athletically thin frame to another foot, and contorts gray and blue hints of color upon her face with an intrigued eyebrow quirk.  “Interesting...”

Sebastian’s ethereally transparent form pivots in place to gauge Aristespha’s reaction.  He briefly squints his blue eyes at Aristespha’s face and directs his gaze to where her stare concentrates.  He folds his tan colored arms across shirt his covered muscular chest and tilts his head to a side.  The loose pompadour on his head settles and a number of short brown hairs break free to hang in front of his face.  The free hairs distract his eyes long enough for his mind to recognize the issue, and a quick hand rakes them back in place next to the white streak.  Sebastain scratches the back of his head and leans next to Aristespha.  “So.  What do you see, my dear?”

A finger from Aristespha directs Sebastian’s eyes and she draws in a breath hinting suspicion.  “The empty pedestal’s magic is gone.  Some residue remains, but I believe the locking enchantment is on the swords rather than the pedestal.”

Her eyes wander towards the center most, largest pedestal, and stop upon it.  Sebastian darts his glances between the center pedestal and Aristespha.  “Makes sense.  So, what’s wrong with the one in the center?”

Aristespha gradually pulls her head back, slides her posture, and rests her hand underneath her chin with a critical stare secure upon the center, sword-housing pedestal.  “Originally, I thought the different pedestal explained the slight difference in that enchantment’s aura.  But, if the enchantment is on the swords, then that means the enchantment is different for the same thing.  Unfortunately, the obfuscation and shielding they’ve used makes it extremely difficult to discern.”

A Stalwart Sword salesman locks his gaze at Aristespha and waves happily.  “Hello!  I see you have a keen interest in our latest and greatest model.  And, judging by the sword at your side, you most certainly have just as keen tastes, that Stalwart Swords aims to please.  Please, come over, and let me help you find the sword for YOU.”

Aristespha blinks, directs a smile, and starts to wave off the representative.  Sebastian echoes a cough and grins with a sly shade.  “Well, let’s see what he can offer.”

Aristespha halts, lowers her hand back down with an awkward stare to Sebastain, and she lifts a brow.  Sebastain lifts a similar brow and eyes over to the rep, still grinning.  A slyness cracks the smile on Aristespha’s mouth and shes nods.  Aristespha and Sebastain calmly walk over to the booth in front of the salesman.  He smiles happily and bows in greeting to Aristespha.  “Thank you for coming over and granting me your time.  First, I must say...”

He examines Sebastian up and down with honest amazement.  “That is a most impressive illusion you have with you!”

Sebastian puffs his chest out, postures proudly with a heroic flair, and winks at the salesman.  “I know.”

The salesman blinks and slowly returns his head to Aristespha.  “Amazing.  I can already tell you have particular desires in the swords you acquire.  If it is not a problem, I would like to inspect your current sword and see what Stalwart Swords can do to exceed your needs.  Do not worry, I am allowed by the convention to undo and redo peace bindings.”

Aristespha and Sebastian eye each other with developing mischief in their respective smiles.  Aristespha releases the scabbard’s lock upon her belt, and gently rests the Sword of the Spirit Realm upon the table in front of the salesman.  She awaits with Sebastian for the salesman’s response.  The salesman respectfully nods, aptly releases the convention mandated peace binding, and professionally slides the sword out from the scabbard.  As his gaze takes in the details and workmanship of the sword, his mind processes the attributes to arrive at a very shocking identity.  The salesman’s smile wavers to building astonishment as his eyes widen to the artifact in his hands.  After seconds of silence, he slowly slides the sword back into the scabbard, rests it back upon the table, stands up straight, and releases a composure regaining sigh.  A different genuine smile appears upon his face and he looks to both Aristespha and Sebastian.  “This is a very gracious, surprise honor you have bestowed upon me.  To even examine such a fine blade is an amazing experience...   As high as I hold Stalwart Swords, a unique blade as this is beyond us...”

The smile upon the salesman’s face morphs gradually to previous variant.  “But...  A unique discount for a sword to compliment that fine blade is well within the capabilities of Stalwart Swords.”

Sebastian crosses his arms and grins at Aristespha.  “Ooo...  He’s good.”

Aristespha lifts the scabbard and sword off the table, locks it back onto her belt, and smiles at the salesman.  “I think we will take you up on that discount.  We do need a training blade and a weapon grade blade that’s roughly the same size, weight, and shape of my current one.”

&amp;nbsp;

Sotalia stares expectantly at the fvalian woman behind the table.  With a delicate grace, the woman signs her name “Ardere” on a Tinkering Tina comic with an artistic flair and a small drawing of the lead character Tinkering Tina.  Ardere looks up to Sotalia with a smile.  After many seconds of silence between the two, a toothy grin springs on Ardere’s face and she tilts her head just enough to shift a number of auburn hairs loose from underneath the large bandanna on her head.  “I’m so sorry.  You’re just going to have to wait until the next issue.  I already gave away too much at the last panel.”

Sotalia draws in a large breath and strains a long sigh as she lifts her gaze up to the ceiling of the long hall comprising Personality Alley.  “Really?!”

Ardere shifts a curious glance to Cideeda while tapping her large black claw tips together on both hands.  “New to the series?”

Cideeda shakes her head with a humoring smile at Sotalia’s frustrations and nods slowly at Ardere.  “Yes.  She binge read the series recently.”

Ardere pats down the bandanna on top of her head near two solid bumps underneath and tightens the knot in back.  “Oh... That explains it.  She just got through the Great Contract arc, didn’t she?”

Sotalia lowers her head down, crosses her arms, and pouts.  “Yes, I have.  And, I have SO many theories and not evidence to neither prove or disprove them.”

The pout gives way to a mischievous smile and Sotalia focuses her eyes upon Ardere.  “But, I do have one theory that I do have evidence for.”

A brow quirks up on Ardere’s face and she squints with a scheming smile.  “Which is?”

A giggle escapes Sotalia and she alternates her gaze between Ardere and Cideeda.  “Tina and Byron are SO going to be couple in the future.”

Ardere’s eyes flit open in shock and quickly narrow to honest examination of Sotalia’s theory.  “Really?  That’s an interesting theory.”

Cideeda laughs and nods to Sotalia with a tight smile.  “I have to agree.  There’s something there between those two.”

Sotalia counts off points with her fingers and lets her eyes hunt through her mind.  “Despite all the times Tina’s has practically kicked down the door to Byron’s place, he’s never mad at her for being there.  Despite all the questions she asks, he’ll always answer them...  Even if he’s grumpy about it.  And don’t forget the Embargo Arc!”

Cideeda places her hands on her hips and thinks out loud.  “He forgets about collecting rent on her shop when business was bad, she’s the first to check on him when he hasn’t left the house in a few days, and he’s the one that pushed her to lay down the contracting law upon that general.”

With a quick pivot, Sotalia points at Cideeda.  “And!  Don’t forget who he calls FIRST when he finds some crazy technology.”

As both Cideeda and Sotalia contemplate the growing fan theory, Ardere tracks the conversation with great interest.  A muffled buzz and phone chime startles her, and she retrieves her aetherphone from a pocket.  With few taps of the screen, a text message from “Jasper” appears on the screen.

“Hey, sorry about the silence.  Just got enough signal from a radio relay tower of all things.  Found something from the zone you might like when you get back from your convention.  After I get this to transmit, I’m heading to back to Gateway.  Here’s a picture of the find.”

Ardere eyes focus upon the image and she fights back a wave of giddy delight.  She covers her mouth briefly with squirm in her seat.  Moments afterwards, she lowers her hand down, the giddiness fades to welling revelation in her expression.  She reads the message one last time with a warm smile, returns her phone into her pocket, and resumes paying attention to the fan theory between Cideeda and Sotalia.

Sotalia rolls her eyes at Cideeda.  “Self worth issues?  He was the designer behind major innovations in robotics!  How could he feel like he’s not worthy enough for her?!”

Cideeda sighs and shakes her head. “He lost it all when that competitor company won that ridiculous lawsuit.  He’s got some royalties, the plot of land his house is on, and the shop that Tina is renting from him...  For half market average.”

A groan sounds out from Sotalia and she shrugs.  “Well, I don’t think we’re proving it today.”

With a quick nod to Sotalia, Cideeda pulls out her atherphone with a toothy grin.  “Before we go...  Are you still interested in seeing fan findings of ancient technology?”

Ardere’s ears perk up and her expression brightens.  “Of course!  What do you have?”

Cideeda presses a few commands in the phone screen and turns it to Ardere without saying a further word.  Ardere’s eyes lock onto the screen and almost reflect the image of the security bot head.  Her smile grows into an ear to ear grin the longer she studies the picture.

A toothy grin forms on Cideeda’s mouth.  “Would you like to hold it?”

Ardere blinks, lifts her head up, and nods slowly with a smile.  “I think I can take a lunch break.”

&amp;nbsp;

Sotalia releases the collar of Bach’s shirt when he drifts closer to her from an aborted escape attempt.  She lifts a hand and points out a row of stalls and platforms with a variety of arcane markings and electronics intermingling the structures.  “Here they are!  These are the magical energy measuring stations I told you about!”

Bach adjusts his shirt collar back in place and turns his gaze upon the magical measurement equipment with an uneasy smile.  “Neat.  Um, reminds me of the one back in school.  Must be showcasing the newer models...  Well, that’s pretty cool...”

He watches warily as Sotalia maintains a sly grin with her stare at Bach.  She straightens up confidently and rolls a waving gesture towards two empty platforms and stalls, and concentrates on Bach with an evil tinge infecting her grin.  Bach pivots in place to examine the stalls briefly and returns to face Sotalia with a pleading expression.  “I can’t beat you in raw power.”

Sotalia places her hand on her chest with a happily amused smile and giggles to herself.  “Oh, I know.  I figured we could compete with efficiency.”

With an alternating glance between the platforms and stalls, Bach catches the hints of the excitement Sotalia presently suppresses and sighs with an eye roll.  “I guess it couldn’t hurt.  I’ll take the one at the end.”

Sotalia rushes off with glee to one of the attendants next to a “Merlinatech Magical Machinations” logo.  The human woman gives a quick nod, directs Sotalia and Bach to the platforms, and explains the system.  “With new revisions in the detection algorithm and energy flow sensors, Merlinatech has been able to reduce the size of our professional line flow meters to allow easy home installation!  A mere corner of room is all that’s needed where a whole room once was!  All you have to do is stand on the platform and cast your spells.  The system will measure the flow to, from, and within the space of the platform and calculate energy usage, among many other useful statistics.  But, for demonstration purposes, we’ve put big displays to show energy usage.”

The woman smiles wide and directs Sotalia and Bach’s attention to the nearby stalls.  “If you have any projectile, beam, or other types of spells, please feel free to use our containment stalls.  We ask that you just keep it simple and moderate for safety reasons.”

She steps back toward another group of interested people with a slight bow.  “If you have any further questions, please ask.  But for now, I’ll let you put our equipment to the test.”

Bach thanks the woman and swings his head over to witness Sotalia stretching her arms up and cracking her intertwined fingers.  “Simple and moderate, now.”

The grin assumes an almost seductive air and Sotalia bites her lip with a long breath in.  “I’ll try...”

With a few fast, hand gestures she flicks out a small training bolt of magical energy.  It flies from the tip of her pointing finger into the space of the stall, impacts a barrier at the back, and dissipates.  A few seconds later, a status message pops up on a flat screen monitor near her platform, and a colored bar highlights around the fifty unit range on a sliding number line.  Sotalia puts her hands on her hips, sways them with a confidence nearing pride, and eyes Bach with a flitting quirk on an eyebrow.  Bach sighs, shakes his head, pulling a smile, and holds his hand palm out towards his stall.  A magical bolt forms immediately in front of his palm, darts out into his platform’s containment stall, halts in the middle, and disperses into a mist.  Bach and Sotalia pour their undivided attention to the display near Bach’s platform.  A status prompt appears on the screen and a similar sliding number line charts a much narrower range within the teens just short of twenty units.  A zealous ear to ear smile expands upon Sotalia’s face.  Bach’s jaw drops lower with each moment his mind analyzes the results.  “How the fuck does that shitty of a bolt register so low?”

Sotalia’s smile collapses to a neutral confusion shifting towards an extremely suspicious glare at Bach.  “Shitty bolt?”

She crosses her arms, leans her head back, and bares her teeth in a sneer.  “Oh, don’t you dare flub these on purpose...  Now give me a REAL one.”

Bach blinks, droops his shoulders in defeat, breathes in, and projects another bolt from the palm of his hand.  The smile returns in full force as Sotalia witnesses the display showcase a narrow bar hovering just below the ten unit range.

&amp;nbsp;

A small gathering murmurs a mix of conversation with a few occasionally pointing towards two displays near the platforms Sotalia and Bach stand upon.  Sotalia squints and grimaces with intense concentration upon a forming ball of energy in her hands.  She glances up at the stall for her platform, releases the ball towards the area within the containment stall, and watches the ball burst on the surface of the back target.  Bach unrolls his hand out with a near mirror match of the energy ball.  It drifts on its own into his designated stall, halts midway through, and bursts on its own.  Status messages appear on the displays.  Sotalia momentarily grabs onto her horns in frustration and growls.  “Argh!  How?!  Just how?!”

Bach attempts in vain to contain an exceedingly amused grin on his face, and he turns his head away from Sotalia’s eyesight.  “Just a lot of practice, I guess.”

The few technicians behind a collection of electronic and computer equipment stare in bewilderment as the readouts continue to vex and baffle their knowledge.

“Is it a calibration error?”

“No, we just calibrated it a few hours ago.  Are they just less powerful versions?”

“That’s the weirdest part!  They’re actually slightly more powerful, from the stall sensors...”

From around the corner of the intersection, a small horde of recording equipment hauling personnel orbit a singular lone emin woman.  Tassilda proudly struts across the floor, granting a small wave to those that notice her along the path.  Her ears detect the spike in noise from the small crowd around the Merlinatech demo space, and her head centers upon the source.  Her eyes open wide the moment she spots Sotalia forming another energy ball and Bach idly flicking, very familiar glowing light orbs into the containment stall.  A sneer flashes on her face and she dons a superior, dominant posture and steps with intent over to the platforms.  Sotalia flings out another energy orb into the containment stall, studies the number, and groans as it barely improves over the previous.  “Oh, you stop smiling already and start telling what I need to do!”

With a cleavage lifting cross of the arms, a condescending tone floats into the air from Tassilda’s mouth.  “Maybe consider a career in stage magic?  You seem quite capable of drawing a crowd.”

Sotalia stance snaps rigid and she pivots with a similarly dominant posture to glare with the faintest hint of a grin at Tassilda.  “Oh, you flatter me.  But, I can’t compete with your demonstrable abilities upon the stage.  Such a fine comedy yesterday!”

A light twitch tugs gently at the corner of Tassilda’s eye and she cocks her head to the side, letting her long black hair sway along her revealing outfit.  “Interesting.  It seems strange for someone of your obvious experience to be instructed by the intern of your group?  What deficiencies could you possibly be addressing?”

An evil grin creeps onto Sotalia’s mouth and she lifts her head up with a shake of her dark red hair.  “Refinements, really.  As for the intern, I saw you’ve learned plenty from him yourself...”

She gestures with her eyes and swaying head towards Bach.  The shift in attention from Sotalia, Tassilda, the crowd, and the camera crew stuns Bach clueless to action, as he holds a light orb in his hand with many floating in the containment stall for his platform.  Sotalia rotates her head slowly to face Tassilda.  A wave of unease flows through Tassilda’s body, but a spark of insight from memories boils her confidence.  “Certainly to be expected from a lady of your exceedingly refined age...”

A noticeable cringing grit cracks Sotalia’s facade, and Tassilda delights in the sight.  Tassilda walks to a platform next to Sotalia, stretches and flexes suggestively to the crowd, and magically gestures a small bolt of energy into that platform’s stall.  Sotalia responds in kind with a slightly larger bolt.  Bach leans out from his platform to a better view of the events unfolding.  “Ah, shit.”

Sotalia and Tassilda continue their jabbing conversation while each produces a slightly more powerful spell to edge out the opposing.  The number ranges on the displays grow with each round.  Double digits, low triple digits, and moderate triples digits shift and sway on the screen.  Both maintain respective airs of superiority and near sneering smiles at each other.  A break in the action occurs as both build up their finales.  Sotalia scoffs and forms the magical energy in her hands.  “Let’s make these count.”

Tassilda dramatically, with an extravagant flair, opens her hand palm up to reveal a growing ball of green fire.  “Yes.  I agree.”

The two continue to glare at each other, the magical flow condensing in their hands.  A few technicians glance over to the containment stalls with nervous expressions.  Bach follows the uncertain looks to the stalls as his eyes glow blue.  He squints to examine the stalls, rears his head back, blinks, and steps off his platform.  Sotalia readies her energy orb and waits.  Tassilda directs her palm out towards the target in her stall.  Both stare intently at each other and pause in silence as the cameras and crowd anticipate the moment they will release their potent spells.  Sotalia flexes her arm muscles and Tassilda flares out her fingers-  And Bach walks right between the two of them, snatches Sotalia’s energy orb with one hand, and yanks Tassilda’s green fireball away with the other.  “Okay!  I think that’s enough right now.  Looks like they need to let the stalls cool down a bit.”

Sotalia’s energy orb shakes for a few moments before puffs out into a cloud of energy, fading into Bach.  Tassilda’s green fireball flickers and snuffs out in a haze that drifts into Bach’s hand.  Sotalia grumbles and seizes Bach by the collar of his shirt.  “Damn it, Bach!  What are you doing?!”

Tassilda stands up straight, carefully examines the hand that the fireball once hovered near, and blinks in absolute, sheer bewilderment as to the fate of her fireball.  Bach narrows his eyes at Sotalia and points to the stalls.  “You were about to overload the system.  So, I stopped you.”

Sotalia glances over to stalls, squints as her eyes flicker golden for a few moments, and embarrassment washes over her with the release of Bach’s shirt.  “Oh.  Right.  Good call.  Sorry.”

Bach shrugs with an eye roll.  “No problem.  Can we get out of here?  Away from the cameras?  Please-”

He halts mid thought and feels the fingers in hand that seized Tassilda’s green fireball.  “What the hell?  There’s something on my hands.  A powder?”

He moves the hand closer to his face and Sotalia quickly grabs his arm.  She directs Bach’s hand close to her eyes, squints, and puzzles.  A sudden flash of shock erupts on her face and she cover her mouth before rearing back in a cackle.  “OH.  MY.  GODS!  It’s copper powder!  She’s using material components in her magic!”

Sotalia continues a loud echoing laugh and looks to Tassilda with an incredulously amused expression.  “Really?!  You couldn’t manage to use magic to make the flames green?!”

She takes a long breath, exhales to calm herself down, stands up straight, and walks near Tassilda.  “So, I have to ask...  Which kit do you use?  I have to admit, back in high school, I used them, too.  I liked the one with black candles myself, but you know how all the emin girls go through that doom and gloom stage.”

Tassilda’s normally gray complexion darkly reddens rapidly to a twitching furious death glare upon Sotalia.  When Sotalia moves close with an expectant smug grin, a harsh spouting of the emin language escapes just above a whisper in volume.  Sotalia halts, process the words, crosses her arms, and chuckles darkly as her eyes widen with a triumphant smile.  “Oh!  So, that’s what you think of me!  Mind saying that lovely term a bit louder for everyone else!  I haven’t heard that one in a while.  Did your racist grandfather teach you that one?”

Tassilda whips around without another word, rushes away in an angry huff, and nearly knocks over a camera woman along the way.  Sotalia waves with a delightful smile.  Bach slides next to her, glances at the irate Tassilda in the distance, and glances over to Sotalia.  “Um...  Everything okay?”

Sotalia sways happily around.  “Yes.  I, SO, knew it!”

&amp;nbsp;

Loud impacts of padded training swords sound out into the high ceilings of the enormous warehouse.  A few loud crashes of people hitting soft mats on raised platform resonate with grumbles and frustrations of defeat following.  Dretphi converses with two other older grath.  Both casually wear old grath military uniforms with many prominent awards and ranks sparsely decorating sleeves and front pockets.  A few words laugh out from one man, he pats his the empty folded sleeve of his shirt using his only hand and shrugs with a nonchalant smile.  Other man shakes his head with an eye roll, buries his face in the palm of his hand, and rocks with a chuckle.  Dretphi stifles a reflexive laugh with a happy smile and continues speaking.  

Behind her, a very old grath slowly steps forward with solid crane presses on the floor preceding his footsteps.  He maintains a warm smile and gaze at Dretphi as he orbits around her to stand next to the other two men.  Both men immediately recognize the very old grath, rigidly pause, and salute.  The elder grath eyes the two.  With some effort, he straightens his posture to properly fill out his uniforn, stands taller than everyone else, and lifts a strong but shaky hand to his temple.  With a nod, he releases his salute from the short white hair encircling his bald head, relaxes his back with a playful groaning eye roll, and chuckles.  With a sly grin, he turns his head to Dretphi, shifts his support to the cane in front of him, points a finger her with a slight wag, and smiles as speaks a short sentence.  Dretphi blinks in confusion and her mind sorts through memories in a rapid, desperate attempt to identify the man before her.  The elder grath laughs, gives a comforting wave of the hand, and shakes his head with a smile.  He taps the side of his head a few times to punctuate his words, and shakes a point to Dretphi before carefully lowering his hand down near his knees, and gestures a certain height.  He draws himself back up, and joking references a topic that immediately causes Dretphi to blush in sympathy to her childhood.  The other two grath snicker in fun and prompt another topic of discussion.

Across the way, a camera crew catches the thudding crash of an opponent upon the mats and a triumphant Trakenthin standing above with a practice sword end tapping the fallen opponent’s chest.  The referee witnesses and confirms with a hand gesture towards Trakenthin.  “Winnner by vital hit, Trakenthin!”

A small crowd applauds and cheers, and Trakenthin absorbs the praise as he holds his arms out and up during his circuit around the mat.  Cameras focus upon him and Samantha flips through notes on her clipboard as boredom assaults her.  “Again, he beats yet... another opponent.”

Trakenthin scans out around the area, his eyes scrutinizing each person for a possible opponent.  His search expands outwards and further out in the warehouse full of practice mats and rings.  With a brief double take, he finds his next target with a hungry grin spreading across his mouth and his eyes settle upon Dretphi in the distance.  With a loud bellowing shout in grath, he snaps a strong point to Dretphi and issues a challenge.  Dretphi cringes with low grumble and sighs.  The one armed grath quirks a brow at Trakenthin, the other old grath sidesteps around to block line of sight between the rest of the group and Trakenthin, and the elder lifts a brow at Dretphi and asks a question.  Dretphi shakes her head and narrows her eyes with her pupils gesturing to Trakenthin.  She looks to all of them and points to the ground to highlight her query.  The old grath men nod with the elder waving her to leave for now with a nod and an understanding smile.  Dretphi respectfully bows, steps away, pivots, and power walks straight towards the nearest exit.

Trakenthin’s expression sours as he watches Dretphi move fast towards the exit.  He narrows his eyes, slides his stance back, and thinks.  With a few moments, a mean grin crackles upon his face, and directs his full focus to Dretphi.  He calls out to her, his words mixing with arrogance and contempt.  Dretphi maintains her stoic demeanor and keeps her attentions forward.  A long pause follows Trakenthin’s last statement.  He dismissively snorts and exaggerates the emphasis on a slow, purposeful grath sentence with anticipation in his eye.  Dretphi freezes in place.  A subtle twitch flexes her cheek, she lifts her stance, and draws in an angry breath through a grit peeking through her lips.  The three old grath concentrate stoic, harsh glares at Trakenthin, with the face of eldest leaking out his boiling ire.

Dretphi’s twists her head to a side to crack her neck, pivots to face Trakenthin, and powers forward cracking her knuckles along the way.  The elder grath smiles, examines a nearby rack of training weapons, spots a weapon, and secures his footing.  With a strong grip his crane, he lifts up a training sword with the end, feels out the weight, calls out to the one armed grath, and launches the weapon.  The one armed grath effortlessly snatches the weapon out of the air, gives it a few test swings and swipes while he marches over to the side of Dretphi, and presents the weapon to her.  The other older grath moves along side her and carefully whispers into her awaiting ear.  Dretphi nods in confirmation with each paragraph of information and gradually shifts her mindset to a serious state.  Samantha finally catches sight of Dretphi approaching the ring and her jaw drops in astonishment.  “Holy.  Shit.  Everyone check batteries and storage drives!  I want every bit of this covered!”

Trakenthin and Dretphi stand near the middle of the mat and wait with their padded training blades ready.  The referee glances at either of them, holds his hand in the middle, and then lifts his arm up with a step back.  “Fight!”

Trakenthin launches a flurry of strikes upon Dretphi.  Each impact hits solidly against the defending blade of Dretphi.  The two circle around the surface of the mat, Trakenthin aggressively assailing Dretphi with barrages of swings and swipes.  Occasionally, Dretphi attempts a strike upon an opening but Trakenthin proficiently blocks.  As the constant exchange of attacks continues, Dretphi’s blade rocks back more and more with the next wave from Trakenthin, who begins to intermix more banter and derisive words between his attacks.  Dretphi’s serious, concentrating expression never wavers.  Samantha studies the combat and cocks her head with an emerging suspicion as she catches the stoic amusement of the older grath nearby.  “What’s going on?”

With an elaborate overhead slam upon Dretphi’s sword from Trakenthin, she drops to a knee.  A flare of eagerness ignites Trakenthin’s eyes and he steps forward to power down his blade against Dretphi.  She maintains the shaking deadlock above her with both hands on her sword’s handle.  Trakenthin glares at Dretphi with a gritting grin expressing his unyielding desires for her defeat.  As Dretphi locks eyes with Trakenthin, the serious expression shatters to reveal a wide tooth bearing grin and a fire of sheer confidence in her eyes.  Trakenthin’s bewilderment barely gets a chance to manifest when he feels something different about the blade deadlock.

New lines of muscle definition emerge upon Dretphi’s arm as she powers her blade up toward Trakenthin.  She draws up her knee from the ground to put that foot underneath her and a hand frees itself from holding the blade to sweep forward a clawing grip around Trakenthin’s ankle.  Dretphi roars upwards with the defiant flex of every muscle in her body, and she yanks out Trakenthin’s foot from underneath and up in front of him.  Following the guidance of his leg, Trakenthin drops flat on his back to loud resounding echo of the warehouse.  He attempts to blink, but his eyes flit wide as he feels Dretphi lever his leg forward.  As he opens his mouth to growl, the pain of a boot pressing weight upon his sword wielding fore arm interrupts.  Finally, Trakenthin recovers from the seconds of chaos to the pressure of a padded training sword on the side of his neck.  Dretphi beams a furious glare upon him and slowly traces the tip of the training weapon symbolically across Trakenthin’s neck.  The referee examines the action, nods, stands up, and gestures towards Dretphi.  “Winner by vital hit...  Excuse, what is your name?”

Dretphi releases Trakenthin’s leg, exhales calmly with an air sheer satisfaction, and respectfully answers.  “Dretphi.  Dretphi Prakkenten Reti Veranattin.”

The referee confirms with a hidden contentment.  Dretphi calmly exits the ring, returns the training sword to the smugly smiling old grath men, bows, and leaves quickly to the exit.  Trakenthin sits up from the mat floor, blinks in sheer bewilderment, and stares silently attempting to comprehend the situation.  A camera gets to close and suffers the full ire of Trakenthin when he backhands the lens right off it.

&amp;nbsp;

A large, loose crowd hangs out near the Stalwart Sword huge demo with the major topic being the last, remaining sword still in the large center stone.  The other four sword stones remain empty with names and locations card in front to showcase the new owners of the swords.  Bach steps up to the center platform at the direction of a Stalwart Sword representative.  He carefully and firmly grips the sword handle, shores up his stance, and readies himself.  With a strong attempt, his arm muscles flex, his body strains, but the sword remains in the exact spot without a single shudder.  He shakes his head, looks up to Aristespha, Cideeda, Dretphi, Sebastian, and Sebastian with a nonchalant shrug and an accepting smile.  “Oh well.  Guess it’s not for me.”

“A valiant try!  Quite impressive.  Really…”

Bach stands back up and glances over his shoulder to see Chad Bosch waving to the crowd.  Camera crews disperse into the area, while Samantha and Gerald maintain a professional distance away to overseer the impending operation.  As Chad steps up to the side of the sword containing stone to work the crowd, Bach quizzically stares at the sword with a strange curiosity.  He glances at Chad and returns his gaze to sword in thought.  Bach’s eyes glow blue as they search through his mind.  A seconds later, his eyes flit wide and then narrows a quick glare to Chad.  The glare fades with a scheming smile and the glow in his eyes dims back to normal.  Chad maintains a bright heroic smile and eyes Bach.  “If you don’t mind... I’d like to give it a try.  Sir...”

Bach nods against Chad’s intimidating, demanding stare contrasting his smile, steps away with a welcoming gesture, and returns into the crowd.  Chad keeps the stare upon Bach and only breaks off when he receives a variety of other stares and glares from Aristespha, Cideeda, Dretphi, Sebastian, and Sotalia.  Bach slides in behind the group and Aristespha directs her voice back.  “I sensed something strange about that sword’s locking enchantment.  Did you feel anything?”

Bach grins with a dark tint and laughs quietly.  “Oh yes.  When Chad walked up, I felt something stir.  I think it was some kind of remote trigger stirring.  I bet he’s got a key enchantment or something on him.”

Cideeda shakes her head with a dissatisfied sneer.  Dretphi crosses her arms with stoic glare forward to Chad.  Sotalia leans closer to Bach to participate in the conversation.  “Fucking figures.  I wonder how much the cheat paid for the privilege?”

Bach chuckles with an evil color and perks a knowing eyebrow.  “Too much for what he’s going to get.”

Sebastian blinks, and hovers his head near to whisper to Bach.  “What did you DO?”

Bach merely grins.  “Oh.  We’ll see.  I’ll have to apologize to Kaleb later.”

The group watches with less than kind, anticipating gazes as Chad secures his grip around the sword for his attempt.  Chad calms himself, concentrates with a dramatic flair, and flexes his muscular upper body in an exaggerated display of strength to draw up the sword.  The display eventually shifts towards  genuine straining effort as the seconds wear on and the sword remains in place.  Just as the determination upon Chad’s face cracks to desperation, the sword gradually slides up to the silence of the crowd.  The sword travels sluggishly out of the stone platform, ignoring the shakes of Chad’s arms stressing against some force.  When the sword arrives half out of the stone, it slams back into place and leads Chad’s forehead to tap unceremoniously into the handle.  Chad releases the sword, stands up, and assures the crowd with bold, heroic gestures.  “Do not worry.  It’s just a little shy with such a wonderful crowd witnessing.”

He squats down, carefully grips onto the sword tight, pans a gaze to the crowd, and traces a glare to Samantha and the confused Stalwart Sword representative that Samantha discreetly berates.  He waits for crowd to quiet down, preps himself, and waits.  With all the power he can muster, he puts all his strength into pulling the sword.  It gradually moves up and rewards Chad’s outstanding effort, up until the halfway point...  When the binding force completely disappears.  The large crowd cheers a chorus of laughter and applause when Chad flies backwards onto the ground and crashes out onto the floor.  Sword still in hand, Chad summons all his being to contain the irritation swelling out onto his face behind his trademark heroic smile.

&amp;nbsp;

Kaleb doubles over from laughing and rights himself back up to face Bach.  “Nicely done!  That arrogant prick deserves all he gets.  I wish I could have seen his face.  It was probably just as bad as when you asked about his car.”

Shadeesa shakes her head as she relaxes in a chair and pets Lagi’s head at her side.  “We need to be careful.  If they keep it up, they’ll put our act out of business.”

Kaleb glances with a shrug to Shadeesa and Lagi.  “They still don’t have a dragon.  I think we still got them beat.”

The entirety of both groups converse about the events of the day, exchanging various stories.

“MYLO!  Stop running!  Get back over here!”

Mylo rushes toward the groups, waving his glowing wand around, and calling out.  “Dragon!”

Mylo’s evuukian mother runs after him with another human man beside her.  The man calls out.  “Come on, son!  Slow down!”

Mother and father split out to either side, and close in on Mylo as he close in on the other two groups near Lagi.   Eventually the parents manage to capture the excited Mylo.  As Mylo’s mother turns to apologize, she immediately recognizes Bach.  “I’m so sorry for him-  THERE YOU ARE!”

Bach blinks and weakly waves.  Mylo’s mother smiles and bows slightly.  “You disappeared before I could thank you.  Again, thank you so much!  You’ve saved the day for all us and kept our sanity intact for a little while longer.”

The human man, with the same dirty blonde hair color as Mylo, steps forward and extends a hand out to Bach.  “Hello!  The name is Mason Anderson.  Just wanted to say thanks for helping my wife and son out.”

Bach shakes Mason hand.  “It wasn’t a problem, really.”

Mylo’s mother lowers Mylo back down with a hand securing him from wandering too far.  “Oh, that’s right.  I never got your name.  I sorry to have been so rude.  I am Lalyanpha and this is Mylokia, or Mylo.”

Lalyanpha lifts her head up towards Bach with a smile and notices Aristespha.  The smile tinges with unease as nervous energy seeps out.  Aristespha’s eyes widen and she raises a hand comforting hand to Lalyanpha.  “Do not worry.  I do NOT share those biases.  You do not study proper medicine without seeing the fallacies behind those prejudices.  You two have a beautiful son.”

A great weigh leaves Lalyanpha and she sighs with relief as Mason wraps an arm around her.  “Thank you.  That’s one of the reasons why Mason and I come to these type of events.”

Mason grins and winks out to the group.  “Also, I get free tickets from the organizers.  Helps when you’re the guy they come to fix everything that likes to fall apart around here.”

Mylo looks pleadingly to his mother and points to Lagi.  Shadeesa meets Lalyanpha’s glance with a happy nod and gestures for Mylo to comes over.  Lagi enjoys the new attention from little Mylo, and the gathering converses more about the events of the convention.  Eventually, the groups go their own ways as the night sky in the above skylights wears on.  Everyone takes great care to not disturb a sleeping Mylo from cradle of Lagi’s front legs."
77w7sm,3,2017-10-21,Do I quit my first job for an internship?,i_like_to_travel,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/77w7sm/do_i_quit_my_first_job_for_an_internship/,"Hey there I was the usual unemployed engineering fresher for months until I finally got into a Big 4 tech company as a CS Associate. The job is generally an elaborated BPO but has good growth if you're into it. I'm not happy with the work because this isn't something with which I want to start my career with but the big brand name is something I like a lot (which for obvious reasons could help me stand out at getting jobs later), not to mention the work culture too.

It's only been a month at this job and I'm already doubting if I should keep going on. I decided to apply at another good company and got an internship role at it. It's similar to operations support role which I'm slightly interested in and involves a new product that's been quickly growing at a rapid pace in it's market. I'm very sure this product will do great as it's part of a sort of Big 4 company right now, but it's just an internship for a couple of months. 

Do I stay back at the present job, build up experience with mediocre performance or do I quit the full-time safe job for a risky internship which may or may not lead me to a full-time role in the interned company? 

I know that this is something *I* need to spend time thinking about but I'd like to know if there are other people who have been in such a position, what did you do or what would you have done?"

However, it isn't quite what I want to do.

I started programming several years back and knew it was exactly what I wanted to do. I fall into the category of people who would say their job is their hobby, and vice versa. Side projects, linux user, you get the idea.

So, I went through with it and got a CS degree (online). So far, so good. I feel I have done a good job as far as skillset goes. Not perfect, mind you - no internship, among other things - but I feel pretty confident I have useful skills.

I graduated last fall. I have kept the job at the PC repair shop (worked part time previously, now full time) thus far, because I don't really know how to enter the field. I don't think developer jobs exist as this small of a scale - even the IT prospects are pretty poor here.

I have looked for online jobs for a while (since before I graduated), but it seems entry-level remote positions don't exist. More recently, I am beginning to think the only realistic option is moving.

Any thoughts or advice?"

I'll try to give as many details about me so I can have a some sort of a ""plan"" in my hand for near future.

So, here I am in Turkey. I'm 21 as I said. Curreny pursuing a Bachelor's for Computer Engineering (It's actually CS but nevermind). I've got a pretty complicated life and family. My mom is a really unsuccessful lawyer. My dad is a computer engineer. My parents divorced back in 2003. My mom is still single and dad married back in 2010, divorced again 2016. There are lots of tragedy in my family but here is not the place to tell. Just know major tragedies exists.

Other than that, since the day I know myself, I am pretty uncomfortable, unhappy, and disturbed about the society I live in. Most people in here are pretty conservative. By conservative I mean it's not like a ""Let's stick to our traditions"" kind of Conservatism, it's more like Islamofascist authoritarian rule. There are lots of people who opposes the government but everyone - i mean **every one**- is fucking politically active. From the 8 years old children to 80's grandparents, everyone is talking about how other side go fuck theirselves etc. Everyone is radical about it. You simply cannot talk with anyone without mentioning politics. This is making me super pissed off.

Another thing is religion. I really don't wanna yalk about the issues how the things fucked up in here but Muslim society is pretty harsh in here. Government supported religious courses turns out the places for pedophilic people who rapes 8-9 years old children. Religous groups blending in to governmental positions, selecting their own people for specific positions. Corruption levels are high just because of this and there are no obligations against this cause everything is done under religous cover. As an atheist it's harder to live.

The last thing I want to say is people's mentality. I simply cannot understand a thing about people in Turkey. People who tried to shoot the sun with pistols because it's too hot, child rapers, judges who release rapers, police officers killing innocent and got away, high ranking government officials who openly stole money, people who are supporting this thieves because they're muslims, people punching and kicking girls just because they wore a skirt and this make their dick hard... Oh my fucking god... There are lots of things which are waaaay absurd than I can ever handle... I just can't take it anymore.

Last july I make my childhood dream come true and went to a Scandinavian trip by myself. Bought a flight tickets to Oslo from Istanbul and Stockholm to back to Istanbul. It was a 12 days trip but worth it. I listened Johann Sebastian Bach on the streets of Oslo,  started to drink beer at pub with my roommates at 10 in the morning ! Hang out with beautiful girls and had a really good conversations. Had a bike trip at Aalborg/Denmark. Drank almost 7 litres of beer in one night when I was in Copenhagen. Walked 12 km in Stockholm, took a nap in the park and saw a fully naked girl 45 cm away from me. Everyone using bikes. People are friendly. No one told me to fuck off or any other bad behavior -except a little racism that I encountered in Copenhagen- People **are** happy. I was also happy. 

What are my options to move to Norway or Sweden? (Sorry Danish friends :(( ) My roommate back in Oslo was from Finland and he was waiting for some paperwork. He told me that, I should look on nav.no for jobs. I don't know the Sweden side. I am in my second year of university maybe I can find some internships or research programs? Other than that I was planning to go to a Norwegian courses in Oslo. I can spend my summer there and learn the language. Haven't find a time to detail my plans. 

Any help are mostly welcomed. Please give me some help to see the path ahead of me.



Btw, I do not care the expensiveness of Scandinavian countries. Norwegian GDP per capita is 75k usd and Turkish gdp per capita is 10k usd (according to Turkish government, it maybe lower in reality). 1 euro is 4.33 turkish lira right now but assume it's 4 tl. In order to buy a 25k euro worth car Turkish citizen must pay -no, not 25*4=100k TL- 350-400k TL with taxes. I pay taxes more than most of the world and I got nothing in return. At least in Scandinavian governments actually do something with the tax.

Sorry for spelling mistakes, I am both sleepy and on the mobile phone. I can give any additional information if needed. Thanks for reading. Love you all."

Recently I've been thinking about what I want to do with my career. For the past couple of months I been kind of lost, but around 2 weeks ago I finally decided on what I needed to do. My plan right now is to: work on internships, get a degree in CS, and eventually to move to Seattle and (preferably) work at one of the Big 4.


Some background:


I'm 20 years old, and an online student at a non-target university. Currently I'm working towards a BS in IT: Application and Database Development, but plan on switching to a school that offers a CS major. Now, the reason why I'm currently a student there is a long story, but basically it's cheaper for me because my father is a Veteran, and my thinking was that I'd complete my pre-reqs and then transfer to a school that actually offered the degree that I'm after. I currently have ~30 credits, and a GPA of 3.85. I don't mind sharing the school name if it matters. I've had 3 jobs, 2 as a hotel front-desk clerk, and the other as a pipe labeler at an Aerospace company in SoCal (unfortunately not at SpaceX :P). My classes haven't been anything related to computers, mostly just Math and Sciences. When I was 18 I worked a lot in game development, so I'm familiar with the basics of Unity and C#. I also know a bit of Python. When it comes to more advanced stuff like algorithms and DS though, I'm pretty clueless.


Anyway, on to the questions I have:

1. I'm thinking about leaving my current school in Spring, do you guys have any recommendations on which school I should transfer to? I'm having a hard time finding a reputable online school that offers a BS in CS, but I also don't mind going to a University. I've heard from a friend that University of Washington would be a great choice because it's near Amazon and Google, but from what I've read it's hard to get into their CS program. 

2. I want to start interning soon, but it looks like the deadline for 2018 internships at the Big 4 has already passed. When do applications for 2019 open up? To be honest the idea interning anywhere hadn't even crossed my mind but from what I've read they're pretty great to have on your resume and the idea of getting a return offer afterwards sounds amazing.

3. I've been reading a lot here for the past month, and to be honest the majority of you guys are a lot more knowledgeable than I am. I attempted to work on some LeetCode, but to be honest even the Easy problems were pretty hard for me. Seeing that some interns here knew how to do Medium and Hard problems before applying proves to me that I have a lot to learn. I've been working on Python tutorials and bought CTCI, is there anything else I can do to study?

Please let me know if any details need to be expanded, and thanks for reading.

Any advice would be appreciated :)  "

I don't have any internships and will likely end up graduating by next December because all I have left are Core CS classes to take. Is limiting my search for internships or personal projects to Swift going to hinder my job search? I know it's a relatively young language so I'm wondering how in demand specifically swift developers are. I'm in the Research Triangle area of NC if that makes any difference. Go Tarheels!"

What I ended up doing was showing an example of how you override the divide operator. What I didn't show was how you could manipulate it so that you could declare things other than numbers as inputs in the override, but instead I just used an example where I returned rhs/lhs instead of the typical lhs/rhs. Am I worrying too much about it? The interviewer looked a little confused the entire time and had to look at my pseudocode for a little while after I had finished. The rest of the interview went great imo. 

Sorry for the complaining - I just had to get it out there.

edit - I got the internship!"

I signed on the first thing I was offered and my SO and I packed our bags. She has a bachelor's and has been in an out of precarious employment while I work an ok-salaried job in my field.

My job is 85% writing emails and dealing with whiney people. It honestly isn't too terrible but I think it's mostly tolerable because it isn't too stressful. 

I had lived in this city once before and had a bad experience, so I was hesitant to move back here. I did so because my SO has family here. Basically I've completely lost contact with all my friends. I had a great social circle where I was living before.

I have one friend who happens to live here who I'd been hanging out with quite a bit. I'd also met some of his friends through him. I realized I was always the one initiating and so I stopped texting him so much and I don't see him much anymore.

For a while I didn't vibe very well with my coworkers - they're all super gregarious, loud and extroverted and so I often felt out of place. I tried my best to find common ground and I'd thought I was doing ok. I'd also been spending a bit of time with some friends who were here over the summer for internships. 

Anyway, the other day at lunch we started talking about dressing up for halloween and one of my coworkers asked what I wanted to be. My other coworker interjected saying ""don't you have to actually go and do something to dress up for Halloween?"". It created this super awkward silence and another coworker said ""well you can dress up for Halloween with your cat.."" Obviously the implication was that I don't have any friends and that I'm a loser. I was kind of hurt by this since I'd thought this coworker as a potential friend and I'd seen him outside of work a few times. Anyway since then I've felt pretty uncomfortable at work and I've kind of resigned caring about this job.

My SO's family wants to see us constantly and it's not good for my mental health, and I'm finding being the ""supporter"" in the the relationship stressful. I don't care for the job and I just feel uncomfortable around my coworkers who I guess see me as a loser. If I quit the job my resume will look terrible and I'll also have to deal with the mess from the lease I'm stuck in. I also have no jobs lined up back home. At the same time, my mental health is really deteriorating here. 

TL;DR Moved across the country for a job, I don't get along with my coworkers, have no friends, feel lonely, and basically hate my life"

Since it is a small company I do a variety of different things. I would say I mainly do  Invoicing, creating Price tables for our contract proposals, and also have been managing our project schedules. I really like the job that I am at and they have offered me a full time salary position after graduation, although the details like my salary and benefits have not been discussed. My boss did mention that I would have to sign a 2 year contract if I were to stay. As I stated, I really like the job and the people but I do have a worry that since it is a small company and that I am not doing that much Finance, I would have trouble finding a good job if I were to ever leave the company. Also, if I were to grow in the company, it would consist of me taking a project management role and not Finance. The company says that I could soon start taking lead on some of our smaller projects in the near future and that I could eventually work my way up to  some of our big projects. Another plus is that the company is growing at a really fast rate, we have been awarded over $10 million dollars in contracts so far this year. I see potential large growth for myself in the company but my main concern that I would not be gaining enough experience in Finance. 

So for my alternatives...

I have an interview coming up with a well known &amp; respected company, for a 2 year Financial Analyst Rotation Program. From what I have been able to research, the position pays around 60K on average which is nice, but more importantly, I think it will make me more attractive to other jobs in the future with that experience on my resume. I am on the 3rd and last part of the interview process and I know that I may not get the job, but If offered I would be conflicted on whether I should take the job or remain at my current job. I think that the experience would be better and assume that the pay would be better (idk what my current job will offer me). The downsides in comparison to my internship are that i don’t think that the growth potential in the company is as great and also I am not sure how if I would like it as much as I enjoy my work now. 

If I don't get an offer, I will most likely take the job at my internship, assuming they offer me a reasonable amount and further assess my future after the 2 year contract. 

I guess I am coming to reddit for one, just to type out my thoughts instead of laying down and getting lost in my thoughts (feels good btw) but also because I really don’t have a person irl to really discuss this with for some guidance.  

Any thoughts/advice on my situation will be appreciated.

I'm just...worthless. A fairly defective, waste-of-space human being. I epitomize the word ""useless."" In my 19 pathetic years of life I've done nothing of significance or discernible impact. I have virtually no friends, because I can't seem to break past my aloof, reserved shell that desperately yearns for acceptance and love beneath its surface. I was bullied relentlessly throughout much of my life, and the permanent impact on my self-esteem is unequivocal. My parents have been in dire financial straits for all of my life, they've always struggled to maintain any semblance of stability. We went periods without a car, periods where they put our house on the market because the mortgage was so damn overdue, both of them have been perpetually under &amp; unemployed. It's fucked me up, irrevocably. I forever feel as though ending up like them is inevitable; I feel powerless and wholly incapable of ever improving my life station. It breaks my goddamn heart now, to know they're still struggling immensely and I can't do a fucking thing to ease their burdens. Mom and Dad both suffer from depression; Mom's apparently manifested after she had me, and it has stuck since. She attempted suicide when I was 3, and I've always carried that fucking weight with me. Awesome job, what-a-surprise! Your birth resulted in your mother being cursed with an enduring, agonizing mental illness and spurred her to almost end her life. I love my parents, don't get me wrong -- but that fact makes me even more wracked with unfathomable guilt. If that isn't a sign I shouldn't have been fucking born, what is?                   


I decided to go to college ~2,000 miles from home last year, for a fresh start. No longer tethered to the entrenched notions of me that bullying cemented; no longer subjected to the constant realization that my parents are barely scraping by. Well, thus far I have failed completely at every fucking pain-staking effort to improve my life! I made two close friends, last year -- a goddamn miracle, considering my staggering inability to do so prior. One transferred. The other I started dating after a few months. I was head-over-heels, felt as though life was acknowledging my existence after a shit ton of rejection in high school. I was finally happy, outrageously ecstatic. I built my social life around him, devoted every fibre of my being to him (not an advisable decision, I realize)....annnnd he dumped me. And refused to ever speak to me again, after nearly a year of near-constant interaction and undying affection on my end. And hey, at least it proved that I really am as fucking worthless as I feel! So I'm 2,000 miles away from my family, yet lost all the fucking friends I made last year and all vestiges of my former happiness have dissipated. My grades are decent, but my virtually non-existent self-esteem has hindered any efforts at internships thus far, and I'm not nearly as involved as I need to be. My fucking anxiety and my irreparable image of myself mean I'm fucked for any future employment endeavors. I have barely any experience thus far and I'm too damn cowardly to put myself out there, so how will I even begin to function as an adult?            

I'm not normally disposed to whining, and believe me, I know how dramatic and superficial and self-imposed my complaints sound. But I'm just fucking done. I'm fucking done with feeling like such a miserable, pathetic failure. Hopelessness pervades every inch of my being. I've made it 19 years without fostering any meaningful relationships, without any fucking achievements, without generating any faith in myself to successfully pursue future prospects. My crippling fucking depression/anxiety stymies me, I hate myself so goddamn much. I am fucking incapable of making friends, of convincing someone that I'm lovable, and it all just feels so futile. I'm not old by any means, but I remember being 14 or 15 and saying ""Just wait for it to get better before you think about... that."" And it hasn't gotten better. I just continuously fuck things up, my horribly awkward personality diminishes all opportunities, failure is an inextricable facet of my being. I just don't know how to be happy. I don't think I'll ever find happiness, I don't think I'll ever find success, and I just don't fucking know what to do. I have nothing to live for and all the color is long faded. I love my family. I'm damn thrilled for every person that loves their life, and I wish I could ease the pain of all those that don't. But when it comes to me, I genuinely am a lost cause. I don't think there's any mechanism to fix the person who has been marred by a lifetime of pain, sadness, strife and consistent failure. I don't believe in myself to ever make things better. I don't think I have the strength, energy or capability. And I just...don't know. I'm just so fucking sad, as I sit here alone in my room with no hopes for the future, no hopes for myself, no hopes for progress, and so much fucking pain to reconcile myself with.           

Thanks for reading, if anyone does. As stated, my apologies for whining and the drama. Just needed to vent. No one in my life knows I'm struggling this much, as I don't really have anyone to confide in &amp; I don't want to be a burden. It also breaks my fucking heart to imagine anyone else in this much pain, feeling this fucked up and hopeless, and God how I wish I could just take away the pain from everyone. It's not fucking fair, and this fucking sucks. I'm just so sorry. "

I understand that in order to get accepted to top CS PhD programs, one must have a lot of research experience.
I am planning to apply to some competitive CS PhD programs this year. But I don't have any publications at top avenues. I was just wondering whether I will have some chance to get admitted with my limited research experience?

So I have one paper related to data mining that got accepted to a low-tier IEEE international conference. And I have one paper related to HCI in a low-tier regional conference. I am currently a research intern at Adobe System. I started about a month ago but I did quite well so far. I quickly finished the main task of my internship, which is to develop a research prototype in less than three weeks. Then I picked up the existing project of other intern and had some ideas that lead to substantial improvements. The deadlines of most related conferences for this year have passed though. So I am quite sure I cannot get another paper before applying. But I am sure that the letter from the research scientist  who is supervising me will be very positive. He just knew me for about a month though (3 months by the time I submitted my applications). I am not sure if his letter will carry much weight though.

So yeah, do you think I will have some chance to get admitted given that I don't have any publication at top conferences? Other parts of my profile are alright (High GPA, high GRE quant, okay GRE verbal for international students, two internships at Google).

I am planning to apply to HCI research area (with a little focus on machine learning / data mining)

It's only been 1 month at this job and I'm already doubting if I should keep going on. I have tried applying to another good Big 4 tech company and got an internship offer from them. It's similar to operations support role which I'm slightly interested in and involves a new product that's been quickly growing at a rapid pace in it's market. I'm very sure this product will do great in the long run but it's just an internship for a couple of months with a possibility for a full-time conversion.

Do I stay back at the present job, build up experience with mediocre performance or do I quit the full-time safe job for a risky interesting and challenging internship which may or may not lead me to a full-time role in the interned company?

I'd like to know if there are other people who have been in such a position, what did you do or what would you have done?"

781dij,1,2017-10-22,Switching from trying for a Ph.D. in one field to a Masters in CS. Need Advice.,adamdh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/781dij/switching_from_trying_for_a_phd_in_one_field_to_a/,"I just got finished reading through all of the relevant sidebar threads and FAQs, and I still have questions about switching from trying to obtain a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences to starting a Master's in CS.

* I'm beginning my second year of graduate school at a public university in the Southern U.S. and have tried to quit twice now because it's definitely not for me.

 For only having a bachelors of science in Biology, I felt locked into completing the Ph.D. because the job opportunities for scientists with only a bachelors degree are severely limited and very underpaid. After completing a Ph.D. in 5-6 years plus a possible post-doc for another year, I could only then start to look for employment opportunities (which job-holding Ph.D. researchers have said are still very competitive). To top it off, I don't like the project I'm working on and have taken all of the computer science-related courses available to me at the graduate level in the program I'm in. I realized that not only do I like programming, I'm good at it. The job placement is also very attractive once you have the degree. I don't know when to tell my adviser I'm leaving the program to avoid fees for the previous semester. I want to start on the Master's degree in the Spring 2018 semester if everything goes as planned. I know I might need to look elsewhere for financial advice, but maybe there is someone out there who was in the same position I'm in now.

* I've worked through a few online courses teaching web development and python to confirm my interest.

 I have a few projects on my github account, but have no idea if it's enough to start working in any field or to even find an internship. The next step I took was to set up an appointment with a CS adviser at my university and ask about the opportunities available to me. A second bachelor's degree or a master's degree in CS (this one was strongly encouraged) were the two main options I was presented with. I could complete a Master's in CS in 2.5 years with necessary prerequisite courses finished first. So I would have to drop out of the Ph.D. program, which was fully funded, and reapply to the undergraduate program to take the prereqs. Then I would reapply as a graduate student, and with a teaching assistantship, have my attendance fees waved at the start of the second academic year. 

* As I already have one bachelor's degree, I'm not sure how much financial aid would be available to me at this time until I got to the graduate level.

 The cost of tuition for my Southern U.S. university is around $8,000 per semester for in-state students (1.5 years of prereqs during this time as an undergraduate), and after I end my TA stipend with the Ph.D. program, I would be technically unemployed. The $16,000/year amount could go significantly up when having to pay room, board, and cost of living amounts. Is there a trick to avoiding all of these fees? Should I secure a job in the CS field first and go back to school when the cost of tuition is funded by the company? Or should I secure an internship during the semester somehow to cover costs of living? My fear is completing the Master's degree with around $50-80k debt. I know that I'll enjoy working in this field ten times more than in my current field, which by itself makes this degree worth it to me, but when thinking about the student loan debt accruing, makes me second guess myself. 

* In summary, I really have no idea what I'm doing but I know I need to make a change- either here at my university or somewhere else. Any advice is appreciated."

For example, I just took the coding challenge for a big company I interned for the previous summer (non SWE) and couldn't figure out how to do Dynamic programming in time for fibonacci.

It's very simple, but I just blanked out and did the O(2^n) recursive solution, unfortunately. Things that like have really been getting to me, and being an Asian American applying to things like Google EP, etc. doesn't exactly help my case.

7846yl,0,2017-10-22,reaching for help (long i apologies),Daddy616,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7846yl/reaching_for_help_long_i_apologies/,"I'm sorry this is So long and thank you so much for looking. I need help, is there a better place to post this?

So I got myself into a very toxic situation that may have a simple answer but obviously there will be risks involved.

2004 I was 18 years old I'd grown up in the storage business with my parents as well as hotels and other management positions my parents job was to get a facility up to a percentage and then move on to the next one oftentimes with our average stay at a place for three to six months obviously without saying we were good at her job and because of that lifestyle there was no hope for a social life. Which is fine I hate teenagers anyway, always have (drama omg).

Beginning in 2004 we get a call from the management company we were working for, A storage facility that had just opened within a last month or two a couple cities away. The managers they had there had health problems and was rushed to the emergency room and unfortunately for them they needed somebody to fill in for them and since we were close and capable the management company knowing of my at the time wife and i Through The Years they offered it to us.

Went up there as a sort of temporary see how it works out type of thing lo and behold me and my at the time wife did a fantastic job and was offered a permanent position which comes with better pay all the benefits my own house free room and board and I became the site manager for a seven million dollar facility.

I started working at a very young age mom and dad were struggling but doing an awesome job as parents but hard times one after another I opted out of school too get jobs and help fend for myself in hopes of taking the load off of them didn't seem fair to me as I was a able body to just place all the burden on them.

So the job goes great except for the management company had some family disputes between themselves which often led to who's my boss today, significantly less than fun not to mention the facility was in a terrible neighborhood one of those towns that isn't full-blown ghetto but not far from.

My parents have been working with some very financially capable business smart people for probably 10 years by this time, and they had offered to my parents that they own some land in a prime location and if they can oversee the construction and run it for them so they don't have to have as much concern for it that the opportunity is theirs.

As the construction of the new facility was nearing completion my parents offered out to me and my then-wife opposition making near the same amount of money and the house was to supposed to have been built to accommodate two families what really made this tempting is it was in a much nicer area.

We'd gotten married winter of 04 and is amazing to have an job opportunity like that at such a young age. the stress that came with the depressed area was not healthy so we opted out.

Once we all had moved into the new facility we walked into more than a fair share of construction issues little did we know that there was a lawsuit pending that would take nearly 10 years to finalize.

A few months in my parents come to me and ask about hiring my aunt just as temporary to get her on her own Feet Again. Now my aunt is a user that is a coin toss above Junkie. The small town I'm from there's simply nothing there and there's no close town or opportunity to get out of the hole hence why my parents had me and we got out of there before I fell in the same line that's so many do.

As it is my mom sister and my mom being the wonderful person that she is she wanted to make the attempt to lend a hand for her sister to get out of the hole. My aunt worked as a part-time position at our last facility that's my parents facility and it wasn't great it was extremely stressful my father and I regretted it immensely she pushed us apart and cause so much stress and drama I don't even know where to begin.

We seen our new facility as sort of the Holy Grail at the end of a very painful Journey.

We left my aunt at the last facility in hopes that a sort of peace offering to get her off of our conscience of here here's a job it runs very well your task here are very simple take payments make sure they place is swept done very very simple nearly any capable body could do.

So we felt good we didn't throw her out we didn't turn away we just moved on and wasn't our problem anymore.

Silly me silly us as we had a assumed would happen not a few months later she got fired.
 if you were to assume narcotics and absence from the position you would be correct it's as simple as the facility we left being so easy to run because of the work we had put in way,
 too much time in your own head and when you have a certain type of History it often repeats itself.

So now my parents asked me how I feel how I feel if they give her a temporary job. Now I feel great for a moment I feel very validated not that my parents don't respect me but they still are my parents and and it feels nice to have your opinion validated and respected and showed that it means something that's human right? Well I told them it was a terrible idea and a very respectable way I simply reminded them the stress that we went through with her both personally and as an employee and regardless of my please they kept reassuring me that it would only be temporary.

 I knew better, as wonderful as my parents are,   enabling is definitely a problem and I told them so again, respectively that no, it will not be a temporary thing it will be a stressful thing that will tarnish if not end what is supposed to be our light at the end of the tunnel. And to No Surprise a month or so later she moves in with us makes a makeshift bedroom behind our couch between the couch and the wall in this terribly awkward spot in our living room and feels that she can live there indefinitely.

That's terribly uncomfortable now you have three managers Under One Roof, one that's failed miserably, one that's fresh or rather two that's fresh my wife and I, and two that are veterans. If any of this seems uncomfortable or awkward you couldn't be more correct.

She ends up getting offered a more full-time position so she could hopefully move out and get her own place, along with this for years my mother had kept leaving newspapers with classifieds on the desk for when she walk in and always constantly be suggesting somewhere else to work some other opportunities that may be better for her.

This is yet another reason why personally I hate hints I hate subtle motions I can't stand it if you have something to say say it respectively before it turns into an argument and then there's hate that just as always seems simple to me.

So this goes on I being the experience one second to my parents get more experience with tech Savvy and more new age style business lead me to be nearly constantly cleaning up my aunt's mess and you can only imagine the arguments between me and my parents/bosses of me questioning her position there as an employee.

Towards the last few years it got to the point to where she would sit and bad talk my parents who is also her boss obviously and I could only endure that for so long.

One day without her knowledge I made a recording of some of the key phrases and arguments she had against them, granted I sort of provoked her to release certain information and by no means by force I was simply just stirring the pot.
 I did this because I wanted my parents to understand why there had been times in the past where I just simply stopped talking to her for months at a time; which obviously makes it very awkward as we work together.

After having made the recording I waited for the opportune moment to go to my parents and say this is why I will not be talking to her anymore and this is why I have been for years plea’ing for you to do the right thing and fire her.

This wasn't even bitter at the time, please realize that it had been approximately 8 years that I had been cleaning up often the same mess time after time of this bad employee it wasn't something new or sprung on there was no hate involved here just yet. Obviously it made for a very hard situation between my parents who are also my boss as I had seen this train coming as soon as they had mentioned that they wanted to hire her temporarily I knew then and no matter how much I plead it still happened.

So I found the time to play the recording for them and I just said I'm sorry I cannot sit down there with someone who is a very recognizably bad employee; who makes a lot more work then she's worth, who is terribly incompetent anyway and again please note at this point I am not bitter I've been trying to amend and repair and teach and be an example so there wouldn't be this turmoil because I knew that no one was going to Prevail from it in a positive manner.
 but after eight years of the same stuff incompetent is precisely the most accurate word to describe this.

I played the recording to my parents and were both slightly shocked yet not surprised, like realizing it IS as bad as it sounds, my dad wasn't as surprised my mom was all kinds of angry.
 I'm sitting there not being an ass hole not screaming, how much I, “told you so” I'm just sitting there pointing out the reason why I am deciding to never talk to her again.
 obviously to some degree I would have to but it will only be two communicate involving the job and even then my conversation with her will be as short yet as professional as it can be.

I simply couldn't sit there day after day anymore and listen to her say these terrible things about my parents, my boss’s who I respect or listen to how ugly of a person she is in general.

Once my mother had brought to the attention of the landowners the people who sign all of our checks that we needed to Let Her Go, by whatever coincidental timing that is the forces against me in life, they asked us to hold off until after the lawsuit has ended with the construction company that built the facility, their concerns obviously were any liability or information that could come out sideways to complicate things.

On a side note I did the majority of the punch lists during the finalization of the construction and the repairs are needed to be done after construction was allegedly finalized and still and very curious as to why they are so afraid of a lawsuit.

It is obvious that between my decision to never talk to her again and I'm sure the altar conversation between the landowners and her, she either took the hint if she somehow didn't blatantly find out that she was on The Chopping Block because we were her new Target and when I say this woman is good at manipulation I mean she is very good at manipulation if you have experience with Junkies who fall in and out of rehab I'm sure you will understand what I'm implicating.

So she spends the next two or three years fighting for her job and making everyone else looked as bad as she is. So much so that she had weaseled her way into where the landowners had requested my mother and father not to fire her indefinitely also what has made it personally so stressful is I am her main focus of hate more than likely because come to find out that she buys her narcotics from is a guy that I used to live with and because she knows that I know that, well when you're fighting for yourself yeah I don't think I need to explain it further.

(for the record i don`t even drink)

I feel really that she really has us cornered here in the fact that we have three landowners here one as a silent owner, one who is a primary owner that has referred to this facility as his wife's little project, interesting little 15 million dollar project if you ask me but I'll never know what it's like to be rich I guess so anyway my point was that is, the wife comes across as very sheltered or at least naive for one reason or another and it is very obvious she has been fortunate enough to never have had to deal or associate at any extent with someone who not only is been so manipulative but so manipulative for these reasons and this is a very obvious dynamic and for the evil party here it is working perfectly for her as if it's play-by-play laid out.

I have now been “written up” on three different things all of which I have proved my innocence on yet still I get this phone call from the head boss the husband in the matter stating that if my name comes up again I am fired…
 in this 45 second conversation I had the opportunity to say hello, that's it…
I know that I have done none of these things that I've been accused upon, for that matter I have proven myself innocent on all of the things I've been accused of, and he has recognized that, yet I am still getting told this.
 so I am sitting here feeling very helpless because all I'm doing is showing up and doing my job and the things that I'm getting written up for or whatever are things that I'm typically not even a part of.

Okay little family background now I am the father of two beautiful children that I would do anything for my wife astounds me every day she is so beautiful and she's so strong she is so smart I admire her so much she is only a semester or so away from having her pick of a position in a medical field Be it RN or nurse practitioner in a few more semesters, already has her medical assistance license her phlebotomy license etc etc she is a very qualified person and we're trying to hold on just so she can get out of school and walk into a career that pays so we can not be struggling so hard on just my income. It seems far too scary to not attempt to hold on to this because it becomes way too easy to find a job that can pay your bills but leave you for how much longer of our children you need us most.

And then there's my parents I love them so much they're so strong and so many ways but their health suffers my dad suffered a massive heart attack at the age of 32 broken ankle that will never heal list of health problems in general one of which is crippling anxiety and of course with that he always get depression when I say crippling anxiety I mean there will be months at a time that he doesn't leave the house the emotional toll that takes on his family is excessive. And there's my mom who is all heart and love her so much she's such a wonderful person her physical ailments of having a back disease which I can never remember the name of degenerative disc disease I know she got that one as well was in multiple very tragic car accidents one that threw her out of the car Landing in a pit full of sod cut up tree and of course she landed on her back so she's kind of a mess as an employee around here this facility has been something that I've been apart of since before it began and I had pride in that and because the position that I'm in here and the control that I do have that is slowly slipping away because of all of this for me to go to work I don't just do my job I take on their responsibilities as well because well I can I have a laundry list of my own health problems starting it working at such a young age have shattered right knee 11 broken bones in my right foot stress fractures in my left foot fractures in my right hip and lower back problems that I still have mail to identify not to mention recently coming out with a newfound stomach disease that leaves me bedridden. But it's who I am that as long as I can fight I will fight and what I'm saying is I do way way way more than my job entails and if another example was needed then the fact that this is a 1200 unit facility that is approximately 87% full I am the only one that works both the office and the grounds. To put that in perspective I have to be involved with every individual customer's contract when it's rented can you imagine the traffic of a 1200 unit facility in one day? That is a lot of possible things to go wrong and guess what they do.

At this point I don't know how to emphasize how dire this is to me, the stress from this work and all things related has taken a very hard impact on my current wife a mother of my children and our relationship my mom gives emails and phone calls from the owner said leave her hysterical and oftentimes the wife owner will call and it is very obviously harassment as she will scream at my mother over the phone.

My dad threw the stress goes through bouts where he refuses to eat and zup getting very sick and obviously with his existing health issues it sends us all into a panic.

I'm not exaggerating and you never know how real this is until it happens to you but now I can literally step into my office and become nauseous instantaneously for quite a while I thought it was the stomach disease as it came about as soon as everything else around here Gotten noticeably worse.

I know I need to quit I know we all need to quit But here's why I haven't yet.

This job allows me to be closer to my family I have turned down higher-paying jobs But The fact is that I despise the monetary system don't get me wrong I'm not naive I am very aware of the fact that the dollar bill was to cease to exist at this planet would stop turning. However When My daughter Use the bathroom by herself for the first time I can run upstairs and go high five her.

I can take an extra power off during the middle of the day and go watch my son play baseball.

Right now I'm currently enrolled in college myself I'm taking 3 classes as well I am going to the National Academy of sports medicine I'm on the road to become not only a certified personal trainer but more importantly to be able to work with injured people and also beyond that my first degree will be in nutrition followed by dietitian which then I can start working for a hospital while I finish out school to become a full-on physical therapist and if I can tolerate any more school after that I would like to go into biomedical. This is a field I feel very confident in very interested in all of these subjects days or what I do in my spare time I love it I live it what else do I say the point is that where I'm working right now gives me the opportunity to pursue these goals.

If I was to leave the things that I do as an employee around here to compensate for my parents illnesses or health holdbacks whichever you'd like to call them cannot be asked of average employee and in good conscience I can't leave them to deal with it themselves because I know that they would force themselves to do it and that's just going to take time out of their life time that they could be spending with their grandkids my children also the hard times that we've been through together I understand that they are my parents it is not my desire to live underneath of them but I also will not leave them alone in a sinking ship.

With their health and mind it is seems nearly impossible to find a job that they would be best suited for, my mom maybe my dad however with the anxiety issues and the depression I don't know. And as I was saying in the beginning of all this we left all of our family behind because my hometown there is just nothing positive there drugs and alcohol and lowlife losers and just nothing positive. So if we were to get fired my parents would have literally no where to go.

About 5 years ago my parents for the first time in their lives were actually at a point to where they could start having a savings and putting away things for a retirement and coming from where we come from and how we came to be this was such an amazing moment for all of us and then as our luck would have it someone stole a car from us stole almost everything of value from us and drove us into $20,000 worth of debt.

So here we are stuck, if I get fired which is extremely likely that any given moment for who knows what reason. Then at least I would have a place to be however having my own health issues I have no idea what I would do for work I have no idea how to Market myself obviously I'm capable but I am simply so paranoid of what would happen if I took the step little own to figure out how to take the stuff what's the best direction to step in Etc obviously I'm going to have to drop more than likely all of the classes I feel like I couldn't even put on a resume the stomach disease realistically it doesn't happen that often but would you hire someone for a somewhat dignified position knowing that there may be weeks at a time where they just can't show up?

Another benefit of being here that if that does happen I can still do some filing and some managerial work to justify a paycheck from my house. A paragraph I can't leave my parents I know that they will work harder than they should because that's who they are not only will the health told I will take on them but these people no longer deserve that effort from them.

I don't know what to do I want out so bad I can't stand it, I find myself looking without looking if that makes any sense for any other work and the area for an opportunity I am after all very well connected in the community. I run a local charity here that I do on my own spare time not that I have any, twice a year I get between 5 to 10000 cubic feet of supplies to disperse out to Foster families crisis centers Etc not to mention reaching out to individuals as well that are in need our focus is children and our County it's all local I've been part of the active 20-30 International and am still good friends and fact the only reason that I'm not still with them is if I have any spare time I give it to the charity intern in their spare time they give it to me. I am also very very involved with Rotary International as they are myself.

I've never had to make a resume before my work has always shown itself and I believe it still could. And the idea of marketing myself seems terrifying even if I did know how. How do you know what is a good position I've been a facility manager of a 14 million dollar facility for 12 years and before that I was a facility manager of multimillion-dollar facility for about a year before that I did a lot of Warehouse a lot of delivery a lot of customer service and a lot of inventory.

How do you know your monetary work is $30 an hour too little is $50 an hour too much I have no idea I know I'm not compensated nearly enough for what I do around here if not for my responsibilities alone as I said before I do above and beyond my responsibilities for both personal reasons and honestly that's just who I am if I'm going to do a job I'm going to do it correctly I want what I do to speak for itself I hate the idea of failure I can't stand the term good enough I want to be the one who teaches the next guy how to do it after all to learn is to teach right?

The end is any minute now and I am as fearful as I am sick of it. I feel as if I cannot abandon my parents and let them sink with this ship and then have nowhere to go.

My wife wants me to stick it out with school and trust me I see how that can be beneficial in the end obviously but right now I don't know she wants me to take advantage of this opportunity as long as I can but the reality is it is far too obvious to me the toll at this is taking on our relationship and I'm not about to be having my kids have divorced parents cuz I'm not about to not wake up and have my kids not be in the Next Room that's not a thing and it never will be.

I'm sure there are some obvious answers here and I want to hear them however please understand the pressure that is in the situation from every angle I need help I don't know what to do."

The most advanced projects I've done were class projects where I implemented data structures to do various tasks, but nothing really beyond that. I only have vaguely relevant work experience. Not feeling super hopeful about internships for next summer. Even if I manage to get an interview, I haven't practiced CTCI or leetcode at all, and frankly, I don't feel like rushing to practice when it's unlikely that I'll even get interviews.

I'd ideally like to go into game or VR development. These kind of jobs are very portfolio-focused, and generally demand a good amount of relevant work experience for even entry-level jobs. 

I'm thinking of taking a semester or year off from school to build up a portfolio, practice coding questions, go to hackathons, etc. It would also give me more time for internships. 

I do have some concerns, one of which is about falling into depression from social isolation during this time (although I'm no social butterfly in school). I'm also a bit concerned about whether employers would care about the time off (although I doubt they will).

Has anyone done something like this? Any advice?"

I'm thinking that if I start a company now (with a concept I'm super passionate about) I might be able to make a side hustle and get some exp, hopefully 2 years. I'll try to integrate testing/agile practices too so that if I'm asked about it I can be up to speed. I'll also try to learn system design as that seems to be something asked about quite often to seniors. 

I would sacrifice graduating early but I think it would be worthwhile. I just see how competitive getting internships/junior lvl offers is and how general salaries are starting to lag and I don't want to be as affected.

Looking for advice on how to decide what to do.,cs123567,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/786g32/nervous_about_rejecting_a_return_offer_looking/,"I've interned 3 times at the same company and I have a full time offer deadline this week. I'm applying to graduate school and my recruiter told me that if/when I get into grad school and I've accepted this offer it will be converted to an internship offer. However, after being at the company for 3 summers I've been unable to transfer teams and I'm worried about getting stuck. It makes it much worse that this is a well known company and a competitive offer so I'm doubting my gut instinct about not liking it there. It's difficult to nail down exactly what I don't like. The culture seems to revolve around what a great place it is to work in a weird corporate-Kool-aid way that is very off putting. There is a lot of politics which also bothers me. There are individuals that I like but many people come off a bit fake. Additionally, many, possibly the majority of, interns come from wealthy families and they act like it. This has led me to feel very out of place. On the technical end there are mountains of tech debt, and lack of obvious best practices; especially things like continuous integration and documentation. For example, my team exists to essentially do infrastructure surgery which acts as a band aid until a real solution comes along to solve scaling problems. In this case comes along means in as many as 4 years and it's been that far out for as long as I've been here. It's hard to tell to what degree these things are normal and whether I just need to learn to live with them because you can't always like everything about your job.

I'm also afraid that after turning this offer down I won't find anything better or will have to settle for something worse than this offer. Ideally I'd like to do a research internship but I know I'll have trouble finding one as a graduating senior. Even disregarding money, it would be disappointing to take a less challenging internship than I would have had here because I'm having trouble interviewing and end up somewhere lower profile after widening my net. Not that non-research wouldn't be challenging, just that it would be a bummer to get stuck doing test automation because it's better than nothing.

On top of this I almost feel guilty (and sort of pretentious) having this internal conflict because I know how hard people work to get one of these offers and I'm afraid to squander an opportunity.

At the end of my internship both of the last two summers I talked with other interns about how we really wanted to be somewhere else but feared not getting another offer on time. We learned that upwards of 80% of the interns take the return offer and it's frightening to realize that many of us would likely come back even though we would rather be somewhere else. I'm not sure how much of this is just lack of expertise or how to determine that.

FWIW, the offer is ~125k in SF plus a signing bonus, relocation, healthcare, 401k match, etc. From talking to other interns this is the standard new grad offer this year for this company. I'd likely get an hourly rate of ~45 if I get in grad school and convert to an intern. The company employs 25k+ people and they're growing. I definitely expect them to continue doing well financially. This really makes me doubt my desire to turn this down and wonder whether I'm being naive.

TlLDR: Big offer makes me scared to reject even though I don't really like it there. I'm also nervous about ""downgrading"" and feel pretentious even saying that. I need help getting perspective.

How would everyone approach this decision?"

For example I see them joking with someone, and when they look at me, their smile disappears into a feeling of discomfort. 

I'm not a guy with a lot of social skills. So, I'm kind of the awkward guy to begin with. But my facial expressions don't seem to help either. I don't know whether it is my discomfort that is very visible that gives other people discomfort. With some people I even feel it in my chest stiffening/not breathing that easily anymore.

But I don't feel this way with people I know a little better. It is only with colleagues (at my internship) I don't know that well or strangers.

789nn8,1,2017-10-23,How much does GPA matter when getting your first internship or job?,gisellasaurus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/789nn8/how_much_does_gpa_matter_when_getting_your_first/,"I'm taking 5 courses this semester, and if I take 5 every semester until Winter 2019, I'll graduate in that semester (so a total of 4 semesters, including the current one).

While I'm floating at around a B average (I think, I may have an A or A- for a couple of courses), it's getting a little difficult to manage all these assignments. I'm sure if I sat down and read the textbook and practiced, I'll be able to get it eventually, but my assignments do require a lot of thinking, and there's so many, I can't seem to finish them at the level I want them to be (ex. I'll miss coding a couple of conditions). I'm noticing a big dip in quality code, and as a result, I'm starting to get C's.

My question is, should I settle for a lower GPA and push to finish in two years? Or extend to another semester so I can raise my GPA? Another thing to note is that this is my second degree, so while I'm enjoying my classes, and want to finish my school, I'm also kind of itching to leave school so I was kind of hoping to leave in two years.

A summer semester also isn't possible - I want to spend that time trying to get an internship, and from what I've heard from other students, the computer science courses at my university cram all the assignments and coursework into one month, which won't help my GPA at all."

I created a post a few weeks ago detailing applicants and the interview process for a junior dev role we had at our company.

We recently went through the process again, but this time for a the role of junior  front end developer.

I was once again asked to help out with the process. This role was vacant as the previous developer who had 3/4 years experience had left. I felt this role should have been filed by someone with similar experience but the company isn't willing to pay enough for a intermediate developer. 

Hope this helps someone.
- around 200 applicants over 14 days.
- around 100 are good applicants, have a background in CS I.e have a cs degree or experience or both, location close to our office/ willing to move immediately etc
- phone interviewed 15 candidates that had some experience in front end development. General questions about what they did , telling them about the role etc
- Around 10 chose to continue/i felt was worth continuing with.
- My manager made an offer to the third candidate he interviewed. We did not ask any alg/ds questions. But have them a laptop and an hour to complete a basic front end page and ask any questions they had. All 3 we interviewed finished within 15 to 20 minutes. The candidate my manager chose had an interest in design, Photoshop etc and had worked at a digital design shop as an intern.

The main skills needed for this role is CSS/JavaScript and liasing with the brands/marketing/design department internally.

Any questions feel free to ask."

78ajo1,3,2017-10-23,Something's got to give...,Ubercrazyman,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/78ajo1/somethings_got_to_give/,"It's time for a change, and I'm looking to all you fine computer people for what you think it should be! I apologize in advance, as this may be a bit of a rant.

I've been working at a healthcare consulting firm for 2 1/2 years as a Junior Support Services Specialist (mostly helpdesk work). I was originally a paid intern here. I then interviewed for a Systems Administrator position, but after some silliness in the hiring process, my title was changed twice (lowering my salary each time) to something they felt more closely ""matched my qualifications."" 

Without getting into too much detail, let's just say there's been a number of things that have happened at this place that have really bothered me. The first of which happened on the very day I was hired full time after my intern position. The hourly rate for me they finally settled on after dilly-dallying with the title changes was something like $14.16 (can't remember the exact number, I think it was close to that though). It struck me as odd that it was such a specific number, so I playfully asked, ""Why $14.16?"" My boss interpreted it as me asking, ""Why ONLY $14.16?"" Without skipping a beat, he replies with, ""Because we know you'll take it."" I was speechless...I felt like I had just gotten slapped in the face. He looked me right in the eye and told me that they had gone through all the silliness of lowering my position and salary twice because they knew I would take the lower salary. It was blatantly disrespectful and unprofessional, and to this day, it STILL bothers me. 

This is the first of many things about this company or the management itself that has rubbed me the wrong way. The longer I work here, the more I learn. The more I learn, the less great this place seems. I like most of the people that work here. This company strives to hire wonderful people for most positions. The management is the main issue. It's where all the things that bug me originate from. 

So, between corrupt and unethical business practices and the fact that I'm being paid well below the average for my position, staying here doesn't sound all that great. Plus, I'm not sure I'm even enjoying helpdesk work anymore. I don't look forward to coming into work like I used to. Our IT department consists of myself and one other person who acts as a Systems/Network Administrator. That's two people in IT for a group of companies containing roughly 150-200 employees. They refuse to hire more IT, and the reason why is another lengthy rant in itself, so I won't get into it.

There are a few compelling reasons to stay here. One is of course how nice most of my coworkers are. Another is their tuition reimbursement program. Once you've worked here for at least a year, they'll compensate you for up to $2,000 of your tuition each semester (or maybe each year), which is pretty sweet. I haven't used that yet, though.

So, I suppose my question is simply this: what should I do? I've got an associate's degree of applied science from majoring in computer programming at a technical college (five months as a developer for my state government), two years of experience fixing computers from vocational school in high school plus the two and a half years of experience from working at this job. I have no certifications, though I have been eyeballing the A+ and Network+ certs for the past couple of years. I just haven't gotten them yet.

Should I stay here a bit longer despite the bitterness I hold toward this place and pick up some certs and perhaps take advantage of their tuition reimbursement program? Or should I book it out of here and find something else?"
78aoxm,1,2017-10-23,Internship vs continuing the job search?,SnakeEyes2114,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/78aoxm/internship_vs_continuing_the_job_search/,"TL;DR - Is it worth taking an internship offer I have at $15/hr to break into web development, or would I be better served continuing to look for a full front end engineer role?

Background: I am mostly self taught when it comes to development. I have a degree in biomedical engineering but taught myself enough programming to start working at a large healthcare software company (yes, THAT one that hires everyone right out of college and has a large turnover rate) as an integration engineer. So I've got some server side development experience through my current job as well, but will be leaving in November.  I would consider myself qualified for front end engineer positions, probably at a junior level. 

I recently applied and was denied for a full stack engineer position (I thought they had a front end opening, but turns out that was a miscommunication on a friend of mine's part who works there as a content writer), however after learning how much I'm self taught and how quickly I've learned, they came back to offer an internship at $15/hr. 

I'm strongly considering this since I would really like more hands on experience and the opportunity to learn more about how web development is done in the real world. Additionally, there is the possibility to get some full stack experience and possibly graduate from an intern to a fully salaried employee ""eventually"". I haven't discussed what ""eventually"" would mean exactly yet. 

However, I'm wondering if I'm selling myself short and should keep looking for an engineering position rather than jumping at the internship offer. 

Has anyone here dealt with a similar circumstance before or have any recommendations on whether this would be a smart or dumb career move?"

Somehow, I am the most experienced and qualified person on this software. Both on paper and experience. IDK how that happened, but in team discussions, senior devs my team just hired will overrule me, have a 10 minute argument and then come to the conclusion that I was right. 

I was explaining how a component of the software worked (I was specifically asked) and someone on the team said ""Oh an intern teaching us subject matter experts how the software works."" 

We were having a 2018 planning session. I contributed 3/4s of the items we are going to focus on for 2018, but all of my suggestions were put down, until my boss stepped in and said they were good ideas. Then suddenly the senior devs got onboard. 

Both of the things big ticket items we want to finish and deploy by the end of Q1 are my ideas. They will be showed off to the CTO... 

My team just doubled in size and we hired a bunch of senior devs and engineers and they all look down on me, solely because of my age. I contribute a lot to the team.

78de9l,3,2017-10-24,"[x-post from /r/academia, Rant/Advice] Errors on my qualifying exam, possible politics, feeling lost",Failinggradstudent,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/78de9l/xpost_from_racademia_rantadvice_errors_on_my/,"I was accepted into a prestigious PhD program, and I feared it might be hypercompetitive, so I did ask about retention rate when I toured. I was assured that every student was accepted because the department intended to fund and graduate them. There was no cut-off due to competition within a class of entering students for advisers/funding.  

Upon matriculation, I learned that usually about 50% of each incoming class is culled involuntarily. The quals have no set passing score, no grading rubric, and very few students pass on their first attempt (less than half of my entering class). On my final attempt, I studied from sunup to sundown for months. I’m confident, even now, that I knew the material. 

This year, though, there were several blatant typos on the exam I took (in my field this would gravely affect the question and solution), and I failed. I appealed on the basis that I made ~90% on the questions without typos, but the opinion of the department was that I should have figured out the intended question on context. Many other students had my same confusions, but received closer to ~100% on the rest of the question, or managed to see past some of the typos. The (carefully worded) response I got on my appeal implies my master’s is in jeopardy if I fight them on this further. 

I know some programs have lower retention rates than others, but it’s especially upsetting they blatantly misled me about this when I toured. And this year felt especially political. 

Possible Politics:

1.) This year I chose to get a letter from disability services requesting additional time due to medication I take that can cause me to lose track of time. The other student who had additional time also failed (very likely a coincidence)

2.) Many of my score sheets were missing. Usually several professors grade the exam, but I only received one graded copy. There’s no comments on my exam either, only scores, which is highly unusual (in previous years there was always written commentary). I fear there is some covering up happening, and that the other graders failed to submit their feedback. 

3.) The one copy I received was graded by a professor who, for reasons I don’t understand, thinks very little of me. She also has strong opinions about things like disability accommodations. As a whole, the department seems to bear me no ill will (at worst a nonchalance), but they have a vested interest in keeping it a secret if she was the only grader. 

4.) My adviser is moving departments, and I'm early enough in my career that we could not complete our project remotely. He announced his leaving a little before my exam. 

My options: 

1.) Leave and say nothing. 

2.) I could speak discreetly to the Dean of Graduate Studies or maybe Office of Disability Services. I don’t want to escalate the issue at this time, but if this is a repeated pattern (especially for students with additional time), perhaps there should be some record of it for those who enroll after me. 

3.) There is one sympathetic professor who took my side when my appeal was brought up at a department meeting.  I could speak with him. He is close to retirement and has a reputation for playing no politics. I mostly suspect he would just give very honest advice about my career, and may have some suggestions for new departments. 

The Immediate Future Plan:

Regardless, I get a master’s. 

I was fortunate to secure an internship a few summers ago at a very research-oriented industry position. I loved it there, and they really liked my work. When I told them my adviser was moving and that the new program isn’t a good fit, they offered to take me on and set me up on a path to a new program (many people in this company have PhD’s, close academic relationships, and they publish often). 

My adviser also said I have an open spot at his new department, even if I choose to take some time off for industry. He also offered to write me a letter for other programs if I choose. For various reasons, I’m leaning towards applying to other programs. 
I’m not sure how to navigate the fact I failed out of my first program due to quals. It won’t be blatant on my transcript, although it will be obvious I entered as a PhD student. I intend to say “I left because my adviser moved and no one else was a good fit. He entered a program that was also not a good fit.” That being said, I don’t intend to lie if asked specifically about quals. 
Overall, I’m not sure how things will look on the other side of the table applying to programs. Will publishing papers in the next year or so help? Is my only hope for a PhD to stick with the old adviser? Is there hope of overlooking my past if I meet potential advisers personally at conferences or through connections at the industry job?

Tl;dr: Department made an exam with typos. I failed it and they denied my appeal. Some shady things happened. Should I seek to put this on record (anonymously) with the university in case it’s a repeated pattern? Moving forward, what advice can you give to minimize the damage this does to my career if I want to continue in academia at another department? "

I'm a sophomore in college who was on track for biochem. I am taking a CS course right now and am absolutely loving it. It's something that really makes me want to work hard and go above and beyond on the assigned projects. 

I am really considering dropping biochem all together and going for CS. I'm worried that I will be very behind on the internship game however, and was wondering if you guys and girls had tips for finding summer internships (preferably paying something) that require little experience. 

The class I'm taking is in java and I will take at least another course next semester. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Relevant info:

I live in New England so I would prefer it be in this area.

I know java from the class and will learn more of it next semester.

I go to an Ivy League School if that matters, and the course will have me have a nice little portfolio of projects (all games). I'm going to go really hard on my final project and make it look nice.


Thanks!"

I’ve just recently found this sub. I’m currently at a community college in California looking to transfer next year. One of the colleges that I’m looking at has a co-operative education program where you get a paid internship that counts for credits. I did a bit of research and it turns out that Microsoft offers internships out of their office in Ireland. I figured I could do this, go back to the college and take Game Design courses, and then go back to Microsoft Ireland and work for them on the Havok Game Physics Engine.

I’ve always wanted to travel to Europe or some other place. Lately, my parents have been causing me a lot of stress. It’s not just lately, though; it’s been building up for over 10 years. Not only that, but I want out from America simply because the American society just isn’t for me.

Anywho, I have a general, broad, and basic understanding of how visas work (and in any case, I’m supposed to take an extra class before entering into an international internship that would teach me what I needed to know). A) Could this work? B) I would want to bring a couple of musical instruments (like a cello or a keyboard). How difficult/costly would that be?

Edit: Probably should have said this before, but I guess it was inferred. Just in case you need to know, my major is Computer Science. I am an undergraduate student in my second year of college. I’ve worked a little bit with Unreal and Unity, as well as trying to use another engine called OGRE to make my own game."

I am just pissed and need this off my chest

It all started January of this year. On New Year’s Day  my boy friend of a year broke up with me. Then a week later I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. An incurable autoimmune disease that causes a lot of shit, pain, and frustration. I started a high dose of steroids and that really messed me up. Finally got off of them. In June my best friend and support system of 6 years decided to stop talking to me. All because his girlfriend said he had too.

I started school in August, and was put on new medications that are both very strong and an immunosuppressants. And I moved back into a dorm  for my sorority with my good friend. Then in September my mom was diagnosed with stage three cancer. My sister became even more depressed than she already was and it’s my job to take care of them, because I have to be the stable one. 

Now I feel like I’ve had the final straw that’s going to break the camels back. My roommate is toxic. She’s rude and aggressive. She has no empathy for others case in point: I am awake at 8 am because she decided she had to study and turned on her light. (We have a study room on the hall). She continues to say degrading things to me and other people in my organization. She leaves food and dirty dishes around. She never cleans. It can be 1 am and she will come in and turn her light on and wake me up. Yes I’ve talked to her 5 times about it and she remains firm on the fact that she doesn’t care that it wakes me up. 

With my Crohn’s it causes extreme fatigue (I need 10+ hours of good sleep to function or I get even sicker). I live in pain, cramps, bathroom, or bad joint pain. Sleep is my safe place, when I go to sleep I can have relief from the stress and pain that is my life and it helps my body heal. 

Next week I start an internship that I need to be up at 6 am for. I need to nail this internship, but I’m so worried I’m going to get even sicker from the stress and from the pain. 

Summary: I’m single, my BFF won’t talk to me, I have Crohn’s, my family is depressed, my mom has cancer, and I’m on my last straw with my roommate.

Thanks for letting me rant. "

78frd0,0,2017-10-24,OS-Deployment.,bearwithastick,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/78frd0/osdeployment/,"Hi all,

I'm an intern at a mid-sized, rapidly growing software development company and I received the task to evaluate different OS-Deployment tools.

Now, the requirements are maybe not rock solid but include:

* Driver Injection / Hardware independent Image
* Maybe some sort of App-Deployment / Client Management
* Driver Packages
* If possible, support for Mac OS X Sierra deployment

Did I understand this correctly? You either have Cloning, with a 1:1 copy, or imaging. Almost every damn OS-Deployment tool does imaging, right? Question is, if you always have to re-image your master client if you need to do updates or if you can deploy these updates separately? That would be another requirement.

Now, I already have WDS/MDT on my wishlist, the other was FOG project. I kicked FOG again because to my knowledge, a real hardware independent image is only possible with some tweaking over post-install scripts?

To be honest, I have no fucking clue on what some good criterias are for OS Deployment tools. Do you have any other suggestions for criterias, or could you correct the ones I already have? And if you still have the patience, point me to some other strong OS-Deployment tools, maybe with some arguments to why you recommend that tool? 

I almost went crazy finding information on those godawful vendor websites.

Thank you very much!"
78g9yz,8,2017-10-24,Should I stop going to college?,modileraka,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/78g9yz/should_i_stop_going_to_college/,"A little about me first. I am 17 years old freshmen studying Computer Science in an average college. I know a few programming languages well enough (Python, Rust, JavaScript and some other small languages not mentioning here) to write code that helps solve real-world problems. I own a couple of repositories, few of which are a bit popular and have contributed to some major open-source projects on GitHub, something which I am quite satisfied about. In my free time, I involve in Q&amp;A sites like StackOverflow or help people solve technical issues in some or other form.

But here's the deal, since I started college, I don't think I've learn anything valuable in these 3 months. I get no time to maintain my own projects or learn other things I find interesting. Being a day scholar, I spend 9+ hours everyday from catching the bus till returning home. Not to mention the load of homework assignments, practical files and exams they put on us just about everyday (I am serious). I don't find anything that helps me look forward to attend college. At the moment, some of the things we are taught about are electrical motors, lasers, atoms. Most of which I don't think will ever help me. Stuff like this seriously makes me cram the day before exam and forget everything later on.

I've always wanted to learn more about machine learning and other phenomenal stuff in Computer Science. Even though I'll need maths as a per-requisite but I believe one can always learn anything when needed, instead of learning something and then looking for a way to put that knowledge to use.

In a nutshell, I don't find going college worth it. Should I stop going and put money to better use or is it that I am just being stupid? If leaving college might sound a better option, would my dev profile help grab interesting internships or a full-time job or should I just open-source more and gather knowledge by myself for the time being? Although, My parents won't easily agree for a drop but just in case life get unbearable.

78hqgw,0,2017-10-24,An Open Letter to Misogynists,openletterbird,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/78hqgw/an_open_letter_to_misogynists/,"Today, an upper year told me that he read something that members of /r/uwaterloo were [discussing on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/78hea9/tfw_youre_a_woman_in_cs/) He said that you’d been discussing WaterlooWorks, and who had gotten which interviews. And when someone mentioned that one of your female students had gotten a particular interview, one of you said, “Well, she got it because she’s a girl.”

To the people who have said this — and trust me, I know quite well that there were more than a few of you — you know who you are. To the people who have thought it but not said it out loud: this post is for you too.

I am disappointed in you.

I don’t consider myself a particularly outstanding software engineer by any means. But I’m very good at what I do, foster an intuition that helps me adapt to situations quickly, and have a personality that makes me easy to collaborate and work with. With hard work, panicked late night interview practice, hours spent on resumes and projects to fill them, and throwing myself into every co-op that I’ve had, I’ve been very successful in this field. I’ve worked with a startup, done a co-op in SF, and spent the last three co-ops of my school career with big tech companies (Facebook and Google) working on high-impact user-facing projects.

And every single co-op cycle so far, I’ve been accused of getting a job or interview because of my gender.

I’m sure you meant no harm. In your mind, it all measures up: there’s no way she could’ve gotten the interview over you, since you clearly had the experience. Or at least, someone else more qualified should’ve gotten it. You didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s feelings — you’re just stating facts.

But the fact of the matter is, there is no magic quota that companies have to meet. No company would be stupid enough to hire engineers that wouldn’t be an asset to their company, or interview people they wouldn’t consider. They truly aren’t that stupid. If there was a quota, I wouldn’t be the only girl on orientation day in a room full of 30 engineering men. If there was a trend towards hiring women, I wouldn’t have had to wait 5 internships to work with another female engineer. I wouldn’t have to write posts like this.

If you’re trying to justify why someone else got the interview over you, you will supply positive reasons for guys and negative reasons for girls. Just think about it. When was the last time you said that Jim must’ve got the interview because he’s a guy, or good looking, or pads his resume? You search for a technical reason (he had experience, he did a lot of extracurriculars, etc) and supplement that. But when you’re talking about your female peers, the easiest reason to find is that she’s a girl. You trivialize what she’s done. You don’t give merit to her skills, or her work. You pick what makes you feel best about yourself — justified in your own abilities, because her gender gave her a leg up.
But what you think gives girls a leg up actually just throws us down a fucking staircase. Let me explain.

For a workshop I plan to run, I wrote scenarios for attendees to act out. These are meant to help women practice what to say when they’re uncomfortable, or when they feel like they are being told that they don’t belong. And the worst thing is that when I was writing scenarios, all I had to do was write what had happened to me in my 4 years in this industry. Every single scenario, which I’ve listed with fake names at the end of this post, has happened to me personally. Each is small on their own, and many of you will actually read them and think that they aren’t a big deal. But each one happens more than once, and they all add up quickly.

Can you imagine what it’s like to be told at every possible opportunity that you don’t deserve to be here? To have your hard work undercut by disgruntled peers? You’ve all been getting interviews, and I know that feeling when you open JobMine and see that you’ve gotten one — you’re on top of the moon. What if I told you right when you got that interview, that you shouldn’t have gotten it? That you didn’t deserve it? That it was a mistake?

That is every day for a girl in our program. And you know what? Many of you will disagree, but maybe she does deserve that interview. Because after all that bullshit you say to her face, plus the shit-talking you do behind her back, she’s still here.

Don’t become the first in a long list of someone’s scenarios. Respect your peers. Grow up. Be the men you think you are. Because the sooner you stop thinking you’re better than everyone else, you can finally become the people you aspire to be.

--------------------------------------------------

SCENARIOS

1. First years Ben and Hannah are both going for the same iOS job. Even though Ben has iOS experience and Hannah doesn’t (she has other experience), she gets the interview. Ben angrily tells her that the only reason she got the interview is because she’s a girl, and he deserves the interview much more than Hannah.

2. Emma is ecstatic that she got a &lt;BigTechCompany&gt; offer! She excitedly tells her friend Alex, who congratulates her, saying, “That’s amazing! Good for you! &lt;BigTechCompany&gt; is great at diversity hires!”
Fiona is walking with her friends. Nick is talking about how he just attended a research conference, and was talking to a girl who was “way too attractive to be in CS”.

3. Claire is out for drinks with a group of acquaintances, who all happen to be male. One says that “all women are 10’s with the lights off,” and starts a round of jokes including “Don’t worry about dating tall women, because they’re all short lying down”

4. Lisa is the only girl on her team at work, and her 30-year-old single male coworker is very nice to her. She considers them good friends, but later on in the term, he starts to make excuses to touch her hand or shoulder during team lunches or when hanging out in the microkitchens. She’s a bit uncomfortable, but doesn’t know if it’s a big enough deal to bring to HR and she doesn’t want him to get in trouble.

5. Sadie is working on a Scribbler Robot group project, and is excited to learn Python. However, her all-male groupmates seem to have divided the coding up amongst themselves and left her with the report.
Riley (who has a gender-neutral name) is going into an interview with &lt;BigTechCompany&gt;, She’s very proud of her resume, which she spent a lot of time on and used to improve her design skills. When she walks in, the interviewer shakes her hand and compliments her on her resume. She says, “Thanks, I had a lot of fun making it!” The interviewer replies, “I can tell! It’s quite pretty, that’s how I could tell you were a girl.”

6. Amanda is the female lead in EngPlay, with a romantic subplot. Throughout the last performance, the audience is yelling more sexual obscenities and suggestions than for any of her fellow cast members, but she doesn’t want to stop the performance just because she’s uncomfortable.

7. Lara is dressed up in a onesie for a themed class party, with a zipper up the front. Throughout the party, the guys at the party keep pulling down the zipper to her belly button. Thankfully she wore a tank top, but is getting really uncomfortable with the behaviour.
Rachel is discussing how she thinks a TA marked her assignment unfairly. An upper-year tries to suggest helpfully, “You could always go and talk to him about it. If you batt your eyelashes and say please he’ll probably change it.”

8. Sara is working on front-end at &lt;BigTechCompany&gt;, and is killing it in her first week. She mentions to the other interns (all male, by coincidence) that she’s submitted 12 changelists in her first week, and the other interns seem surprised and impressed. As she wants to not appear to be bragging, she says “Oh, they were all UI changes though! Smaller changes.” The other interns seem less surprised now, saying, “Oh yea, that makes sense. Front end is so easy!”

9. Jessica has noticed in over the past month that none of her male co-workers in their 20’s will meet her eye when talking to her, and avoid talking to her at all if they can help it. She’s quite lonely at work, and there seems to be nobody else in the 50 person office who wants talk to her other than the lady at the front desk.
Heather has already explained to 5 people in her first week at work that she’s not in Marketing or design, she’s a software engineer. She really wants to come up with a one-liner that will end the questions once and for all.

10. Rebecca is being sent by plane on an all-expense-paid trip to the corporate office in California for a Women Techmakers conference, and is really excited! One of her teammates is obviously disgruntled saying, “I don’t see how this is relevant to your job.”

78ijva,0,2017-10-24,[Ohio] Partner started receiving increased targeted harrassment from supervisor after she learned of her disability.,OhGodsHelpHer,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/78ijva/ohio_partner_started_receiving_increased_targeted/,"Hello everyone. I'm kind of at wits end about this whole situation and was hoping to receive some input from people who know laws (and life) much better than I do.

My partner was working part time at a retail position (she had filed for disability prior, and was receiving SSI) starting in 2014-2015. She recently (within 2-3 months) started working full time at the same position and has been dealing with immense amounts of stress. 

She was in a domestic abuse case with her ex, her ex accused her of rape, and then shortly afterwards they committed suicide. Suffice to say, she has been going through an extremely emotional time, but still trying to stay strong nonetheless.

Ever since her coworker got promoted to the supervisor position, let's call her X, has begun the usual power-tripping that you see in lower managers. It seems that she has been targeting my partner specifically and it has only gotten worse recently.

Her store has a strong policy about tardiness and lateness, i.e. 7-8 ""occurrences"" = fired. She has received a second chance from (Corporate) Human Resources from having too many occurrences ***as advocated and fought for by the supervisor in question and the overall store manager/owner***. That being said, she was demoted to being cashier and ""had to prove herself"" to get back into her previous department which she was very proficient and skilled at, meeting her daily requirement. 

She currently does not have a case worker from the state, so her mother has been advocating for her in the meantime. When she was at complete risk of being fired the first time, her mother called the manager and set up an in-person meeting with the store management. At this meeting it was revealed that she has a disability that store management previously was unaware of.

From what she's told me, it appears that X's harassment has only increased since this was revealed. There have been dozens of awful comments, being scolded for the tiniest things, accused of stealing from the register, ""moving too slowly"", having saggy pants, basically absolutely anything that she could find.  
A few days ago she was cleaning the keyboard with a paperclip to occupy her time (she was working register) and X came up and told her to give her the paperclip. Supposedly, X thought that my partner was trying to open the register drawer and steal cash from it. She was pulled into a meeting today and is no longer allowed to have paperclips in her pockets.  
Another example: We attended a concert this past Friday and after telling X about it, she said to my partner ""Oh, if you're going to be late, don't even bother calling""

Obviously this is a completely toxic work environment and she needs to gtfo ASAP. From my perspective, it looks like they're trying to force her into quitting herself so they have no obligation to pay her unemployment or something. 

She wants to quit her job today, but she currently has no other source of income lined up (she is off of SSI, and actually *owes* money), no college education, no relevant trade skills. She has a lead to another retail position working overnights and is hoping to start training for a nurse-type position mid-November, however nothing is currently waiting for her.  Both of us live at our respective parents' houses, but her mother is charging rent. I currently have no income either (recently graduated college) but am interviewing for companies. The position I'm currently interviewing for is only a part-time internship so the income I will be getting won't be enough to support both of us fully. 

So.. basically, I'm completely at wits end as to what she should do. I know she needs to get out of there but I'm wondering if there's anything further that needs to be done for her. I'm honestly COMPLETELY pissed at X for her behavior towards my partner, but I will respect her decision to leave quietly if she wishes. If anyone has any advice as to what to do, even if it seems like it's completely obvious, I'd love to hear some other opinions. Thank you!"

As you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/78ajo1/somethings_got_to_give/), I've been doing helpdesk stuff for about 2.5 years. Well, I'm not so sure I'm enjoying helpdesk anymore. It may just be the environment at this place, but it winds up being frustrating and tedious rather than enjoyable anymore.

I did an internship with the college I attended, and I had a blast there. It was primarily grunt work, i.e. running cables, cable management in computer labs, imaging machines, etc. I enjoyed it though. My current position has me primarily focused on helpdesk, but I've also found myself in charge of creating domain accounts, setting up Exchange/Lync accounts and things like that. I like the account management aspect of my current job, and would like to keep that as well. It's mostly just the, ""X broke. What can you do fix it? Why did it break?"" that's been getting on my nerves as of late. I like customer service and have a good background in it, but I've found that helpdesk work isn't the kind of customer service I can enjoy for long periods of time. Again, it may just be the environment/negative views I have of this place, but it's still got me thinking. 

So, what are some positions I should consider? It's primarily helpdesk I'm wanting to avoid at this point. I'm open to any other fields, but the only ones I have experience for that I've also enjoyed are account management, hardware (building computers, messing with cables, etc.), and networking."

I currently work for an medium sized company as a help desk / junior sysadmin (I'm not actually sure what my ""official"" role is at this point) in an IT department that's mostly been started when I started and has been increasing in size since (currently 5 of us, including the intern). Our environment is currently making the switch over to office 365 and I've been given the project of removing all of the versions of office that we have (2010, 2013 and 2016 standards) to replace with 365 in our windows environment.

I'm interested in seeing how others have handled this scenario. Thus far, I've been looking into PDQ inventory for the removal process for the windows computers, and using a Munki system that I've setup for our Mac environment (I can set versions of office as a ""managed uninstall"" to remove any versions that we're moving away from, and then just put the 365 installer in the repo / manifests as a ""managed install"" to force the install when the software center is used). How would you guys manage this task for your environment? "

Ive had some interviews but only from applying from my school career site, and i have one with capital 1 for their data science position in a few weeks. Right now that's the only one that's of any decent value. I have some other companies left to apply to as well that I think I have a decent shot at but i dont want to ruin my chances.  

Anyway, since i haven't had any interview offers from any other companies ive applied to that are not directly affiliated w my school im worried that maybe my listing of my biology major is working against me because it's completely unrelated to many software and data analysis positions and maybe employers are just not attracted to it?

I have no internships because ive spent my summer doing courses and research. The research is software dev and ive been building a data vis platform with Python. 

I'll post my resume I guess but idk if that's something to consider...

78j9br,1,2017-10-24,psychology fundamentals,gorbachuck,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/78j9br/psychology_fundamentals/,"Hello UCI Redditors!

I'm a recent transfer student at UCI (this is my first quarter). I am a Psychology student looking to get admitted into to the cognitive science program. I have a few classes to finish before getting admitted into the program and I was curious if anyone has taken all the psychology fundamental classes (9A,9B,9C) in one quarter? 

I am curious of how hard it would be to take all three in one quarter. the reason for the rush is if I were to do the cog sci major I would have a lot more classes to finish (27 courses) vs. if I were to stick with just a psych major (16 courses). So I am just trying to finish as much as possible so that I will be able to graduate on time and also have some quarters where I am part time so that I have some free time to start doing internships (later in the major of course).

let me know what you guys think or if you can offer some great advice (especially on which professors to take) I would greatly appreciate it!

Thanks!"

He also mentioned that he committed solutions for any difficult problems to his Github repo to make his Github more appealing and demonstrate his ability to problem-solve to potential employers.

I just finished my first problem ([this one](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/description/)) and my solution in C++ is as follows:

    #include &lt;map&gt;
    #include &lt;string&gt;
    #include &lt;sstream&gt;

    class Solution {
        std::map&lt;int, std::string&gt; m;
        const std::string url = ""http://turl.com/""; 
    public:

        // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
        std::string encode(std::string longUrl) {
            for(int i = 0; i &lt; m.size(); ++i) {
                if(m[i] == longUrl) {
                    return std::to_string(i);
                }
            }
            int size = m.size();
            m[size] = longUrl;

            return url + std::to_string(size);
        }

        // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
        std::string decode(std::string shortUrl) {
            shortUrl.erase(0, 19);
            std::istringstream iss{shortUrl};
            int c;
            iss &gt;&gt; c;
            return m[c];
        }
    };

    // Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
    // Solution solution;
    // solution.decode(solution.encode(url));

My question is whether it was wise to use the the STL map class for my solution. 

I have two conflicting opinions that:

1. using STL doesn't improve my ability to solve this in other languages/pseudo-code nor do I gain practice implementing my own data structures, but
2. using STL is perfectly fine because it's a facet of C++. There'd be other options in other languages that could've helped me solve this problem similarly. "
78jto1,3,2017-10-24,I hate my dad and sister and literally wish I wasn't related to them. Black sheep rant incoming,whycantijustdiern,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/78jto1/i_hate_my_dad_and_sister_and_literally_wish_i/,"I fucking hate my family. I just want to be a normal human being. I want a normal family, one that loves you and has your back when you're down. Mine kicks me when I'm down (Literally, if you wanna know keep reading). 

Whenever my sister and I were at the pool, she would hold my head down underwater because she wanted me to die. 

I've wanted to die ever since I was 8. Yeah, no typo, I was eight years old when I realized I would rather DIE than live with my sister and dad. 

I came home crying because a girl bullied me at school. My sister wanted to know what happened - not because she cared but she wanted to find out what that girl said so she could hurt me more. I ignored my sister, went to the computer and logged into Maplestory to make myself feel better. I logged into my character and started walking around, thinking I could forget. Then my sister snuck up from behind &amp; gave me a swift kick to my left kidney. She knocked me out of the chair, it was that strong. I rolled over trying to get away, but I was cornered between her and the desk. She kicked me again in the same place and I cowered while she yelled at me asking why I was crying. I said it was because a girl at school called me a little freak. My sister CACKLED, said that girl was right. She then killed my character in Maplestory out of spite and left me on the ground. I was EIGHT. 

When I told my dad, he didn't believe me. I showed him the bruise and it was purple and huge. He asked my sister and she said that a girl at school had done it. When he asked me if that was true I had to say yes, because if I told the truth my sister would hurt me later. 

When I went to college, my sister made me drive the most stressful parts of LA because she hated me. My dad said it was because she loves me and wants me to learn how to drive. I know how to FUCKING DRIVE I've been driving since I was 16. 

When my sister went to college she got a FREE CAR from my dad. She had no job, no internship, she just got a free car. When I went to college, my dad said I had to EARN a car. I juggled a job, an internship, full time school, volunteer work, everything. I struggled with social anxiety. I still do. Finally I am able to afford a car of my own, but DAMN if it didn't take a long ass time. 

This is borderline suicidewatch but idc. I want to die but I'm just so angry at everyone right now. I hate that my dad clearly favors my sibling more, I hate that he always believes her over me. I hate that I am the black sheep WHEN I DON'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

I'm trying my damndest to stay alive. I'm trying my damndest. 

Meanwhile my sister has a rich husband, is buying a home soon, has a well paying job, and tons of friends. Why is this world so fucking unfair? Can't anyone see that she's a sociopath?? 

Maybe I should send her rich hubby this post and it would make him think twice. I have NEVER forgotten what she did to me and I will NEVER forget how horrible it was to grow up with her and to grow up afraid and angry and depressed/suicidal. 

And another thing THERAPY JUST DOESN'T HELP WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING YOU LEGITIMATELY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU AND AREN'T INTERESTED IN CARING. I had to talk to a therapist when I was 14 about suicidal thoughts because the school was afraid I was gonna kill myself. My dad got called from work and had to come to school. He acted all polite to the teachers but in private he was SUPER ANNOYED with me for wasting his time. I guess because money is worth more than your kid's life!! He brought me to therapy, but only the mandated amount by the school because otherwise the school would've kicked me out. It's only because it looks bad on him to have a kid in therapy, he wanted to believe that I was ""cured"". He never fucking talked to me about my depression and never gave a shit, just did the bare minimum. 

I wish I had killed myself back then just to spite them all. It would have brought so much shame on my dad. It's not like it'd make a difference to my sister anyway but I would have definitely written that she was the reason for my suicide and that would've been really shameful for her too. 

I just want to hurt them the way they hurt me, but that's fucked up and messed up because I also wouldn't want to wish this on anyone. I've tried my best to be the opposite of my sister - I want to be a NICE person who GENUINELY CARES for people but I fucking CAN'T ANYMORE.. 

I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL!!!

I am a junior CS major in college and have been interviewing with several companies for software development, security, and networking internships.  My ultimate goal is to be in the security field but I am interested in all of these fields.  I recently received two competitive offers for internships.

Company 1

- Accounting firm
- Penetration testing internship
- Smaller company

Company 2

- Bigger investment company
- Networking internship
- Possibly better long-term opportunities
- Higher pay
- Much better benefits
  - Paid housing
  - Catered breakfast and lunch

I am very torn between these two options because on one hand, I like the content of Company 1's internship much better because I eventually want to work as a penetration tester.  However, Company 2 might be a better full-time role and offers a better quality of life but I don't like networking quite as much.  Any advice or help would be appreciated."

Since these are smaller companies they seem to be at least somewhat open to negotiation for salary, even for an intern. However I've found myself in a situation I don't really know how to handle:

I have offers from A and B. I am interested in joining A but was trying to use B's offer to increase A's offer. B only made me an offer over the phone and they said they will give me an official offer when I get closer to deciding and decide to sign with them (honestly, thought this was kind of weird on B's part, they aren't really a small startup and they have a good amount of funding from top VCs, is this normal for these kind of companies?). I still told A B's salary details (and said I have an offer) and they are working on getting me a new comp package. 

What is the possibility of A asking me for documentation for B's offer? I don't really have any documentation for B's offer (but I didn't fudge the offer or anything). However, I don't think B will send me an offer until I express intent in signing, and I don't intend to go to B either way (regardless of whether A increases their offer or not). If I'm unable to provide documentation, would A rescind my offer? I'm also not comfortable giving out specific offer details or sending offer letters, since my parents who have experience in the tech industry have repeatedly told me not to do so (i.e. companies don't normally ask, and shouldn't be asking for other offer letters in their experience).

- Many countries, especially in Europe, have master’s programs taught in English, but is it advisable to stick to English-speaking companies for the purpose of getting an internship?

78lhcz,2,2017-10-25,Large Seattle company vs. medium-sized NYC company whose internship I loved (new grad--have to decide by tomorrow),studiousmaximus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/78lhcz/large_seattle_company_vs_mediumsized_nyc_company/,"Hey CSCQ,

Here's the deal: my return offer from said NYC company expires tomorrow (well, technically today - the 25th), and I just received an offer from a big, well-known company based in Seattle. I was pretty set on returning to NYC company (NYCC for short), but the big Seattle company (SC for short) offer was pretty compelling. I'd sincerely appreciate any advice regarding where I should go - this feels like a pretty momentous decision, given how different the two companies and locations are. First, the offer details.

Seattle Company

* Would work in nearby city but both team and location TBD
* 108k base
* 25k signing
* 70k stock (3.5 year vesting period)
* 0-20% yearly performance-based bonus with a new grad average of 10% (so if I'm average, would get another 11k at the end of year)
* Total first-year comp: 150-165k

NYCC (~1000 employees)

* Manhattan, NY (though I'd probably live in Brooklyn)
* 120k base
* 5k signing
* 7000 shares purchasable over four years (the company is pre-IPO, and I'm not totally sure how much this is worth. In four years it could be worth anywhere from 20-40k I'd bet, but I think this is like buying a lottery ticket - if the company continues growing rapidly, it could be worth a lot in ten years)
* Total first-year comp: ~131k (see below)

So, as far as money goes, SC wins out. I know people on here have given reasons that CoL calculators are flawed, but that's just the measure I'm working with to approximate right now. SC stock's first 25% vests in 6 months, so my first year compensation comes out to about 150k (161k if I get the average bonus). 150k in Seattle appears to translate to 190-220k in Manhattan/Brooklyn (I'm averaging a bit here). By contrast, if we value the 7000 units at 25k, the NYCC offer comes out to about 131k, which is considerably less than SC's when CoL is taken into account. This is a big point for SC, as the bonus alone could help me become free of collegiate debt.

But I really did love my internship at NYCC. I thought the people were great and made a lot of friends, a few of whom I consider really close. The work-life balance was really great, and I enjoyed what I was working on (although it was a tad dry, I learned a lot and it was ultimately rewarding).

So, a quick pro/con for each:

NYCC Pros

* Great, friendly company culture with a lot of mingling events
* Great work-life balance
* Already integrated in the community with many friends
* Awesome location in the heart of Manhattan
* Small enough to know the leadership well and understand the whole business
* Seems to be quickly growing, which could help with career mobility and makes stock seem like an exciting investment
* Average age is mid-20s, which makes for a lot of great social opportunities
* Enjoyable work with big systems

NYCC Cons

* Not the most interesting mission (advertising tech)
* Not as many options in terms of what to work on (not that many teams, and there isn't that much inter-team variation)
* Worse pay &amp; stock stuff could be a gamble
* Worse perks
* I'm not sure if I want to be on the East Coast (been here my whole life)

SC Pros

* Immense diversity in stuff to work on, and it seems like it's fairly easy to switch teams if you don't like your current one
* More impactful work in that it reaches way more people
* More inspiring overall mission than just ""ads""
* Seattle is very exciting to me, and I feel like I could see myself loving it culturally
* Fairly significantly better pay and perks
* Better name brand for future jobs (? not sure if this is necessarily a big factor)
* Easier to move to other jobs on west coast, where I think I want to end up

SC Cons

* Older crowd, seemingly more stuffy and generally less fun culture
* Could get weighed down by politics or bureaucracy
* Seems to be a higher variance in terms of team quality; I could get a really interesting, impactful team, or I could get one I hate (then again, it seems like switching really is an option)
* Don't already have friends here (though I worry I'm taking comfort too much into the equation with this; surely I'd make friends at SC, too)
Not as good work-life balance as NYCC, I'd imagine

If you read this enormous wall of text, I thank you greatly. I'm currently stressing over this decision and would love any and all help. These are two very different places, so I don't want to take this pivotal decision lightly...

TL;DR: Head (Seattle company) or heart (NYC company)?"
78lmg2,3,2017-10-25,A somewhat painful realization..,woobwoobzoob,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/78lmg2/a_somewhat_painful_realization/,"I could be seeing things... I dunno, I've been blind for a while (not literally of course)

I was hanging out with two of my friends and I noticed how effortlessly they made small talk with the waiter (edit: waitress).  I don't usually talk to strangers. I have no trouble talking to people once I get to know them and I'm comfortable. But otherwise I find it painful and I get really anxious. I don't know what to say or how to say it.

The realization I'm talking about is that I think I actually have terrible social skills and this has hurt me all my life.  Even in high school, I never really had any friends.  I would talk a lot though, but I was so high, so deluded, (dopamine?) that I thought I was hot stuff. 

As for women? I've had two relationships. These were geeky type girls that just happened to be in the same space as me. I have no idea how they happened or why they liked me.  But because I lack social skills, I don't meet new people often. I've spent a lot of time alone. It's been 10 years since my last relationship.  When I'm in groups, I tend to tune out, and daydream, rather than participate in the conversation.

I absolutely love one-on-one conversation. I really like talking to my friends on the phone for 1 or 2 hours.    

This problem has also affected my work.  I was perfectly capable, and they liked me during my internship, but for the first 3 or 4 months I would eat my lunch in my cubicle instead of with the guys in the lunch room.  They said it was okay, so I did, but eventually I went out and sat with them.  I was still pretty awkward making conversation. I used to cringe at the thought of interacting with people (especially the supervisor) though. I liked to just sit in my cubicle, do my work, and leave.

Trying to improve my social skills. I'm not sure if this theme which has been present my whole life is due solely to me never actually having much experience, or if it's due to an untreated anxiety problem."

While most of the schools I am applying to are mostly from 5-20 in terms of ranks but I saved 1 spot for a highly ambitious application to a top 5 program. The thing is, my GPA isnt the highest (3.7) although I will be graduating from a top 10 mechanical engineering school. My GRE isnt that great either, 92percentile for analytical and 93 percentile for essay but 61 percentile for verbal. So I really need to have a very competitive recommendation letter to actually stand a small chance.

Thing is, I have 3 academic letters. I am trying to choose a supplementary one to complement my 3 letters. The choice is as follows:

1) Internship supervisor is willing to write a letter for me. I did an internship in the biggest chemical manufacturing firm in the world and I believe a letter by my boss there will help my grad school application. However, my direct superior doesnt really have a good command of the English language, which means my letter might not be well written.
2)A renown professor at my university once interviewed me for a scholarship which I was awarded subsequently. The scholarship was given for me to pursue my overseas internship. One of the requirements of the scholarship is to participate actively in social work. So this referee will be able to  highlight both my academic abilities and my active participation in social work, which actually shows a different side of me. 

Therefore, I am in a dilemma since both referees will be able to provide a different insight to my personality. Anyone has an idea which one to approach to write that supplementary letter?"

78n16o,2,2017-10-25,Transitioning from SysAdmin/Technical role to Programming,necrononnui,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/78n16o/transitioning_from_sysadmintechnical_role_to/,"Hi everyone,

I'm mainly looking for advice on my current predicament, rather than a specific answer or solution. So here it goes...

I'm a recent BSc Computing graduate in the UK. The main focus of my degree was software development in C# and Android, with a smaller focus on web development. At the start of my degree, my career goal was to work in software development, ideally games design.  My course was a sandwich course, which meant I had the opportunity in my third year to take a year out to work in industry, which I felt would be great for future prospects. I interviewed for five software development positions (four being C# development, the other being web development), and I was rejected for each position. This knocked my confidence massively, and I started looking for internships in other fields as I felt I was not good enough for software development roles. I secured an internship mainly doing helpdesk and technical support for a small company, despite all of my skills being development orientated.

Since then I've graduated university, and I was offered a job at the company I interned at. My predicament really is that I don't have any interest in this field, I wanted to, and still do, work in software development. What's holding me back is my lack of confidence that I would be good enough for any software development role, as well as the fact I now have nearly 2 years experience in an unrelated field. 

My question, I guess, is should I persue a career in software development, even with a lack of experience and confidence, or should I stay in my current position and progress through this career? I understand the question has no real clear answer, I'm mainly just looking for advice/guidance.

Thank you for reading.

How do people manage to overcome work visa obstacles? I have an engineering degree from a top-5 ish school in India, 5+ years of experience all over Asia Pacific, and a non-STEM grad degree from a top-20 school in the US in my field (the undergrad program is among the best among non-Ivy I guess)... but most employers won't even let me apply to their jobs. Among the few that do, if I'm lucky to have interview(s) they bail because of the visa situation.

I understand their point of view since it's a risk due to the lottery system with visas, and I knew this before coming to the US, but even after 15+ months since I graduated I have been struggling to find a job that is a good fit for my background and education.

I worked at my uni for ~10 months before tapping into my personal connections to land an internship half way across the country - but I'd like to move to St. Louis to be closer to my SO.

78oau5,1,2017-10-25,Registration tomorrow. Please help,jetlife95,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/78oau5/registration_tomorrow_please_help/,"Hey everyone. Tomorrow, I register for my next semester of classes and I am not sure what to sign up for. I have spent several semesters “exploring” different stem fields. At this point, I have taken math up through differential equations, engineering physics courses, statics, dynamics, mechanics of materials, and several computer science courses (5 to be exact). I thought I was interested in CS because I like to code, but I don’t like to do nothing but code if that makes sense — I’d rather write programs in an engineering scenario. That being said, I’m interested in electrical and mechanical engineering. 

I feel more comfortable with mechanical engineering just because I have taken things like statics and dynamics, and I even had a mechanical engineering internship. That being said, I have a lot of interest in electrical engineering, but I don’t know much about it. So I’m worried about taking those classes and then having a similar experience that I had with CS, where I end up not enjoying it several semesters in because it’s not what I thought. I’m a little against mechanical just because I’m not a huge fan of a lot of the courses in the curriculum, although I realize that there will be courses I don’t like in any department I choose. I also like ME because there’s a lot of flexibility with it, and I plan to go to grad school later so I’m not looking to get a job right out of undergrad. 

All of that being said, does anyone have any advice or things for me to consider? Those who are ME or EE students, what is it like for you? I am trying to get a good feel and make a firm decision because at this point, I can’t keep putting off graduation. Thanks!"

So I already signed a summer internship offer with Facebook, but later received a very competitive offer from Bloomberg.

I'm kind of at a loss because I really want to work for both of these companies at some point before I graduate (either intern or coop), so I need some advice as to what to do with the Bloomberg offer (since I most likely will be aiming for them next summer).

My initial thought was to ask to convert BB to a fall coop, but they said that they didn't do coops. I have a few ideas floating around right now, but most of them seem unrealistic, so I would like some advice on the best way to proceed.

1. ask to get Facebook converted to fall coop that way I can do BB this summer and then FB in the fall (is this even possible since I already signed?)

2. ask for Bloomberg to defer the offer by a year (this is a ridiculous idea, but is it even remotely feasible?)

3. just decline Bloomberg offer and interview again next year (seems like the most realistic option but no guarantees I can get an offer next year)

Again, any input on these options or any other ideas are much appreciated. Thanks!!"

**Colleges:** Applying ED to CMU SCS as it has been my dream school ever since my sibling went there. Applying EA to the University of Michigan. Applying regular to UIUC, University of Washington, University of Maryland, University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech.

**Major:** Computer Science

**Academics:** I go to a highly competitive magnet school. I'm in a bit of a unique situation in terms of GPA. My first two years of high school were extremely bad, with ~2.9 weighted GPA in freshmen year and ~3.2 weighted GPA in sophomore year. However, I changed myself a ton after sophomore year and ended my junior year with ~4.6 weighted GPA. I am continuing that upward growth, hoping for above a 4.6 in my senior year. My overall weighted GPA, is a 3.675.

**Coursework:** Decently rigorous. Compared to the other kids at my highly competitive school, it's about average. I've taken 4 Computer Science courses so far and am taking one more this year.

**SAT:** 1510 (800 Math, 710 Reading/Writing). Unfortunately, I took it again, hoping to improve, and went down to a 1480 (780 Math, 700 Reading/Writing). Not sure if the second one will hurt my chances.

**SAT II:** 800 Math II, 700 Physics. Will the poor physics score hurt my chances significantly?

**AP:** Computer Science A (4), Calculus AB (5), Psychology (4). Taking US Government, English Language and Composition, Calculus BC, and Macro/Micro this year. Hoping that the 4 on Computer Science A won't hurt me, as it is my intended major.

**Recommendations:** One is from my Math teacher who I had for two years, and she seems to really like me. The other is from my AP Psychology teacher who likes me as well. Also, I asked my mentor/supervisor/boss at my internship for a letter of recommendation a few weeks ago, and he said he would be happy to. I'm hoping he'll finish in time for my early applications because I think it'll be a really good recommendation.

**Extracurriculars/Volunteering:** Pretty good I think. I've done robotics for almost my entire life (since 4th or 5th grade) - FIRST Lego League and FIRST Tech Challenge. Overall, I've won around 20 awards which varied from Robot Design to Robot Programming to Community Outreach to Tournament Champion and have moved on to the State and Super-Regional levels a few times. My team also ran programs for a few years where we taught robotics to children with autism through both a local college and our local Autism Society. There were articles published about us in small local papers/school newsletter a few times. I've also participated in three hackathons: First was a small local hackathon, the second was a relatively large hackathon hosted by my high school where I won two awards, third was an extremely large (I think the largest collegiate hackathon) hackathon, where my team won an award as well. At school, I am an officer and writer for a sports analytics club, have actively participated in our Mobile and Web app development clubs, and have been participating in Investment club (not sure if it's relevant). Last year, I also won first prize in my project category at my school's science and engineering fair. I've also gotten AP Scholar and National Merit Letter of Commendation, but those aren't that exciting. Last, but not least, I have been interning at a reputable Children's Hospital, using computational science/data analysis/bioinformatics to contribute to a really cool project in the Neuroscience research laboratory.
Now, on to volunteering. Last year, I took part in my school's program where a select group of students go to a neighboring, underprivileged elementary school and tutor them in subjects they're struggling in (mostly math and English). I also took part in an extracurricular (not affiliated with my school) club/organization where we would go after school to neighboring schools and teach STEM to younger kids. I'm not sure if these activities are considered good because some of the other kids at my school have done a ton of stuff and some have so many internships that I have lost count.

**Essays:** I'm a pretty average writer (maybe slightly below average), but hopefully they will turn out alright.

**Legacy:** Sibling went to CMU from same high school as me, not sure if they have sibling legacy."

Currently working towards a future in Law, federal prosecution, getting a security clearance",elusive_restful,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/78p314/indiana_two_petty_mistakes_in_my_high_school/,"Hi, I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. I have visions for my future which I really believe in and a passion for the law. I’ve done some extensive reading on here and I know that there are a lot of highly educated, intelligent people with great insight and advice. I have a couple questions concerning my law prospects, specifically in regards to two youthful mistakes I made in high school. I know this windy and may seem anecdotal but I believe the details are important in cases like these. Any guidance, insight, or thoughts are welcomed. 

I am 20 and a sophomore studying Law and Public Policy, with a minor in Political Science which I’m considering doubling with Russian as I am taking it as my language. I attend a large and fairly competitive “public ivy” state school. My specific school in was ranked #4 in the nation last year the having the competitive programs for Public Policy and Pre-law in the nation. I have a 3.5 GPA and intend on joining the mock trial association at my university which has a top 25 law school. I already have an internship at law office in a major city lined up. I have dreams of following into similar footsteps of my grandfather who served as a county prosecutor for 12 years and then a magistrate for many more. I had the very unique opportunity on many occasions sitting in my grandpa’s courtroom near his bench at a desk with the chief bailiff and former police sergeant. On each of these occasions I would bring a legal folder with me and take notes. These memories helped foster the strong dreams I hold today to aspire to working in public service. My absolute goal is to go to law school and my dream is to work as federal prosecutor. Either for the state, district, or county. I have a fairly well connected family granting me a very solid list of connections and coupled with coming from a strong school with a good GPA i think law school could be a seriously presuming prospect for myself. Yet, Ingrained in my head are two, yet still fairly traumatic memories of being an oblivious 17-18 year high schooler who found himself in the wrong place on two occasions with the police. 

The first time was when I was 17. It was my girlfriend’s birthday and because neither of our families allowed the other over at their house past a certain time, we decided to spend the night in my car not too far my from neighborhood. An officer on patrol spotted us as we laid there talking. He approached and asked if we had any weed and I promptly handed over the camera bag. In it were the bowl which belonged to my girlfriend and a small bag of weed crumbs which I’m guessing weighed no more than .02 grams. I was charged with a single Class C Misdemeanor for the bowl and a Class B for the marijuana. As I was a juvenile and it was my first offense, there was no conviction. I completed 3 months of informal adjustment without incident and I do not believe I pled guilty.


About 8 months later at 18, still in high school, I left an apple which was used as a smoking device in my car. An officer searched it and I was consequently charged, not convicted, with a Class C Misdemeanor as the apple was deemed as paraphernalia. As it was my first and only adult offense, I pled not guilty entering into the Pretrial Diversion program which resulted in no conviction. The case was dismissed which followed its expungement. 

These two events now have been 2-3 years ago. Today, I don’t even consider ever putting myself in any sort of situation which could land be in trouble again. That is a given. I continue to believe in the ideals in which this great nation was founded upon and I want to uphold the law which rules it. I find many flaws in our law enforcement and judicial system in the United States, but I also have faced the system myself. I felt its wrath and the cracks which are very real in our society opened themselves up to me and I could see the crippling reality on the other-side. Yet, I avow to these institutions and want to be a part of bringing good change to them. This is something which I care deeply about and have experienced two, unfortunate yet valuable instances which I took as lessons. I feel these are lessons which offered me a unique but dynamic perspective of the law. One perspective came from mornings spent in my grandfather’s courtroom, once even getting to tour the city jail. The other one would come a year later when I was fingerprinted and then immediately released from that very same jail. 

Are my dreams still achievable? I have done plenty of research about the bar and law school, those I am not worried about. I do not believe two situations in my youth for a little bit of marijuana and an apple which I was not convicted, dismissed, and expunged, but also were not of moral turpitude would make me not morally fit. My worries are about this - 

My prospects for still becoming a a district, state, county, or federal prosecutor? Federal agencies in general and getting a security clearance?

I currently have two offers for summer internships next year.

Bank of America NYC

33/hr + $2500 housing stipend (paid once)

Smallish Marketing Agency RTP

25/hr + no housing stipend

Every student I've talked to has said I should go with Bank of America. However, after taking into account the cost of living, I'm not entirely sure how much more the pay actually is.

The other thing I'm worried about is culture fit. The company in RTP has appeared to be a perfect fit ever since I started reading about them and began interviewing. Bank of America has come across as being much 'colder'. Considering this is only for an internship, I was wondering if I'd potentially be better off going with the worse fit of the two since it's not as big of a commitment as a full time position.

(It's also worth noting that when I applied for BoA, I was originally expecting to be located in Charlotte, which I would have massively preferred compared to NYC.)

Am I crazy for not instantly going with the more notable company? Or should I prioritize the culture fit to increase my chances of being happy with my experience?"

I have lived in the south for about a year, been to the Houston area for a few weeks and through most of the east coast. My understanding is, the U.S. developer community is concentraded on the Westcoast/ NY. Is that correct?

Since I am still in college, my budget is very limited. The standard of living for the places I listed, seems to be pretty high. That could be a problem. I would need a small affordable flat(willing to cut out some things for lower prices). The intership should guarantee to pay for at least a certain share of my expenses(1/3 of rent would be the lower limit I suppose). Is this even a thing in the states?

As time went by, I looked harder for jobs, but the job market has been unforgiving here and it’s hard to even land an internship. 

I don’t want to reveal too many details, so I apologize for being vague, but I recently interviewed for a company who really liked me for the role, but they have told me they won’t be able to pay me what I’m asking and they’re concerned I may just be taking this job to make a few bucks and quit when I find something better. Nonetheless, the hiring manager called and told me he wants to make an offer, but I won’t find out what the offer is until I meet with him soon. 

The position has a lot of growth potential and even though it doesn’t align directly with my career path now, if I do grow at this organization, it’ll be useful in my career. The position, at where I would start, is rather unglamorous work involving making lots of warm calls all day. 

I expect I’ll be offered something along the lines of $45-55k/year, which is about $30K/year less than my last job and IF I can land a good gig along my career path, I can probably get paid $80K+, now that I’m about to graduate with my masters. 

With all that said, should I take this job?

I’m rather tempted to take it so long as I can pay my bills, or at least dramatically reduce the financial burden I’m placing on my parents. I’ve been told I should take it and keep looking for better opportunities, but I feel really guilty about that sort of thing, especially since I’m being referred by friends for this job.

- I transferred colleges fairly early in my academic career from 
college 1 to 2.(this is important)

So a week ago for some reason I access my previous college's career center (college 1) and apply for a job in a pretty prestigious company. In my mind I thought I was going to get a rejection flat out because that's what Ive been accustomed to and because my resume clearly states that although I was previously an undergrad student at this institution, I completed my undergrad degree at college 2. Today, I woke up and learned that I have been accepted for an on campus interview.

Now I need advice. 

- Should I notify the college right now and inform them of the mistake and come clean that I am not eligible for the position. 

- Should I go ahead with the interview, I will be able to enter the premises and I would be able to take the interview, because the 2 colleges are part of the city and will take either student id to enter.
I would really appreciate any advice thanks in advance."

My Summary:

I'm a 24 year old woman with a BA in History. I graduated in December 2014. I've essentially been a caregiver for my grandmother and taking care of my little brother from Jan 2015-July 2016. My mother worked and I did all the SAHM duties.
July 2016-July 2017 I was an au pair in Paris. I chose to go because I was debating going to grad school at the Paris university that I studied abroad at twice. I wanted to network and mingle with my professors and students I knew there. The fact I took care of children was secondary.


From July until now, I am again being a full-time caregiver for my grandmother and brother. My grandmother requires virtually around the clock care and it's insanely expensive, so I haven't had the time for a paying job. Our circumstances are changing and my family will be able to support itself without me. I have plenty of bills to pay and need to get on my feet and I need an income. So here I am.

I haven't had any internships or outside experience in the field. Even in university, I went home Thursday evening and returned Sunday night every week so I could help at home. It's left my resumé rather vanilla. I'm not making excuses for it; just being honest.
I've contacted my school alumni aid for help with job search, but they only provide it for a decent fee and I simply don't have it.

Contrary to the job listing, it seems this is not open to people with my lack of experience. I would eventually like to go back to school and get an MA or even PhD, but it's not in the budget right now. 

I've struggled with finding exactly what my dream job would be. It's made the job search difficult since I really had no idea what I was looking for. I knew the things I *didn't* want such as sales, but I still felt lost.

TL;DR: What type of entry level job could help me build the skill set or make the connections needed to eventually have a job like I listed above?"
78pwxp,3,2017-10-25,"3rd year CS major, I'm not sure that this is for me. Advice?",function3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/78pwxp/3rd_year_cs_major_im_not_sure_that_this_is_for_me/,"Hey everyone, I'm in a position of great uncertainty and thought I'd come here for any advice, support, or encouragement. First some background on my college experience so far:

I just transferred as a junior to a decent state school out of my community college. During my two years at CC, I constantly struggled with the math requirements for my CS degree. I barely scraped by calc 1 during my freshman year, and was buried by calc 2 (ended with a 69, just barely failing...). At the same time as failing calc 2, I was struggling with discrete math. I didn't know how badly I was struggling until I took the midterm and miserably failed. The only grades in that class were a midterm, final, and some bonus points for homework assignments (basically negligible). After failing that midterm, the only way to pass was to do exceptionally well on the final. It did not happen. I retook calc 2, and passed, but I once again failed discrete math when I retook it. 

At the end of my sophomore year I transferred without my associates, and it really was a blow to my self worth. I decided to push on so that my two years would not go to waste. I was accepted as an intended major (as I did not have the discrete math requirement) into my second choice school, and things seemed alright. I paid my deposit, signed a lease for an apartment with two others who transferred from the same CC.

However, as the summer went on, my schedule was not yet done. everything was done over the phone, and they were to call me to get me set up for the fall semester (I wasn't able to just make the schedule on my own). The first time they called to advise me, all I was told was that they do not have my immunization records and cannot continue without them. I sent them the next day, and no one contacted me for weeks. I finally reached out to them and was told everything is ready and they don't know why I wasn't contacted. I was told I would receive a call by the end of next week. Next week rolls by, and so does the following week. The semester begins in 1.5 weeks and I don't have a schedule. I call them, and they set up an appointment the next day. The call goes well, I was placed in 3 classes (discrete math, differential equations, and digital systems). Great. I'm set. I ask if they have all my final grades from the previous semester. Nope. She asks for a rundown of my classes. I list off my previous classes and she stopped me after I mentioned discrete math. She was confused and told me to send in the transcript asap. I was already prepared and sent it in right then and there. She said the admissions committee will take a look at it and let me know. I was confused, what do you mean let me know? Let me know what? She was unable to give me any information. Alrighty. A few days later I get an email from the head of the program saying that I'm permanently ineligible for the CS program at this university, as they have a 1-retake policy and I have already retaken a course. I was still okay with my schedule for the current semester, and I had no choice but to attend this school as I already had an apartment and rescinded my other applications.

Half way through the semester, I am once again struggling with math. Discrete math is much easier here than the one at my CC, and I'm not doing as terribly. I know I will at the very least pass. Differential equations feels alien to me, as I have a very weak calculus background. I am not sure how well this class will go, I have my second exam next week and I am already scared about it. I know that the material itself isn't impossible, but I am just so far behind in the fundamentals of the class. Little things like u-subs and knowing specific rules of integration trip me up. 

If I were to get 100% serious, I would have to relearn calc 1 and 2, all to pass an elective. At this point, I don't know if it's worth it anymore. Since I am not in the CS program, I cannot take level 300 classes and will not waste my time and money here another semester. My plan was to finish this semester and find an internship for the spring while I live out the lease on my apartment here. However, my search for an internship has turned up dry. Even the few times I've caught interest, it was hard to put a positive spin on why I'm taking a semester off and why I'm transferring to a different school. 

I just feel like I'm getting nowhere, and I'm not even sure where I would like to work after completing my degree. I look through CS job listings and the amount that I don't know is so overwhelming and the broad nature of the field is daunting. There are so many ways to specialize, there is so much to learn. I feel almost aimless, especially this semester when I'm taking math courses and one class about digital logic. It's been a year since I've touched an IDE, and honestly I kind of miss it. Sometimes I help out my engineering student roommates with their Matlab assignments because it feels nice to even look at something that I'm comfortable with.

The past 1.5 years I've told myself that I would like to do security, but even that is uncertain. Am I going to be a glorified IT guy? Will I be developing security software? Monitoring company networks for threats?

I looked into programming bootcamps for about 15 minutes before I realized that they're mostly bullshit aimed at teaching basic stuff or web development (which I have zero interest in. I had once web development class and it was by far one of the least enjoyable things I've ever done). I understand that there is a fundamental difference between programming and computer science, and for that reason am very skeptical of bootcamps. 

I have read (either on this sub, or the college sub) that certificates are basically worthless, except in the infosec field (how convenient). Should I look more into these? How far can I expect to get with a certificate? Would it be a good idea to try to transfer my discrete math credit back to my CC and get my CS associates? Is that even possible? After this semester, I plan to reach out to my adviser there, who is also the head of the CS program and see if that would be possible. But I have also read that an associates is basically useless on the job market, so I am not sure if it is worth the effort.

I am just very unsure about everything. I understand that ""school is not for everyone,"" but I really do not want to give up. At the same time I feel like I am floundering, and it is costing me money. It honestly makes me feel worthless at times. The other day I did poorly on a math quiz and sat in the car for about a half hour because I felt like shit.

I do not want to throw away two years of work and tuition money, but I am not sure where I can go. I read a lot about people landing jobs with no degree, but proponents of that are usually also supporters of things like bootcamps and don't actually understand the fundamentals of computer science. How reasonably can I expect to find work without a degree? How far ahead in computer science education must someone go before they know enough to be a competent employee? I feel like I have a solid grasp of data structures, and I've been able to pick up syntax of other languages pretty easily while helping out my engineering friends (almost all of my CS education has been done with Java). I had an ARM assembly language class that I did not particularly enjoy, but I did well enough and have a solid understanding of the material.

I don't want to completely change fields, I've put far too much time and money into my education so far. Just not sure where to go next as I'm not sure that I will be successful in completing my degree; this isn't working out for me and I am doing something wrong...

It's a very long post, but I don't know where else I can go to vent and ask questions about this and have an audience that would understand the specifics of my situation. If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, it would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Eating ass in school because of emphasis on math in CS, not sure if will be able to finish but I'm three years in and feel that I've learned too much to completely give up. Is it possible to get a decent job with an associates, certificates, and a portfolio of projects showcasing CS ability? Will I be able to advance a career in the field without a bachelors? Or should I switch to something else?"

78q0tz,10,2017-10-25,Asking for a raise - another offer in hand,Gsagain82,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/78q0tz/asking_for_a_raise_another_offer_in_hand/,"tl;dr I like my job and don't intend to leave, but I got a higher offer, should I bring it to my manager?

I've seen a lot of threads along these lines, but nothing perfectly relevant, so I thought it was worth some specific advise. I'm an embedded software engineer. I've been at my current company for 6+ years, and I have another year of experience prior to that.

**Where I'm at:**
I'm located in a high-growth and high cost of living metro area and I'm currently making around $80k. I started at about $60k, six years ago. The raises have come in small amounts at annual reviews. Additionally, I am a few weeks out on finishing a masters in CS.

**New offer:**

A couple weeks ago, I threw a resume out to an interesting looking company. I have no serious problems with my current position, but mostly out of boredom, I wanted to see where it went. Long-story short, I have an offer from them for mid-$90k's . It's a decent bump from $80k, and it looks like a good company, but overall, I can't see myself taking the leap (commute, PTO, and health benefits would all take a hit). I would have jumped on it if the pay difference was enormous, but I don't think they'll be able to go high enough to make it worth all the trouble/risk.

**Happy where I'm at:**

Besides the occasional boredom with being at the same place, I think my current company is very good with plenty of growth opportunities. I do feel like I'm slightly under-compensated in my role. For compensation, I think I started a little on the low side and the raises have not brought me up to where I think the market is. I'm technical leader and have had some management roles off and on (internships and contract positions). I know our convoluted engineering and business systems better than anybody in the group, so I think I'm very valuable to the company. They also have short and long-term plans to grow the group. I also have a very good relationship with management.

**Can I use this offer?**

I am considering bringing this offer to my manager as a conversation starter to ask for a raise outside of the normal review process. I would preface the conversation with communicating that I have no intention of leaving and I really like my role here. I would also present the offer as something that came up after a recruiter sought me out and I was just curious with where it would go. I could see myself staying at this company for my career, but I think the corporate raise policies haven't kept up with the job market or my growth. The company can be very corporate so I don't think the normal review process will ever net me any more the 3-5%. I feel like I'll always be behind where I should be for compensation. Would it be reasonable to use this offer as a shortcut up the pay grade?

What would you do? Anybody with similar experiences?

I'm a sophomore computer science student and this past summer I interned at Capital One in Wilmington. The pay and experience was on par with Big N companies, and they offered me a returning position in NYC as a data engineer intern (&gt;50/hr).

On the other hand, I have offers from eBay (&gt;30/hr, San Jose), Fannie Mae (&lt;20/hr, D.C.), declined PNC (&gt;20/hr, Pittsburg), and am waiting to hear back from a trading company in Chicago. I also have an interview with Qualtrics but again, not sure how long that will take to process.

My concern is that my offer for C1 expires tomorrow for NYC and is still ongoing for McLean afterwards (so I lose my spot in NYC but can still potentially go to McLean). I also have offer deadlines of next week for eBay (which is my next choice) and I'm not really interested in Fannie Mae / PNC.

My options are the following:

- Take C1 in NYC

- Take C1 in McLean (slightly lower pay)

- Take eBay (lower pay, new company and location)

- Wait for trading company / Qualtrics (losing C1 NYC)


Can anyone provide some insight on which of these decisions is strongest for my resume and career moving forward? I'm really not sure how to approach this situation and it's tough for me to gauge which options are strongest."

I work nights, so I primarily slogged through the degree program at work by myself, and thus have no real projects I can put my name on, and taking internships would’ve required quitting my (well-paying/easy/boring) technician job, so I have none of those under my belt either.

I transferred into this program from a small CC, so I've been late on the internship thing. This will be my first software internship. I have interviewed with a number of companies so far, and I've had offers from:

* John Deere, I rejected.
* Statefarm, I rejected.
* FAST, I rejected.
* Bank of America
* NextCapital

I'm in the process with some other big companies, but haven't heard back yet, and frankly don't think I will. I need ***help deciding between NextCapital and Bank of America***.

The Bank of America offer is for a Global Summer Technology Analyst position, which is a pretty weird name. It's a software development internship though, I'm fairly certain. I'm just hesitant about BoA because the process was super-streamlined. Met at career fair, on-campus interview next day, job offer within a week. The on-campus interview questions were extremely basic (implement a find smallest number in List, using Comparables, etc.). After I got the offer, no one has reached out to me either to try to sell me on the internship. From the research I've done online, I've read that BoA internships are quite dry and the technology isn't the coolest. The main pro for BoA is how big of a name it is.

The NextCapital process was much more involved. I took a Hackerrank, phone screen, and had a whole-day on-site interview (multiple rounds of technical interviews). I got to meet a lot of the people who work there, see the layout of the office, get a feel for how the work-environment is. NextCapital felt like an actual tech company. Their main product is a web-based financial planning tool, so their product is tech as opposed to BoA. Also, they do a lot of work in Ruby, Java, etc. Frameworks and languages that could be really good skills to pick up. And the title of the position is actually ""Software Engineer Intern"". My main hesitation is that NextCapital isn't as big of a name as Bank of America. As someone who eventually wants to work at a Google, Microsoft, etc, does this really matter?

Also, Bank of America pays really well. Both located in Chicago, which is my home.

as for the case, neither one of the two was available in the part-picker, I consider [corsair carbide spec alpha](http://www.corsair.com/en-eu/carbide-series-spec-alpha-mid-tower-gaming-case-black-yellow) and [corsair carbide spec 04](http://www.corsair.com/en-eu/carbide-series-spec-04-mid-tower-gaming-case-black-yellow)

as this is my first build I'd like you folks to have a look at it and crosscheck if everything will fit together also I'd like your thoughts/ suggestions for improvement.


Now some of my questions:


Is my goal of a future-proof gaming PC achieved/ achiveable with this parts/ my budget? 


Is this build noisy, what can I expect from it in that regard?


I'm planning on installing these two 120mm quiet case fans, does it make sense to use quiet pwm fans or is the difference not worth it? 
and will these two suffice or should I plan on adding a third/fourth?


neither one of the two cases I picked seem to have a slot for a intern blu ray player, If I buy a extern player could this cause problems when first installing windows?


The CPU cooler (150mm) seems to just fit into those cases(one 150mm max and the other one 156mm max), is it advisable to reconsider the choice or will it have enough play in the case for air circulation?


Thank you in advance "

I'm an electrical engineering student who is currently on internship in the communications field. I've taken 3-4 C++ and C based courses during university, and gotten B range grades in those courses. Since I have some free time because of my internship, I wanted to get started re-learning programming and possibly start a project next summer.

Although I did relatively ok at the programming courses, I feel that I did not develop any programming skills. I discovered I'm good at finding solutions to problems (pseudo-code), but not so much at implementing them (actual coding). I wanted to take a shot at learning Python, as that seems to be the language best learned for general purpose programming. 

Where would be a good resource to start learning Python? Is there a specific way I could focus on learning how to better put my thoughts into code, as I struggle specifically with syntax and structure. "

So I got my degree in Industrial engineering from a reputable school but I was not the most studious person nor did I do any internships while I was there. I also did not really find myself being passionate about the subject other than the statistics math portions.

Fast forward, I graduated and got an analyst job at UPS. Got promoted after a year. I used programming and scripts etc to automate a lot of my job and make my life easier. I started thinking maybe I should try and move to a computer science related job since I had originally thought about doing CS as a major. Combined with not liking the company culture or team at UPS, I moved to a small company as a programmer thinking it would be a get my foot in the door situation for a programming career since my education is not in it.

I worked at that job for a year and it was ok. The technology was extremely dated but the team was great. I only left because of life situations that caused me to relocate.

Currently I work doing sort of IT/programming for a warehouse environment. The team all keeps to themselves and there are frequent bursts of anger and yelling. I didn't receive any formal training so I fee like I was really just dropped off in the deep end. I know I should probably talk to my manager about the training, but the more I've worked around programming I realize it's not for me. I'm not the best coder in the world and think it's just nice as a hobby or just a supplement to a job sort of like an analyst. This in combination with the team that isn't very helpful in answering questions, I find myself struggling to accomplish anything at work and just feeling like a zombie going through the day.

So the bottom line is, I've jumped around between jobs and changing careers and I still don't really know what I want to do. And I really dislike where I'm at now. I think the only thing that really interests me or sounds like I might be good at is data science or going back to analytics. I could use more of the statistics that I like and programming as a supplement to the job and not the focus.

But I'm worried either I'll get fired where I am now, companies won't look at me because of the job hopping, or I won't be able to find something if I quit. I'll also lose the insurance I have with my company which is pretty damn nice, and I am frequently sick with chronic health issues.

I don't know what I should do in my situation."

What's the best option?,october73,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/78x1ye/i_have_year_of_uni_left_studying_noncs/,"Currently studying Mech.E, so I'm not entirely new to programming, but most of my early introduction was in Matlab scripting. I've only recently found my interest in true CS after I learned Python for my research project, and at the same time I'm feeling less enthusiastic about Mech. E. 

I'll be graduating in next June, and I'm taking intro sequence (142~3 in my uni) learning basic Java and data structures. I'm planning on taking 300 level class on data structure and algorithm next, and I have one more quarter to take something interesting. Maybe intro web development. I also feel like I need to explore the field more to find out what exactly I like about it. For now I just like programming in general and being able to produce without limitation of hardware. 

But that's only three classes compared to what CSE majors will take (10+ I think). I only have two quarters left so I'm not looking to switch major all together. Me being out of school also makes me not eligible for most internships. So what would be the best option for me next? 

I'm thinking following options

1. Bootcamp to get more knowledge: Somewhat costly, but doable. But I'm not sure how legit and productive this will be. I've read a lot of great success stories of bootcamps. I also read a lot of terrible alarming stories about them.

2. Self learning: But tbh I have difficulty self learning at early level. I can start picking things up if I'm atleast knee deep in it, but I feel like I'll lose focus and direction. 

3. Masters?: Most costly and time consuming option... not really down to pay 2 years of tuition either. 

4. What else?: Maybe something that I haven't thought of?"

Around 600 USD. Will be purchasing it from the US.


* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 

I want a 2 in 1 convertible running full Windows 10.


* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Shouldn't be too heavy, hopefully around 1kg or so. Don't care about thickness.


* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**

Windows.


* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 

~12-13 inches.


* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 

Nothing very heavy too regularly. The usual workload will be the following:

* General web browsing
* Media consumption - mostly 1080p content, and some *very legal* soccer streams
* PDF reading - very important, as most of my college reading is on the computer
* Some coding - mostly web development, as I've started an internship which will lead to a full-time job after I graduate. However, this device won't be my main workstation. 
* Note taking - important factor as well, and one of the main reasons I want a Surface in the first place.
* Drawing/Designing - once in a blue moon. Some doodling, mostly. Not very essential.


* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

Won't be gaming on this device.


* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 

Reliable build quality would be good, as I won't be able to send it back for warranty purposes. Is the SP3 more reliable than the SP4, which I've heard suffers from a few quality issues, especially regarding the display?


* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

Now, where I live (India), Surfaces -well, only the Pro 4, as it's the only one that's even been sold here officially- are very overpriced. The i5/4/128 Pro 4 that's priced at $700 costs near about $1100 here, which is way out of my budget. So I'll be getting an acquaintance of mine to bring one over from the US. The problem is, my (already very stretched) budget is maybe 600 dollars or so. Hence I've decided to go the refurb/used route.

This device won't be my main workstation, I've already got a decently powerful laptop, but which at nearly 3 kilos is literally a pain to carry around. So I want a portable, yet powerful device. But since I plan to keep this for a decent period of time (at least 3 years), which one should I go for - the SP3 or the SP4?

A refurbed SP3 (i5/8/256) is about $500, while the SP4 (i5/4/128) is about $600-650. My question is threefold - Firstly, is the extra 100-150 dollars worth it, considering the SP4's processor is better/more efficient/has better cooling while the SP3 has double the memory and storage? Secondly, are refurbished products worth the risk, especially since I won't be able to send it back if some issue does arise? And finally, should I buy used or refurbed? It'd be really helpful if anyone could share their experience regarding such dilemmas.

One thing to note that I will not be buying a Type Cover or Pen, as I'll be getting both from a relative of mine. And apologies if this portion was a bit too long.

Mind you I'm coming from a different field, I currently work as a Security Supervisor, and I'm also a freshman in College, pursing and A.S in InfoTech, so my experience is limited. I've always fixed my own computers and I've also gone through some Active Directory courses online, I feel pretty confident managing Users and Computers on it.

So now Im in my senior year with no internship experience, I have decent projects on my resume and a 3.5 gpa.

I transferred into this program from a small CC, so I've been late on the internship thing. This will be my first software internship. I have interviewed with a number of companies so far, and I've had offers from:

* John Deere, I rejected.
* Statefarm, I rejected.
* FAST, I rejected.
* Bank of America
* NextCapital

I'm in the process with some other big companies, but haven't heard back yet, and frankly don't think I will. I need ***help deciding between NextCapital and Bank of America***.

The Bank of America offer is for a Global Summer Technology Analyst position, which is a pretty weird name. It's a software development internship though, I'm fairly certain. I'm just hesitant about BoA because the process was super-streamlined. Met at career fair, on-campus interview next day, job offer within a week. The on-campus interview questions were extremely basic (implement a find smallest number in List, using Comparables, etc.). After I got the offer, no one has reached out to me either to try to sell me on the internship. From the research I've done online, I've read that BoA internships are quite dry and the technology isn't the coolest. The main pro for BoA is how big of a name it is.

The NextCapital process was much more involved. I took a Hackerrank, phone screen, and had a whole-day on-site interview (multiple rounds of technical interviews). I got to meet a lot of the people who work there, see the layout of the office, get a feel for how the work-environment is. NextCapital felt like an actual tech company. Their main product is a web-based financial planning tool, so their product is tech as opposed to BoA. Also, they do a lot of work in Ruby, Java, etc. Frameworks and languages that could be really good skills to pick up. And the title of the position is actually ""Software Engineer Intern"". My main hesitation is that NextCapital isn't as big of a name as Bank of America. **As someone who eventually wants to work at a Google, Microsoft, etc, does it really matter having a well-known non-tech company internship vs a small relatively unknown tech company internship?**

Also, Bank of America pays really well. Both located in Chicago, which is my home.

Thank you for all your thoughts, advice, opinions, help, etc."

My story is quite confusing and I don't know what to do. (English is not my first language so sorry for any mistake.)
I never knew what to do with my life or who I wanted to be, yet I have always wanted to do a lot of things, not one specifically. 
In high school I was super smart, always getting good grades. 
In the summer of high school I did several research programs at college and even won a scholarship to do research in another country. It was the first I visited another country.
At 18, I got in medical school and had pretty good grades. At 19, second year of med school I was a research assistant, got a paper published and was a teaching assistant for biochemistry lab classes. Actually, I felt medical school quite easier than what I was expecting, at least in those first two years (in my country, med school lasts 6 years).
During that year, I had a major family crisis and started to thinking about all my life and what I wanted to do. Felt like I had no meaning in life.
I didn't want to work with science anymore. Actually, I never wanted to be a doctor, I just liked the research I was doing. But now not even the research interested me anymore.

I stopped med school and signed up for new degrees, Computer engineering and economics. I had a scholarship for economics and didn't pay tuition there. I have always been good with tech, so I thought I would be good in computer eng.
At the second year of computer eng and economics, I started to lost interest. I had no friends and felt quite strange having classes with people 2 years younger than me. Also, I never had much of a social life. At 23, I signed up for an entrepreneurship club and started becoming interested in startups. Attended a lot of events and created my own. It got featured on the news and won several awards, but unfortunately, it failed. 
This kept me busy for around 2 years, while still going to school. Because of that startup, I lost interest in studying economics and computer eng degrees and my grades started dropping. I stopped those degrees.
Then, I decided to backpack by myself during the summer of 2013 to 12 countries. In September 2013, since I didn't know what to do I got back to med school. I had lost all my friends I had previously with so much change in my life. I had a hard time studying in med school this time. Still, I finished the bachelor of medicine (3 years) and kept going to the masters of medicine. Yet, I hate being at the hospital and dealing with people. I am a very shy person and don't enjoy being social.
In 2014, I did an internship in an hospital abroad, and backpacked alone to 15 countries.
In 2015, I signed up for a masters in biomedical engineering in my former engineering school. I found it hard to keep with the math classes because my bachelor is in medicine. I started losing interest again. 
Meanwhile, I kept going to several tech and startup events. In one of them, I met an investor who gave me a part-time job as his assistant. It was my first and only paid job. I still want to create my own startup and work for myself. I started learning web development on my own but after a few weeks, I lost motivation.
Currently I have two exams and a thesis to finish med school but I don't want to work as a doctor.
Since, I have to be waiting for those two exams, I signed up back in economics degree to finish it but I am 27 and most my colleagues are 19. Also, I am still signed up in my master of biomedical eng and going to classes, although not really motivated. I had a professor complaining about my lack of motivation. A lot of my colleagues wanted to go to med school, and yet there I am, taking biomedical eng classes.
Also, I have a very big interest in aviation, had several flying lessons and loved it, thought about becoming a pilot.
I also love photography, painting, traveling and exploring new stuff. I am a very creative person. I have also worked as a model.
Because I am very shy I started taking acting classes a few weeks again to help me with my public speaking. I have a friend who is a movie producer and invited me to play the shy girl in his movie. I really liked the environment on the movie set and thought about making a short movie on my own.
I am currently 27 and I don't even know what to write on my cv.
I don't like meeting new people because I never know what to say to tell them when they ask what I do with my life. I always get in an existencial crisis every time someone asks me what I am working on.
This has a huge effect on my social life, preventing me from meeting new people and not knowing what to tell them. Because of how confused I am and all these changes, I could never maintain a relantionship. I am always anxious about everything and get depressed because I can't talk with anyone about this confusion on my mind.
Also, I started using tinder in 2014 and had dated many guys, never being able to maintain any relantionship because of how confusing I feel. I always go away, I don't want to bother people with my problems. I also feel like dating keep me distracted from my professional life. 
The only thing I know is I want a job that allows me to travel to anywhere, be flexible, working for myself, preferably, web related, that allows me to be creative."

How do I proceed?",cs_employment,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/790c5o/2_years_of_graduation_no_cs_job_irrelevant_work/,"After graduation (Summer 2015), I immediately began to cold apply to every single relevant job I could find online. It lasted for about a year, and a lot of rejections. Also, a lot of dead ends with recruiters. After a year, it felt so bleak. More and more time passes, it looks like it was getting harder to find a job. All I see in the job listings are repeats of certain companies, and not many new listings. It was a vicious cycle, and I'm feeling like I'm unemployable. There aren't many positions available from what I am seeing, and I'm not shooting high.

All this time, I was working at a family business so I could assist with anything I could. I figured employment in *anything* is better than nothing. After a year, I essentially stopped applying as much (maybe a few jobs per month that looked interesting) and focused on the family business.

I had professionals look into my resume and the only main thing they could say was, ""You should have taken an internship."" Honestly, yes, I could have. It is not possible now. Also, not being employed in CS for two years makes it very difficult to find a relevant job. My overall GPA was 3.7 and major GPA was 3.9. However, I do not find it helpful considering there is a huge gap between school and now.

At this point, I am wondering what can I do to get started? I have been trying to get started for the past two years. Should I take classes? Work on more projects? Learn more? Any recommendations on where and how I should look for job listings?

* When I sit down to study, random thoughts will jump in my way of focusing. If I block certain websites, I will either think of a way to get around it or think about something random that I wouldn’t have thought to block.

* I accept these tangents because I won’t want to work. The physiological joy I can receive from these tangents is often much higher than doing most work.

* Only stress and occasionally passion force me to actually do work.

* Lately, I feel more and more like there is always time to do work when there isn’t. This lying to myself worries me.

* All of the above create a snowball effect. If I catch up, I start the above process all over again. If I don’t catch up, grades suffer.

* I haven’t hung out with anyone all semester long. I don’t like talking to most other students because quite a few are either immature, lazy or partiers. I don’t think this is a big issue. I’m not a social person but occasionally I will have a longing for social contact which I will remedy by forcing myself to go to a college groug.

* I’m not taking the initiative for my career. I haven’t looked for internships. (sophomore)

* I copy others work and improve it/couple it with others. I’m not sure about the last time that I wrote an original essay.

* I will cheat during tests. (notes on calculator)

* I won’t touch my computer without washing hands a few times. Also, I feel scared that where I am working (table) might be dirty so I will use a flashlight to check for any. Sometimes, I will clean a desk to use it. This is unfortunate because it often takes time. The mere fact that it will take time makes me put off doing work that needs to be done on a computer.

* I don’t actively study. I will only start studying 4 days in advance.

* I rarely get enough sleep. I often dream about waking up at around 6 and exercise to start my day right. (Maybe exercising would help my focus.)

* I’m not understanding the material; just regurgitate. 

* I’m doing 1 thing right; brushing and flossing every day. I haven’t missed a day in the past 3 months. The only reason for my diligence is that I had 15 cavities and a root canal on 1 tooth where a filling had to go too deep.
* Family moved away at the start of the school year.

* I take more time to learn something than others. However, when I know things, I know them well.


Any advice is helpful. Book recommendations are also welcome."

1. 
I interned for a startup last year(it was part time while I worked full time somewhere else, it was also unpaid), it was me and a couple other guys. The 'boss' was smart but basically biopolar, he asked the world and I delivered what I could but ultimately things fell between the cracks due to everything I had going on(and the fact it was unpaid). Anyway I put this experience on my resume because the tools I used were unique. Now the time has come to verify my backround so i reached out to him(asking if he would be comfortable verifying that I worked there). He basically told me to fuck off and that he wouldnt say anything positive if somebody were to reach out him because of my constant lying and flakiness? None of which is true. I established prior to starting the internship I had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the team, I also have all the code for the projects I wrote and the data I used.

What do I do? Do I just take it off the background verification form?

Second questions

2 . I worked on a team like 3 years ago for a small &lt;50 company, they are asking for a reference to contact at the company but I dont know anybody who works there anymore, there was a mass exodus when my entire team left. What do I do? Do I just give them the contact info for somebody I worked with then who is no longer with the company?

However, I do not like how little computer science focused classes there are even in the ECE technical core. UTD's CE major seems to be more CS oriented as well.

791wor,1,2017-10-27,Looking for advice regarding roadmap for pursuing a software job without a CS degree,cvspharmacy123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/791wor/looking_for_advice_regarding_roadmap_for_pursuing/,"I am posting on behalf of a friend who has graduated with a masters in Material Science and an undergraduate degree in EE. She is currently doing an unpaid internship doing chip design and a bit of firmware, but wants to move to the software side of things since it is booming and easier to get a job in. Her experience in coding itself is marginal, and has only done a bit of low-level coding for firmware design, so straight up trying to interview would not work out.

I am a software engineer myself, but was lucky to get a degree in CS from the start, so I am not too sure what the best course of action would be. I personally see three options:


1) Study on the side and do a few good personal projects. This would be the cheapest and probably require the most dedication / hard work. I do think given the immense amount of resources online that one (especially someone with an EE background) could establish sufficiently solid fundamentals in data structures / algorithms to be prepared to competitively interview for the market in the span of 6 months. The problem here is the lack of branding and resume-boosting that would enable acquiring interviews themselves.

2) Apply for a degree in CS. I am confident undergoing a second masters in CS would allow getting a job in the industry, especially given my friend's background, but I do not think this would be worth it money-wise. Also, this would involve way too much time than necessary. But perhaps there are more cost-effective and short-term online degrees that may be worth it?

3) Taking a 4-6 month bootcamp. From what I've read here, the general consensus seems to be that bootcamps are a scam. However, if money is not too much of an issue (especially given they are way cheaper than re-enrollment to college), this would be a good way of forcing studying on oneself and establishing some basic networking for career roles. This, combined with enough dedication and tailoring of the resume seems like a solid option in my opinion. The only issue here is I am unsure of whether partaking in a bootcamp is resume-worth material. Would it attract recruiters enough for branding? 

What are your thoughts? Personally, I am leaning towards suggesting the bootcamp option, because I think it is most cost-efficient and time-efficient, especially provided enough dedication. But the main issue I have is whether bootcamps in general help with boosting the experience portion of your resume. "

**GRE (unofficial): V164 Q168**


I want to pursue a Master's degree with a focus on **machine learning and / or natural language processing**, but I'm having a difficult time determining the range of schools I should be applying to. Ultimately, I would like to get a PhD at a top 20 university, and get involved in CS research at a competitive R&amp;D division or laboratory. Therefore, it's important for me to find a place that is productive in terms of research in ML / NLP. I'm especially interested in grad schools in **Canada**, but I'm certainly **open to other suggestions**.


To give you an idea about my profile:


I graduated with a degree in computer engineering from the most internationally esteemed university in my country with a subpar GPA, which was mostly caused by poor performance over a couple of semesters during which my family was going through a rough time. I did get back on track, and did fairly well in the last three semesters though. I was wondering how those obvious and sudden transitions in my transcript would be interpreted by the admission office? Should I address the reason in my SOP, or just leave it alone? I also ended up graduating in the **top 10 of my class** anyway, so that might be worth mentioning. (Yes, the highest GPA that year was ~3.7, and the second ~3.5, which I know seems ridiculously low compared to most other schools.)


As for experience, I worked at a **large defense company as an intern**, and later at a **robotics laboratory** participating in **deep reinforcement learning research** for a few months. I also spent two years working part-time as an **undergraduate TA**. Unfortunately, I have **no publications** or serious research experience to speak of. Not sure if these are at all relevant, but I also played chess in the national junior team, and the violin in my country's first amateur symphony orchestra, whose establishment I took some part in. I have a few decent LORs, but I'm still unclear as to what constitutes a ""strong LOR"".


That's basically it. I feel incredibly incompetent, and afraid that I might not get in at all. Currently, I'm considering **U of Montreal**, **U of Alberta**, **McGill** and **Simon Fraser** to begin with. Are all of these too ambitious for me? Should I aim somewhat higher - or lower? What other schools should I look into?


Many thanks in advance!"
792co1,4,2017-10-27,Confused about degrees,lostcareergirl,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/792co1/confused_about_degrees/,"Hey :) My story is quite confusing and I don't know what to do. (English is not my first language so sorry for any mistake.) I never knew what to do with my life or who I wanted to be, yet I have always wanted to do a lot of things, not one specifically. In high school I was super smart, always getting good grades. In the summer of high school I did several research programs at college and even won a scholarship to do research in another country. It was the first I visited another country. At 18, I got in medical school and had pretty good grades. At 19, second year of med school I was a research assistant, got a paper published and was a teaching assistant for biochemistry lab classes. Actually, I felt medical school quite easier than what I was expecting, at least in those first two years (in my country, med school lasts 6 years). During that year, I had a major family crisis and started to thinking about all my life and what I wanted to do. Felt like I had no meaning in life. I didn't want to work with science anymore. Actually, I never wanted to be a doctor, I just liked the research I was doing. But now not even the research interested me anymore.
I stopped med school and signed up for new degrees, Computer engineering and economics. I had a scholarship for economics and didn't pay tuition there. I have always been good with tech, so I thought I would be good in computer eng. At the second year of computer eng and economics, I started to lost interest. I had no friends and felt quite strange having classes with people 2 years younger than me. Also, I never had much of a social life. At 23, I signed up for an entrepreneurship club and started becoming interested in startups. Attended a lot of events and created my own. It got featured on the news and won several awards, but unfortunately, it failed. This kept me busy for around 2 years, while still going to school. Because of that startup, I lost interest in studying economics and computer eng degrees and my grades started dropping. I stopped those degrees. Then, I decided to backpack by myself during the summer of 2013 to 12 countries. In September 2013, since I didn't know what to do I got back to med school. I had lost all my friends I had previously with so much change in my life. I had a hard time studying in med school this time. Still, I finished the bachelor of medicine (3 years) and kept going to the masters of medicine. Yet, I hate being at the hospital and dealing with people. I am a very shy person and don't enjoy being social. In 2014, I did an internship in an hospital abroad, and backpacked alone to 15 countries. In 2015, I signed up for a masters in biomedical engineering in my former engineering school. I found it hard to keep with the math classes because my bachelor is in medicine. I started losing interest again. Meanwhile, I kept going to several tech and startup events. In one of them, I met an investor who gave me a part-time job as his assistant. It was my first and only paid job. I still want to create my own startup and work for myself. I started learning web development on my own but after a few weeks, I lost motivation. Currently I have two exams and a thesis to finish med school but I don't want to work as a doctor. Since, I have to be waiting for those two exams, I signed up back in economics degree to finish it but I am 27 and most my colleagues are 19. Also, I am still signed up in my master of biomedical eng and going to classes, although not really motivated. I had a professor complaining about my lack of motivation. A lot of my colleagues wanted to go to med school, and yet there I am, taking biomedical eng classes. Also, I have a very big interest in aviation, had several flying lessons and loved it, thought about becoming a pilot. I also love photography, painting, traveling and exploring new stuff. I am a very creative person. I have also worked as a model. Because I am very shy I started taking acting classes a few weeks again to help me with my public speaking. I have a friend who is a movie producer and invited me to play the shy girl in his movie. I really liked the environment on the movie set and thought about making a short movie on my own. I am currently 27 and I don't even know what to write on my cv. I don't like meeting new people because I never know what to say to tell them when they ask what I do with my life. I always get in an existencial crisis every time someone asks me what I am working on. This has a huge effect on my social life, preventing me from meeting new people and not knowing what to tell them. Because of how confused I am and all these changes, I could never maintain a relantionship. I am always anxious about everything and get depressed because I can't talk with anyone about this confusion on my mind. Also, I started using tinder in 2014 and had dated many guys, never being able to maintain any relantionship because of how confusing I feel. I always go away, I don't want to bother people with my problems. I also feel like dating keep me distracted from my professional life. The only thing I know is I want a job that allows me to travel to anywhere, be flexible, working for myself, preferably, web related, that allows me to be creative."

I'm gonna try to keep this short because I want to vent but not rant. 

All I'm gonna say is, I really enjoy the major. I spent three years in college doing electives trying to figure out what I want to do and I love comp Sci. But I haven't programmed until the semester before I got into the major and took all my easy, least time consuming courses already.  I am also generally a slow learner, but I do my time and I do my best. My logic is it doesn't matter how you do as long as you enjoy it and do your best, and yes, I am on the C-B- side if the spectrum for most courses except for a few. 

But lately, these elitest, those who are the fastest learners, or have experience, or just gets it better than I do,  make me feel like i shouldnt be here even though I think i deserve to be here because I worked to be here and that's why I got here. I spent my time looking for what I enjoy most and this is it. Even if a lot of these elitest who don't say it to me, but rather those who might complain and/or are in the same position as me (but obviously more vocal about it), the responses they get tend to make me feel crummy and depressed.

However I've been in an internship and been told I'm doing great because I do the time needed and work outside of work, so it's reassuring but I just get bothered by the elitism that tell other students they shouldn't be in the major... "

I've been lurking on this sub for quite a while and have learned a lot, so thanks to all of you who answer noobish questions from people like me!

Anyways, a bit of background about me: I'm a second year CS student at a pretty prestigious CS school (not Ivy, but up there in respect). I currently have an internship this summer with an automotive company, but otherwise I have nothing impressive to show (disregarding some cool projects made in class).

Currently, I'm planning to easily graduate at the end of next year, but I'm a little bit concerned by this. I would only have one internship under my belt before I start applying for actual jobs, and from an employer who's name is highly recognizable but isn't a real ""tech company."" After reading around on here for a while though, I feel like this one internship won't really be enough to help me stand out and get a well paying job post-graduation.

To remedy this, I've been thinking about getting a Masters at my current school. I could start the Masters during my undergrad (I'm pretty sure that's allowed), and have it done in 1-1.5 years, bringing my education up to a total of 4 or 4.5 years. Additionally, this Masters would give me an extra summer (maybe two) to nail some hopefully good internships which would really boost my resume. I probably wouldn't have to take out loans for this, as I think I could survive off my upcoming internship, as well as the internship of the summer right before my Masters.

Overall, would it be worth it to pursue graduate school? The pay bump suggested by my school's history is pretty significant, and I believe the extra internship(s) would really help me land a good job. However, the fact that I would be losing out on a full year at a company would be bad for actual experience as well as having a real paycheck for a year.


Thank you all for your help!

On the first transaction, their webpage showed error when I submitted my order. So I made a new order with the same exact item, address, and debit card number and this time it went through. I got the 'order placed' page and the order number. I have this screen saved as a proof, because they never sent me an order confirmation email. I recently found out that I was charged twice with the transaction and I assume that the first transaction still charged me even though there was an error and the order was incomplete and not submitted. So I contected their customer service, and on the live chat, they said that they could not find any order placed under my name or email account. I gave him the order number of the second transaction and they said nothing came up with the order number provided. I asked him if he's sure that there was no payment or order made by Visa ending-xxxx(my debit card) and he responded that there was no payment or order made by me. I have this conversation saved. I looked up my order number myself and nothing showed up. I saved this screen as well. The transactions were 453.59 dollars each, so total 907.18 dollars payed to Guitar Center.com. It shows up as POS DEBIT GUITARCENTER.COM INTERN 877-687-4242 CA on my chase bank account. I looked up 877-687-4242 and its Guitar Center in Lawnsdale CA. So I payed twice for a digital piano twice by an error yet Guitar Center denies that they have received any order of payment from me. I contacted Chase. Is there anything I can do? Is there a hope to win a debit card dispute like this? What do I do if Chase doesn't solve the problem?"

I work for an MSP and including my internship I've been here for about 2 1/2 years. This is my first job out of college. In my internship I was given a lot of responsibility and started solving problems that our senior engineers couldn't but still had a lot to learn. In the time between then and now, I finished school and dedicated a ton of time to learning as much as I could.

Now I am the company firewall/network guy, I head most of the server projects that include installation and configuration. Tier 1, 2 and 3 support. Internal projects that included rebuilding our entire domain after our main server crashed. I've implemented a brand new test network and introduced a documentation system to help keep track of knowledge better. I go to pretty much all of the new client meeting to pitch our company and have to prepare demos, presentations and what not. 

The issue is that for what I do relative to the ""senior"" engineers, i'm severely underpaid. I end up picking up the slack of others that should be my mentors but still argue ""We stay away from GPO because it's a bitch to get working"". The company doesn't have enough money to give me a raise which I know is true but it has been said that it's being worked on. As it stands, I can't live on my own because I can't afford it.

There is also a trend of writing me off because I'm the younger guy. I bring ideas that will make us more efficient and effective that a lot of the time get shot down because ""We tried that and it didn't work"" or ""people will never use that"" These things include imaging that is sort of in the works, good documentation and other pretty key things to have in order in today's I.T. world.

So I'm stuck between do I jump ship? ( They have invested and trusted me a lot with things, but a lot of the times I get interupted and talked over before I can speak.) I don't want an interviewer to say ""oh you're 24 and didn't stay at your full job for 2 years"" or ""you don't have enough raw experience"". I know a good deal and have made myself a student to the trade, I have a ton to learn for sure but I don't want to be written off because of my age and time at my first job.

Or do I stay and ride it out until I get to two or so years and then start looking to avoid that? I've never quit anything in my life so this is all very foreign to me. Thanks for taking the time to read and I appreciate any and all suggestions."

First off I'd like to thank everyone who contributes to this subreddit, it's been an invaluable resource. I'm a third year geology major pursuing a minor in GIS at the moment. Based off the advice I've seen in this sub, I plan to learn a good deal of python, SQL, and HTML/Javascript before I graduate. My general goal is to break into the GIS industry with a technician position, hopefully working my way up to becoming a developer. 

Fortunately I go to school in the DC metro area, so there are plenty of GIS jobs to go around. I'm just concerned that I won't have an adequate background. It would be hard for me to get a GIS specific internship this summer as I haven't been able to enroll in any GIS courses yet, although I'm taking the introductory class this winter.

I'm trying to find if I might be a fit into the IT industry. Right now I'm in college and considering an information systems degree. I do have one issue which is I have a learning disability in math. Taking something such as computer science would be a death wish for me due to how slow I would have to go learning the math and possibility of failing then taking the classes over again. I would rather focus on my current strengths than mentally flog myself for years to come! As far as the math is concerned I have taken business calculus in school and did just fine. But I'm trying to see if there are other avenues in the IT industry that aren't veering into calculus and the like. I know experience is a big factor in this industry and I would like to give context to what skills I have been trying to develop. Right now I have dabbled in python, ruby, perl sql. I have also messed around with vmware trying different things out and seeing what I can break and how to fix it. I have no issue going to google and trying to figure a problem out (is it wrong to use that as a starting point?). I have been looking more into logic and troubleshooting more since I was an electricians apprentice before college. I'm also interested in networking. Also, if I were to go this path would it be feasible to shoot for an a+ certification and demonstrate my current skills to get some type of help desk job while in school to continue learning and try to move into an internship later on?

I'm in my second year (total 3) of University studying Cloud Computing. For the past 6 months, I've been living in this constant case of 'imposter-syndrome' where I feel the competition is just too good or I'm just too unskilled to make a career in IT.

I'm a huge tech nerd, watching tech YouTube videos all day (LinusTech, Barnecules, MKBHD, Jay) I'm interested in business integration with cloud and IoT, these things do intrigue me - I'm not **PASSIONATE** about it as to say I think about this stuff all day, every day but I'm pretty confident I want to do this for a career. But I constantly live in this mindset that at 22, probably 80% of my peers are already just much more qualified than I am and I'm never going to get a decent job. 

My Bachelor's courses give me a basic knowledge of databases, networking, cloud technology, project management etc - but forget my Bachelor's degree, it's a mediocre University, I'm talking about hard practical skills here. 

* I don't have any certifications like a CCNET/CCNA or CompTIA. 
* I'm just alright with code - very basic. (Python, HTML/CSS) 
* I have zero meaningful work experience.
* I'm at a 3.41 CGPA

I have 14 months to graduate and I am expected to find a decent job **instantly** paying about Singapore $13k+ a year (South Asian family expectations) 

I know where I have to go from where I currently stand, I know I need to work towards the things I don't have, but I need to know where the competition is - generally. 

Does the average 22-year-old kid studying IT already have a nice list of certifications, knows 6 languages of code, worked on like 2 dozen mobile + desktop apps and interning at the best places? Because that's what it feels like... 

Basically, I just need to know what companies expect from a 22-year-old student/freshie who wants to make it in IT. How much 'technical' knowledge do you expect me to have to make decent pay? 

Reading the ""Qualifications"" section on freshie job/internship openings doesn't answer that question because just fulfilling those qualifications doesn't mean anything, it's probably never even enough to get called for an interview - there's always someone smarter or more qualified. 

I've so far been rejected for 34 internship positions (30 unanswered applications and 4 no-call-backs after the interview) I'm still applying - But been 4 weeks and no luck.

By now, I’ve already been well acquainted with the importance of obtaining an internship, so I figured I should start moving towards searching for one. 

Given that I’m still getting used to life-after-high school and that I’ve never worked a real job a day in my life, I figured you guys could share some wisdom so that I reduce the amount of mistakes that I might make.

I’ve already had a couple of offers and my university is supposedly good at linking people to offers as well - so that’s not a huge problem.

First of all, what do internships want to see in me? What could I do to make myself stand out amongst my peers?

Secondly, I hear that even the lower-end internships pay pretty decently. What kind of a salary should I be looking for? I require some numbers.

Moving on, I don’t really expect to land an internship with any of the big 4 right off the bat, but I would like to aim for the middle at least. What companies at that level could I be able to reach out to? How can I identify a company worth interning at?

How far in advance do I have to apply for internships? I’m willing to start during any semester - even this coming Spring - so when should I be applying?

Finally, since our field is based on technology, I’d assume that it’s possible to work from home/long distance. Is there any benefit to this over working in person? Should I just stick to trying to find an opportunity locally?

If you have any other tips that you believe will help me, please do include them, Thanks in advance, folks!

To fully explain, there is a lot that goes into this decision for me. For one, exams end for the semester of studying abroad around June 1st, and I know that a lot of internships begin in the middle of May. I don't want study abroad to hurt my chances of getting a competitive internship, but I also don't know if I can ask the potential employer to push back the start date a few weeks.

For background, I've wanted to study abroad for years, probably since early high school, and I desperately want to travel and see outside of the United States. I've already had two summer internships up to this point, but I'm wondering how important having an internship between junior and senior of college will be to my job prospects after I graduate (I want to work in the TV/film industry). I also wonder if studying abroad would give me  an excuse for not having an internship this summer if that ever came up in an interview.

Of course, it would be difficult financially to cover both studying abroad and having an internship (which could be either paid or unpaid). I'm planning on applying to internships in LA, New York, and Chicago, so the cost of living there for the summer would be somewhat high.

I would also have to figure out the logistics of the internship and do interviews while I'm in Europe. Plus, this semester I would have to both apply to internships and figure out the logistics of studying abroad in addition to class and life.

I hope this doesn't come off as a privileged problem, because I know I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to do either of these things. I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice, because I'm torn! "

796tjo,41,2017-10-27,Deployed my first app!,unix_in_20_years,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/796tjo/deployed_my_first_app/,"6 months into my first job, and I deployed my first app today and just wanted to share my experience.


**The project:** It was a horrible, horrible project. It is an application written in 1996 in CICS COBOL, running on BlueZone Mainframe. We were tasked to rewrite it completely into a Java webapp. The application is a fairly small CRUD app, but it was still challenging for someone straight out of school.


**The team:** The rewrite was started two months before I joined. This includes my supervisor who doesn't know Java and was basically the project manager, and a CIS-major intern who was the other coder. 


**Development:** Once I came aboard, I was basically tasked with all of the coding. I missed two months of design/planning/requirements, which really hurt. The intern's code was really bad, and I ended up taking over his work and rewriting most of it. I had to learn a lot by myself, and now I understand why people say most of what they learn is from Google. 


I knew Java well, but there are so many things they don't teach you in school. I was never taught local/test/prod servers, version control, deploying WAR files, J2EE, etc. I had to figure out how Java servlets and JSP interact. And on the way, I learned some Bootstrap, finally understand what jQuery and Angular are, and my SQL skills have increased ten fold.


**What I learned:** Get shit done right the first time and you don't have to worry about it later. This feels like it should be my life motto after this project. There were so many days where I was just lazy or naive and hacked together some solution that works, only to have it bite me in the ass a few months later.


Planning is the most important part of development. Don't be short sighted with your solutions and try to look at the big picture. Sometimes looking at the big picture will lead to simpler solutions as well.


And most importantly.. **Ask questions**. Don't be afraid to look clueless and ask if you're not sure about something. It's better to look clueless than to actually be clueless. For example, if my co-worker was explaining something he did with JBoss, don't just nod your head like you can Google it later and find it out. Save some time and just ask ""what's that?"""

The case is that I currently have got admission of 18fall 'master of computer science' on-campus program from an U.S. university.
But it's ranking in usnews is not very high as Gatech, just about(60~70).
 
Therefore, I think the OMSCS may help in some extent when hunting job or internship.


So the questions are:

**Do you think it will be worthy to pay extra 7000$ and time for the second MSCS degree at Gatech online, in order to have a greater chances to get jobs or internships of Big company(like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon) ? **

**And secondly, when hunting for internship or job, how should I write in resume about two CS master programs at the exact same period? Should I specify the GT one is online? Or just list one of them? Or others? **

  I am a rising junior at a large state university (our mascot is a nut). As of now I am on my second internship since beginning college. 
   My first internship lasted about eight months as a marketing intern for a small holdings group that owned over 15 fitness clubs throughout the state I live in. Overall I did not learn a great deal in this position and it was mostly a summer/part time job at $12.50/hr. 
   Last summer I accepted my second internship at a large multi-national cooperation where I am an intern within the Supply Chain Management Department. Here I have many responsibilities and earn a decent amount at $14.40/hr, but after 1.5 years I am growing tired of the same routine every single day. My supervisors often congratulate me on doing well in this role however I do not see myself working for this company after graduation even though it would be a great, steady, average career sitting in front of a computer 40+ hours a week. On the plus side I do get a few privileges, the biggest being the ability to work remotely from home half of the week so long as my tasks are completed. 

Here is where I need advice: 
   Next week I am interviewing for an internship position at a small start up company with just over 40 employees. The office is in the major business district of my city and closer to my apartment than my current job. Even though this company is small with only two offices (one in my city and a headquarters office in Manhattan) they have a great reputation and seem to have a fun/unique office culture. I was told by the company recruiter that wage is negotiable and my responsibilities as an intern would be far less strenuous and stressful than my current position. Also after proving myself as a capable addition to the company I would earn the privilege to work remotely a fraction of the time which is great due to a full class schedule during normal working hours. 

If offered the position at the smaller company, would it be wise to leave my current role where I am almost guaranteed a job after graduation?

How would I go about negotiating my wage to be at or above what I earn currently?

Is there anything I’m forgetting to consider?

Sorry for the wall of text, I’m just trying to make sure I add all the necessary information! Thanks for reading!"

- Now I'm 20 years old, have been in college for 4 years, and am still a solid 1-2 years away from finishing my ""4 year"" degree in computer science.
- I still depend on the medication (Vyvanse) pretty seriously to even be slightly functional, but my 40-50mg dose is starting to barely affect me.
- My prescribing doctor retired, and the new doctor is suspicious that I'm selling it on the side. He's started having me take regular drug tests, but for some arcane reason the Vyvanse doesn't always show up even though I take it daily.
- I've been suicidally depressed, getting monotonically worse for about 2 years. Mostly because of ADHD related issues, failing or barely passing classes that I could probably TA, as a result most of my friends are graduating and I'm still here
- idk if this is because of the depression or adhd, but I've had horrible insomnia for as long as i can remember. I've lashed out at friends because I thought they were rudely ignoring me, when in reality I just tend to forget that some people don't take 5 hours of shuteye to fall asleep
  - This has been going on for as long as I can remember. I take **at least** an hour to fall asleep, and about twice a week I'll lie down, close my eyes, and be perfectly awake until I hear my alarm going off 5-9 hours later.
- Alcohol has been a very unhealthy coping mechanism since I started going to college. I'm still underage, but have never had trouble getting liquour, and the **only** way I can fall asleep reliably is if I pass out.
  - I'm afraid to get sleeping pills, because I would probably try to use them to kill myself.
- The only thing I can focus on is my work on side projects. I'm really passionate about some technology, but never finish a project. I have literally ~100 half-finished software projects, most of which started out as digressions from the others. my friends are tired and annoyed by how every week I'm working on another ""next best thing""
- I interned in Europe at a very prestigious company the summer before last
  - the internship went well
  - i made a really good friend who is coming to America this Spring to finish her studies
  - to save money she's flying into a city close to where I live, and i promised to drive her to Austin
  - i want to ask her out, but i really can't because i don't think that anything will make it better and i don't want to lead her on just to probably kill myself slightly later on and make her deal with my mania and depression
- I know I should try to get help, but i'm afraid that if i bring it up to my friends they'll see me as broken and unstable and if I bring it up to my doctor i don't know what would happen"

79anud,37,2017-10-28,EE tips and stuff,Zippotro,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/79anud/ee_tips_and_stuff/,"So I posted a thread before about EE/physics classes and some people asked for a full ""guide"" about the ECE department. So I finally have a break to do it. Also I've noticed there's people coming from CC's that are having a rough time so I'll try to give my perspective that may or may not help. 

The reason I am doing this is because I had such a shit time coming to UMD for the first two semesters and I want people to have a better experience that I did since its not worth having such a bad time. 

And to give a quick background of where I am coming from, I am a senior in EE/physics graduating this Spring and starting grad school here next fall.

So I'll start with EE things (links will be at the end). If you started here as a freshman I can't really speak for the classes 140/150/205/244/CHEM135. But I can say the math classes will require a lot of work to pass that may put you off thinking about engineering, don't let that get you down. The Math Success program is a great place if you need help for math related classes. So for some of the intro/advanced MATH 140/141/241/246/461 this is a great place to go if you are really struggling (its free too). But as for higher level classes and (FYI I will not trash teachers I am only going to mention the good unless something needs to be said):

101- I am a TA for this class and it is pretty much an intro to a wide range of things offered in the ECE department. This class is also one of those classes that can be hard depending on the TA. You will be introduced to basically programming... There is not much with circuits which is really infuriating and not much to do with physics aspects of EE. But on the upside you do get a good exposure to MATLAB, signal processing, image processing, and how code makes things work. So these lessons are very important. I wish I had a class like this to take since I would have liked the MATLAB experience and just coding in general. 

200: it sounds like this isn't a thing anymore but if you wind up taking it, take it in the summer with Lawson so it's actually an ethics course instead of a writing course. [1]

222- This class is pretty much all math no matter who you take it with. It introduces you to the Discrete Fourier transform and the applications in signal and image processing. A lot of people thought this class was easy because the tests were straight forward depending on your professor. I thought otherwise, I had a difficult time in general. So just put in the effort to do the practice problems and you will be fine since its just math. You ""learn"" some MATLAB but this depends if you have the prior work. I didn't have the work so I struggled on the labs but in the end it was worth it. 

245- This class is a lot of wrong. It is all Verilog programming and some circuit building. As long as you put in the effort and do each lab and pre-lab with good faith effort it should be an easy A. The Lectures do not matter too much but it depends on the teacher you have. I had Candace for everything and she was great! Also, the TAs for any lab class make or break the class. If you get a good TA cherish them and ask them if you really get stuck. If you get a poor TA... I'm sorry....

303- This class was great if you like circuits. You learn about some device physics, diodes, BJTS, MOSFETS, more op-amps and small signal analysis, and digital logic circuits. The difficulty and topics covered varies depending on the teachers.

350- Now... if you are an EE major this class may be the worst class you take. If you are CE then you will most likely like it more. I had a professor who did mostly hardware and we didn't do much assembly programming. But all other professors put a strong emphasis on assembly programming. So this class is mainly coding and how does the code make the computer processor/memory work. Also you will learn different computer structures such as MIPS. This is what I learned but I know some of the other teachers use different structures/languages or use structures that they created themselves...

322- This class is all signals and systems. This means more math! The class is a lot of math with more calculus than 222. So it will be hard if you don't do the homework or don't do the practice. I had Dr. Simon for this class and he was amazing. Everything was fair his homework would prepare you for his tests. I don't know why people didn't like him. He answers questions well, he cares about students success, but his lectures are kinda dry for most but if you like math then you will like him. Other than that don't take Dr. Wilson... 

380- This class is mainly ""intro"" E&amp;M which more calculus three involved. So do some review on surface/line/volume integrals and you will have a decent time. This class makes a lot of unreal assumptions that will make problems easier to solve but other than that you will learn about electrostatics, magenetostatics, induction, Poynting vector, energy, and Maxwell's equations. It is a great class is you like physics since it is physics. If you aren't the physics type then just be prepared to work a bit harder. 

381- This class is amazing if you liked 380. It applies everything you learned in 380 and throws away all the crap assumptions so you actually solve real problems such as transmission of E&amp;M waves across boundaries and so forth. Its a lot more applicable so it may be easier than 380 for some. But for others it is a lot more math and more complicated math at that. So make sure you have a good background in complex math/phasors (you should know this by now in EE if you don't... for shame....).

313- This class is mainly about semi-conductor physics. As of right now don't take this class with Dr. Illiadis. You learn about minority and majority carries and the consequences of them since this is how diodes, BJTs, and MOSFETS work. You also learn about opto electronic devices. Since I am taking this right now I don't know much else! 

324/307- I haven't taken yet so I cant really write too much:
324- This is a probability class with applications to electrical systems and signals. So in some ways it is going to be very difficult because of the math involved but as long as you can find a good teacher which would most likely be Dr. Papamarcou, Dr. Shayman, or Dr. Simon. There was one more but I forgot his name. 

307- It is like 245 but only has 6 labs that span 2 weeks each
that cover circuits using diodes, BJTS, op-amps, and MOSFETS. The professors don't matter toooo much but Dr. Newcomb gives a final in this class thats 45% of your final grade so yay.... I am taking him next semester so we shall see what happens. 

Now as for the 400+ level electives I will speak about the ones I have taken most of the 400 level classes I have no clue about since these are specialist based. 

489Q- This class is more or less an intro to quantum mechanics and its applications to some EE phenomena such as quantum communications, quantum computing, band structures, and some electronic devices. If you have a strong background in quantum mechanics it will be a relatively straight forward class. (I did have a background in it already so I attest to this) If you do not then it will be a little more difficult. 

Capstone 408E: This is the optical system capstone class. Now this is a weird one. In EE you are not exposed to much optics/lasers so this class is really difficult to judge. I would like to do optics/photonics/nanophotonics as research so I knew this class would fit for me. But if you have no clue about it and if you are still wondering about what capstone you want to pick it may be the one for you. The reason I say this is because most capstones are geared toward signals/controls and microelectronics and designing things using typical EE material. This class is all optics. You learn and design optical systems. It starts out with ray tracing and moves into more complicated things such as Gaussian beams, grated indices, general optical systems, oscillators, and more. 

411: CMOS design, focused on ASIC type stuff. A lot of this is how to make stuff from 303 work the way you want it to. [1]

413: A more in-depth version of 313. Didn't seem to be all that much different between the two. [1]

428: DSP lab. More of a programming (C) course than anything else. Four labs that take one or two weeks each (how the I/O works, signal generation, filters, and AM mod/demod), then it gets more complicated (FM and digital stuff).
MATH461/2/3 are all solid. I found 462 (PDE) the most interesting of the three.
Transferring with an ASE: you have to get the requirements to apply to the engineering school to transfer first, then they consider the ASE. So if you're like me and took calc 1 and 2 at yet another school, you have to get them to transfer first (and the initial response I got was to send a final transcript, even though I wound up taking a year off in between). I also wound up having to take an extra three credit gen-ed elective, but I got to pick the category, so I took econ200 (took macro for my ASE) and that let me take intermediate macro (305) for a gen tech. [1]

499/499L: DON'T FORGET ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY. This is a senior research class. I posted a link below.

690- This is an introduction to quantum mechanics with a big twist. You learn more applications through examples and you will go farther into the textbook used so you will cover more such as perturbation theory and identical particles. If you have had a quantum mechanics course before then this class will be challenging but not as bad as it could be.

Now the department in general people do complain about but from my experience there hasn't been much issue. If you show initiative and take care of your admin paperwork before hand you will be fine. This department I find will really help you out if you can do things on your own and look things up yourself. Nothing will be hand fed to you unless you initiate you interest in something then opportunities will start to open up! Advisers can be more helpful if you can come up with some ideas about what you want to do in the future and what classes you want to take. They are there to help you about anything including life! I love all the advisers in the EE department, they are always on your side. 

But if you have a hard time trying to come up with plans it will be more difficult. Now if you are having troubles trying to figure out what you want to do with your life but you know you want to do EE just be patient and something will find its way to you. A lot of my opportunities I could not have planned out. Just keep putting in work and you will be rewarded. 

I don't know what else to add as of now but I will continue to make edits depending on what people say. I hope this was kind of helpful.

i am going on a abroad internship for 20 weeks as a game developer and i want to bring my pc workstation. 

I heard from some forums that the best way to do that is to take your pc appart and just pack it all in their boxes in your luggage. 

It needs to be in my luggage. Is there anyone who has experience with this or is willing to help me? Is this the way to go or am I missing a obvious solution?"

I've done a lot of reading on this sub recently, but would like to know what I can **specifically** do to make myself a better applicant. Ideally, I'd like to aim very high and shoot for the ""best"" programs. 

I am interested in pursuing a MS or PhD in EE, focusing on some sort of signal processing/machine learning/computer vision. Also might be interested in applying for some sort of Applied Math/Computational Science sort of thing. 

That said, here's where I am at right now:

* 3rd year EE major with minors in Math and Data Analytics at a top 50 US school
* Very ahead in credit. By graduation, will have taken at least 5-6 graduate courses (all will be relevant to what I want to pursue in the future) at the minimum as electives for my undergrad degree
* Work Experience: Just did a data science internship at a start up, where I wrote production level code and worked on machine learning models. Had basic exposure to a Convolutional Neural Net. Also did a few basic data analytics type of projects. Prior to this internship, I did a couple of basic engineering internships that aren't relevant to what I want to do anymore. 
* Was a TA for a circuits class
* 4.0 GPA right now. Expect to finish with at least a 3.94 (absolute worst case this will drop to 3.85 by graduation)

Anyone have any advice for how my profile is right now for top EE programs, and what I can do to improve? Thanks!"

I was moving to different state for an internship, but it just so happened that my sister lived in the city I was working in and she was actually moving out of her apartment. Her lease didn’t end for another 3 months and I was going to be there for only three months so it made perfect sense for me to move into her apartment. It was a really small studio with very few things so she basically left me everything the way it was. When she left, there was still some
Items in the fridge and some in the cupboard but not much so I assumed that she had gotten rid of any food that was about to go bad. 

The apartment had a really small kitchenette area that looked like it was installed a century ago. It had a few drawers that didn’t really open all the day and I think it was missing a drawer but the space underneath  it seemed inaccessible and I never really tried to store anything in it or underneath so I just assumed there was nothing there. 

A few weeks in my new apartment and I start to notice some fruit flies. I just assumed that it was because I was leaving fresh fruits and veggies out in the open and they were attracted to them. Didn’t seem concerning but it was bothering me so I just started storing all my fresh fruits and veggies in the fridge. I also started closing all my windows so that they wouldn’t get in. It didn’t seem like anything I was doing was making a difference and there was somehow even more fruit flies every day when I would get home from work. They started getting into my fridge somehow and I was really confused about how they were getting in. I would get home and have to clean my fridge every day because there would be dead flies all around the edges of the door. It started to give me so much anxiety because I couldn’t figure out where they were coming from or how they were multiplying. I stopped buying fresh fruits and veggies all together and I set up a few apple cider vinegar traps. It seemed like it was working for a few days so i decided to start buying some frozen fruits and vegetables. Before I know it, they start getting into my freezer. What was bothering me is that the fact that they were even trying. They would die immediately  from the cold. I was also really confused about where they were multiplying because as far as I knew, I had cleaned out any type of food that wasn’t refrigerated and I had even cleaned out my fridge of anything they could possibly breed on. 

It was getting so frustrating that I set up even more Apple cider vinegar traps..They weren’t helping and I was losing my shit at this point. I was running out of patients and healthy food options Just picture a 150 square foot apartment infested with fruit flies. I couldn’t sleep at night because I was scared they would crawl into my ear, couldn’t prepare food because I was afraid they would lay their eggs on it. I was at the brink of setting my apartment on fire. 

I somehow made it 3 months living in this hell hole and the day I finally had to move out was a relief. Little did I know that the flies were just the tip of the iceberg. 

My sister came down to help me move out and clean the apartment. At this point I had told her all about the infestation and it was a mystery to both of us how this was still going on. As we’re cleaning the last remaining things, we manage to pull out the problematic drawer I had mentioned earlier and boy we didn’t know what was awaiting us. The entire portion underneath the cabinet was covered in maggots. It looked like they were feeding on a sack of potatoes that had been there for way too damn long at this point. I started dry heaving and couldn’t even fathom how we were going to clean that up. We couldn’t just leave them there because I knew I wouldn’t be getting my security deposit back . Thankfully my sister has more balls than I do and she strapped on some gloves and mask and somehow managed to scoop everything in the trash. It was probably the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen and It still gives me chills when I think about the fact that I was just living with a maggot infestation for 3 months. 


TLDR; didn’t realize there was a sack of potatoes underneath a broken drawer that caused a maggot and fly infestation. "

I know my Berkeley GPA will be way below those of other applicants, but will my past academics and activities from high school and community college give me any chance at transferring for my sophomore year?

79ctvl,5,2017-10-28,Putting first degree on resume,OddFeatureOSU,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/79ctvl/putting_first_degree_on_resume/,"I'm curious as to whether any of you include your first bachelor's degree on your resume, especially those with a STEM degree. My first degree is in Mechanical Engineering with a math minor, so it's certainly relevant to CS and was enough work that I'd hate to just act like it doesn't exist. One concern I have though is that I really didn't do anything with the degree. While I liked some of the problem-solving aspects in my classes, I really didn't like mechanical engineering itself and always had trouble speaking passionately about it in job interviews. I never did any internships or worked in the field, so I'm worried that while the degree itself may seem impressive, it actually reflects poorly on me to have done all that work and paid a ton of money and then give up on the field and degree before I even started. I graduated very recently and basically went straight into this program, since I realized how much more I liked computer science in my last year or so of study. I'm also curious if anyone has been in a similar situation and has any tips about how to phrase the situation in such a way that it makes me look good. I'm very lucky in that my parents have been willing to pay for this way too long experience of me finding out what I want to do, but when I tell people this story, I can tell that they're judging the fact that I essentially threw away a very expensive degree. Don't worry, I judge myself for it too, but the past is the past and all that. I typically say something along the lines of that I was pretty far into the mechanical engineering degree before I started to have doubts, but I figured it was better to just finish the degree than to scrap it all and start over. Then I talk about how I started learning computer science during my senior year, and then discovered the OSU program, and realized that if I finished my degree I could then immediately use that to get into this program and get a CS degree. This is of course my ""interview answer"" to the question. Really, I dealt with serious depression and drug abuse during my first degree, and that, combined with my lack of enthusiasm for engineering, was the main reason I never made the effort to get internships or work in the field. I of course leave that part out of the explanation, but without that additional explanation I feel like I come across as flaky and non-motivated. That's why I'm wondering if I should just not mention that degree at all, and thus hopefully avoid interviewers prying too deep into my backstory. Thanks for any help!

TLDR: First degree in Mechanical Engineering but never did anything with it. Worried about how this comes across, but also don't want to act like the degree doesn't exist. Should I include it on my resume?"

My first mistake was graduating a year early since I wanted to save some money from college, (I severely regret not getting another internship). My second mistake was joining a large tech company and relocating to the Midwest from the east coast for an engineering role.

Since starting (I have about 1.5 years experience now) I realized that the job wasn't for me. My entire team is all concerned with watching their own asses and everyone communicates to each other with a guise of feigned friendliness. Besides the work environment, I've pretty much become increasingly isolated from living alone and having 0 friends or anyone to talk to at all. I started looking for a job about 10 months ago... Every day I dread waking up from this rejection filled search which keeps my life chained to this repeated cycle of waking up, going to work, coming home defeated, and playing video games and applying to more jobs.

I probably got a 5% callback rate from online applications for entry and mid level software engineering roles earlier on my search, but now I barely get any callbacks whatsoever after applying to 300~ companies, small and large. I mostly get rejectedat the resume  stage. The ones that don't I usually got pretty far with (had onsites with Microsoft, Google, Bloomberg), but didn't manage to get an offer in the end. I don't think my technical interview performance is particularly poor (I've done CTCI, EPS, &gt;300 leetcode problems and have even passed the onsite technical part at one of the aforementioned companies only to find the position was filled). But the issue is that I literally cannot get any interviews anymore.  I've pretty much been at my wit's end as of recent because I send out a bunch of online apps only to be welcome by the ""Thank you for applying"" email. It baffles my mind how completely random this process is when I've gotten interviews from highly selective companies before but I've pretty much been rejected instantly by all random no name companies as of recent. I've mostly used LinkedIn to find positions and then applying to them there.

I just don't know what to do or what to do to get a damn offer at this point...

A little back story he gave me, he was hanging with the wrong group of people two weeks before he tuned 21 (2011) a few years back. And he was suppose to be the lookout but got cold feet some how he got caught along with two others. He said he wrote a BS confession letter not naming names even though he wasn't caught with anything but suspects the other two turned on him because that's what detective told him &amp; he said and that's why he wrote the confession. 

I guessed after he turned 21 and started university, a month went by he went to court and pleaded not guilty but since the judge said he already wrote his confession letter, his attorney told him that the judge took into consideration that this was his first time in trouble and he was in school he would only give him 2 weeks in the county jail.
  
He missed our midterm exams that year before the holiday break and had to drop out and go to CC the following year.
He completed his second associates of applied science in Cybersecurity. Now he's been applying for internships &amp; entry level jobs for the last two years and working odd jobs. But he hasn't been getting anywhere with the IT jobs and he's starting to think it has too do with his little Larceny incident.

Anybody have advice that I should tell him? We've been studying for our Network+ and Security+ together, I just don't want him to get discouraged and not think it's for nothing.

Additionally, I am unsure about my chances in USC. I've heard it is pretty acad-centric and at my GPA I might be striked off pretty easily. I am considering not applying to it if that is indeed the case.. can someone gauge my chances for USC given my gpa? Also, does anyone have any other suggestions for safe colleges?


Thanks a lot for your input!

79h609,2,2017-10-29,Can one recommendation letter from professor and two from internships help in MS applications?,jessicalousie,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/79h609/can_one_recommendation_letter_from_professor_and/,"The university applications for MS in Computer Science requires 3 recommendation letters. I am confused between choosing my professors or industry mentors. The problem is I have seen in some places that it is preferred to provide 2 letters from professors.

Potential people:

* Assistant professor
* Mentor at a remote research related project from a prestigious university
* CEO of an internet based company
* Other professors/ head of department

I have a professor under whom I did several important research projects and have, also, taken his classes and labs. He is very pleased with my performance and he eager to provide a recommendation letter. He is an assistant professor at my university.

In case of other professors, I have never worked on any research projects so, the recommendation letter will be average in my opinion, as they will talk about classes and labs I took under them. This, also, applies for the head of the department. For this reason, I do not prefer to take one from them.

I did two remote internships and both are pleased with my performance. One person is from a very prestigious university. I am not sure as he prefers to keep the letter confidential. I did some research related work under him and basically, managed several teams.

Another person is the CEO of a company and is expected to provide a strong letter as he is pleased with my performance.

I am confused regarding whom should I approach for the letter? As this will be an important deciding factor, kindly share your opinions."

Thanks to everyone's comments on here and in /r/GradSchool I did some souls searching for a few days and spoke to a bunch of advisers. I've got a plan.

Hello Reddit intellectuals, I need some help. 
I’m a junior at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. I’m having a small crisis because I’ve begun to question what I thought I wanted to do with my life. Below, I will break down my background, current position, goals, and options. I’m asking for help choosing a path.

Background

Coming out of a private Virginia high school, I was recruited to play baseball at Johns Hopkins University. There I decided I wanted to major in Microbiology. I was interested in Genetics and curing diseases and such. After a good year there (starting pitcher as a freshman, 3.6 GPA), I decided to transfer to James Madison University. I’m enrolled in the JMU Honors College, my major is Biology and my minor is Spanish. I decided in sophomore year that I was drawn to ecology and I wanted to do field work in Latin America. I wanted to play baseball at JMU, but after playing club as a Sophomore (due to NCAA transfer rules), I wasn’t good enough to play on the team as a junior, so I’ve given up the sport. My GPA at JMU after sophomore year was a 3.9 (Organic Chemistry ☹).

Current Position

-I’m dissatisfied with my major. Going through college, the only thing I’ve found that I truly like about biology is the animals. If I want to graduate on time, there’s only a select few majors that I can switch into. I will elaborate in the following sections. I’m upper middle class and my parents are paying my way through college, they support me doing an extra year or two if I need to. I think it’s helpful to explain what my actual interests are.
-I love animals but I have no experience working with them and so I don’t know if potentially following a zoology type of route will be for me either. 
-Nothing involving sports interests me despite my baseball history. 
-I think something like architectural design/industrial design would interest me considering the following: I love solving puzzles/problems/logical tasks. I loved and was incredibly adept at Halo forging.
-Game design currently has my eye. I’m working on a board game for my honors capstone project. I talked them into letting my do a creative project far outside my major. I don’t have any programming skills to speak of, but I think I’m good at picking a target audience and saying here’s something novel they’d really like. 
-Generally, I have an interest and/or a talent in most things academic; I enjoy writing, creative or formal, I excel at math but have little interest in it (after a 5 on the Ap BC Calculus exam, that was it for me), I can appreciate lab work but that can’t be all I do in a job- I need human interaction, psychology is fascinating and Sherlock Holmes is a role model of mine, history/archaeology are topics that I have enjoyed but will certainly pass on. 

Goals

I’ve always wanted a PhD. I want to do something I will at least enjoy on a daily basis. I want to make good money meaning potential for 6 figures. I want to graduate on time- my girlfriend and I would like to graduate JMU and go to grad school together. I’m thinking about UVA for grad school. 

Options

This is where I need help. Note that I am primarily asking for advice in choosing a path that will give me the ability to figure out what I want to do with my life. I believe that over the next year I’ll figure out what I want to do, but unfortunately choosing spring classes comes in just a week or two. Therefore, I believe it best to pick an option now that will keep my options open for the future. Given that, here are the options I’ve come up with. 

-Option 1

Major: Sociology
Concentrations: Social Inequalities and Public Policy, Environment, Technologies and Innovations
Minors: Biology, Spanish
Graduating: On time

-Option 2

Major: Biology
Concentrations: Ecology or none
Minors: Spanish
Graduating: On time

-Option 3

Major: Communication, English, Foreign Languages, Math, Media Arts and Design, Religion, Philosophy, Anthropology, Writing
Concentrations: Varied
Minors: Spanish, Biology
Graduating: On time or 1-2 semesters late

-Option 4

Major: Industrial Design, Architectural Design
Concentrations: None
Minors: Spanish, Biology
Graduating: ~3 years late

-Explanations
Options 1 and 2 are the ones I’m strongest considering. Option 2 is what I was planning on doing until this year. Option 1 is basically a résumé building plan. I am interested in sociology, particularly criminology but I don’t know if that interest would last. However, that option gives me 2 minors, 2 concentrations, I still graduate on time, and I get out of the major I feel out of place in. Option 3 consists of my real other viable options. Option 4 is the majors I would have considered when entering college as a freshman but didn’t. I would get my degree when I’m an old man (sad laughter). 
My grad school résumé would consist of one of the above options plus: Honors College graduate, baseball history as Freshman at JHU and sophomore at JMU, co-president of a Spanish club as a junior and probably senior, hopefully internship during this upcoming Summer, restaurant job last 3 summers, JMU undergraduate research journal publication (waiting on official answer to my submission), and high GPA of 3.9 or 4.0. 

So, Reddit, I ask you. How do I proceed? Assume my knowledge of everything involving grad school and applying is low. "

79hhby,3,2017-10-29,I think I'm done with teaching after this year: but how do I survive till June?,Chocolatechip_cookie,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/79hhby/i_think_im_done_with_teaching_after_this_year_but/,"It’s my third year teaching, but the first year that I have my own class from day one (full year replacement). I know that the first years of teaching are the hardest and in my province something like half of new teachers drop out in the first five years. 

Sometimes I tell myself that I just need to tough it out and it will get better (but I tell myself that far less often than I used to). Other times, more and more often now, I feel like it’s just not for me. 

I feel like I’m overwhelmed and not satisfied with myself even when I give it my 110%. I feel like I’m not doing a good job at school and I feel like I have no energy mental or emotional or physical for home. So right now both my work and home life are suffering. 

I’m constantly in doubt and often in tears (mostly at home. though this week I did have a breakdown at school, before classes started and managed to calm myself down and get through the day ok). 

I’m just waiting for the weekend and when the weekend does come I don’t even want to do anything. I’m scared of making plans because I might not have enough time to just sit and rest. 
I used to panic a bit Sunday nights the last two years, but I thought I had gotten it under control. Now Sunday-panic is back full force. Today I could barely get out of bed in the morning because I was already dreading my day as it precedes the week. 

I’m unhappy if I follow my colleagues’ plan (the whole year is planned out); I hate doing things exactly by the book and have everything given to me, so this doesn’t work well for me. I’m unhappy if I deviate from the plan; I doubt myself and then kick myself if something doesn’t go right or if I realize that the original plan was actually ok. I also doubly kick myself because I wasted my precious time and energy that I have so little of trying to re-invent the wheel instead of just taking what was maybe not perfect, but already done. 

I also sometimes feel like I’m starting to hate kids. Or maybe not hate them, but definitely get irritated when I see random kids on the street doing something. This has never happened to me before and I’ve been working with or being around children for the past 8 years or so (working at daycare, school internships, first two years working). This is a huge red flag for me because I’ve always wanted to be a parent and was so excited for it, now I’m not really excited about kids (not all the time obviously, but the thought does pop up).

Halloween is next week and I’m trying to work out my costume right now and I’m in tears again because FUCK THIS. We have tests and report cards and I don’t WANT to dress up anymore. I’m tired of everything. (I used to LOVE dressing up!)

It doesn’t help that my husband’s business is having a lot of trouble and I can’t afford to leave my job now.  

I’ve got to make it through this year.
ANY advice please!

The two most notorious one I know is Intel and IBM. Do these companies keep some kind of automatic blacklisting strategies? 
Also, in general, as an applicant, how do I find out if I'm being blacklisted by certain companies? Since they certainly don't tell applicant if they are blacklisting them. I'd rather not waste my time applying to these companies, like having some plugin to block their sites so I'm not wasting my time on them.

The quietly boisterous group of Lete’xians huddled around the professor’s notice screen, subduing as Quan’xar approached.  Drawing aside and creating a path for him, Quan’xar felt a sense of dread settle in his stomach.  Looking down the list of students and their assigned internships he finally found it: Quan’xar ~ Terra ~ Fright Night at the Fair.  

Manifesting a furrowed and questioning brow on the normally totally blank canvas of his face, Quan’xar turned to one of his classmates asking “Fright Night at the Fair?  Do you know what that is?”  Melodramatically forming glancing eyes on one side of her face and then the other, Shan’xiq used her well-developed stage whisper, saying “You mean you haven’t heard?  It's the toughest assignment that Professor Cre’tax has ever given; he must really think a lot of you!”  

“Well clearly he thinks a lot of me, I have the highest grades in the Stage Program, so no wonder it was given to me.  But what is Terra? It sounds positively frightening!”  At that moment the professor’s door opened. Professor Cre’tax gazed out over the crowd and he indicated the request of Quan’xar’s presence for the brief –pre-internship screening without forming any defining physical features, such was his skill with the theater arts.  Imperiously weaving his way through the hubbub of inferior students, Quan’xar swiped the door closed behind him and settled into the chair in front of the desk.  

As Professor Cre’tax began to set the meeting timer, Quan’xar began to ramble “I’d first like to say welcome back from your sabbatical professor, I’m sure touring the inner planets must have been riveting, I’ve always wanted to travel and experience more; I’m sure it would assist my acting ability, when even…”  Cutting him off, the good professor quickly spoke “I’m sure it would, that’s why I’ve decided to test your skills on the birth planet of the newly discovered Human Coalition”

Drawing himself up with pride, Quan’xar said “ I won’t let you down sir.  But as they’re so new, do you have a psychological profile of them? I need to know what physical attributes and mannerisms to practice creating so I can provide the most stimulating performances!” Grinning almost evilly with a newly formed and sharped toothed mouth, Professor Cre’tax tapped on his wrist communicator and swiped a file over to Quan’xar.  Tapping to open the file, Quan’xar frowned as it failed to open.  Clicking the error message, and manifesting overly large and dilated eyeballs, Quan’xar managed to squeak, “27 Petabytes?  That's bigger than some planet’s entire literary works!”

“Indeed”, replied the professor, “And this is only information pertaining to the Terran fear-responses.  I had initially planned on stopping by Terra at the beginning of my sabbatical but ended up spending the entirety of it there.”  Quan’xar absorbed his ridiculous eyes back into the flatness of his face and stroked his chin thoughtfully.  “Truly they must be an excitable species, these Terrans. I suppose I’ll have to seek help from the medical students in order to understand much of this.”  

Leaning back in his chair, the Professor queried “Now why would you need to do that, I was sure that the top student in the Performance Arts program would require no assistance.”  “Be assured Professor Cre’tax, I don’t NEED the help, but any species with a fear-profile this expansive must be in a constant state of near death.  I don’t want to mar my perfect grades with an accidental murder charge!”

Chuckling darkly, Professor Cre’tax assured Quan’xar “Oh don’t worry about their health, you might tower at least 4 feet above the average Terran, but you're much thinner and weaker; what with their heavier gravity.  Their physical constitution is not in question here.  The real cause for the thickness of the profile is just how varied the average Terran response is to terror.  Terrans are not like most sapients, with an almost species-wide consistent response to specific triggers.”  Manifesting a frown, Quan’xar questioned “so what am I supposed to come prepared with? How can I succeed without a proper profile?”

Raising his hands in mollification, the professor gave his final bit of advice as the timer began to chime softly “The true task with the Terran internship is that it requires you to not master a specific set of skills, but to master imperfection.  What induces terror-piss in one Terran may induce gales of uncontrollable laughter in another.  Even within specific individuals, the fear-response may change on repeated exposure.  No, your task will be to effectively and consistently emulate the horrors of thousands of individualized sapients, with an unhelpful audience, shifting continuously depending on the environment presented to you.  
Wolfmen, Zombies, Demons, Vampires, even homicidal Terrans will become part of your repertoire.  To learn of these creations-and countless others-will be your task now.  Only you and your On-Site Advisor(Steve)will be aware of your goal.  With luck and diligence, you will return to us a true master of the arts.”

I shall be applying to grad schools in the USA (maybe Cambridge) for Fall 2018 for PhD in Chemical Engineering. My research interests are in Fluid Dynamics, Soft Matter and Thermodynamics but I wish to only work on theory. (I hate experiments and experiments hate me). It'd be great if you guys could take a look at my profile and give me some advice on my choices for grad school.

+ **Degree**: B.Tech Chemical Engineering (Possible Minor in Mathematics and Computing)


+ **College**: An old IIT (basically a pretty prestigious school in my country)


+ **GRE** : 334 (Q168/V166/A4.5)


+ **Toefl**: 120/120 


+ **CGPA**: 9.47/10 (major GPA is 9.91 or something, I have the highest GPA in my department if that means anything)

+ 2 summer internships: Both funded by competitive fellowships. 1 was in India and another in Germany . My bachelors thesis is a sort of a logical conclusion of these internships and is related to the work I want to do.

+ **LOR**: [1] one from BTP prof, [2] one from internship prof I'm publishing with, [3] one from prof in my dept. (Can expect all of them to be great / good letters)


+ Publications: One is in the process of being written up but it wont make the deadline :(


Schools I'm considering: MIT, UCB, Cornell, Stanford, Gatech, Princeton, Purdue, UIUC, UMass.


Are my choices overly ambitious ? If so any recommendation for ""safe"" schools with good Chemical Engineering programmes ? Thanks in advance for any advice !

79ila4,1,2017-10-29,Why am I feeling so detached from everyone around me?,adriasea,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/79ila4/why_am_i_feeling_so_detached_from_everyone_around/,"I moved to a new place a month ago, and for the first time in my life I'm feeling completed detached from everyone around me. Everyone is new – my flatmates, my colleagues at work (even though it's an internship, so a temporary thing) – and thankfully nice, but I'm finding myself keeping all of them at a distance, and I don't understand why. 

It's like I don't care about anyone, because I know that in a few months they won't be part of my life anymore and I most probably won't ever see them again. It probably has to do with the fact that I've been travelling and moving a lot in the last few years, and especially this year. I usually get along with people, but then things come to an end and we part ways I end up not seeing them anymore, because our lives always go in different directions.

This time, I find myself not putting any effort in the people around me. I enjoy their company and I'm happy to go home to a lively flat (I have three flatmates), because I know that otherwise I would feel really lonely. But in the end I don't really care about them. It's like I'm turned off around everyone. Only once I went to a meetup where I really had a lot of fun, even though I just talked to a few people for a couple of hours. It was the first time I felt really alive since I got here. I know what you are gonna say: then try to hang out with them, go to other meetups, get out and meet people. I'm trying, really, but honestly in this city there is not much going on in that sense – the one I went to is a monthly thing, so if I'm lucky I'm gonna see the same people again in a month.

So going back to the problem, I don't understand what is happening to me. Am I just protecting myself? Am I emotionally exhausted? I don't see my life getting more stable anytime soon – it's hard to find a job in the field I'm interested in, and I'll go anywhere I need if it means that I can get more experience. But I feel like I really need more emotional stability. I keep in touch with family and friends, but it's different from being part of their daily life. I feel like I don't belong anywhere.

I am currently in my last year of Computer Engineering and managed to secure myself a job after a 3-month internship with a start up company. The company is small, and the job is focused around software engineering/development which is what I want to pursue as my future career. I’ve been there for a year now.

Overall I have it good, the job is super super flexible with uni, the pay is good 35p/h , they give me an apartment above the office for free in the heart of Sydney and work is pretty laid back. But with saying all this is there are some flaws. My house is 2 hours from the office (one way), my girlfriend’s house where I stay at for a few days in the week is 2.5 hours from the office. So typically, I go up there and stay a few days and come back down (still not bad at all!). Also, the work environment is great but in terms of learning software dev and how companies build and test their product it’s not that good and I personally don’t see the product getting very far, so prospects seem slim. 

There is a position in my home town (5 min from my house…..) which is in the similar line of work but the company is well grounded with a solid product and income (current company doesn’t have a client yet). Only issue is the position is an Internship with a potential job after 3 months. 

I don’t know what to do. I like my job now because its good pay and super secure, but the travel is bad even though I don’t do it often and the work itself isn’t amazing. When I say, “isn’t amazing” I mean in terms of experience, I don’t feel like I’m learning a whole lot of useful stuff and the way things are managed seem to be a little odd, e.g. “no unit testing…. or standard convention, its just do your own thing and make it work….”. My fear is leaving my super secure job for a job that could possibly only last for 3 months, and be less pay, but if it works out could potentially be a good opportunity.  

In the end of the day I feel like my current job is just a gig for me to get experience in the industry while I am at uni, but when I finish I can’t see it being very beneficial in the long run. Yes, the work is easy, and the money is good, but how useful is that if the company runs itself into the ground (seems likely in the coming years, but who know could turn into a multi-million idea). Everyone I talk to tells me to just stay because I have it good, but , I  stay in this empty apartment by myself doing uni work and hardly see friends or family and I’m not learning as much as I would hope. Has anyone run into a similar situation and if so what did you do."

I've already accepted the return offer and don't plan on re-negging, but I've recently questioned this path and wonder if I should look into a different second job like a year after I graduate.

Basically, how well regarded is this sys ops role? Will I struggle if I stay in it for 5 years and try to move to a different company doing more traditional engineering? Should I leave more quickly, or transfer within the company to traditional SWE?

I know the pay at my current company is the same for dev ops and SWE, but if I go to another company and take another dev ops role, is dev ops generally paid less or the same as SWE?"

79lx0g,6,2017-10-30,I feel so hopeless.,scarytesla,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/79lx0g/i_feel_so_hopeless/,"I feel like my parents have always and continue to spoil me without me deserving it. School has been making me feel like absolute shit. I'm studying architecture and if I don't raise my GPA by .1 (yup) by this Fall I'm going to have to wait until Fall 2019 to continue my education (this is my 3rd year in uni, 2nd out of 5 years in the program). If that happens my plan is to intern full-time so I can get plenty of hours, but I'm so scared I won't want to go back to school. I hate it. Raising my GPA by .1 seems like it'll be easy but so far in one of my classes my two (out of four) exam scores have been 60 and 42. I'm only taking 3 classes but I'm barely putting any effort into 2 of them. 

I feel absolutely exhausted all day. Caffeine makes me feel even more tired, and I really can't function if I don't take a nap at some point (I drive home at either 1pm or 6-7pm and I'm always falling asleep on the way). I barely have the energy to keep up with school, much less do any hobbies. I'm in a LDR (my boyfriend lives 7 hours away) and I only get to see him once or twice a month. My relationship with him is very important to me, and I often get sad that I can't hug him or physically be with him. I have a few friends, but in general I avoid physical contact with people as much as possible. I love my parents, but I just feel very uncomfortable having physical contact with anyone apart from my boyfriend.
I've been on medication for depression/anxiety for the past year, and while I've improved a lot, it kinda went from me feeling sad a lot to just feeling...nothing. I've become so much more apathetic. It's really hard for me to see any color in this world. I keep going because the logical side of my brain tells me that this isn't permanent, but I rarely feel any happiness in my daily life.

I feel like this is really taking a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend. He is a very optimistic, positive person and I feel so horribly guilty for bringing him down with my negativity. I feel like he deserves so much better than me. The only two things stopping me from killing myself sometimes are 1. Fear of what comes after and 2. My parents. I know everyone else will move on (and they deserve it, especially my boyfriend) but my parents won't. I'm their only child, the apple of their eye, they would NEVER get over my death. They would blame themselves forever, and I love them so much that I don't ever want to put them through that. I pretend that I'm fine so they don't worry, but fuck it's getting so hard. I've stopped going to therapy because I feel like it's just a waste of their money. I failed a couple of classes a few semesters ago causing me to lose my scholarships, and while my uni isn't expensive, I feel so shitty having them pay that. The worst part is that they just continue to throw money at me despite the fact that I'm barely putting any effort into school or into anything in general. Just this weekend I went to Universal and got kicked out within 20 minutes of being there, so $200 went to total waste. FUck I feel so fucking guilty.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm not going to get anywhere in life. I'm barely putting effort into anything (I seriously spend most of my time either sleeping or fantasizing about sleeping) and I feel like it's only a matter of time before my boyfriend leaves me. My anxiety causes me to make stupid assumptions makes me guilt-trip him and be passive aggressive and it just really puts a strain on my relationship. I hate it. I hate myself so much. I want to take a bunch of klonopin, zoloft, alcohol, sleeping pills, whatever the hell I can find and just die, but I couldn't put my parents through that. If you read all of this, sorry for the lack of organization. I just have a lot of thoughts and I seriously just feel so lost.

TLDR; School is stressing me the fuck out and I feel guilty as hell for letting my anxiety put such strain on my relationships. I have no idea what to do from here."

""Study, you will get a nice job"". All my life i have been studying. I have no single year in my life without a finished course. I spent my college years for free, because of my academic results had a good college scholarship. I spent it all to help my parents, and also get a good computer and some clothes.

I thought that, due to all my studies, i could easily find a job. But no. I never, ever worked. Not a single legal day. Only as trainee or internships in a few companies,everything related to my studies (cinema, sound, design, film, camera), and a few no-legally payed tasks. 

Looking for a job for years. Zero results. Lots of interviews, lots of ""call you later"" each month. This situation almost killed me. Literally, i tried to suicide because of this. Suicidal toughs are on my mind every single day. But don't mind about this. The issue is jobs. 

A few months ago I joined a startup accelerator. Started a project. Still looking for investors, but with no money to create a quality solid MVP, can really do much more. No job, no money. 

Nowadays i have no bills. But also i have no gains. Also, have 0 friends, i am on my own. I'm trapped, i feel old and drowning.

I keep studying, learning... But it leads to nowhere. What should i do? "

So my girlfriend recently graduated college and is currently working in HR. The thing is, she really wants out of the country. She firmly believes that nothing good ever happens to her here and it's hard to argue with the proof.

Her parents always give her a hard time. They always get angry at her for the shallowest of reasons. They also expect her to help out in finances like food for the whole family, even though she earns barely enough to send her six-year-old daughter to school and for her both of their necessities. 

She's also almost always at odds with most of her peers. When she was in school, she had disputes with her classmates, including her thesis partner. She also feuded with who I consider as her closest friend in her class, and it reached the tipping point during their internship together, and that affected her evaluation for the said internship. 

Recently, she also feuded with her roommate whom she works with as well. They disagreed on a lot of things regarding work, and often they also argued whenever they're together in the apartment. It also reached the tipping point when that roommate blatantly looked at my girlfriend's phone and read a message from me that she was entirely convinced was about her. We were talking about her roommate that day, but still, my girlfriend got really upset because her roommate invaded her privacy.

This, amongst other things back in high school, led her to believe that she's incapable of making any friends.

Work is extremely difficult for her too. This is her first job after graduating, and she feels that she isn't learning anything. The only person in HR with her just orders her around, even though he isn't her boss.

She keeps telling me that she'd do anything just to get out of this country and get a job, any job, even completely unrelated to her degree such as a service crew. We have exhausted every resource in trying to find a job abroad for her and still, nothing.

We live in a country where crime is rampant, where people get killed by other people every day, and where it never feels safe to walk anywhere anytime. We keep thinking that it's just a matter of time when it happens to us or to someone close to us.

I don't know if she is depressed, but she constantly contemplates suicide and the only thing taking her mind off that is her daughter. I can feel that she's lost all hope. She tells me that she feels empty inside and that she has no purpose in life. She keeps telling me that she is unlucky. She feels that nobody appreciated her existence anymore. 

I want to help her so much. I'm trying everything that I can. I've asked for help from my parents who are abroad, but they can't find a job for her either because immigrant worker laws are very strict. I'm still a Junior in college, so my options at helping her are limited.

I don't know what else to do. I love this girl and her daughter so much. I keep telling her that once I graduate I can help her with finances and even finding a job since she would accumulate multiple years of experience by then, increasing her chances to find a job.


But she doesn't want to wait. She has been waiting for the longest time for something good to happen and still, nothing has. It's understandable if she's losing patience, but I don't want to lose her.

Help.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend feels that nothing good ever happens to her, wants to move out of the country but can't because of lack of job offers and strict foreign labor laws. Feels hopeless and unlucky, and has contemplated suicide before."

I am in a period of transition and trying to figure out what to do to find an appropriate role so I'd appreciate some tips in terms of career growth and finding the right opportunity.


I've been working as a software engineer for a bit over two years now, (internships + a full time position as a SWE I) and am trying to figure out what I could do both to accelerate my learning pace and find the right fit. I am unhappy in my current role as I feel there is little room for growth (I'm writing very little code.) and my morale is also low as a result of several projects being cancelled or my team not having a road map.


I have had amazing opportunities in the past, and got the chance to design, code and launch things end to end, and work with several teams in order to achieve this. I loved every minute of it, the responsibility, the ownership, and the complexity of the projects involved.


As this is not the case anymore, I have started interviewing for various companies, aiming at more senior roles (I feared interviewing for a SWE I role would make me look like a job hopper, as I've been here for only a year, and I also want more ownership.). I got rejected for both positions I interviewed for, the feedback being I did great in terms of systems design and leadership but my coding skills are not there yet, because I am slow when refining my code and obviously unexperienced.


At my current company, the feedback is identical: super strong in terms of making technical decisions, yet I haven't proven myself code wise because I haven't had the opportunity to deliver a large volume of work. There have been many changes on the team, meaning there was a need for me to focus more on looking at tradeoffs and talking to other teams in order to see how to proceed. Coding? Not so much. The only coding intensive project that was assigned to me was proven unfeasible after an initial analysis.


I'm trying to work on coding in my spare time, with fun projects, yet I do admit I have very little time outside of work and feel drained. Should I find a super coding intensive team? Would it be worth switching companies as a SWE I? And if not, are there some roles out there that would benefit from my current skill set without me hitting a wall because of my coding skills? I want to find a right fit and not be told I'm ""unusual"" or ""miscalibrated"".


I must admit, I do like designing more than coding, and I'd like to do as much of that as possible when the time is right. I like putting the puzzle pieces together and understanding how it all comes together. I obsess over understanding why I am doing something and what alternatives I have, and more importantly whether it aligns with what others are doing or future plans. I also like talking to other teams, partly because I learn a lot, but also because I have a public speaking background and I get a kick out of presentations.


I am certain I need a change, as I am not growing code wise and the other kinds of things I am doing are out of my scope and I feel like overstepping. What type of work could I look into? What companies do you guys recommend in the UK? I know this sounds like a new grad first world problem, but I feel I am hitting a wall and want to be a better engineer.


Thanks!

I've always struggled with an on-and-off eating disorder since middle school, and when I was 15/16 I was **SEVERELY DEPRESSED** to the point that I wrote a suicide note and had begun to self-harm. However, when my parents found that note I told them I was just venting, and they never ended up doing anything about it.

I kind of just suppressed those feelings. After a while I stopped feeling suicidal, and went on to do a lot of normal things. I've had boyfriends, gotten a job, joined a sorority, plan to study abroad next semester, etc. But now I am slammed with work. I have 15 credit hours, an internship, write for five magazines, am part of several clubs... it got to the point that I dropped the sorority and cut off about 90% of my friends (literally sending a text out of nowhere that I couldn't be friends with them, it was awful).

I have obsessive thoughts all day. Thoughts about my weight, that I'm not good enough for my major, that I have too busy of a schedule, that I need to do something rash like shave off all my hair or drop out of college.

Now it's getting scarier. For the first time in 5 years I'm having those suicidal thoughts. I'm not self-harming or anything, but I sometimes I get so anxious I am completely disassociated and want to do something like jump in the road. It happens maybe twice a day, but the obsessive thoughts are always there.

I have such a normal life and normal parents. I'm not in financial distress, and all the stress is good. Like, I'm stressed I have ten interviews set up for my campus's paper this week, or that my internship gave me extra responsibilities. But my first reaction is to hurt myself.

I'm afraid to get help. I don't think I could tell anyone I have these self-harm thoughts, but I think I have major anxiety (NOT social anxiety). I just need advice. Can I get help without my parents knowing? Do I HAVE to be put on medication? I don't know, I'm just scared that this is happening after 5 years of normalcy.

**tl;dr:** I used to be very depressed and suicidal for NO REASON as a teenager. After 5 years of normalcy (and never receiving help) those feelings are coming back. I have obsessive thoughts all day about either hurting myself or doing something rash like cut off all my friends or shave my hair. I am unsure what to do.

**EDIT:** I've also seen major changes to my mood. Sometimes I am both excited and depressed at the same time. My sex drive (which has always been low) is the highest it's ever been, and my hygiene sometimes slips (like I don't want to brush my teeth or shower) even though I've always been a very hygienic person. Just things I forgot to add."

That wasn't the worst yet. Because understanding English for me requires active listening, random jokes, comments, or questions often caught me off guard. The times when I said ""Oh, what? Did you say something?"" are just way too much that I know it's annoying. I tried to fake laugh sometimes but ended up awkwardly quiet(cause can't follow up the conversation).

79rvte,3,2017-10-30,Help me decide on an internship - PwC or GE,Invicta12186,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/79rvte/help_me_decide_on_an_internship_pwc_or_ge/,"Hey all, I've been having a lot of difficulties deciding where I'm going to be spending next summer. I recently got two offers at the beginning of this month from PwC and GE Oil and Gas. PwC will be the START internship in the Dallas office, and GE Oil and Gas will be the Financial Management Program (FMP) in Houston. I'm very torn between the two.

To start, I'm currently a junior pursuing a Bachelor's in Accounting, and I'm looking to go immediately to grad school once I graduate in the Spring of 2019. I'm looking to sit for the CPA exam as soon as I possibly can. 

GE has outright informed me that I will get transportation and housing paid for during the summer with a wage rate of 21.50 an hour. When I complete their internship, I will be approached with an offer for a 2-year rotational program following my undergrad. Following the 2-year program, I will be approached with a full-time offer. 

As for PwC, I was selected for the START internship with a wage rate of 23 an hour. This will mainly deal with HR work, but upon completion, I will be asked to return the following summer to complete another internship in whatever department I'm interested in, whether it be Tax, Audit, or even Consulting. Additionally, the START internship will allow for weekly rotational roles in whatever departments I want so I can get a taste of what I like and what I don't like. 

Being very honest, I'm smitten with PwC's offer. I just got back from visiting their office last week, of which they paid for everything, and I was amazed at the work environment and staff. GE hasn't been nearly as inviting or interested as PwC has been thus far, but I'm still considering them nonetheless. 

One of the biggest concerns I'm having is that I'm still financially dependent on my parents. I've spoken to them about the offers, and they've expressed interest in GE because it'll be less money out of their pockets for the summer. However, one of my colleagues recently contacted me informing that he just got an offer from the PwC office in Dallas for the upcoming summer as well. If he signs, we'll more than likely be able to share an apartment for the summer, and costs for living will certainly be a lot less. 

Please, if you have any advice on helping me decide, I'm open to anything. Thanks!"

___

I got a return internship offer from the Fortune-500 company that I spent the summer doing full-stack web work with. I need to respond to by November 3rd.
The rate is average for CS internships in the area (~20/hr - Boston)

That being said, this semester I’m doing a lot more projects/hackathons/coding practice and I haven’t had a chance to have all of the interviews with the companies that I've applied to before this response date. 

I’m leaning towards saying no so that I can keep my relationship with the people at the company without leading them on, but I’m concerned that next summer I’ll be sitting at home doing nothing if I don't find a better option. Essentially all of my interviews in the past month have been duds.  

I spoke to my undergraduate advisor, and he told me to either push back the date or just say no entirely. He told me ""I can aim higher"" than this company and encouraged me to apply to REU's and other companies throughout the semester and find work more closely pertaining to what I'm interested in. However I get serious imposter syndrome when I think about going anywhere else. 

My ideal job is doing something related to Cognitive Science + CS (in industry).

As of now and I’m going to be doing an undergraduate thesis pertaining to NLP (if all goes to plan), and then potentially a masters program however this is up in the air as well. From what I’ve seen most of the jobs in this industry require master’s degrees so that’s where my primary motivation lies. 

___

Does anyone have any advice in regards to the timeline that I should pursue? 

Should I deny the offer (due this week), postpone it, accept it? 

Should I prioritize on getting an REU, or should I continue my search for an internship if these are what my interests are? 

Thank you CS folks.

Honestly, I would rather relax than take a college class in the summer, but if it helps me get into college I would gladly take it.

However, I've also been looking at some institutions that I could also intern for in NYC (I live near Boston but can't find anything). The only one I found was Bloomberg, but that starts 2 weeks before I get out of school.

So, my questions are:

* Should I take an NYU one-month long summer course? Will it help me get into NYU because I can show why I would be interested in applying?

* Should I take a summer course in somewhere closer to me (Boston, where I could commute)?

* Is an internship more important? Do you guys know any places where I could intern?"

I will be graduating in december. I worked an internship full time this summer for a life insurance company, and continue to work there part time.  
  
I worked on creating a predictive model pretty much from the ground up. I cleaned data on a hadoop cluster from around 20 sources into one final table for modeling which took me about 2 months. Then I used h2o (machine learning software) to create predictive models. I played around with gbm and deep learning models, but ended up going with a glm model because it was the only one I could easily explain to a regulator.  
  
I found my work to be very interesting, but I am just not passionate about insurance. Also I am sick of taking the actuarial exams. I feel that if I am devoting a large part of my life to studying I would rather it be relevant skills that I will use rather than mindnumbing repetitive calculations for techniques that seem to be becoming outdated.  
  
I have decided that I want to pursue data science instead.  
  
I was planning on getting my masters in either computer science(with a data science concentration) or applied math. I would like to do independent projects while I am getting my masters to develope a portfolio of work I have done.

My partner is a MA, and has been working at a local clinic for about 2 years. She started as a student from Southwest, got an intern spot, and worked her way up to a supervisor within a few months. They stay super busy at that clinic, seeing about 40 - 50 people on a normal day. Some of you might think that isn't a lot of people, but it's only her and 2 others from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM +. Her boss pays way too little for anyone to want to stay, and he refuses to attempt at a better workplace. People are quitting left and right, or having mental/physical problems from the stressful environment. All 5 locations he owns has the same problem, some worse than others. Over the two years of her working there she has gained terrible anxiety, along with knee pains. She wants to quit, but she can't because it would worsen her families financial strain. I'm trying to help her find another place of work, but it is turning out to be a huge struggle, especially because we live in an area where ""bilingual is preferred"". There are endless details I can give, but I don't know what ones would be useful. 


How can we go about changing her nightmare into a dream? Any ideas or advice would help! 

In short: Her boss is a satanic dick who doesn't care about his workers, but we are struggling to find her a job. We need help.

I'm really just looking for some career and life advice. I just turned 19 recently, and I'm somewhat starting to get a feel for the industry -- how recruiting works, and what kind of things people are working on.

Computer science is a field of study I've really come to enjoy in my past three semesters in school. So far, I've taken six CS classes, including data structures, algorithms, machine structures, and artificial intelligence. Next semester I'm taking a class on databases and a class on security. I love our classes here and sometimes I feel like I want to take every CS class we have, but I'm not sure if there's enough time. I'm also taking an upper-div stats class, and I'm not sure if that's something worth pursuing as a double major or a minor. 

I'm kind of conflicted because I don't really know what mindset I should have to be successful in the tech industry and to live a happy life. I came into Berkeley incredibly determined and hard-working. I studied for hours and hours, sometimes failing to leave my room for the entire day besides to get food. Because of this, I excelled greatly in my academics, earning the top score occasionally on exams among thousands of students. But as a result of my obsessive mindset, I neglected a large part of my life. I regret not putting more time into meeting people, joining clubs, and simply having more fun. Every time I relaxed and took time doing something fun, a little voice in my head would make me feel guilty for not studying. *They're going to get ahead of you*, it would say, ultimately making it difficult for me to enjoy anything. I would go home early on weekend socials so I could study and make sure I could stay ahead on my studies. 

I've been scared lately that though I might leave college with a good GPA, I won't have any fun stories to tell my kids. I have a dream to be successful and make it big some day, even though I really have no idea how and when I'll get there. As a sophomore, I've tried to diversify my interests and activities. Now I'm working for the university on course staff for our core CS class as a TA, and I joined two CS clubs on campus. I'm trying to meet more people and find more fun things to do. 

Is it important for me to spend a lot of my time towards academics? Should I focus a lot of my attention on getting an internship? I might have an opportunity to intern for one of the Big Four this summer, but I caught myself obsessing searching for a job just like I did about academics, and tunnel-visioned myself into thinking that working at Google this summer was the most important thing in my entire life. Ultimately my goal is just to be happy in life. I want to create something really cool and that can impact people across the world. I don't want to work in a cubicle for the rest of my life just like I don't want to spend all day studying in my room. I know that these are empty words and I might just be naive. I'm really just looking for some advice about for my remaining years at school, and for much of the rest of my young years.

Some recurring names I see are Two Sigma, Jane Street, etc. It seems much harder to get into those than a Big N company (just judging from people who post their offer statuses, non-representative obviously) and I wonder why so many people apparently want to work for them?

My thoughts:

* It's finance, so I'd expect longer work hours than in most other companies. Of course you can work yourself to death in any Big N (or startup, ...) too, but I got the impression you can also choose to have a fairly relaxed job with insane pay and interesting tasks, if your career ambitions are not super high.
* It's finance, so I'd expect a higher salary. Considering the insane salaries throughout the industry I don't understand why a fresh grad or intern would care so much about a few thousand dollars per year, are people really that blinded by money?
* The big X factor for me is their technical competence. Usually I'd expect banking software to be of rather low quality and their engineers not to have the best reputation, but maybe if it's some sort of fintech they hired/founded with around 5 extremely smart engineers and that's why theyre so coveted?

When I was hired full time I discovered that one of my friends was looking for an internship so I recommended him. A few weeks later he had the internship.

A couple months later they offered him a full time position (The same one that I'm currently in). He posted on Facebook when he got the job about how much he was making. My boss finds out and asks him to take it down, but obviously I saw it before it was taken down. He is getting paid the same amount as me, but he is getting paid hourly rather than salary...

We have the same job title, but I'm still WAY more experienced than him. I feel like I'm getting screwed and my bosses know it... Like they have to know I saw the Facebook post... I was the one that recommended him...

Anyways, should I be making a big deal about it? Or should I just wait until my time has come for a promotion. Feel free to put me on blast, if I'm being a lil bitch about something I want to know."

I'm currently a student in a part time MBA program, and I work 40 hours a week (full time). I started my degree in january, and I will be halfway done with it in December!

I am adamant to have a job secured before I graduate but I'm a little confused on how to go about the process. A lot of the rotational programs for companies I'm aiming for have the positions start in the summer. So if I were to apply for those programs, I would have to finish my degree in the summer (if I got hired...). It will be impossible for me to finish my degree in the summer, due to finances and work, so I didn't apply. I was kicking myself for not applying for opportunities, but I want to add more to my resume and actually start my major classes so I would know more about my major.

I've already started networking, but should I start applying to positions now? My resume says my graduation date of December 2018. Or should I apply futher along (summer/fall 2018) and try to get a contingent offer for a position that would start next summer? I'm a little confused on what to do, because while its never too early to network, it might be too early for me to apply. Also, I won't be doing an internship because I'm already working.
My major is Operations.

Also, does gpa really matter in interviews? I'm not aiming high but I was wondering how often it is asked etc.

Thank you."

79xdl5,2,2017-10-31,How do I break this to my team?,tamakerii,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/79xdl5/how_do_i_break_this_to_my_team/,"Some backstory: I'm currently studying at a tradeschool, and we have a quite empty period atm. I recently jumped on a project with a small team, I was sceptical about it initally but didn't have anything better to do so I thought, hey, why the heck not. I have been with the project for about 3 weeks now and my interest and motivation in it overall has not gotten any better.

And a few days ago, I got to know that I've gotten a really cool and challenging internship that I applied for, and I'm starting in the first week of January. This internship is somewhat of a dream position of mine, and I really want to start focusing on bettering my skills in that area so that I'm more prepared when I start in January. They even offered me to start the internship right away, but to be faithful to my current project, I said that January will be better. 

But now I'm feeling more and more fed up with this current project and what I'm doing on it. None of the skills I learn here will be applicable for me on the internship, and even though some might be in the future, it's not anything I couldn't do on my own. 

So right now I'm looking at a few alternatives 

1) I tell the team how it is and leave the project entirely to focus on preparing for the internship. That would obviously be great for me but the downside is that not only will I completely let the team down, I'll be half-lying to the internship since I then could start there right away. 

2) I talk to my team about either taking a couple days off a week, or leave the project earlier once my most important work is done, in order to have time to focus on internship preparation. This would be the nicest option to the team and pretty decent for me but I don't think they'll agree.

3) I stay on the project and get more demotivated and get no time to focus on bettering my own skills. This would suck so much because I've already started to feel reeeally tired of this project, and since I have to work quite a lot on it I have no time nor energy to do my own stuff. This will also harm the team since a demotivated person makes for more demotivated people.

TLDR: I want to entirely quit/spend less time on a project with a small team where I have a very important role, in order to practice more of the necessary skills for a super important internship I've gotten. Any advice?

I'm going to be graduating this semester with a double major in economics and computer science. Little about me, I started off as an economics major at first then decided to add a computer science major kind of late. I would've just dropped the economics major to a minor or just dropped it outright but the problem was I had already put in a lot of credit into the major and just dropping it felt like such a waste, especially when my family struggles financially (I go to a pretty expensive private school that gave me a scholarship but the COL is high). 

Additionally I wasn't really sure whether I wanted to do software engineering but taking more and more CS classes has gotten me much more interested in the field. However, it meant that I have internships but not any software engineering internships because I wasn't really sure if it was a field I wanted to get into yet. 

Fast forward to now, and I've been wanting to break into the SWE job field, but I don't have any SWE internships but I do have internships and only 1 small project at the moment.  Should I settle for an internship in the spring and work from there to have software engineering experience or try to lock down a junior developer full time role?"

I followed my sister's steps into going to a local school but that ended up being a costly decision (30k student loans currently). My parents wanted me to pursue medical school since I did well in school without trying too hard and since they've done so much for me I didn't disagree. After finishing my sophomore year, I started to have doubts about the career choice but had major sunk cost fallacy due to student loans and time/resources spent on studies. I wanted to do programming but kept hesitating and decided on biotechnology (90% biochem/10% programming). I find science related jobs easily and get some interviews for coding positions but end up getting cut when it comes to the technical interviews. I want to return to school for a CSE degree at the same university since that would make the fastest route due to most transferable credits and the school's good reputation but ultimately I would have to live in another city and take on many more loans. I am looking into scholarships/fellowships to minimize any part time work I would do. This would require lots of time/money but a friend said this would be the best method since I will have proper knowledge of the field and could go for internships between the years and get a good job to begin with after finishing studies.
The other plan I had was to do a coding workshop since it is a lot less time and money but I've heard some cons about this route as well since you don't get the in-depth knowledge needed. Another friend said this will at least get my foot in the door so I can work my way up or job hop once any learning opportunity runs out.
I don't really know which would be the wisest path since I really feel pressured by financial debt and being so behind compared to most people my age since I would be restarting a career. The science path I realized is not for me due to low earning potential, with high requirements such as masters/phd, and funky hours due to the work not able to being put on hold. I would rather take 1 step back now so I don't regret my future 40 years later. If anything, my main goal is to work in the programming field and gain lots of experience so I could potentially put my first degree to use in bioinformatics. I just want to make the right decisions because I feel lots of remorse and regret over many decisions I have made since I worked so hard/long for the biotech degree compared to many other students but end up with less job prospects/income.

I am not sure about this decision however, as I feel I will have to make some career sacrifices.

For example, this summer I will be working at a firm I really like as an intern, and could likely negotiate a full time return offer for after college. However, if I'm in the PC for two years that kind of eliminates this possibility, unless I re-apply after. I also don't want employers to see my 2-year gap away from programming in school and industry, and think that I am not as strong of a candidate for it. If I do go into PC, I would make an effort to maintain my coding skills and maybe work on some projects while abroad, if possible, but it would still be better to be fresh out of college, it seems. 

Another option would be to work full time for a year or so after college, and then go into the PC a year or so after college with this full time experience under my belt, but it's preferable for me to do PC before settling down somewhere. Could I get some opinions on this? "

I was wondering if anyone here applied to a Master's in Computer Science program without having a bachelor's in CS. If so, can you tell me a bit about your background and outcome?

I'm interested in applying to a few Master's programs in about a year. A bit about me:
- Undergrad: Economics, English from a top 20 school
- Masters: Math Education (Teach for America type program)
- Taught HS math for 5 years, got an internship as a dev which turned into a fulltime role (2 years experience total)
- Mostly self taught, am now slowly working through https://teachyourselfcs.com/ which I love. Web-dev, CRUD, aren't all that interesting to me.

Honestly I just love learning and while being self-taught has been fun and challenging (and never ends, really), I miss the formal environment of academia. I don't care all that much about the salary bump or whatever from the Master's.

I've taken a look at a few admissions websites (in Canada and USA) and some seem to be strict about the BS in CS, others not so much. I don't care about getting into a top-tier program, I just want to go to a good school for a few years and learn/work on side projects.

Thanks for the input/advice, and if this has already been asked elsewhere (I've looked) please point me there!

Bloomberg pays a little better for the internship (and full-time as well) I think, but it was my reasoning that Microsoft would be better software dev experience (I would be working on Azure with a pretty cool team). Also, NY cost of living would definitely be higher than Seattle/Redmond, so that's something to consider as well..


Additionally, if I end up not liking it, I'm wondering whether either would put me in a better position to go elsewhere (Facebook/Google?) if I wanted to down the line.

Currently on my resume: 

&gt;1) Year-long internship my freshman year at a well known tech company working on primarily IT/scripting work. 

&gt;2) Freshman summer unpaid SWE internship at a random startup. Pretty BS but still learned valuable skills. Personally I'd say this is my least impressive internship

My graduation date is set for December 2018, so I've been looking for internships for summer 2018. Now I have an option to intern in the spring + summer of 2018 for two different companies, or just the summer. I'll be able to graduate on time (2 quarters early actually) regardless and part of me wants to just go for the two internships, but I'm also thinking that it may be overkill at that point. 

Would it even be beneficial for me to have an extra internship in the spring? I thought it would be a cool experience as I would be able to make more money and experience another company but again having 4 SWE internships may seem a bit much. 

Note: None of these are ""Big N"" by any means, so it's not like I'll have 5 Big Ns on my resume which I believe *would* be overkill. "

Back in first year, stupid me thought I'd go academia for life, or even if I changed my mind I could just get any internship I wanted by showing off my 95+ average and IMO medal, so I opted out of co op. But last term I tried applying to a ton of ""cali or bust"" places (facebook, google etc.) thinking I was the shit, and of course got rejected from all without a single interview. It came as a shock to me, so I realized I was bad and started working on my resume to replace math stuff with CS.

Since then I've put in some personal projects, CS course I got 100% in, etc. I also took up competitive programming and got myself ranked in the top 0.5% on one website (I won't say which to avoid identifying myself) and joined a tech startup (which I love btw, but I'm not crazy enough to go full zuckerberg and quit school just yet). So when applying for winternships, I thought I'd be taking no chances this time around.

40 cover letters. 40 fucking cover letters to everyone from DE Shaw to the freakin Blackberry in Waterloo (Yes, they still exist), hand-crafted with love for each posting. And so far I've only gotten two responses: one rejection and a phone screen from some hedge fund in the UK. In my experience they usually reply within a few days or not at all, so I'm pretty hopeless at this point.

Am I delusional about being competent enough to land a 4-month code monkey placement outside of coop? I've asked my friends and no one seems to know what's going on, and I know for a fact that tons of below average coop students have no problem getting jobs. Is it normal for non co-op internships to be a fuckton harder to get than co-op ones, or am I just that incompetent? I know there are 25% rebates for coop salaries in Canada. It might translate to a slight advantage over non coop students, but at this point it almost feels like I accidentally deleted my entire resume and replaced it with a dick pic before sending it to every hiring manager.

My advisor said it's too late to switch back (streams are all messed up). Non co-op CS students who did internships, is it supposed to be this competitive? Does it get much easier to land a job after graduation? I'm incredibly frustrated and contemplating giving up on industry altogether and just sticking to a life of academia. I really shouldn't have dropped co op before trying it first. Fuck.

Thanks to anyone who read this far, advice or no advice. Sometimes you just gotta vent."
