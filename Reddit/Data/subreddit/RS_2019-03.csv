I'm a manager in my current position but applying for Software Developer jobs hoping to make a 180 career change. I have several large personal and school projects on my github, a 3.8GPA from Vtech, and a very solid track record in my current field. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I interviewed for a smaller (250 people) company I would very much like to work for in Salt Lake City but the recruiter said I ""might be out of their price range"". I didn't give a number, said ""Blah blah, more interested in finding the right fit and I'm sure we can come to an agreement blah blah"". She then said they are thinking 45k. I was a little surprised, I know with my lack of experience I won't be making 100k immediately but 45k is about what I make now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking to their CTO tomorrow and obviously I will stall until they make an official offer but what would you expect in my position? Is it common for recruiters to lowball? I don't want to over-ask and miss out on what otherwise seems like exactly what I'm looking for. It's a cross-country relocation too so I would want something for moving costs. "

avye23,3,2019-02-28,work rant and landing jobs without a clue what i am doing..has anyone else gone through this?,anonymousqueen820,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/avye23/work_rant_and_landing_jobs_without_a_clue_what_i/,"I started working in Supplier Procurement a few years ago. When I was hired it was entry level and the odd thing was that when i started, my boss was gone for the first month so I really just was given a laptop and watched some corp harassment and safety videos until she came. Once she was back, she kind of didn't have a lot of time to ""work"" with me. And I really just helped random teams....No one trained me, no one explained the industry and at one point someone left the company and they promoted me. Next I knew, I was being asked to train a few people and run a few video training sessions on things I was never even told about. Even had me walking interns through how to make calls and such when it was never even shown to me. My point to this was that, I did it, but I can't say that I did it ""right"" or that I really learned much. It was really just a case of faking it every day and honestly was stressful because I never had someone to ask questions to but followed up by no one having time to check on me so I was never doing something ""wrong"". So I moved on from the job because I didn't feel like I was ""growing"" properly. I wasn't learning anything other than how to bullshit what i was doing and I wanted to actually have a more viable skill. 

I moved on to a job in a different industry and different type of position and it was beyond hell. I had a horrible boss who was verbally abusive, calling me stupid blah blah. So I went back to working with Suppliers. Im not sure how, but I landed a job as a Procurement Manager. I manage another person in the team as well as the suppliers. During the interview I was never told I was managing someone. So I jump in, and guess what...another case where my boss isn't there for the first few weeks. Not only was she not there for the first few weeks but she works in another country. 

I was never shown what tools or really anything that the company uses, wasnt even told about the company or the industry and really just was told to hit the ground running. Is this normal? 

I get random requests for reviewing contracts, guiding suppliers through systems that I didn't know existed because I was never shown and I approve things when I wasnt even given visibility to what our budgets are for approving costs. At least at my first supplier job, I was shown the averages to pay suppliers. I onboard suppliers when I don't even know who handles what. No one and I mean NO one answers questions. My boss has blown off every check in meeting ive set up and is traveling too much to answer emails. No one else in the company responds to questions. My only help was the person that works under me but even she can only help so much because she really only does a very small part time aspect and was never trained either. 

I've now been there about a year. I know get very high level requests that I should at this point in know how to do, but I just keep faking my way. Honestly, up until about 7 months in, I hadn't even gotten a task. I really jsut sat at my desk waiting for someone to answer an email what I am supposed to do. I couldn't just jump in and agree to contracts without someone actually telling me what we needed. But yet, thats what i did.

&amp;#x200B;

All this rambling but now, I am looking for a new job. I have a few years of experience on my resume but I honestly don't feel like ive legit learned anything. I am more surprised I haven't been fired at this point but everyone is too busy to know what I do or dont do. It does make me really anxious because at some point someone is going to ask. When I interview, its hard to explain when they ask what I do, when I haven't actually done much of anything. 

I am extremely grateful that they gave me this chance and i am paid very well. But I feel like I am stuck. Im stressed out staying because now I get too many requests that I can't handle. I feel a bit stupid when I interview because my level on paper seems higher. I stuck it out per other peoples advice while I look for another job, but turns out, finding another job has been extremely difficult. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess part of this is a rant, another part is wondering if other people have gone through similar situations. Im just not sure where to go from here. Im stressed out not because of the work, but because I don't know the proper way to do the work and I can't seem to find another job. "

I have a couple internship offers for this summer, but I would like to hear about any experience anyone has had working as a hardware engineering intern at Cisco in San Jose? Is the program structured and do the interns have mentors guiding them with the projects? I've seen posts stating that they were never assigned a project or anything of the kind and instead they basically had to go around asking others for stuff to do, and that doesn't sound like something I'd enjoy spending my summer on.

avztso,1,2019-02-28,Destructive and Abusive roomate,XeonMasterRace,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/avztso/destructive_and_abusive_roomate/,"So early May of last year (18')I moved in with someone I knew from high school to relocate to a better school. He was one of the ""stoners"" or at least hung out with them during high school. He had one of his ""stoner"" friends as a roommate but kicked him out when I was looking to move in as he was smoking weed and drinking in the apartment (we are only 19 so both are illegal). He promised he was cleaning up his act (no smoking or drinking / partying) and stuck to it till about august. Late may he decided he wanted a puppy and got one. With this new puppy being left alone for hours a day while we both worked and him not potty training it like he said he would the dog began to pee and poop all over the apartment including on my bed and floor. I am super passive aggressive when it comes to stuff like this so I bought an expensive steam / carpet cleaner to ""clean up after the dog and past roommates stains"" he agreed to pay me back half, but never did. Fine i thought as if he was actually ever going to use it. he never did, i was cleaning up after his dog. I went back home for break and realized how bad the apartment stunk after being gone for a week as I must have grown used to the awful feces smell along with all the garbage and rotting food he has been hoarding. The puppy ""does its business"" on a plastic like tray with fake grass which stinks if he doesn't clean it every other day or so. He used to clean it and then i would have to remind him. now hes ignoring me for cleaning anything (garbage, dogs waste, clothes, dishes) I even made him agree to terms on cleaning for both of use where we owed each other $20 for each forgotten cleaning, which he broke the first day and wouldn't pay up. I also came back from break to realize that the entire counter in the kitchen was full of various alcohol. I was told this was a one time occurrence only to find out that he is an aggressive and physical drunk a few days later when his friends were over and messed with his computer. I was in my room and he called me out and started punching and hitting me blaming me while his friends tried to break it up telling him it was them not me, he didn't believe me and still continued till i shoved him away and his friends held him back. I was almost tempted at that point to leave on the spot and find somewhere else to leave but thought it would be a one time thing. At the time I was working as a paid intern of sorts through the company's college program and didn't have the money to pay two rents at once plus my new expensive car payment. I then found out that I was getting hired full time and finally had the money to leave this dangerous situation as he almost hit me again when I asked about what we are doing after the lease is up in august of 19'. I said i'm fine staying with him as long as he actually cleans up after himself, he got incredibly pissed off and was approaching me trying to corner me. I then started shopping around at other places till I found a new place that I can move into (literally the day I signed onto my new position) and got out without saying a word. His parents are divorced but pay his rent even though according to him he makes $80k/yr selling cars at a kia dealership. I called his mom to tell her my issues and she basically claimed she didn't know and refused to talk to him about it (likely fearing his aggressive tendencies). I then had some buddies come over and we managed to move all of my stuff before he came home from work which thankfully worked as he flipped out over snap chat when he found out why I moved and claimed I was stealing my own towels from the kitchen. I tried contacting the landlord regarding this and he said he would check out the apartment on Thursday. He never showed. I then contacted him saying ""hey hes too hostile and refuses to clean so I can even try to find another tenant to take my place"". He then said he would be out the following Tuesday which he lied to me on a call saying he went over and the place was immaculate and smelled fresh, Which was BS because I checked in the next day and it was exactly how it was when i left it. I then contacted his dad who was cosigned on the lease who claimed that he hasn't heard anything and then as i started to text him pictures and explain everything hes doing he said he had heard some things from his mom who has been over there more frequently. I asked if he would sign me off the lease as i fear for my own safety with this lunatic and its literally a health hazard with all of the rotting molding food and feces that have been soaking into the floor for the past few months (not to mention the fruit fly infestation). I also stated that due to me not feeling safe in my own place and needing to go back for my mail and other things, that i can technically file for an restraining order against him or an order for protection against him that would according to the landlord break the lease without much penalty against me. I even offered to have him break the lease early for the $300 fee and we are just liable for rent for a couple months till they find new tenants. He said that he would think about it and get back to me the next day. its been 3 days and he is ignoring my texts and phone calls. What can i do here? I cannot live or even find a new tenant to live there nonetheless if i was on good terms with him who would want to live there with someone who literally cannot walk in their room with garbage bags and literally dog feces the floor. Can I sue for the remaining rent or go after the management company as the apartment was per the pictures I sent ""a violation of the lease"" and uninhabitable and them refusing to do anything about it. I dont want to just stop paying as it will destroy my and my parents perfect credit who are cosigned on my half as well, and it doesn't seem fair to be paying for a place i cannot use and that he is now taking over my half. 

Any advise would be seriously appreciated. 

I will upload pics tomorrow when i get internet installed as Verizon LTE is apparently too slow to upload lol.

I'm new to reddit but I'm in need of some serious guidance. I'm a finance major and I don't go to a top tier or target school, so our finance curriculum is very vague and we don't take our first actual finance course until end of junior year.

I'm also a skilled programmer for someone my age (and someone who isn't majoring in CS), after learning python 2 on code academy I took on some small projects of my own. 

Anyways, like I said my college isn't bad but its not the best, meaning the advisers offer little to no help. They don't help you find internships and our career fairs are small. Are there any internships for people who want to work in finance that are tech/AI focused? Are there any *corporate finance companies* that anyone knows of that are working with AI, or even tech companies that develop automated banking systems? I am at a total loss here. I guess my goal is to work in finance but also be part of developing the technologies for automated systems in this industry. Basically think finance &amp; tech geek lol.

Making this because I’m not sure whether or not to accept this.

I have recently received an offer to intern for North Star, a home security company, and do door-to-door sales for them. 

I would be paid purely off of commission for my sales and would be working 7 hours a day (weekdays) and 10 hours a day (weekends). 

They promise that anyone that works for them would be making $7k+ by the end of the two month internship (can definitely make more if I make sales)

My problem is I don’t know how reputable this is, or if it’s too good to be true. 

I’m currently a college kid and am debating whether to do this and be shipped off to some random state for two months and work NONSTOP for them or to go home and pick up work in a restaurant or something.

Any advice would be great! Thank you!

At this point I will be content with any entry level software developer job because I do not have unrealistic expectations. I just want to set my foot in the market. I am open to paid internships or part-time job as well as long as it is related to Comp Sci.

I know networking for me can be a game changer. I have started to go to tech meetups. Also I have started working on a portfolio website. How important is that?

Please help. Thank you."

aw36p6,3,2019-03-01,Should I change my employer?,Hyroglyph,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aw36p6/should_i_change_my_employer/,"I started working at my company as an intern and later as a working student for one and a half year, in which I showed proficiency in working with new technologies and coming up with proof-of-concepts from scratch. I got offered a full time position very quickly, and seeing as I liked the people I worked with and the company values, I accepted and decided that I didn't need to hunt for another job and instead could focus on finishing my degree, which I have now. But now that I've been working full time for a month, I realized that that propably wasn't the best decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

My base pay is a bit below average (comparing to my fellow graduates) and I don't get to work with new technologies as much anymore. My actual pay is dependant on my performance, which may increase my total pay significantly. My main project is a python application, which I enjoy developing and I'm passionate about. I'm the only dev that's working on the project full-time. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of my time is alotted to processing tickets for the main product of my company, an ERP system built with SAP and BSP. BSP is a devlish amalgamation of Javascript, HTML, CSS and SAP ABAP. On top of that is a propietary framework made by my company, which only makes things way worse. I absolutely LOATHE being forced to work with this system, especially because the development process is looking up existing pages and copy pasting code until the ticket is satisfied. This development process goes against any and every modern and sane software engineering standards and I hate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this wouldn't be so bad, because I spend only little of my time working with this product, but I fear it might not be that way in the future. So much so that I started applying at other companies and I have an offer lined up. The pay stays about the same, my commute is will be a bit shorter. The differences are that I don't have to work with SAP anymore and the other company is way bigger.  I feel like I have better advancement options there. The company values aren't great, though, for example I have to provide a doctor's note on the first day I'm sick (I'm sick, god damn it, don't make me go to the doctor.). Also I'm not sure about the projects that I'll be working on, I was only given a general idea. The people I would work with seem cool enough, but my current team has grown on me. My current company doesn't track your hours, the other one does. In both companies, overtime isn't a thing. So, with my current company, I can just go home early if I did OT, this won't be so simple in the other company.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude this lengthy post, I'm really torn and I need some advice, maybe some points I haven't thought about yet. Is it wise to change companies just because I hate working on one product, even if it only occupies little of my time?

aw3u75,1,2019-03-01,Question about self presentation,mrbackking,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/aw3u75/question_about_self_presentation/,"Hello everybody,

I have an interview next week with a big bank in my country. They asked me to make one power point slide about myself as some sort of presentation/pitch about myself. I am wondering now what I should put on the slide and how to design it professionally yet interesting. They already have my CV so I imagine it wouldn't be best to just repeat what is on there.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I was thinking about something like this:

A timeline at the left side with the most recent education/professional experience at the top, but just a short mention like ""Bachelor Studies"" or ""Internship at XX"".

Then on the right of the timeline (the center part of the slide) I focus on my skills and how they make me fit for the internship I want including why those past experiences motivates me for their internship. An example would be: I learned Python for data evaluation tasks during my bachelor thesis and I want to apply those skills in my professional life, which I can at their position.

&amp;#x200B;

Did anybody of you have to do such an exercise before? Do you have any tipps &amp; tricks you could give me? Do you reckon the concept I came up with is a good idea or should I focus more on my motivation than my past experiences and skills?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much for any help and constructive criticism in advance"

As part of the training I started a 6-month internship 3 weeks ago for an online retailer (the code dates back from 2013 and is massive). The goal is obviously to practice everything I learnt, to bring more added value to the training and be even more ready to land a job as a full stack dev. I should mention that I programmed in my former job so I’m not completely new to this world. However, the website is built as a “layer” on top of WordPress and the main task I have been given is translating the website because they’re going international, using a wordpress plugin. They expect it to take several months. I am afraid I won’t practice anything I learnt during the training. I enjoy building things and writing algorithms, solving problems, none of the things I’ve been asked so far, and I worry I won’t actually learn anything, or even “un-learn” all the things I did during these months of training. I will talk to my manager about my concerns today, but I’m the meantime I wanted to know your opinion about this situation. I’ll give more details if needed.

Really enjoyed it and was getting great feedback from my manager. However, she has gone on maternity leave, leaving just me, the director and my other colleague. We are a really small team and have tons of projects going on- too much for essentially two people to handle. The manager leaving has left a huge impact.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then my 70 year old director has been snapping at me left right and centre and is micromanaging everything I do. He speaks to me like i'm an intern and criticises my work constantly- I had never had any complaints previously from my manager, or any other job for that matter. I have always been great at managing projects and events. The other day he landed me with a project I have absolutely no experience in (it's very technical). It was never in my job description and I didn't put the skill on my CV. He's helping me out along the way, but completely exploded into a fit of rage as to why he has to do my job. He's also been just extremely harsh when i speak to him (very rude, patronising, unnecessary replies)

&amp;#x200B;

I confronted him about it and his explanation was: ""I just meant you don't have the experience, so now I have to pick up on aspects of the project'. He apologised later and has acknowledged I have been thrown in the deep end, essentially taking on my manager's job with no extra pay. I also have nowhere near the same experience as my manager.

&amp;#x200B;

It really infuriated me as they have loaded us with work to the point where we're working constantly until 10pm, and  can't really take any holiday because there is so much on. It's making my life hell because it;s making me feel so incompetent.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think he's being unfair?

I recently got the amazing opportunity to pair with some developers in my company in the form of an internship.  We're starting in the next few weeks, and the DEV manager of the team I'll be working with asked me to send him a list of goals and when I'd like to learn them by, and that he'd like to re-evaluate the internship and extend it at that time by setting new goals depending on if I reached the previous ones.

I'm coming from zero college experience, all just self taught coding language, and I consider myself a very early beginner. The truth is, I want to learn EVERYTHING, and I feel like setting goals right now would almost be limiting.  However, being as I do want to be able to pull something from this opportunity and give him an idea of what I want out of this, I'm trying to think of what I should or shouldn't really focus on for the first part of this internship?

This is a question to all you experienced developers that I'm aspiring to be like: What goals would you suggest a brand new dev that is still learning coding should focus on given the opportunity to shadow with an enterprise development team (c#) for a few months?   This could be anything from certain parts of the code itself to  how the process actually works, but I want the opinion of someone with experience that might know a good focus for someone new. I've currently done a few online python courses / micro degrees , but am just barely starting to zone in on C#.

Firstly, I want to thank this entire subreddit, I feel like I understand the whole application/interviewing process 100x more now than when I began applying in November.

Secondly, I have a few questions as I start onboarding.

**1)** I will have to consent to a background check. I have been arrested, but ultimately not charged during a really messed up scenario. 

A year ago, I lived in a dorm/apartment on campus with friends, and one of my roommates was caught with marijuana in our apartment, and the university charges EVERYONE in the apartment in scenarios like this. My roommate ultimately took the fall, but I believe the arrest might still show up, so I was unsure if I ought to disclose this incident prior to the check if it does show? Its a really messy and hard to explain situation...so I'm not sure how to go about it. I have had other background checks for unskilled jobs and not had a problem without disclosing the arrest, but I figured that might be because of the nature of these unskilled jobs.

**2)** Provided everything goes smoothly with **1),** any tips on how to succeed in your first position? I would really like to do well as this employer is actively looking to hire interns after the intern period."

I am a 2nd year Electrical and electronic engineering student in a great university. I do love my degree. Ofc, there are times I wonder, but I get a lot of pleasure doing projects and being around labs and experiments. My idea would be to follow something related to communications or analogue electronics next year and focus on one during my masters. 

However, besides this, I have always felt financiay scared. My mum is the only one supporting me and I am almost sure my dad disinherited me. The conclusion is that I grew afraid of not having enough money and not being able to help people I care about if the time comes. This probably sounds very cocky and arrogant, but I really want to have a great lifestyle. I want to be able to buy a car because I like it and go on vacations because I wish so. 

If I followed a career in engineering, I am scared this would mean that my salary would be really poor and I would be dependent on the companies I work for that really undervalue the output produced by engineers. 

Recently, I participated in a competition about algorithmic trading. I learnt a lot and I think I did quite well. Even though my writing is pretty bad, I think I can give a good impression speaking and met a few people from the organising companies I am speaking with and might propose an internship for my third year placement. The point is, I also enjoyed coding and thinking mathematically about the problems I needed to solve to produce the best algorithm. It’s really motivating and it makes me feel really competitive. This industry alsp pays great and it started to mess with my mind. Should I do something like this after I graduate? 

My only issue was how shallow what I was doing is. I’m basically finding ways to make rich people richer, there is no positive outcome for the world, but I sure enjoy doing it. 

What would you suggest to a confused student? Is the money worth it? As a quantitive trader I have seen salaries in the order of 140k year. As an engineer, my goal would probably be limited to 80k. And yes. I know I am being massively arrogant when speaking about these numbers, but I feel scared about my future if noone is there after I graduate. I will depend on me and I don’t want to fall down. 

Also, do  you think there is a way out quant trading back into engineering?

I'm trying to decide on which to take and would appreciate any advice, wisdom, or opinions. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

**About me:** 

* Electrical Engineering student in Canada
* Two previous internships
* Career goal: Embedded Systems. Full system design (schematic/layout PCB design, firmware programming, and testing of the embedded system).
* Initial industry goal: Automation and Robotics, Current industry goal: Open to other options
* In a long-term relationship 

&amp;#x200B;

**Job #1** 

Job/Company Info:

1. Large company (1000+ employees)
2. Industry: Semiconductor
3. Location: 1.5hr commute from home (one-way)
4. Pay: $70,000
5. Duties: System-on-chip design (PCB design, Verilog, FPGA)

Pros:

* Closer to home and therefore gf, friends, and family
* Work is an extension to my previous internship as it offers different and new duties
* Better pay than Job #2
* Enjoyed my interview with the manager, seems to care about the well-being of his engineers and is a good communicator

Cons:

* Industry not as ""exciting and new"" compared to Job #2's industry
* 1.5hr commute one way during rush hour :(

&amp;#x200B;

**Job #2** 

Job/Company Info:

1. Small company (100+ employees), expecting to double in size next year
2. Industry: Warehouse automation, robotics
3. Location: Different province
4. Pay: $55,000
5. Duties: Electrical and software validation (C++, PCB design, Testing)

Pros:

* Relatively new: &lt; 5 years old\*\* (\*\*More opportunities to wear different hats, but job may not be stable because of company infancy)
* Exciting industry and work
* Flexible vacation dates (offer letter mentions flexible vacation policy, but no additional details)

Cons:

* Lower pay, won't be able to save as much
* Different province (slightly lower COL), therefore will require relocation\*\* (\*\*Could be a good thing since I'd like to move out and begin my adult journey)

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, both jobs are great and offers a path towards my career goal of becoming an embedded system expert. Seems to boil down to:  Stability and good pay vs Risk and Passion? Granted $55k is within the expected job market of a new EE grad in Canada, albeit in the lower end. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, thank you everyone for your help! Feel free to suggest additional factors I did not list. "

So if you did a lot of political and economical stuff during high school and apply as a CS major then that would look bad. What if you did a lot of biology stuff joining all the biology clubs at school doing getting research internships at hospitals and institutes, because you thought you wanted to be a premed, yet senior year comes and you felt you would rather be a software engineer?

By that point is it too late? Most people in this sub have lots of CS related activities when they apply for CS yet I saw a CS major at Yale and on his EC page he had one direct engineering related activity so I’m not sure how impacted extracurriculars are."

awc2qq,3,2019-03-01,Looking to found an internship program at my company - advice?,christine_lagarde,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/awc2qq/looking_to_found_an_internship_program_at_my/,"I'm a data scientist at a medium sized fintech company in Chicago, and I'm trying to convince my skeptical boss to start an internship program. He reluctantly agreed as long as I was mainly responsible for the day-to-day running of the program. 

I was actually never an intern myself in college, so I have no idea where to begin. I'm thinking a part time semester long internship may be best to begin with so I have a little time solo to work on my own job and have some time to figure out tasks to give the intern. 

If you've been a DS intern in the past, how did it go? Did you end up accepting a FT offer from the company afterward? Were you ever bored or didn't feel like you had enough to do, or did you feel overwhelmed? How were tasks delegated? I also want to include a career mentorship component, so if you had any experience with that, I'd love to hear about it.

If you've run a DS internship before, how did you balance your own work and mentoring the intern? Did you give them a single project to work on or just random tasks from other projects? Did you offer them a FT job afterwards? "

I’ll be finishing my bachelor in CS at a university in Europe next year and I feel like I’m completely lost. I haven’t done any meaningful work until now (TA jobs don’t really count, I guess) and my grades aren’t that great either (~3.1-3.2 GPA). My long term goal is moving to the US for a developer job eventually. Right now, I see 3 options on how I could move forward towards attaining this goal:

1. Go for a Master’s at my current uni while doing internships/working part time in a related field. This seems like it would buff up my CV a lot. However, I honestly hate the city/country I live in and would rather move out as soon as possible, but I doubt I have any chance of getting into a similarly rated Master’s in another EU country.
2. Go straight to work. I’m not sure why, but it feels like I’d be wasting some opportunities with this choice, when I could be working towards a Master’s while also attaining experience through internships.
3. Try applying for US Master’s. I wouldn’t mind going to a lower rates uni, since it would provide me with the opportunity of staying in the US afterwards. I’d absolutely love this, but it seems like it’s impossible, considering the tuition fees. 

Does anyone have advice?"

I’m a high school senior and I am currently considering taking some sort of break before pursuing a business degree.  That break either being a part-time student for a year or two in university and then finishing off full time, or a straight gap year. 

A bit about me, I started working when I was about 13 and I’ve been exploring different areas of work ever since (internships, working throughout the year, meeting new people etc.) Because of this unusual early start it feels like I’m older than I really am :P

The reason why I am considering a break from school is because I realized that school really isn’t the best for me personally.  I am quite antsy to experience things hands on and while I’m quite driven, I must know both what I want and have a strong interest in it.

I’m itching for some time to work, manage my finances and learn more about more fields I may be interested in.  I feel if I find my interest, and have learnt enough about what the profession is really like in the “real world”, that going to school will be a ton easier as I will know at that point exactly what I’m running for. 

So what I’m wondering is, what are some things I should know if I were to consider this?
Can I apply for university the same way you would out of high school after a gap year, or do I now have to write another exam to qualify for that? 

Thanks everyone."

awdzl9,72,2019-03-01,From Zero to Full Stack Developer – my experience with OSU,givetonature,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/awdzl9/from_zero_to_full_stack_developer_my_experience/,"Hey r/osuonlinecs. I am a few weeks away from graduation with no foreseeable roadblocks in between here and graduation, and I have just landed my first full time gig as a software developer. When I started this program, I had absolutely zero programming experience and I am now a C++ dev. I have asked a lot of questions on this sub over the course of the last 2.75 years, and reading about other people’s experiences was tremendously helpful for me, so I thought it might be helpful for someone else if I share mine. 
### Order I took my classes: 
F16: CS161 --&gt; W17: CS162 --&gt;SP17: CS225 &amp; CS271 --&gt; SU17: No Classes --&gt; F17: CS261 &amp; CS290 --&gt; W18: CS325 &amp; CS340 --&gt; SP18: CS361 &amp; CS 475 --&gt; SU18: CS344 --&gt; F18: CS362 &amp; CS372 --&gt; W19: CS373 &amp; CS467
### My breakdown of the classes
Hardest Classes in order of descending difficulty: CS325 --&gt; CS162 --&gt; CS344 --&gt; CS372 
 
Easiest Classes: CS340, CS361, CS362 
 
Classes that did a great job: CS271, CS261, CS325, CS344, CS372, and CS475 
 
Classes that were absolute shit: CS162, CS290, CS340, CS361, and CS362 
 
Everything else was acceptable but nothing special. I am excluding CS373 from the list of shit classes because it was truly a very interesting class, but if you wanted to put in very little work, it was a very hands off class that required very little of you. If you decided to do all the optional labs that the on campus students do in class, it’s a pretty decent class.
You can see from my class track that I always paired a good class with a bad class whenever I could.
### Advice for the program
For anyone out there who wants some advice on how to handle this program, I have a couple of recommendations. There are a few of things that I did early on in the program that I think set me up for success. One was to thoroughly research classes and figure out how hard things are how to pair classes together. If I had been bold enough to take CS162 with another class, I have no doubt I would have dropped out of this program. Another was taking a semester off to take Colt’s Udemy class on web development before I took 290 and learn a little bit of python. This made CS290 almost trivial and blew it out of the water by comparison. It also meant that I could focus completely on data structures that semester, make a personal website that looked pretty good, and gave me a decent person project to put on my resume. 
 
In that same vein, take some semesters off or take a reduced course load. This will give you the opportunity to explore other areas of programming you are interested in, or just enjoy your life. People underestimate how much time and energy this program takes. If you have a family, kids, significant other, you’re dating, you have friends, you like to keep up with the newest videogames, whatever it is that you do right now for fun, be prepared to sacrifice some of it. If you have a significant other, make sure they understand that this program is going to be hard on you. 
 
Lastly, guys, just take the easiest electives. I hate to say it, but sometimes this programs seems like a total train wreck when it comes to this subject. Don’t even worry about electives until you’re ready to take them, because the courses that are offered have changed a ton just in the last three years that I have been in the program. Whatever subject you are interested in learning about, learn about it on your own. Don’t put your GPA in jeopardy because you want to learn a topic in this program. With that being said, CS475 is fantastic, and CS373 was acceptable.

### Preparing yourself for the job search
This is the part I really want to share with people and probably deserves its own post. I am going to keep it restricted to how to handle this program in terms of getting a job later, but maybe if people are interested in hearing more about landing an actual job, I will do another post about what I did that worked and what didn’t. Job hunt aside, we all share some common ground when it comes to finding a job after this program.  
 
The hard truth is that this program doesn’t leave you job ready for any one job. The good news is it leaves you very close to being job ready for several different tracks of CS. That is the advantage this program gives us over a bootcamp. Want to work in Linux environment? You know enough about the OS and bash to be dangerous. Want to be a web developer? You already know full stack development and databases, you just need to learn a modern framework. Want to work on operating systems of embedded sys? You’ve had a good look into many areas C++, compilers, and assembly, you just need to learn about putting code on the metal. Your first job doesn’t have to be your forever job. Pick a track you think you won’t hate and keep at it.   
 
If you search CS subs on reddit you will find a wide range of advice for what it takes to land a job in this industry. “You need an internship”, “you need side projects”, “your GPA doesn’t matter”, “you don’t need this degree”, the clichés go on. Here is the truth as far as I can see: none of these things are entirely true, but they are all a little true. Side projects are important, having a good resume is important, having good grades are important, and having internships are important. Sure you don’t need this degree to get a job, but some jobs will definitely be off limits while you don’t have it. The same is true for internships.  You don’t need any single one of those things to land a job, but you *do* need a couple. I never took an internship, and my side projects are crap. I do, however, have good grades and this degree. Those were very important for my new employer. Everyone’s experience is going to vary. Some companies only care if you can solve problems on a white board during the interview, some want you to show them some apps you’ve made, and some want to know that you are determined and smart enough to figure out what you don’t know right now. The best thing you can do to find a job is to try what’s available to you. If you can achieve a high GPA, that will help you. If you can take an internship, do it. If you have a few hours during the week to make yourself a better candidate and you just don’t do that well with school, practice leetcode and make cool stuff. These are all successful avenues, and if you keep trying things, there is a very good chance that one of them will work out. The second best thing you can do is reach out for help. Go talk to software engineers at meetups, asking for resume feedback at r/cscareerquestions, get someone to review your code and help you look more like a pro. Eventually, someone will notice that you are turning into an engineer worth having. 
 
That’s all for now. Feel free to AMA and I will answer any questions you have (within reason :) ) 
 
Edit1: I worked full time throughout the program. Not sure how I forgot to mention this.

My father opened a bank account for me when I was a minor. He wanted me to learn good money saving habits, and so I’ve been putting 1/3 of all Christmas and birthday money in it since I was 10. I’ve also added 1/3 of my paychecks from an internship I did while living with him, as well as a small inheritance from a relative and a small trust that my grandmother had for me. Over 14 years of deposits and the addition trust/inheritance, the sum became quite large for a recent college grad. The issue I’m running into is that as it was made for me as a minor, my dad is still on the account and won’t give me the account number to access it. He said he would give me access when I turned 18, but when that came he moved the benchmark to when I graduated college, in the name of helping me resist temptation to spend it. Then when I graduated college he again denied me access and said that I could take money whenever I wanted, I just had to tell him what it was for so he could act as my financial advisor and decide if it was a good purchase. For years he said I could use it for a trip to Europe or a down payment and he would support it because that’s what savings are for. But he still wants me to ask permission as an adult to access my own money he forced me to save, and I’m not convinced he will actually give me my money because he’s used money to influence me for so long he might not want to give it up. I plan on asking one more time for access because I am ready to buy a home and want to use it as a down payment. 

So my question is: if he refuses to allow me access to my own money and I contact the bank, and use my social to prove I’m the one who the account was created for, (if they will even let me do that) and I then transfer the money into my own personal account, Will he have any legal recourse to punish me or take revenge for circumventing his control of my finances?

I did a JavaScript boot camp after trying unsuccessfully to teach myself for a year. Since boot camp, I did a 3 month internship at a .Net shop and have been full time at a .Net ""start-up"" for about 10 months.

We've had a lot of leadership and strategy changes recently and a fair amount of turnover. Some voluntary and some not. 

This week my boss sat me down and told me that due to the amount of work we need to accomplish it's imperative that I get to mid-level developer skills as quickly as possible. Long story short, he was definitely trying to get me to say if I'm looking for a new job and was making it clear that my position here is not safe.

Honestly, I'm not sure if he's actually asking me to do the impossible or was just trying to warn me of what's coming. Either way my only option is to try and advance my skills.

I work in both front and back end, we're AngularJS and Angular7 on the frontend. The main complaints are that it takes me so much longer than everyone else to complete tasks and that I need to do more. To put it in perspective though I think the next smallest amount of experience in the office is 3 or 4 years.

awknq4,26,2019-03-02,To All My Jobless Fellas!,pp62091,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awknq4/to_all_my_jobless_fellas/,"Seeing the recent surge of  '...jobless 23M...' posts on this sub, I have decided to give you guys a bit of free advice. The bad news first, this post is in reference to the IT sector, in particular, product based companies. The good news? If you can think logically even one bit, you can easily transition into this sector. Does not matter if you don't have a formal degree in computers. 

Here are some pointers:

1. IT does not directly equate to computer science. You can very well write software without knowing how a compiler works or what is the difference b/w ARM and x86.
2. But a good engineer will always know about these subjects, at least the basics. You can always learn these things after you get the job. Knowing how stuff works will always make you stand out of in your team. 
3. Companies don't give a toss about how many languages you know. I gag every time a punter here on this sub writes, ""...I know Java, C++, C# and Haskell..."". It impresses no one and you make an ass out of yourself every time you say this in an interview. And trust me, knowing a language's syntax does not mean shit. You think you know Java? Oh, then please explain to me why you shouldn't ever start a thread inside a constructor. And also explain to me how 'volatile' works. To answer this question, you need to know the JVM (such questions won't generally be asked for entry-level positions).
4. If you say that you can write Android applications, then it better be on the Play Store. If you say that you are a 'full-stack' engineer, then please show me your website. Otherwise remove these skills of your from the resume please. To be honest, companies don't give a shit about your resume for an entry-level position.
5. Oh, so you used Couchbase as the data store for your website? Why not Cassandra? Why did you even go for a NoSQL? How would you change your design to handle a 50,000 TPS? You should be ready to answer such questions. But again, these are SDE-3 level questions and won't be asked to a fresher. I am just trying to emphasise upon the fact that you need to really know your stuff if you claim that you know it. You used Couchbase just because it sounded hip isn't going to impress anyone.
6. Stay at bay from buzzwords du jour. 
7. Product based companies look for engineers who can understand and solve problems. I think a 6 month internship at Amazon in 2017 (didn't get an offer). My manager always used to say, ""You haven't been hired to write code, you have been hired to solve problems"". This statement could not be any closer to the truth.
8. Getting into these companies requires a lot less effort than cracking that bank exam (or whatever) you are prepping for. And it is a lot more rewarding. Better career prospects, challenging and stimulating problems to solve, and a much better pay.
9. A ground footing in DSA will shield you from all your shortcomings - no projects, poor communication skills, bad breath. On the other hand, no project or skill in the world will make up for your lack of knowledge of DSA. YOU WILL GET REJECTED.
10. Service based companies on the other hand, do not want you to think. They want you to work like robots, doing mechanical work. That's why they pay you 3.5lpa - the supply is much, much greater than the demand. 

Too tired, shall continue tomorrow maybe.

I will soon be finishing a year and a half long degree in software engineering and am applying for jobs. My current internship has made me realise that I'm not cut to program. Although I appreciate the amazing work that is put in to make a computer to essentially do magic, I find it really tedious and uninspiring. It seems like the profession is best for people who really enjoy it or dont mind the tediousness. Because of this, if I go into programming, I'll most likely end up being a mediocre one in a company that views it as a cost centre to be outsourced as soon as possible. Also, during my internship I have realised that developers/software engineers dont have much of a say and are treated pretty much like labourers who just need to shut up and do the job. I realised this at the internship where even though the employer has a boat load of money, they were not even willing to provide a decent monitor or two from the store room next door(try programming on a 1280x1024 19 inch in 2019!). I have heard similar stories from senior graduates not being offered the right basic tools for their job and instead expected to perform magic  above their pay-grades. Also, I have a chronic neck pain that's resulted from years of bad posture in front of the computer, so doing overtime, which  seems normal in this industry, is a no-go for me. Lastly, I view the employer-employee relationship as fundamentally antagonistic.

But some of the positives that I got from the internship and course are -

1. I'm good with people. I can easily converse with them and make acquaintances if not friends.
2. I am good at the requirements phase where one has to work with the business analyst to write down the user stores/use cases, features, screens and basically work that needs to be done.
3. I'm also fairly decent at functional testing with selenium or UIPath.
4. I'm always looking for more time efficient ways of doing the work or accomplish the result with the least amount of work possible or doing it better
5. I have a good basic sense of business and business models.
6. I'm good at analysing the product from the user's point of view. During my internship I identified many basic UX issues with the application
7. I am reasonably good at smelling bs when I encounter it. For example, I recently gave a short primer to one of the head of departments on blockchain over a cup of tea and helped him understand the difference between bitcoin, blockchain and the hype around it.Helped him to save over a 1000 dollars on a blockchain consultant.
8. I'm more interested in what the technology is being used for rather than the technology itself.
9. I have more of a philosophical/analytical bent than a techie one.
10. I like to head teams and often see them to their success.
11. I am based in Singapore.

Would love to get some of your advice on what potential careers/jobs I can pursue. Thanks :)

I’m currently majoring in business, but I genuinely don’t know what career I want to pursue. I’ve thought about switching majors quite a bit. In general, I feel like taking a year off will be very beneficial for me. I can work and save money, do some career/self-exploration, do an internship, job shadow, travel, attend a coding boot camp, and so much more. I feel like being in college makes it so much harder to do these things because it is so demanding and time consuming. What are your thoughts? Have any of you taken a gap year? Should I take one?"

awmv0m,31,2019-03-02,Recent Mechanical Engineer graduate Pro Tips for Students.,GoldenTypo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/awmv0m/recent_mechanical_engineer_graduate_pro_tips_for/,"I made this list 2 weeks before I graduated 10 months ago. I was in an extreme ""engineering student"" mindset, and I figured i'd share it with you all who are currently going through the 4-5 years of hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to pursue engineering because of my mechanical mindset and hobbies. I basically was a straight C student in high school, yet in college i am graduating top 5% of the engineering college. 

* First for my new Engineers, chemistry, physics, and caulculus are all weed out classes. They are designed to make you fail, the ones who truly desire to be an engineer work for it. It gets easier from here, most students grades are at their worst in their freshman-sophomore year by far.
* Find as many internships as possible. I am where you will be one day and **seeking a job as i graduate in 2 weeks,** trust me, experience is everything to your future resume. Do as much as you can in as many different fields while you are at this internship.
* If you are sitting through intro classes specific to your engineering pursuit and do not find the fundamentals mildly interesting, this is not the field for you. If you do not have the slightest interest, you will not have the desire to learn the information, and i guarantee you will fail out.
* The internet, specifically YouTube, is your best friend. I could not have went through engineering school without it. Free lectures from top schools compared to my ""research college"" which hired people specifically for research, ignoring the fact they speak 100 total words in the english language, greatly simplified these lectures.
* If you can afford it, buy a device such as a surface pro or iPad pro to annotate notes in class. Yeah, I was the kid in some classes wrote down every word, in others i didn't write down a single one. Regardless, it greatly benefited me to buy an iPad and apple pencil to download professors PDF's and annotate them as he taught, even if it was a simple word.
* Form a small friend group within your classes. Engineers one day are required to work as a part of a team, beginning these skills early is important. Also, your homework wont take you 20 hours. Do not cheat, you will fall behind and not pass, but collaborate to understand the material.
* Do not try to get by not learning a specific concept. Often times, engineering builds and you can easily be left in the dust for semesters on end. Learn it up front, get better grades, and in return made the future classes easier.
* Yeah units blow, just throw them in google and call it a day. FALSE. Unit conversion and understanding what ""kilograms per meter per second per second!"" means in relation to what that EXACT technology does will greatly enhance your understanding of engineering concepts. In addition, learning these units in SI and English units will greatly benefit you, im not saying converting (but also learn this....) but learn HOW to do it. Those mass and weight conversions between lb mass and lb force are never specific. Also, if you didn't realize i clearly stated the units for 1 Newton earlier, please start reading!
* With that whole ""engineering builds on itself"" theory in mind, do not blink the first time you hear the words ""Laplace"" ""Frequency response"" ""Transient"" ""Unstable"" ""Stable"" ""Critically Damped"" ""Damping Ratio"" ""Elon Musk"" All of these terms will follow you through your engineering studies until you graduate, learn them early.
* Learn Matlab and Excel early, it will greatly benefit you later down the road. One day you will be sitting at a desk 8 hours into a Control Systems II homework assignment wondering ""Lord Jesus why can't I just do this calculation once, why must they make me do it with one manipulated variable over and over"" well, thats when excel and matlab come in handy.
* Prioritize professors over class time. It doesnt matter if its at 8:00am, if its a better professor you will understand the material much better and be motivated to show up to class. Why pay for the education of you have a professor who speaks 100 total words of english, wake up early and learn. Trust me, it pays off in future classes.
* Organization is key. This is a skill i never figured out, to this day I'm still debating organization of folders on my laptop and where the F i saved that one excel file someone emailed me for a project.
* This is a tip I wish i realized the true magnitude of the result. DO NOT STUDY THE NIGHT BEFORE. Yeah, you are going to do it, you are going to be frustrated the entire exam knowing you know the information, but can't pull it out of your brain. Start 7 days ahead of time, 3 days later you will be golden, if not use the extra time to study. Almost always, i received a high A when i started 7 days earlier, the night before, always yielded at least a C. It pays off the feel prepared for an exam, and hey **the knowledge will absolutely help you in future classes.**
* Dont brag, people are aware engineering is a hard major. But hey if its 2:00am and you're vibing, use that to your advantage, humans are attracted to engineers regardless of your gender.... but for the sake of this being engineering, yes girls will want you.

Threw this together over a few beers, enjoy kiddos, feel free to PM me im open to whatever questions. "

I’m extremely interested in working at a particular company, and they are currently hiring for both a full time opportunity and an internship in my field (business analyst).

My question is this: would it be best in my case to apply for the full time position, internship, or both? Given that I would be happy with either opportunity if given the chance. 

I’ve heard that companies automatically trash people that go for multiple positions. When I’ve asked people advice about this I get a lot of mixed answers, so it would be great to hear from someone who maybe worked in HR."

awoiw1,3,2019-03-02,Any advice to someone who is trying to land a job?,yicoeatsbrains,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/awoiw1/any_advice_to_someone_who_is_trying_to_land_a_job/,"Hey everyone! I hope this doesn't sound too sappy or anything but here's my story:

\-Graduated a year early with a Communication degree where I showcased my skills in translating documents like blogs and press releases working with a non-profit

\-Took a year off (since I did school back to back until I got my Bachelor's degree) and continued working part time managing expenses through an accounting program and doing personal assistant stuff for my family's business

\-The other half of the time I had two internships. 

* The first one ended up really great. In 3 months I was able to curate social media posts, make engaging blog posts, use scheduling tools like Crowdfire, and learn just a bit of Facebook Ads. Interns were promised in receiving a certification that said we completed the 'social media equation' and hopefully a job position there. Unfortunately towards the end of the internship, they ended up losing their biggest client. They took each intern (including me) one at a time asking them what they could contribute to the business (we didn't know at the time what was going on besides the fact that the business was in trouble) and what we would consider our best skills. After that they sent everyone home and I never heard about them until my friend (who worked there) told me the company ended up closing the location and merging with another agency. Of course I was upset, but hey. Business is business right?
* The second internship (music booking agency) I got was more for myself to keep my skills alive and fresh. At this internship (currently still there) I was given the opportunity to run their Twitter account and schedule posts out. At the beginning it was great, I was promised free entry to shows, great co-workers, awesome environment, but was limited to what I was doing with my skills. I did learn about how to use Buffer and how to engage with users on social media but that's about it. It's fun, but I wish it paid something. This is about to be my 2nd year here and have already told them I have plans on leaving this June.

\-On my personal time in order to keep my skills up to date, I've taught myself to be familiar with Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and a little bit of Premier. I've started a bunch of small projects (band, house venue owner, and even a little YouTube) and have challenged myself to use these programs and new applications with them. I've also joined PRSA and a local chapter, but haven't heard from them since I've applied. I've contacted the PRSA customer service line later to find out my name was misspelled (I was in PRSSA in University and I guess the President butchered my name) and was told to wait for a introduction packet. I haven't received anything.

\-I have been actively applying to jobs, but it seems like lately I've been pretty bummed with the string of bad luck happening. I keep applying and honestly getting a little tired about these self-automated e-mails saying I wasn't selected or organizations not responding at all. I've had a number of phone/in-person interviews all commenting on my skills but recruiters keep leaving me feeling hopeful about a position and/or end up choosing a different candidate. Or even worse: not contacting me at all (even after following up or checking in with them)

\-There are a few factors that I think might be the problem. For example my resume was made in InDesign and may be an issue when it comes to applying for a job since job programs nowadays scan for key words. Although, I always apply it as a PDF every time. Next, my native language is Spanish and I never considered it an issue until a recruiter told me that if she didn't know that she would of never understood why I paused so much at the end of my sentences when talking in English. I wasn't sure if she was being mean because she followed it up with suggesting I should look into speech impediments. 

I'm posting here because I honestly I've been having some major anxiety about where my life is going. I just want to land a job, hear similar experiences, and additional advice that can steer me in some kind of direction.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Been trying to land a job for quite some time but have had some bad luck since graduating. Looking to see what advice you guys have for someone who's burnt out on rejection. Would love to hear suggestions, advice, and personal stories.

awp7i0,0,2019-03-02,What can I do to maximise my chances of getting an interview at a bigN company ?,throwingtechdudeaway,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/awp7i0/what_can_i_do_to_maximise_my_chances_of_getting/,"Hi there,

Right now im a second year undergrad studying cs at an average non russel uni.

I have a good academic history (6a*2a gcse, 4a as, AAB a2), due to financial issues had to go to my local uni.

my first year average was 60%(doesn't count towards degree), current second year average after jan exam is 92% (predicted 1st)

I have a bunch of projects using tensorflow/sql/etc done in my spare time + open source contributions.

I have 300+ leetcode qns solves + codeforces (blue but havent done too many), also been through CTCI, Algorithm design manual and some systems design stuff on github also done about 10hrs on pramp.

I have a friends at Google/FB /AMZN who offered to give me a referral but im worried that i wont even get an interview without experience as I started applying to internships in Febuary after jan exam results came out and I dont want to waste it.

Im not expecting to get any internship this summer, most left are placement years and there just isnt a lot available unfortunately. 

I know some of you may read this and say I should just work somewhere else for a year get experience and apply then, that is my plan should I fail but I would like to know if there is anything more I can do (Within reason) to just get to that interview stage ?

Thank you

awp8l6,1,2019-03-02,"Need resume critique, about to graduate with a BA in IT. Still haven't found a job yet!",EightSip,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/awp8l6/need_resume_critique_about_to_graduate_with_a_ba/,"Hey everyone, I've come here to ask for advice because I'm in quite of a predicament at the moment. I graduate in May with a BA in IT and I still haven't found a job yet. I have submitted 55 applications so far and only one of them was shortlisted while 3 of them were direct rejections. The rest were no responses so I can assume they are all rejections as well (with the exception of the 7 I applied to yesterday and today).

That being said, I'm unsure as to where I want to go from here. My long-term career goal is to go into security consulting. I love the strategy aspect of cybersecurity and to me that's the main reason why I want to go into it. I also find that the technologies and concepts come to me very easily. I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ (501) exam using TestOut to help me prepare for it, on top of a networking class I'm enrolled in at my school.

I'm looking at IT rotational programs, systems administration roles (although so many of them ask for LOTS of experience) and IT internships in security. I don't know if I should look at help desk since I'm not savvy and skilled with hardware (although I am taking a class called Digital Hardware, which is basically help desk 101). Besides help desk what are some entry-level roles I should be looking at that don't require little to none experience?

Also, I think another reason why I'm not getting any interviews is my resume. So please, critique it as much as you can. I want brutal honesty and advice.

Link to resume: https://i.imgur.com/dQAG4Xu.png

edit: I've showed this to other people as well, including career counselors and friends. They all say I'm a good fit for IT Business Analysis. What exactly does IT BA entail? And is it possible to become one right out of college?

Thank you!"

awparj,107,2019-03-02,living document: UW CoE Essay,squicboy,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/awparj/living_document_uw_coe_essay/,"What's up you crazy campers. I have read many UW CoE application essays and completed a lot of research on personal statement. I have constructed some guidelines on what I believe makes a good CoE personal statement essay. I wanted to share my gatherings with you guys so that you may hopefully write a stronger essay.

This is the first writing session to this post. I will add updates at the bottom. Currently leaving for a birthday party.

&amp;#x200B;

**#1 Tip: Google search ""engineering personal statements"" and read a bunch. Typically they are for grad school. It helps a lot to understand what builds a good statement.**

**\*\*Goals:\*\***

Each engineering departments has their own [prompt](https://www.engr.washington.edu/uapp/essay_questions.phtml). Besides this, however, each major has a different ""prompt"" on their graduate website (ex. [EE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/academics/grad/faqs/)  [HCDE](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/ms/application/materials) [IE](https://ise.washington.edu/admissions/MSIE/criteria) [ChemE](https://www.cheme.washington.edu/graduate_students/prosp_grad/application.html)  DONT ONLY CLICK YOUR MAJOR. READ THEM ALL. SOME OF THEM HAVE IDEAS OTHERS DONT HAVE LISTED). Now you guys might be thinking ""hey this is for graduate school, not undergrad"", well let me tell you: if you can write a good graduate school application, you can use it to write an impressive undergrad personal statement.

The general goals of your paper showed be as follows

1. Convince the admissions faculty that you qualify for their program (figure out what ""qualify"" means to the faculty due to the links above and the prompts)
2. Convince that you fit into their current focus/goals (probably something future related like AI, renewable energy, personalized learning, better materials, etc.)
3. Show skills + experience + REFLECTION on experiences to convey achievements. Anyone can say that they are ""passionate about XYZ engineering"" but show your passion by reflecting on an engineering experience that changed you. How has XYZ major impacted your identity. (ex. ""my experience in X's research lab show that I enjoy research because I want to build a better future. Now I see my coursework as research material and I have changed by doing..."")

**\*\*Trends:\*\***

Most of the successful personal statement had some kind of career goal statement that involved IMPROVING society like ""in 10 years I hope to be working on THIS topic and doing THIS kind of work. I like this work because ..."") and typically they mentioned something futuristic like AI, machine learning, renewable energy/material, etc. hot topics.

Most of the successful paper had some emotional investment as well. I don't mean like ""oh man I was crying when I failed my midterm"" or ""I was crying when XYZ happened."" It's more like ""I want to study as UW engineering because of the exciting cutting edge research. I can't wait to be a professor pursuing my own research in XYZ because I feel like everyone should deserve XYZ."" Invest a little, if you want to change the world, the put ""I want to change the world and becoming an adjunct professor is the best way to do it because X, Y, Z"" or ""I want  to create innovative products and shape modern society, so I want to help Microsoft build their newest Xbox because I love connecting people over the internet"". Even if it's super ""weird"" or perhaps ""not really normal or professional"", who cares. No part of the prompt says ""be professional"". Grammar, syntax, clarity, keep that professional. Emotional investments/interests, let those all out and back it up with REFLECTION, again: ""I love Xbox"" is shitty, but ""I love Xbox because Xbox gave me a lot of friends, gave me a great childhood, and changed my way of thinking from 'building products for money' to 'building to change society'"".

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*BAD Writing:\*\***

I read a lot of bad examples. Most of them had some kind of structure like this:

&gt;During my winter quarter, XYZ event occurred and I was ill-prepared. Because of XYZ event, I failed.

The problem with this is that they quite frankly do not care that XYZ event occurred AND you are not accepting responsibility. Shit happens, you control your actions. Even when I read papers and tragic stuff happened, I didn't care. Like, ya that super sucks, but life happens at the same time your life happens. Life happens, sometimes you fail a course.

A more preferable option would be: ""During the winter quarter, I performed poorly in Phys 122 - Electromagnetism. During this time, my grandfather passed away and I found it hard to focus. One team I found solace in is Robotics Club. The constant progress towards our goal of XX helped me...."". This **\*\*appears\*\*** to be cliche - and that's probably because I wrote this example in a couple seconds - however a handful of papers actually did something similar to this, and I found it to be impactful. It showed a true addiction to their major, an **emotional bond and connection that their major is apart of their identity (GOOD).**

&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;In high school, I was really interested in Arduinos, CAD, and coding... I have always loved coding... I coded XYZ project in high school and was team lead on the robotics team  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;I built this project.... I did this internship... My \_\_\_ is an engineer... I did X research/project/assignment.

There's a lot of shit like this. These statements are useless. In a personal statement,  you should pick one MAYBE two events to talk about, but go DEEP AS FUCK. Really dig in. They don't care if you do Arduino projects or if you had an internship or if your dad is an engineer. They care about how it **changed** you!

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE 1 (6/9/2019):

I got into UW EE on my second try. My grades were not great but they were not awful either. My cum GPA is like a 3.5 (3.4/3.3 freshman year and a couple of courses at another school + winter to raise it to a 3.5). I started my essay in February, (application opened April 4/5) because I wanted to write something high quality.

&amp;#x200B;

I would end up writing around 24 pages, each draft containing 1-2 page, so basically I wrote a lot of drafts. Many people read it, even some redditors read it. The day of submission, however, I basically tossed it and started over.

My final draft journeyed from background info &amp; why ---- why my grades were bad ---- what I did to change my bad grades ---- why I am still continuing to pursue UW EE despite feelings of inadequacy. I feel like this is a pretty standard outline.

The reason I wrote the essay again, last second, was because I wanted it to sound more personal. A major complaint I got on my essay is that it felt stiff and was packing in too much information and did not feel like a **human-interaction**. To be quite transparent for this post, I basically wrote what exactly happened during the school year and my internal thoughts.

I do not want to publish everything, but, during my freshman year, an extended family member that I looked up to passed away. I was not notified of their passing as my parents knew how badly I wanted to be an EE and that the news would ruin my exam scores. When I was writing about this, I read some examples were students said, ""ya I was sad and it caused my grades to slip"" or ""I struggled with the news and that caused my grades to slip"". Upon reading some successful CS essays, I suggest you go **ALL in** and ""**capitalize""** on your emotions, as sociopathic as that sounds.

You don't want to lie or embellish the event, but you should lay it all out on the table so that the reader can see your mindset and understand what you were going through. Not going to lie, as I was crying as I wrote my essay due to some of the stuff I went through. That's ok! Your whole essay doesn't have to contain a happy and professional atmosphere 100% of the time. Life happens!

**Example:** ""I was sad and it caused my grades to slip""

I read a lot of examples that are similar to this. The engineerings essay pages on UW's website kinda hint at this type of writing. I don't want to search for the webpage, but I remember reading/hearing something along the lines of ""if a bad event occurred to you over the school year causing your grades to slip, mention it, but do not go too in depth"". I realize, now, that this is not correct and bad advise. Writing like this shows that you, expectedly, were sad to receive some news and struggled to digest the event. Great. However, the brevity also appears to show that it was not a strong enough event to really change you a whole lot as there are no details. If the event takes one line to explain, it means that you do not want to give it the time because it's not important.

**Example:** ""I struggled with feelings of inadequacy and thoughts of failure knowing I had failed my XYZ by studying for an exam instead of comforting him in his final moments.""

This is a dark sentence. It shows how blind you can be in your studies that life goes on outside of UW whether you know about it or not. It opens the writer up to criticism and vulnerability by revealing emotions and mistakes. This **PERFECTLY** explains and downwards trend in GPA without actually saying it."

awqy9f,0,2019-03-03,Are these red flags at my intern company?,henrytheidiot12345,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/awqy9f/are_these_red_flags_at_my_intern_company/,"## I  have been interning as a software developer at a software services  company for the past few months. I am in this particular department that  provides it clients with custom made software to process applications.  Although I am being paid well(for an intern), I have noticed a few  practices that concern me and was hoping if the more experienced here  could confirm if its something to worry about and take into  consideration when thinking of applying for full time roles here.

1. Its  using jsp for the front end with hardly any value adding UX work been  done. Its an ugly application that for some reason the client thinks is  worth paying for.
2. Running sonar qube on the default profile results in so many critical bugs and vulnerabilities that havent been fixed.
3. The  application is bloated for the function it needs to perform, which is  to be a basic crud app. Its an old application and no  refactoring/modernisation work has been carried out on it
4. All the clients that are using this application are on the same application. So if its down for any reason, all users suffer.
5. Because of the way branches are set up, merging code from development to testing and further takes way longer than needed.
6. There are no productivity enhancing tools provided such as JRebel.
7. The  department cant be bothered to provide me or my team with decent  hardware. Currently we are developing on dell systems with 2nd  generation core i5s, hard disk and a single 1280x1024 monitor. Upon  asking for atleast another monitor, my request for laughed off instead  of being taken seriously.
8. The db also has become bloated over the years with tables upon tables for simple requirements.
9. The sit team consists of interns and probably 2 leads.
10. The  head of the department is ok with business analysts talking loudly in  the room but has a problem when us interns are taking some time off  chatting or relaxing. Basically many fellow colleagues whose job is to  talk have been placed in the same room as developers such as us who need  a more peaceful environment.
11. Simple  features take longer than expected to implement because libraries  havent been updated to take advantage of newer features. No one in the  management has bothered to calculate how much development time is lost  as a result.
12. The department is full of the usual nationalities that are generally brought in as cheaper employees.
13. Other products of the same company use modern technologies like react so the above are peculiar features of my department.

Any comments on how bad it is and why this might be happening?"

&amp;#x200B;

Without an internship I managed to land a job halfway across the country in a Major Tech City. It was working on a Tools project for a major console during it's development. It was a good job, paid for relocation, and I left after a year and half. A friend of mine I'd made there offered offered me something doing actual games at a studio that had recently been acquired by a larger company.

&amp;#x200B;

This ended up being a mistake, my new supervisor was abusive and toxic, constantly shouting, put me on 2 PIPs in 3 months, and then fired me after I passed both of them. I went on unemployment for a few months before I was able to pick up a contract with a group of people working on a mid-profile Kickstarted project. Another big mistake, the project was mismanaged, had unrealistic goals and they fired me after about 6 months (they've since replaced that same position at least 3 times) while breaking my contract, it stipulated in the case of termination I had to be given a month advance. I took a reduced monetary payout for a positive reference which they have since gone back on. So, can't collect unemployment since it was a 1040 contract, and now I've been fired from my last two jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

It's now a year later, I've interviewed consistently but had no luck getting any kind of actual offer. I did three different interviews out of state, with hotel and airfare paid for, I've done more on-site interviews here in town. I got kicked out of my apartment, I'm living with a friend. I have two terminations on my resume, a year gap and I've been unable to pivot to Full Stack or Web Development because all of my experience is in C++ and C# App Dev.

&amp;#x200B;

I owe the IRS because of my contract, can't rely on references, and cannot stay with my friend long-term.

How do I land my next job? (Game Programmer, C++ Engineer, Web Dev, doesn't matter)"

awuel7,3,2019-03-03,Does an Master in Management (MiM) program make more sense for me over an MBA?,MBAasker,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/awuel7/does_an_master_in_management_mim_program_make/,"Hi everyone.

I plan to go to B-school next year (2020) and would like some advice over whether a Masters in Management (MiM) would be a better program for me over an MBA. I have previously posted here in /r/mba but my situation has changed since then (especially regarding post-masters goal). **I'd also really want to know whether I am still eligible for the top MiM programs despite already having work experience** (some programs state that they are made for fresh graduates with 0 or limited work experience). I'm in a weird position because by matriculation, I'd have 3 years of work experience, but would be around average age for a MiM student (I graduated younger than most people).

&amp;#x200B;

Profile:

**Background**

* Work experience: 3 years by matriculation at an Asia-based MM bank as an equity research associate (possibly a promotion to analyst this year). Am already covering stocks.
* Extra curriculars: Leadership position in a charity-related UG organization. Jump starting an alumni chapter.
* Undergrad school/major: Graduated in 2017 in a non-target university in Asia majoring in a quantitative business program.
* Other education/coursework: Took a short business course in a top UK program
* Race/nationality: Mixed Asian
* Sex: M
* Age: 24 by matriculation

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): Expecting a 730-740 (have not taken yet)
* Undergrad GPA: 3.6+

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA/MiM: Entrepreneurship/family business (will expound on this below)
* Target schools: T15 for MBA, top UK and US programs for MiM.

&amp;#x200B;

I am being pressured by my parents to join the family business in a few years, and this is something I'd like to do as well. They want me to finish a masters program before I join, preferably one with name-recall as they believe that doing a program in a prestigious university helps in closing deals and acquiring partners. **My main rationale for going for a masters program is prestige (important for an entrepreneur of a growing business), increased network, and specialized learning in certain fields of management/business which I feel were lacking in my UG program.**

&amp;#x200B;

**My problems with an MBA are:**

* I'd be 2-3 years younger and would have 2 years less work experience on average compared to the accepted applicants of the programs I'm targeting (T15). Despite what I feel is good work experience, this may be a negative for adcom, making me less competitive for my targets.
* MBAs are longer (2 years) and more expensive than MiMs. These two (time and expenses) are big factors for me.
* Top MBA programs also appear to be much more competitive than top MiMs, and harder to get scholarships in.

**My main issues with a MiM are:**

* Prestige and quality of connections in top MiMs are definitely weaker than top MBAs.
* I would have 3 years of work experience next year (despite only being 24 then). I wonder if this is perceived as a negative by adcom, since an MiM is usually for fresh graduates with very limited work experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really care about internship opportunities or expected salaries since I would be taking up entrepreneurial ventures post-masters. **I am just concerned about whether I am eligible for top MiMs given my profile (ie had work experience), and whether a MiM makes sense for me.** An option is to simply enter the family business soon and then take up an MBA after a few years, but the opportunity cost would be a lot greater by then and so I'd rather take the masters program before joining (which my parents agree with as well). Hoping to hear your insights.

&amp;#x200B;

Regards,

MBAasker

The deal is, I’m a first year CS hopeful who’s not making CS POSt. Most likely. So my two backups are to either transfer to a different university for CS (I’ve already applied on OUAC), or stay and do a CogSci specialist/major (science stream) with a CS minor.

What should I do? I love CS but I also love UofT (unpopular opinion but it’s true).  If I stay and do CogSci, what are my job prospects graduating? Is a CS minor enough to boost a CogSci specialist/major into something useful? I know you’re primed for AI jobs, which is what I wanted to go into from the get-go, but is it a lot harder to find internships and jobs with just a CS minor?

tl;dr: I hate POSt."

I am a 23 year old university student, currently pursuing a BSc in tech field, I am in my graduation year now.

I have to frankly admit, after the third year of my studying (I was 21 back then), I had a lot of free time to spend in the summertime (I only had a month-long internship at that time) and started going out clubbing. In those clubs I met some very sketchy people with whom I hanged around and did drugs at that time. It all lasted for a few months, but during that time I managed to destroy most of my meaningful relationships, people started avoiding me and it put a strain on my mental health. These memories haunt me and I can't get over the feeling how much I failed due to my own recklessness and stupidity. I feel like my life is basically finished now because of bad choices. I now have bad social anxiety and depression (taking meds for it). How can I recover from this place? I want to rebuild my relationships, but people don't seem to trust me anymore and I lost all respect in their eyes. All the people I meet and talk with seem to avoid me and judge me for what I have been doing. I have become some kind of a social pariah - I have failed everybody's trust and hopes in me. I feel like everyone hates me. What steps should I take to recover? I feel like I have put all my future down the drain.

I graduated 48 days ago. Applied shotgun style to 120 or so positions. Even stuff like java/c++ even though I'm only comfortable with c# really.

I've been told ill have an official offer tomorrow. The position was ideally for a senior dev, I applied anyways. Fairly confident I'll do just fine.

Anyways, I had a talk, and they're deciding to label me an intern for some months and test the waters with me from what I understand. C2hire, not direct as originally expected.

The wage is lower at 40k-50k as well. I don't care about the money really, I need experience but will this hurt me in three months when the intern label is removed? I'd optimally love to stay with this company for many years. 

Would you consider this an insult, an accomplishment, a positive notion?

Not sure what to think tbh. It's an offer though! 

Thank you for your thoughts / time.

Edit: am in greater Detroit area. Would love over devs thoughts on this. "

I've been depressed since I was 12 years old and have suffered from disordered eating since I was 15. 

And I just don't care about anything. I don't care about anyone in my life. I don't care about meeting new people. I don't care about trying anymore. 

But I'm not sad. My life just feels like one long stretched out drag. Like I'm just dead or inhuman or something. 

I don't want to get better and I don't want to try to get better. I just want to move on. Every time I try therapy, opening up has just triggered a major depressive episode which always last more than two weeks where I feel so sad that I can't do anything at all, like laundry or shower.

I'd just rather feel nothing. And it doesn't feel like anything is wrong with me. But it's been 8 years and I haven't been able to recover. I tried being positive, I tried making friends, I tried therapy, and meds won't help me because I hate the feeling of artificial euphoria.

My parents think people with mental health issues are murderers so I couldn't get treatment even if I tried because I can't move out. They would get so angry and even though I hate my mom I'd be all alone if I moved out.

I feel like I'm just making up all my problems. I have an internship at a huge company that my peers I'm sure are insanely jealous of. I do well in school.  And yet it seems my only nerf is how I feel indifferent about everything.

I don't know what the point of this post is. I just wish my entire childhood never happened to me but it doesn't look like recovery is in the cards for this life. I feel like I just faked my entire life.

Has anyone else felt like this? "

(More questions below)",smorcgg,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/awx8ao/hello_fellow_people_i_got_into_both_unc_and_nc/,"So I guess a bit of background! As I said, I’ve been accepted to both UNC and NC State. For NC State, I chose my intended major to be civil engineering, and for UNC I chose undecided. I’ve always been telling people that I would want to go to NC State and study civil engineering, and so when I got the news of my admission I was extremely happy. But I’ve been taking my physics courses in high school and I have not been enjoying them very much. Calculus and chemistry are fine, but physics just makes me lose my mind. So I’m not sure if I want to go into civil engineering anymore. Maybe I want to do something else. And that’s when UNC started throwing stuff at me. The school gave me a fellowship of 5,000 a year, and also is possibly giving me a full ride because I qualify for Carolina Covenant (full tuition and room/board need-based grant). And hey, that’s super duper appealing to me. Going to college debt-free is a big advantage! I guess I just feel bad if I change majors because I’ve been telling everyone that I’m doing civil engineering, even the people from my internship. I’m not sure what to do. I’m really really stressed. UNC does not have an engineering program but I’ve heard they have a really good computer science program. I love to play video games and just thought about how cool it would be to work on my own projects with learning coding. I guess I haven’t received the financial packages for the schools but I would still like to know if you guys would reject a full-ride to a really good school, and change your game plan (knowing that your decision was still uncertain). I guess any type of advice would help. If there are any civil engineers or computer science majors that would like to tell me what you guys do that would be really cool. I just would hate to make the wrong decision and waste time. And I would hate going to NC State finding out that I don’t want to do engineering, and that I lost the opportunity for a full-ride at another great school. I’m just very conflicted guys. 

Sorry it’s all unorganized and jumbled up lol."
awxlea,1,2019-03-03,How can I improve my behavior in groups and build bonds with people?,gorwokJIV,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/awxlea/how_can_i_improve_my_behavior_in_groups_and_build/," 

Hi all! First time asking something on reddit :D

Here's my background:

I'm a migrant (my mom lives here for 10 years), and I'm here for 3 years, I've ended high school in my country and went right to university here, without speaking local language and understanding mentality etc.

Yet I managed to find friends and girlfriend and we had fun times for a year. But after 1st year most of them understood that Software Engineering is not what they like and left. Unlike me, rest of my friends seems to have own social life outside of university, so I just started to study a lot. The thing is that I love this field and after breaking up with a girlfriend and failing a lot in the 1st year (because we used to have fun instead of studying) I was pretty happy just studying without a lot of social interaction.

Now I'm still studying and working hard to be able to enter a good internship, but now I'm just tired of being single and mostly alone for almost 2 years now. I'm not socially awkward or super shy, but I think I was considered by others just as a smart guy.

One thing is that I don't find myself a very interesting person, while I have few hobbies (not only Software Engineering) they're not very social, and I'm currently not able to do a lot of social interesting things (like traveling) because: 1) I'm really broke right now; 2) I'm learning hard stuff that requires a lot of time.

So I started to read material about 'how to make people like me' and 'how to seem more interesting' stuff. And it's OK, I can conduct a dialogue and seem like an interesting person, but I'm having trouble to make it to the next friendship or romantic phase, mostly due to this belief that I'm not interesting person, and also not having money is a big mental block for me. I'm trying to go out with a group to build bonds with people and I always feel confident, but It's always the same story: people are talking about local stuff I have no idea, I don't understand language very good, when I'm trying to say something, other someone grabs all attention talking about subject that everyone is suddenly very interested in and I'm just feeling outsider and ending up being sad about my social life and trying to focus on study next day.

It is same with girls as well. We can speak, flirt, she may show some interest in me, but when we go out with our group she is just losing interest in me because I can't compete with others in attention-grabbing, it already happened few times.

I know that I have to study and my life will get better, but it's hard without feeling that I am important for somebody, and I'm afraid that I'm just losing my best years and it will be hard to build a real friendship after college ends.

TL;DR; : **How can I improve my behavior to stop being an outsider in groups and build friendship and romantic bonds with people?**

Thanks!

P.S. I dont know is it the best reddit to ask, so tell me if there's a better place for this question!"

awyvyo,3,2019-03-03,People getting things handed to them on a plate makes my hard work feel wasted,icryateverything,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/awyvyo/people_getting_things_handed_to_them_on_a_plate/,"So I’ve been applying to internships since around October, and I’ve had multiple concurrent applications going. Each one is a pretty involved process, with lengthy motivational written answers (one application was about 1500 words total), video interviews and hour-long phone interviews. I’ve also spent a really long time perfecting my CV and writing a personalised, properly researched cover letter for every single application that asked for one. It’s been really tough balancing that alongside my university workload, volunteering, my part-time job, and this new project I’m trying to get going at my local refugee centre. This is all in conjunction with managing long-term mental health disorders I’m in therapy for. So these last few months have been terribly stressful, but getting an internship has been the main priority as of late.

I found out on Friday that I got into my top choice internship! I was over the moon, this was the one I had put in the most effort for. I applied back in November, and there were 4 fairly demanding stages I had to go through up until now.

My boyfriend didn’t manage to get an internship or progress past the initial stages. I offered him all the help I could on top of handling my own applications - offering to work with him on his CV, helping him out with motivational questions, trying to be as encouraging as possible when he felt there was no point. I felt slightly like he had a defeatist attitude - the “I won’t get one so why should I bother” attitude. He started applying to internships pretty late, and didn’t really update his CV since he (note: his mum) made it when he was 16. In my opinion, he wasn’t putting much energy into finding one, despite my offers of help and trying to improve his self esteem. I figure I couldn’t make him work hard for something if he deep down didn’t want to. These schemes are really competitive and you can’t just coast through and expect to get one. Of course, I was gentle with him because I thought it was his lack of self-belief getting in the way.

It’s now Sunday, he told me he can just get an internship at his stepdad’s firm. Of course I’m glad he’s got an internship, it was starting to stress me out a bit too considering he wants to get into competitive sectors and I don’t want to see him struggle come graduation. But the juxtaposition of receiving my offer, after months and months of research, tests, mock interviews, real interviews, rejections, trying to improve and trying again........ with his lack of effort leading to the exact same outcome .... I don’t want to seem incredibly bitter but the timing just makes my hard work feel a bit devalued. It’s just a bit annoying that some people don’t appear to struggle for certain things. I understand everyone has difficulties in life but it is true that when it comes to professional life, some people definitely do have things handed to them on a plate - there’s no scope for failure because there is always a safety net. Meanwhile those of us with no safety net find ourselves over-working and getting stressed out, because there’s no one to get us back on the ladder when we fall. Failure really feels like rock bottom.

Before, I thought my boyfriend just didn’t really want an internship enough to try for one. Now, I’m starting to think there’s some sort of pattern in all of this - perhaps he didn’t have the same determination as me because he knew there would be some opportunity available no matter what. Perhaps his rock bottom wouldn’t involve falling down as hard as me. I feel like all the effort I put in would have been entirely unnecessary had I been born into a different economic circumstance, and it’s just a bit annoying.


Most of our friends are mutual so I don’t want to rant to them, sorry this is so long."

awyzms,3,2019-03-03,"Lost in the chaos, looking for some insight.",xACRITASx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/awyzms/lost_in_the_chaos_looking_for_some_insight/,"So, I started my journey into a career in IT quite late. At 27, I returned to college and after 2 1/2 years of schooling, I got taken on full-time as a Support Engineer for an MSP after a 6-month internship program in semester 6. I had zero practical IT experience before returning to college (three years of art college = 6 years as a van driver, naturally).

I just passed the 1-year mark at this position and it has been a roller coaster. Still is, really. For the past 6 months, I've mostly been sold as on-site support for, and post, various projects. These include:

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Post-Office365 migration support

 \- Rollout of new next-gen AV (I actually headed these projects)

 \- Comprehensive enterprise inventories

 \- Rollout of encryption software, including setting up Bitlocker for older devices via GPO

 \- Physical migration of a business from one site to another

 \- Taking over AV operations for some government bodies (I'm properly bricking it over this one)

&amp;#x200B;

All the while taking care of various Support Desk tickets and back-office reporting which now includes locking down LAN-WAN on every firewall we have out there, and configuring the iDRAC on every physical server we have out there. Essentially, I feel like I've touched on almost every aspect of support requirements for an MSP (everything mentioned above including backup reporting &amp; maintenance, server maintenance, user administration, email troubleshooting, hardware troubleshooting, network troubleshooting, telephony troubleshooting, and LOB application troubleshooting. I've never Googled so hard in my life).

So here's why I created this post (apart from catharsis): is this typical? 

I have no experiential pool to draw from. I'm doing this after not even finishing my college course. I'm also doing this as a Level 1 Support Engineer on €32,000 per annum. As I have little industry insight, I'm not sure what level of salary this type of work demands. Am I Level 1? Level 2? I appear to be doing similar work to our Level 3 engineers, but I rely *heavily* on Google and phonecalls with the seniors.

At this stage, I want to put structure, focus, and essentially value on the work that I do. What do you think? Should I be grateful to be in a position where I get to experience everything? Would you look to move onto another role that was more focused? Do you think I'd be taken on anywhere else if I were looking for more money (I started on €24k for the 6 months of my internship. I'm not willing to go back to that). Am I complaining about something that actually every or most IT scrubs have to go through?

Any input or point of view on the above would be appreciated. Thanks."
awz335,8,2019-03-03,I Can’t Remember,Squiber228,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/awz335/i_cant_remember/,"It’s all so hazey and vague. I don’t remember. Maybe I don’t want to, or maybe I can’t. It’s all a dream or a nightmare that I can’t wake up from. Someone might ask, “you remember that time when...” blah blah blah. 

No, I don’t. I’ve obliterrated my memories. I choose not to remember. I don’t remember the good or the awful times. All I can do is live in the moment. 

It’s hard to even follow a conversation. I can’t remember your face. There’s a constant band over my head, constricting my thought flow. Sometimes I think it would be better to stop existing and leave all this confusion behind. 

But suicide is not an option. There is one thing I can remember. I was raised catholic and for them suicide is a cardinal sin. It’s the only sin I can’t come back from. But why does it stop me? I’m a damn atheist. 

When I first tried DMT I found out what the bright light really is. It’s more than just a chemical reaction in the brain. It’s what geriatrics see in the end. It is the end. It is whatever you choose it to be. It is what’s been chosen for you. 

Time dilates upon death and the life you’ve lived does also. Some call it heaven while others call it hell. A few are dropped into purgatory.  But it doesn’t matter what they call it. It’s the same, many sided coin. 

After it’s flipped they could go to a paradise or a dystopia. Mine was dystopia. 

Everyone there was exactly the same. There were buildings, planes in the sky, and baristas at the coffee shop. But something about the ordeal was off. 

Everywhere I went I could hear my name called at me, but when I looked there was no one there. Sometimes everyone was there. I would see faces in the crowd that I half remembered. Who are you? My cousin? Niece? Nephew?

If I ever asked all I would get back were blank, unknowing stares. 

I was a stranger in a strange land. Even in my home, which I do not remember signing a lease agreement to. Or moving furniture into. Or paying a light bill. It was just there. 

And so was the nurse. The nurse who took care of me. She was the only one who seemed genuinely nice to me. She cooked my meals and gave me the medications I needed. 

Her name was Laren. She was an intern and studied at the local university. I miss Laren. She helped me to remember. 

“I have a special medication for you today, Michael,” she said in her usual sing songy voice. The door closed behind her as I gazed up. She looked like an angel with a syringe in hand. “The boys at the lab have been cooking something up just for you,” she smiled with her white teeth expose ear to ear. “Now be a good boy and hold out your arm.”

So I did. She found the vein rather quickly. She must have been practicing on lemons and oranges. When she depressed the plunger my mind exploded into a cacophony. 

She was Laren. I was Michael. I had a son, Steven. My wife, Mary, left me years ago after I couldn’t remember her face. 

Laren stopped letting me out of the house months ago, for safety reasons. 

My voice is hoarse as if I hadn’t spoken in a long time, “L-Laren?... where am I?”

She was stunned. She didn’t know the chemicals would take effect so quickly. But they had. 

After a brief pause and a slightly agape mouth, “You’ve been asleep for a very long time.” Tears ran down her cheeks. She embraced me in a deep hug. She smelled like juniper berries. “I’m so happy to finally meet you, Michael.”

The pay is not bad (19/hour), and I don't have to relocate, as it's close enough for a commute. The one problem I have is that the recruiter gave me until Monday to make my mind up (about 2 business days). Obviously, by that time I probably won't hear back from other companies. So these are my thoughts/questions: 

* Although I've seen it mentioned on this sub, does anyone else have any info on Envestnet? (probably irrelevant but there is not much info on software engineering there)
* Should I wait for another offer? Mind you, this is the only offer I have thus far. Most companies told me that their role is already filled, and some are still pending/ghosted me

I'm in my third year of university, so plenty of my friends/professors told me I should go for it. Let me know what you guys think.

My current job is pretty great. Decent pay. Mostly periods of low stress, but I would argue that is more just because I'm still low on the totem pole. Short commute. Great coworkers. They encourage me to learn. It can get kind of hectic and the hours are inflexible as most engineering jobs in manufacturing are.

Boyfriend got a job in Austin, Texas. It's not a definite he will stay there for more than a year, but it is likely. 50/50 chances, depending if he likes his job. We plan on getting engaged by next year.

My parents think I should stay here for another 9 months before I start a new job. However, I know job searches can take up to a year, usually 6 months, and less than 4 if you are lucky. I don't want to start my job search next year, because I really want to shorten the time of me and my bf being long distance. 

However, I'm pretty terrified I'll end up in a terrible situation. I feel like I could get a job in Austin, but I just have NO idea if the job will be as comfortable as I have it right now. 

\- How early should I start my job search? I definitely want to be doing something I'm doing now.

\- Should I stay another 6 months at my current job just to get more experience? I did 3 internships during college, too. My parents think this looks better, but I'm not sure.

\- What happens when I do start a new job, and I hate it? I am so risk averse, but a lot of my friends seem to think that finding a job in a new city will be straightforward and uncomplicated.

\- Would companies even want to hire me knowing I'm not a local? 

Any advice would be great.

awzw70,1,2019-03-03,I had a coding test for a potential internship. I know I did terribly. Is there any way to salvage this?,VinylHorror,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/awzw70/i_had_a_coding_test_for_a_potential_internship_i/,"About a two weeks ago I applied for a software development internship. Oddly enough it was at a company that I had always wanted to get a CS job at, a moderately large company based in the Midwest.

Last week I got an email with the opportunity to take a coding test to gauge my skills and see if I'd be a good fit. I found this very odd because I put in my resume that I'm a self-taught programmer who currently only has about a dozen community-college credits under his belt. But for whatever reason, probably because there weren't that many applications, I was given the opportunity.

All in all, I did bad. I brushed up on my basic algorithms and things I needed but I know I still bombed. I questioned people who had also taken the exact test and they said the majority of people don't finish it, either, but I know it was bad. 

Is there any way to salvage this? I took it on Friday so there's a possibility they haven't even seen the results yet. Would it be out-of-place or crazy to write a letter to the technical director and tell them how much I'd love to have the position or should I just take the loss and continue interviewing at other places?

&amp;#x200B;

I have read a LOT of posts sharing experiences with CompTIA certs and how to study and what relevance they had in the field and just wanted to briefly share my experience and where it has got me for anyone who may be curious. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IT Experience:**

I started my AS in IT Security in August of 2017 after having done a few Gen Eds and switching from an AA. 

I just finished my AS degree in December of 2018. Prior to that, my IT experience was limited to just being generally ""good"" with computers and being able to figure things out on my own or Google, Youtube, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals:**

Currently my long term goal is Pen Testing. Right now I am trying to get that foundational experience first (learning about databases, apps, networking, and various other things you encounter in the corporate/enterprise environment). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Advice I was given:**

When I first started my IT degree I knew I wanted to become a hacker/pen tester but I wasn't sure where to start and heard a lot of different and conflicting advice on where to start. Some said dive straight into hacking, some said go with networking &amp; applicable certs (Net+, CCNA, etc.), and some saying stick to security heavy skills and certs  (Sec+, CEH, CISSP) etc.

  
**What I did and where it got me:**

I had a lot of people tell me that CompTIA was trash and that their certifications were a waste of time and money. While I am not here to comment on the quality of the exams, I would like to say right off the bat: **they are not worthless**. I cranked out A+, Net+, and Sec+ in about 11 months from start to finish with all three. After getting A+, I got an internship with a huge company in the financial industry and learned more about networking and security and how enterprise environments operate. My biggest wins during this was networking in the professional/social sense, not technical experience or knowledge gained. I worked hard, asked a billion questions about anything I could think of, and was respectful and professional. I can't stress how beneficial those simple things are in the corporate environment. I used my contacts in the networking dept. to meet with the CISO at the company for a general meet and greet and to ask questions and was lucky enough to leave with a job offer (still as an intern) to come over to the ISO (INFOSEC Office) and did some work in Incident Response and then later worked with the SOC (SECOPS Center) doing DLP monitoring and working briefly with the SIEM and helped to build processes and procedures to make things better for everyone. Also, I have actively been applying and interviewing since I started the internship just to get better at it, see what's out there, and see what I needed to work on (or maybe get lucky).

I am excited to share that I just got a $65k salary job (SOC Analyst II) at a company who is also in the financial industry that I start in a week. When I interviewed with this company, I had the certs I previously mentioned, a recently finished AS degree, about a year of resume-worthy experience in the field, and spoke I honestly about what I did and didn't know (this is very important in my opinion, don't try to BS your way into a job). I did not expect to get the job, but I was ecstatic to hear the news. 

I just wanted to share in hopes of giving some clarity to anyone that may be wondering if CompTIA certs are worth their time, how to break into the IT field, or what value they may bring. They are a great for getting a good overall grasp of Hardware/Software, Networking, and Security best practices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Certs, experience, and college are the way to go and you don't need all three to start. I just started the BAS degree and have another two years before that is done. Sorry for the long write-up but I felt obligated to give a little something back to the community for how much I have gained from other's posts and input. Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for all that everyone has shared!

Lately though, the idea of eventually achieving self-employment has been catching a lot of fuel inside me. However, I haven't been able to find much information about it within the context of software development, I guess partly because salaried jobs pay so well that few people have any reason to do something different.

So I want to hear about how developers made it to self employment.

Especially interested in the case of ""built a product(s) and now that's my main source of income"", rather than the case of building things for other people. The problem I see with building things for other people is that once you are successful at it, the way to scale it is by becoming an employer yourself, which I am trying to avoid as one of the motivating factors is not having to deal with a ""corporate environment"".

So if you have any advice on this subject or know of any resources (blogs/podcasts/etc) that would have opinions on this, please let me know.

#What I am most curious about is:

* Data points at which income from self employment becomes viable (e.g.  downloads per app, clients per year, revenue per project, or anything similar)

* How long and how many tries it took to get there "

I've always been pushed by my parents to study Computer Science. Majority of my ECs, internships, electives in school have all revolved around Computer Science. I selected Computer Science as my first option major for all the UCs... except for Berkeley which only had one option so I applied as an Econ Major because I honestly do NOT want to study Computer Science in college.

2)  Expense.  I believe if I get at least $1k in scholarships at either school I qualify for in state tuition without waiting 1 year for residency status, not sure if correct.


3)  Academics.  Department projects for extra curricular activity are a plus


One main advantage of UofH is that I know a friend in Houston who said I could stay with him while I went to school and pay not much rent.

ax2au3,4,2019-03-03,International student in a tough spot regarding interview prep and immigration,throwaway_112wese21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ax2au3/international_student_in_a_tough_spot_regarding/,"*TLDR at the bottom.*

&amp;#x200B;

Hi cscareerquestions. I'm a recent international student graduate from a target school. I had other fields I wanted to major in more, but being from a third world country, I decided that it would be the right decision to do CS. I also legitimately love coding and software engineering. It might not have been my first choice of majors, but it's also within my top 3. Despite loving the field, I was not good in it in school. This is due to a bunch of factors, mainly depression (due to personal reasons), and my school being extra hard. My GPA after graduation was 3.0.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite being from a target school, I hardly was able to get any decent internships despite applying to a lot of places. I would not get any response from recruiters, and the few times I would, I would bomb the technical interviews. Unfortunately, because I was preoccupied with schoolwork all the time and was barely keeping my head above waters, I never had a chance or time to work on my LeetCode skills. During any extra time in the summers, I would study for the following semester to try to ease up the workload. Because of me being international and personal problems that have prevented me from going back home, I couldn't even take time off to work on my LeetCode skills for a year or so then come back to school. Eventually I got some CS program during sophomore summer in the CS department of my school and an internship abroad at a startup, which paid only for expenses. The internship at that startup was an absolute blast, and I absolutely loved every minute of it, and got a spectacular recommendation from the manager, who noted how good and helpful my work has been at the company. Despite not having an easy time during school, especially when seeing the internships my peers would get, I tried to stay positive and thought that my career would get better, especially having the confidence that I did really well at an internship and that I just would need to work on my LeetCode skills and all my hard work so far would pan out. However, I unfortunately had to take the first job I would get after graduation due to visa regulations. Had I not had to do this, I would definitely have worked more on my LeetCode skills.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to graduation, I am now working at a startup (one of only two offers I got, the other also being a startup), and I am utterly hopeless at the moment. The pay is below average/average, but that isn't a concern for me. My main concern is that the work conditions are absolutely horrible. I don't want to go into details, but let's just say that it has taken a toll on my mental health, which wasn't that great to begin with (I've been on medications since college). To make matters worse, while the company is sponsoring my H-1B, they apparently have an undocumented policy of not sponsoring for green cards down the line. I've gotten this while talking casually with HR about other international cases at the company. If they were to sponsor my green card down the line, I would definitely suck it up and stay, but because of this policy, I feel like I am just suffering for no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem: I can't get another job at a larger company that would eventually sponsor my green card because I fail at LeetCode interviews. I'm not terrible at them, since I have been studying in my free time since I got this job and have solved about 200 questions, and have gotten much better than before (which was really bad). However, because I know I need more practice, and with the studying being fragmented and not having that much time for it, and because the bar seems to get higher and higher at big companies (doesn't have to be big N), I am nowhere near where I need to be for these whiteboard style interviews. I've had a few call screens and one on-site, and I didn't do good enough to get an offer. If I didn't have to stay employed to maintain my visa status, I would have definitely quit and grinded LeetCode and other prep materials, organized my studying, etc. until I was ready, especially since I have money saved up, so I could afford doing so. However, I can't do that so I'm stuck in this horrible situation. I know I need a lot of time to get better at LeetCode questions, and I have the motivation and willpower to go through with it, but what I currently lack is time. By the time I come back from work, I am so tired and stressed out from the shitty situation I am in that even though I spend the rest of the day studying, it's not very efficient.

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth noting that for international students, companies fall in the following two categories:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Companies that are willing to sponsor H-1B / green cards, usually good places to work at, but most likely have high LeetCode style interviews hiring bar

&amp;#x200B;

2) Companies that are not willing to sponsor H-1B / green cards, but don't have LeetCode style interviews

&amp;#x200B;

There's also the companies that have LeetCode style interviews but aren't willing to sponsor H-1Bs or green cards, but those ones aren't worth talking about. I guess I consider myself ""lucky"" I was able to get the job I am currently in that is applying for my H-1B without passing by a LeetCode style interview.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you: have you ever been in a similar situation or know someone who has? What did you/they do? Is there nothing in my hands to better my situation other than just keep grinding after work and cross my fingers in 2-3 years that I will be ready by then? I fear that questions will keep getting harder the longer I wait (because I won't be entry level any longer) and that I will never be able to catch up.

&amp;#x200B;

Another question I have (though a bit unrelated): is there any chance to immigrate to another country? I am not dead set on the U.S., but all the immigration paths I see for Canada, Australia, etc. require a lot of work experience, which will require me to stay in this job for a long time to get. For non-immigration paths, getting sponsored for a work visa in Canada/Australia/Europe,etc. will mean that I will have to be able to pass the whiteboarding interviews at those companies before they will sponsor my work visa, which is the problem I have now, so it's not an option.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for anyone's help or insight.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't take any internships and while I proofread for my college newspaper, I wasn't very good at it. My first two years were in community college where I didn't do anything because I thought ""who cares, I'm going to the real college in two years"" but when I did I didn't actually try to get involved in anything until my senior year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so fucking tired of working three jobs and still not making enough money to move out of my parent's house. I'm so tired of working so much that I basically have completely lost interest in hobbies that use to be my world. I was reading a book today and all I kept thinking about was how much time I was wasting reading this book because I could be job searching instead even though I already spend so much time on it.  I don't even know if I want an office job or an admin assistant job, but it's the closest thing I can apply for with the few skills I have. I've talked to my to my therapist about this  many times about how unhappy I am but I still can't stop thinking about how much of a failure I am.

I hate it when every time I log into Facebook I see someone from high school get engaged or go on a wonderful vacation or they post something about their career. (I need to log into Facebook for one of my jobs so I can't just delete it). I'm going to be 27 this year and the idea of still doing this multiple part-time job shit and still living with my parents makes me sick to my stomach.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I suppose to do? How do I not feel so lost?"

ax2ucz,3,2019-03-03,How can I know that I have the potential to be a good software engineer?,lindsayweird,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ax2ucz/how_can_i_know_that_i_have_the_potential_to_be_a/,"I'm having a confidence crisis that I'm guessing is quite familiar to others who are pursuing CS careers. My depression brain is telling me that I might not be capable of ever being a good software engineer, and that I should pursue something that comes more naturually to me. So my question is, what are some indicators that I should keep trying, and what are some indicators that this field is not a good fit for me?

Some info about me that might help: I went to a free bootcamp-ish school for 1.5 years. I did well in the program, but they only taught us to code in C without libraries. I was only able to get an internship working with a ""low code"" product, which I failed because I hated the work, could not focus, and was lonely. I'm enrolled to start classes for a CS degree but I'm having serious second thoughts. I already failed out of school once before trying to complete a Chemistry degree, and math classes terrify me, but I am a much better student now than I was then. I enjoy programming, but I would honestly rather major in art or English, however, I know that I would probably be poor/indebted forever if I made that choice."

However the high price of the program(10,000) definitely leaves much to be desired, and with freshman level skills, I don't think I would be doing much actual work if I was there.

In terms of CV building, would be it just as effective to work on personal projects and attend some events or would doing a early internship have a massive boost to when I start actual work?

I do want to note that as of right now with 2 quarters under my belt, my skills really are only at the level where I care more about getting the program to work than factoring things such as speed, code visibility etc."

So, I graduated last May from a top 10 school in the US with a BSE in CS. Since then, I have been taking time off to travel/relax/read, brush/study up on ML by reading papers and textbooks, and work on some personal programming projects. I have aspirations of working as an ML engineer, and possibly eventually an ML researcher, in the AI space. From the research that I have done, it is very difficult to get a job doing ML with just a BS and no industry experience. I have not had any internships with big companies, however I have done a few projects for school involving ML (2 smaller one-semester class projects and 1 larger two-semester group project for my senior thesis; topics included computer security, computer vision, and NLP).

I like the idea of doing an MS/PhD, but I'm not sure if it makes sense for me right now. I do not love the idea of working at a big tech company doing generic software engineering, however I am willing to do this if all else fails. My current plan is to, in the coming months, start applying for whatever ML jobs I can find that don't explicitly require an MS, as well as start compiling applications to graduate programs, and just see how things go.

I am pretty much looking for advice as to how I can get a job doing real ML work as quickly as possible. Is it better to get a graduate degree right now, or get a job doing data engineering or even generic software engineering for a year or two first? Would an MS be sufficient, or would it make more sense just to do a PhD given my long term goals? Do I stand a chance of getting into a graduate program given (the above outline of) my credentials? This is slightly unrelated, but is it at all possible for me to publish a paper without any affiliation to a university or company?

Thanks in advance."

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Technology (IT). I was in an internship in my last year of college at an elementary school as an on-site technician; it was paid so it counts as my first job. Then a few months later I got my first job (applying, interview, etc.) at a college as a level 1 technician. It served it's purpose as an introduction into the big IT world of a large organization, I leaned a couple of things out of all aspects in IT, I saw how the database and app developers work, the telecom and network team, and of course I learned quite a bit in my area which was the PC infrastructure and administration division. The areas that really caught my attention was networking and sys admin. At home, I like to build computers, and I have built my own mini servers and tried many experiments I have seen online and learning along the way. For example, I built my own print server with a raspberry pi and made my old printer into a network printer, I also experimented with virtual machines on the unRAID os, which in turn taught some things about Linux. I did struggle with networking back in school, but it was still very interesting to me. Unfortunately, my attempts at the Net+ were not successful and so I decided to put it aside and focus on another thing.

 So I am now at this point in my life:

This job I have been in for the past 2 years is only part time and I feel I have learned everything there is to know in this position because I now feel like its getting stale, I don't feel challenged and the pay is no longer gonna cut it as I have many upcoming plans for my personal life. So I am in the need of an ""upgrade"". 
So where should I go from here? I have attempted the Net+ twice and failed twice, so clearly there is still more preparation to be done. I want to take a small break and focus on another exam that can help me in my pursuit of being a sys admin.

I have read on the Server+, Linux+, and Cloud+

am I heading in the right direction? or should I find other exams?"

ax855j,22,2019-03-04,Thinking about completely withdrawing from this semester. Advice appreciated!,tesrella,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ax855j/thinking_about_completely_withdrawing_from_this/,"Bear with me, this is long. I might award some thought-out responses with some coins, as long as that isn't against Reddit policy. Thanks for reading! 

I'm a sophomore in computer engineering. I switched to this major from computer science for last semester, and now during this semester I'm having second thoughts about the decision to switch. I want to fully unenroll from this semester so that I can get my private pilots license.

Rewind back to the beginning of my college career; out of high school I decided I wanted to be a commerical airline Pilot, and that's still the overarching goal of everything I'm doing in life, to this day. There are many ways to become a commercial pilot, one of them being go through the military and use military benefits to pay for flight training and required flight hours. I tried the military, and that definitely wasn't for me, and I had to leave basic training.

Fast forward to after I got back home from basic training; my father passed away from cancer, and that threw me an emotional curveball. I received life insurance benefits, a large amount of them, and decided I would use that money to become a pilot. Just a couple months after my father passed, I went to my first flying lesson, and got so sick I decided I never wanted to become a pilot because it was too draining. I was emotionally distressed at the time and was not able to make rationalizing decisions because of the emotional hurt I was feeling from losing my father. After a year or two of getting my shit together, I now want to try becoming a pilot again.

I decided that the only other thing I could think of doing would be to go to college and get a degree. I wasn't thinking about it at the time, but this is another thing commerical airlines  want pilots to have; a degree. I enrolled for my freshman year in computer science, an area of study for which I have passion and am really talented, and completed my first two semesters with a 3.8 GPA. I liked the core classes enough that I didn't have any problems breezing through the material and I had a basic understanding of the concepts covered in those classes.

Then summer break came, and I got bored. For some reason I decided that computer science wasn't difficult enough or challenging, or something, and decided that I was going to switch to my university's new Computer Engineering program. Now, the bad thing about this was, I don't actually appreciate any of the courses I'm taking now. Almost all of the physics, science and math classes I'm taking are hard as hell and I just don't appreciate the courses as much as I did with computer science. The two degrees are VERY different. This degree program is also not accredited, so it basically has no value until the University can prove that the degree is worth something. Overall, for one step to becoming a pilot, all you need is a degree in something, anything.

I'm in the second semester of my sophomore year, and only the second semester of being a Computer engineering major. After a long road trip, spending time to think about where my life is taking me, and remembering how much I really have a passion for flying and aeronautics, I'm seriously considering dropping just this semester to continue pursuing the dream of becoming a pilot. I can use the 10 weeks I have remaining this spring until an internship I landed to really buckle down and get my private pilots license.

After this summer, I'll re-apply to the computer science major and finish my degree.

I also want to mention that I have scholarships and other aid that will not be affected this semester if I withdraw from all of my classes, and I'll continue to be covered for the next two years of my college degree even if I withdraw.

Should I do this?

TL;DR, I want to switch back to my old major because this one is too hard, and I don't even want to use my degree, whatever it is, beyond showing it when applying to become a commercial Pilot because airlines require a degree. There will be no financial penalty if I switch back and withdraw. Should I do it?"

Me and my girlfriend will be coming into Germany for a 6 month  internship.  I will do my internship in Hannover and she will do hers on Braunschweig. We want to live in Braunschweig.

So first of all, what do you consider a more viable option for us ?Staying to an airbnb for 6months , rent an apartment or maybe search a room to somebody elses house? Is the last choose safe ? What are some common things I should look when searching for any of the three ?Are there nay reliable sites which I could use ?

Another question is that since in I will be going from Braunschweig to Hannover for my internship, which is better to use?Bus or Train? Can I buy a monthly ticket for either of these two ? If you could provide me with a site that would be great!

I applied RD to all 8 ivies in January, and rather than asking my chances for a particular school (which is basically impossible to predict), what are the chances I will get into ONE of these schools.  I know, ""I shouldn't be asking because I already applied"", but please, I just want to know for my own sanity and how I stand so I don't receive any surprises at the end of this month.

&amp;#x200B;

**My letters of rec were all between an (8/10) to a (10/10)**. I received one from my Principal praising my work at our school, one from my JSA advisor, one from the History teacher who I intern for, and one from my AP Physics teacher of 3 years

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from this, I am **first generation**, **disabled with gross motor skills**, and have **Asperger's Syndrome** (which is a unique story because it is typically associated with social awkwardness and the inability to communicate effectively, yet I have overcome this disadvantage placed on me at birth and risen to the top through my involvement with debate and public speaking).

There was very little remaining knowledge among our team on the product so I spent a lot of time learning the product and ended up basically being the lead developer on the project as the other developer was slower to pick up the frameworks we were using.

Now, I'm doing an internship at another company and received an offer on linkedin to do some consultant work for the client since the consultancy dropped them as a client (they could not supply developers with the skill set needed - they focus on salesforce development and this client is more typical web development) and I'm one of only a few people who know the app well. We're meeting later to discuss the opportunity and I was wondering what I need to know going into this meeting? I've never done this type of solo work where I'd need to get a contract etc. and just want to make sure I CYA

Do I need to clear this with the company I'm interning at? I'm hoping this is at most 10 hours a week all after work hours or on the weekend and the product is in a completely different area than our product so I don't think this would break any non-compete I may have signed?

Any advice is appreciated"

I would like to ask you for advice.

I once did a Google Summer of Code at the same time as an Internship. However, I am afraid that prospective companies can think that this looks a bit strange and they may get an slighly negative opinion of me.

Because of that, I thought about saying that I did the GSOC (or the internship) one year before and if they find out just say that it was a mistake.

It’s my first job so I’m just happy that they like me and I’m doing good work but I want to get a decent offer too! The workload I have currently isn’t too stressful but I really am ready for more responsibility and a little more complicated tasks. I’ve made it clear to those in charge, have had the discussions and really just waiting to see the outcome. 

I’ve searched and most of the post just discuss getting to this point or just intern pay.. I’m looking at the difference in that when you move to permanent in pay and responsibilities I suppose.   

Any advice or information from someone who has made that transition or negotiated would be awesome! Btw I’m in a high COL area, not SF or anywhere surrounding it. 

Do you think a 40% increase in pay when moving from intern to permanent is realistic? 🤔"

Since I'm a year behind, the co-op program at my school would require me to work a 12 month internship only after my senior year, and then come back for a full year (when I only need half).


I could simply finish my senior year and do couple of more courses, but I'm scared not having an internship will hold me back from job. I'm in a growing tech hub, so I think my opportunity of getting one would be decent. Thanks!


Important detail: I don't mind taking an extra year, but in order to do so I'd have to wait off on taking courses in my senior year to push to my final year, since there's a rule for the minimum amount of courses in my co-op program. I guess I could work on projects with the extra time?"

Hello, Engineers and future engineers, I have a question for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

First a little about myself, I am currently about to graduate in around 9 months with an Engineering Degree in field of Mechanical Engineering, my GPA isn't that great, may be lucky enough to boost it to 3.0 Overall. 

I'm also currently doing an internship in a large company (Con Edison) which I consider myself fortunate to have landed, the pay is really good and it's very goof experience on my resume, but this is a very boring job, my resposeabilities mainly lay on updating Excel sheets of work that is being performed to be reviewed on weekly meetings. So I just sit here, updating the Excel sheets, a work that can be done by a High School student in 3 hours, stretching the job into 30 anyway I can, usually reading Wikipedia.

In general people probably think I hate them or something, because I just come to work, and sit here in the cubicle doing the work without talking to anyone, in reality, that's what you get when you combine an introvert and a workoholic in a confined space =D. The only time I act like myself is when I have some sort of adrenaline rush, the one I experienced at any labor jobs such as contruction or store stocker.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, ending my rant, I would like to ask someone for advice, and who's better than current engineers. 

After extended research in my free time, time I have a lot of =D , I have assed my options. and was wondering.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Are Technician jobs easier to get in with an Engineering degree?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Is there a good prospect of growth from Technician jobs? (I don't mind starting at the pay that is much below engineering entry level pay, but I want to know I have a prospect of earning good money doing what I like)

&amp;#x200B;

3. Do labor union jobs have any prospect of growth, or at least have some sort of value on a resume?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I choose engineering aside from perhaps of course from family history, it's because I wanted to both know how things operate/ have to be designed and be able to do it myself. Rather than telling a technician how it needs to be made and then harass them by checking how it is being implemented. Hence my goal is to be a person who is given an assignment to be performed but can also recommend what can be done in a particular scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who faced such career decisions would really appreciate an advice. Thank You.

Transferred from a CC and now am in a tight spot. I have always wanted to be a inventor/entrepreneur. At first I was interested in Physics because I wanted to learn about the natural world. Now we are getting into theory and really hate it. I thought I could be a inventor similar to Faraday and so on. But I realize that our sciences have become so deeply researched that someone looking into it must get at least a phd and decades of experience. So now I was looking at CS because I enjoy the applications more and enjoy learning more and more. I would plan on getting the degree working with some company developing software for a few years, gathering experience, knowledge etc. Then starting a company of some type. But the department said it may take me 3 more years to get the degree. That would put me 7 years undergrad and extremely in debt. On top of that I am putting myself through college completely and am running low on savings. I could graduate in a year with a econ degree which would be the best case seniro with my money situation. I have a decent background in C, Python and my currently internship is teaching me sql databases and writing software for automation engineering. I plan on publishing a large collection of apps(swift), C and python projects on github as proof. DO you think I could get a job in some development(or job that is heavy in coding) if I graduated with a econ degree but all this background in coding ?

My first year out of college I was an office manager for a sports construction company and I worked at an architecture firm of 6 people for about a year before my current job. Even thought my title includes ""intern"" I get a very good salary so i cant complain there. The problem with all of this is, I just kind of fell into the architectural field. Out of high school I wasn't sure what I wanted to do so I chose architecture. To make things worse I choose a school that didn't give me the architectural degree I would need to be a licensed architect. I didn't know this at the time so now I have to get my masters if I want to be a licensed architect. This is a very lengthy process which does not end with a very high salary immediately after completion. I am definitely proud of the job I have now but find me self regretting having taken this path. I'd like to say I know what I would rather be doing but I do not. One of the things I considered out of high school was getting my degree in computer engineering/science but I wouldn't even know where to start if I was to take that path. I am more tech savvy than the average person but that doesn't mean I would be any good at it. Should I look into something computer related a career or should I just hold out where I am.

* 1 class per summer quarter and during the first year or so

I currently have two opportunities:
- paid internship that is related to CS at Lockheed Martin
- unpaid internship related to AI (work I want to do) at a small startup

I ultimately feel like I’ll end up learning something at both, but my feeling is that working at the startup will give me more useful experience. The only con is that I won’t get paid. I also enjoy the atmosphere at the startup more.

If I plan on pursuing some sort of research or engineering internship in my Freshman year, which job will help me more on my resume?"

axdufl,6,2019-03-04,Frustrated Junior Developer trying to land first job. Where to go from here?,rgprog,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/axdufl/frustrated_junior_developer_trying_to_land_first/,"I don't want this to be a sob story but I genuinely need some advice on where to go from here.

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory:

My background is in Computer Engineering, I don't have a lot of experience in software development during my time in school because our curriculum mostly focused us on hardware (firmware engineering) I even did an internship where I worked with embedded systems. In any case, I started to take my CS electives and I realized I enjoyed web development more than working with firmware/embedded systems, but since I was already graduating I just decided to continue with my degree, take more CS electives some online web courses, and graduated with my degree in May 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I realized, I don't have much experience  to begin with and although my foundations of CS were solid, I still didn't have enough on my portfolio to showcase, so I decided to attend a coding bootcamp in New York City (I live in the area). I learned a lot from that experience, and I was able to apply myself and make several projects through the things I learned from that experience (I have all my projects on my Github page). Even now I still code, making projects or improving the current ones that I have on my portfolio, to improve the skills that I already have.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks after I finished my program, I got an on-site with a small company in New Jersey, and got an offer for $60 + bonus spread throughout the year. But I politely rejected because I felt like I was being low-balled and I made to believe that I could be making more. Ever since, I've had several interviews (phone calls, on-sites, code-pairs, etc.) but nothing ever really pans out. Thinking about it now, I should have just taken that offer rather than be jobless.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, it's been well over 4 months now since I finished that program (I finished October 2018) and I'm still having trouble landing a job offer. I thought given my background I'd have a leverage from my peers, yet I'm still having trouble landing a job. Half of my peers who attended the same program, whether they had background in CS or not, are now making about 80k - 100k average in the NYC area.

&amp;#x200B;

Very recently I did an interview with a big name company, and was politely rejected yet again. I was really confident about this opportunity since I felt like I did really well during the on-site. I connected everyone I spoke and aced the technical interview. I asked for feedback from the Director of Engineering (who was in charge of hiring for that position), and was told that, ""Our interviews are highly competitive, overall you did very well. My generic advice is just to continue to learn and grow.""

&amp;#x200B;

I've grown accustomed to rejections as I continue my job search but this was really frustrating for me. If doing well in interviews and proving that I am technically capable of doing the job is not enough to land a job, then I'm not sure what is.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way I could be approaching my job search better? Or more efficiently? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Junior Developer with background in engineering struggling to find a job even after doing well in several interviews (technical and non-technical wise). What could I be doing better?  Is there a better approach?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. - if you know any opportunities open in the NYC area, please let me know I'd love to apply. I can talk more about my skills and projects privately, just send me a message.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance."

axg1sa,3,2019-03-04,"BA in Psychology, working on I/O Masters, not getting hired, what type of work should I be applying for?",SurprisinglyOrganic,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/axg1sa/ba_in_psychology_working_on_io_masters_not/,"23/F

I graduated with my BA in Psychology back in August and started working on my Master's in Industrial Organizational Psychology in October, completely online, due to graduate April 2020.

I'm not sure what I want (or can) do for work. I moved back home when I graduated from university so there's no need to pay rent or buy food, but I want to start gaining experience and making my own income so I can help out my parents, save away for student loans, become an independent adult, etc.

Some background: when I started university, I was originally a BioMed major. I had it set in my mind I wanted to be a doctor for years, but once I started working on my Bachelors, I decided it wasn't for me and instead decided to go with psychology. I previously never thought to go into psychology because I kept hearing and seeing online how no one can really find work with just a Bachelors degree in it, but it was my favorite subject in high school and I had no other idea to go with, so that's what I chose and left it at that. At that point I thought I would maybe become a family and marriage therapist, a teacher, or even a PA, but nothing really grabbed at me. The only idea that kind of attracted me was being able to use my degree but in a business setting, like marketing or advertising, but I had not taken any business classes, and any minors like those were only restricted to business majors.

A couple months after I graduated,  I applied and got accepted to an I/O Psych Masters program. I went with I/O because I thought it encompassed the idea of what I wanted to do in university: mixing psychology and business. This is what I'm currently working on.

In the meanwhile, I've been looking and applying for work. Every job so far has turned me down. This isn't surprising, considering I'm applying for Human Resource positions and every one of these positions wants at least 1-2 years of experience. The only experience I have is working as an ""intern"" (basically an administrative assistant) for 6 months, only leaving the job to go out of town for university and was, at the time, completing my AA locally.

I'm continuing to look for HR work, but I'm not sure what else I should be trying. I've tried looking into local HR or I/O Psych internships, but the ones available to me are looking for experience or qualifications I don't possess. My other possible option was looking into teaching high school psychology, but I didn't take any classes on education and child psychology and won't be doing so in my Masters program so I feel like that is a dead end.

Any advice, suggestions, or personal experience on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks"

axgmoq,1,2019-03-04,"I feel as though my parents are pressuring me to apply to a Master's program that I feel woefully unprepared for, and I want to wait a little longer. Are these feelings accurate, or am I just entitled?",fuzbonumber5,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/axgmoq/i_feel_as_though_my_parents_are_pressuring_me_to/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Sorry if this seems jumbled, it's about six months of internal conflict to type out so I'm sure parts will be somewhat incoherent.

For some background, I am a 21-year-old college graduate (took me three years) with a BS degree in Microbiology, and have currently been living at my parent's home, rent-free for about six months during some gap time between education. I live rent-free due to my retail job being only part-time and that I do not get enough hours to pay rent remotely consistently. I am in talks to be promoted to full-time, and I have plans to start paying my parents back for being so generous. I am well-aware of my privilege, as it makes me feel guilty and exploitative, like I am taking advantage of my parents.

Now, I will not deny that I have not been strongly motivated over a significant portion of college and these past few months. During college, I was much more focused on academics and a few clubs (social and major-related), than obtaining experience/internships in my field, despite my dad frequently stating that it would be a good idea to do so (this is somewhat the reason I was able to graduate in three years). After I got back, I updated my resume and cover letter and began to send applications out to various companies looking for employment, but had received next to no feedback from any of them, with many better jobs looking for real-world laboratory experience or a Master's degree. Initially, this made me feel hopeless, and about a month went by where I did not do much aside from lay around, doing occasional chores around the house, not actively searching for jobs or post-baccalaureate education or certifications, pretty much nothing aside from applying to options my parents would show me. Eventually, they sat me down and had a couple of talks with me about how things needed to change, that if I was going to take some time away from school, I needed to be better.

Despite the feelings of inferiority inspired by my failures and feelings that I had completely failed at getting the conditions necessary for employment, I did as they said and kept on, though I admittedly slipped back into those old habits four more times, though for much smaller periods of time (1-3 days each), though I have not been like that since late December, as I came to hate the head-space I was put in during those periods. I truly began to work to be better in this aspect due to these talks and the aforementioned guilt over feeling like I was taking advantage of my parents. I even attempted to apply to retail jobs because I needed the money for the holidays, especially since I had recently met up with my girlfriend of 1 year and needed to purchase gifts for her and her family as well. The instant my mother became aware of this, however, she immediately shot the idea down, stating that she had not paid for my degree so that I could be stuck in a low-end retail job. She had always been domineering, and she has threatened to kick me out of the house in the past due to my behavior (admittedly, this was totally justified considering how I had acted, but other instances will be mentioned later). This inspired apathy, but I kept looking and applying for any job I could find, to no success. 

Eventually, I cracked and obtained a part-time retail job behind my mother's back because I was so desperate for money (before my first paycheck, I had less than a dollar remaining in my bank account). Her initial response to learning about this was to glare at me, dead silence otherwise. She did congratulate me about 5 hours after that, but it seemed rather reluctant. She has since lightened up, even helping with the commute to my work, though when I confronted her about her initial response to my applying to retail jobs, she tried to cover it up by saying that she would have allowed it at anytime. The holidays were amazing, with me making enough money to buy gifts for my parents, brothers, girlfriend and her parents. Afterwards, both my parents decided that it was time to get on searching for a Master's program, since so many employers wanted one. I expressed doubts, but these were ignored, and since then, whenever they ask me ""how I feel,"" I say nothing, since it feels completely pointless to counter them. In between searching, I got recommendation letters from a high school professor, my manager and my Scoutmaster, as the former college professors I contacted either did not feel comfortable with writing me one or did not respond at all, though I do have one in a PhD program who has implied that she would be open but has not contacted me since (this comes into play soon). After a month of searching, we decided on an option, but the application was due in less than one month. There was also a biotechnology application that was much more reasonable to complete, and had some extra time, but my mom in particular still enforced that I must sign up for a Master's program, stating that I need to finish it as soon as possible. They made me sign up for a GRE exam that week (I did well, but had no time to study and was wracked with nervousness about it), have shut down any counter-statement by me, and are essentially going to make me apply to this Master's program despite my ""nervousness"" and ""negative attitude"" regarding it (both things they have noted and told me about), stating that I am just ""ungrateful,"" and that I should ""appreciate it when someone does you a favor like we are."" 

At this point, with my only letters of recommendation being from non-major-related individuals, an average academic record, no work experience or other major qualifications,  I would honestly rather wait until the next quarter's application. The issue is neither my mom or my dad will listen to me. They simply tell me to ""stop worrying,"" and that ""this is your major, you're going to get in."" I am not opposed to a Master's program in the future, and I do not desire to be stuck in retail or my parent's household for my whole life, it just feels rushed and I believe that I would do much better if I had more time to prepare all my materials, perhaps complete the certification (which does involve an internship with necessary experience) if I get accepted. I am deeply afraid with the reaction from my mom about hearing this, because she has kicked my younger brother out of the house for refusing to help my dad take down the Christmas lights on multiple occasions (he did say that he ""wasn't their maid"" and was quite dismissive but I do not consider that entirely reasonable justification for my mom's actions). She has also threatened to kick me out for far less than I had initially mentioned. Here are some examples:

1) For talking to my girlfriend about my problems over her (""if you want to be comforted by your little girlfriend, you can go live with her"").

2) When I told her to shut up after she reduced me to tears by yelling at me about all the things I was ""doing wrong"" (rude, I know, but I was having a difficult time emotionally and it was ""pretty obvious that you were hurt,"" as she would later tell me).

3) When I walked to my work late at night without telling her after she insulted me by stating that crying ""made me less of a man,"" and that I needed to ""grow up and stop being a child.""

I am honestly terrified of talking to her or my dad about this for the aforementioned reasons, so much so that I have not told them about any of these feelings. I do not feel prepared, I want to wait so I can be better prepared and educated for such a strenuous program as a Master's degree. Additionally, I feel frustrated at my mother because all her talk about ""not paying for me to be where I am"" makes me feel like she views me as nothing more than an investment rather than a human being with emotions and desires. It just seems like my feelings are not being taken into account, that my parents have complete control over my future, and there is nothing I can do about it due to their experience and authority. Due to my earlier trangressions of apathy and laziness, however, I feel indebted to my parents and I find myself unsure if I am not being a lazy asshole by refusing to get my Master's and get out of their home as soon as possible. I do not know what to do, think, or say, and I could really use some blunt advice and/or a reality check. What should I do about this situation? Am I being entitled? "

axk1hk,0,2019-03-05,Internship dilemma,Noxium51,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/axk1hk/internship_dilemma/,"So I’m currently undergoing one of the better problems to have in this field. Last summer I interned at a multinational company and had a great experience. This semester I’m studying abroad and had been toying with the idea of obtaining a work visa and getting a summer internship here. About a week ago I reached out to them and asked if they had any positions in Europe. Pretty much I asked if they had any network engineering (my last position) or other internships, they said that no network engineering positions were available in Europe. I shot an email back saying I’m open to basically any engineering internship, and they pretty much ignored that and said they wanted me back in the states. I ended up accepting because to be honest I really don’t want to leave an offer lying on the table when I’m this desperate for experience (and cash). From what I understand I’m now in their system or in the process of being placed in the system for this summer, although I haven’t signed anything or filed out any forms, online or otherwise. 

My question is, would it be a dick move to apply to other internships in Europe after I told them I’d work there? If I did end up getting an offer or even just an interview request, how should I handle things with the other company? Should I let them know I’m looking for jobs here now or do I cross that bridge when I get to it? Again I really enjoyed my last internship and hate to go behind their back, but I feel like I have a really unique opportunity here to work in Europe and would like to at least try and take it. Thanks for any advice"

I am starting a salary sharing thread for people based in the tech industry. I think this will help us all in knowing what the industry standard for a particular position is and if we are getting underpaid at our current job. **The bottom line is to negotiate for higher salaries based on the industry  standard**

**Post in the following format:**

* Name of the Company:

* Job Title or Position:

* Years of Experience (0 for intern): 

* Field or Department: 

* Base Salary:

* Bonus (if any):

1. Do not fill out company name if you're from a small company e.g. 75 people or less. This is to prevent doxxing. This was included for entrants of bigger tech companies.

2. If you are based out of India, than **do not** convert the figure to INR

TL;DR at the bottom.

So, I (M 21) am a student in my third and final year of Applied Computer Sciences. This semester I have to do a 14 weeks internship within an IT division. I'm currently doing this internship in the Data Science team within Marketing of a big company. I started last week, super nervous as I was unsure if I'm good enough for the task. Another reason is that my dad works in the same company and in the Marketing division, so he's on the same floor. Everyone on the floor knows him, as in EVERYONE. (He might have been an important factor how I got the internship, but let's not talk about that.) So I'm also stressed out because I don't want to embarrass my dad in front of his colleagues. So the week started with some meetings and some self-learning and all in all, it went great. Everyone was nice, self-learning went well and I was getting confident. After every workday I message my dad and if possible, we coordinate to go home together.

Fast forward to Friday evening, 4PM. I'm done for the day and start closing down all my stuff. I message my dad I'm ready. He messages me that he's finished at 4:30. I wasn't feeling tired so I thought to myself ""Let's continue working I guess"". I start up the computer again and opened the next chapter of the self-learning. I was reading for 5 minutes when I was thinking ""Let's look at the database and run some simpleprograms on it."" Now, this isn't some small, insignificant database, it's a database with all the records of the clients from the company. 13.5M+ records. I look at the table and try to write some simple programs for it (Remind you, I've only done some self learning on test databases, haven't touched the real one yet).The programs work like this, you look through the main database and copy the needed records onto another (new) database. So I run a program that supposedly doesn't have a result (I wrote a typo). I noticed the typo, so didn't mind the 0 results. I run another program, 0 results. Hmmm, that was strange. I run it again, thinking there might have been a connection error. 0 results again. I'm confused and look at the database, 0 records. I'm thinking ""Connection error? please?"" I restart my PC, I check the database. 0 records. At that moment I notice my fuck up. I check my first program and see that hasty me instead of copying it to a new database, overwrote the first database. It's 4:20PM (no pun intended) and I'm thinking "" Do I tell my boss? Can I say it's not my fault?"" All kind of scenarios are going through my head. After a minute I decided to tell my boss. He was like ""What?"" He looked at my program and noticed the mistake. He checked the database file. 128Kb. 13.5M+ records gone. He looked at a backup he made. Back in 2016. Next plan, check on the database manager to see if he has a backup. Offline for 5 minutes. At that moment I'm thinking back to the reddit post about ""I'm fired aren't I?"" situations I read earlier that day and how it fits my situation. My boss decides to just leave it be and messages the other team members about my fu as they'll have to fix it on Monday as he's gone for the week.

I then leave with my dad, guilt-ridden and shaken as I had just deleted 13.5M+ important records.

TL;DR: Decided to work a little longer, made a mistake and wiped an important database with 13.5M+ records with the last backup in 2016

1. I wont be able to show the result of my newly gained graphical work.

I've been working on personal projects and sent out around 200 resumes since then.

I've had a number of phone screens but most didn't move forward. Recently, I was invited for an in-person interview for a full-time position. 2 weeks after the interview, I was offered an invitation to talk about a possible unpaid? internship instead.

I'm concerned about whether accepting this position would make me look desperate. First of all, it was reduced from a full-time position to an internship. Also, they may think that I was interviewing with other companies after them. If I decide to accept their offer after their delayed decision, it may look like I was rejected by the other interviews.

Would it be wise to accept this offer given that I struggled for 2-3 years to find employment?

I'm not asking you guys to make a decision for me but I'd just like to know your thoughts.

Thanks!

UPDATE:
They ended up choosing another candidate who got in via internal referral. Guess I'm back to the application grind.."

That way I can still get through my degree quickly and have internship experience.

I am an undergraduate student studying Geographic Information Science &amp; Technology in Texas. 

I am currently in my junior year and am looking for an internship over the summer. However, it seems like strictly GIS intern positions are few and far between.

My question is if I should be expanding my search to include other opportunities such as engineering internships.

I am mainly focused on GIS analysis but my dream is software development. I know how to use ArcMap and Pro, have scripted Python projects for my university, and currently have a part time gig working with remote sensed data, but I’m limited to 5 hours a week  on it.

My primary issue is that my overall GPA is not the best. I didn’t take my first two years of college seriously and ended up changing majors a few times before deciding on GIS and rebuilding my work ethic and study habits. Still trying to work on getting my GPA back up.

Any and all advice is appreciated!"

Currently I'm doing moderately well in college as a freshman. I've made deans list, I'm getting good grades, managing my ECs pretty well but now as a Comp Sci student, I feel pressured to get an internship. A lot of the people at my university are all trying to intern at one place or another and my family members are also pushing to me to do the same. One particular family member of mine who has a PhD, makes it abundantly clear that if I don't get one this time, it'll become extremely difficult to get a job/internship in the years to come. 

  
So I've tried my best to fix up my cover letter, CV and other letters. I've applied to dozens upon dozens of start up companies willing to take a freshman student with little experience and while I have gotten interviews for some of them, there hasn't been any responses afterwards. I feel very vexed and nervous for this summer as I feel like I'm letting myself and my family down. I also feel that by not getting an internship this summer, I'm essentially giving myself the proverbial rocky road.

 I'm looking primarily at computer science internships when I'd love and slightly prefer to look at internships in politics focusing on East Asia, that's much more my wheelhouse rather than programming (which I equally enjoy). The money just isn't there in these politics internships, as much as I love it I want to be able to eat and pay rent and not have to worry about my finances over the summer. I'd like to save money for travel and not have my parents shell out another 1k/mo for me to be able to live in the DC area over the summer and go into more debt for my college than I should.


How did you end up finding your internship, as in where do you suggest I look/search criteria? It stresses me out to no end having to apply to these things on LinkedIn or their own website only to get zero response after weeks of waiting."

Please give your inputs and help me make a decision between these offers.

A little bit about me-

1. International student with MS CS degree from a SUNY university
2. Not too good at coding because I have switched careers only through Masters. I did not have CS background.
3. Pretty comfortable in python because my internship, assistantship and coursework projects were in python
4. Intends to prepare more and interview with BigN companies next year. I already interviewed with most of them and did not clear onsite. But they went okay that I believe I can definitely get an interview next year if I contact the recruiter. 
5. Wayfair is offering 110k base+5k joining bonus for boston, IBM Aspera 130k base and 10k joining bonus for california. After taxes and living expenses, I think it is about the same.

Wayfair-

Pros:

1. Work will be in Python. So I can focus on building logics and implementing algorithms rather than learning the syntax of a new language.
2. I heard that the work in this team is good. not sure how true.
3. Moderate pace.

Cons:

1. No job security. I read a lot of bad reviews on glassdoor about the ruthless firing policies of Wayfair. I read on team blind that it's not happening much now and that it is totally performance dependant. But again, I'm not too confident about my coding skills.

IBM Aspera-

Pros-

1. Bay area! More calls in future
2. Slow pace (I think). It could help me give more time to do leetcode and pick up skills on work

Cons-

1. I will be coding in Ruby. Will need to learn the syntax of new language at work while doing leetcode in python at home. Could be confusing and challenging initially. Ruby is similar to python, so may not be difficult to learn ruby.
2. Not sure if the work is interesting. I might have to work on front end in future. I'm not interested in front end. But this is after 6 months or more. Not immediately
3. Not sure how ruby on my resume will affect my future applications.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a reasonably smart person who is moderately hard working. It may not be difficult for me to pick up new skills but working in python will help me get a headstart and I love python. But I'm not quite confident about my coding skills that I can be confident that I won't be fired at Wayfair. I would definitely want to switch in an year no matter which one I choose.

&amp;#x200B;

Please advise.

I want to land a job in IT and eventually pen testing. Currently 18 Senior in High School.",AravisoWo,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/axtc5m/traditional_college_math_degree_internships_and/,"I'm currently at a cross roads and need opinions on the job prospects of the Data Science and Web Dev Programs at Lambda. This topic came up since I haven't seen or heard anything about the math department at U of H, which in turn, means I haven't seen any data on the job prospects for being a graduate of the university. And that is scaring me. I want to land a job in IT and eventually pen testing and am debating whether its more viable to go to a traditional college and get internships and certs to put in my resume or take the data science and web dev programs at Lambda and get certs at a coding bootcamp (the one hosted by UT is one I'm currently interested in and researching. If you have any opinions, feel free to pm or comment as well) and just build my portfolio from there.

Currently have no scholarships and have not been accepted for FAFSA yet so I'm starting to worry about having to pull out student loans, which is what I'm trying to avoid.

I am interested in the school for two reasons:

1. The business model (at least to my understanding) of ""study now and pay when you are making a certain amount of money annually"" is really REALLY appealing to me
2. The connections and job prospects of graduates of this school are very impressive and its drawing me into wanting to become part of the models success story. (It's  rather naive, but I don't believe in the current business models of the colleges here where pursuing an education means taking out student loans in order to just pay for the degree. I just want to find a way around that system, so to speak)

The pro's I see in getting a formal degree is that there's job security in that sense, but getting a math degree from University of Houston isn't looking appealing to me only because the school's math department isn't as well known. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: College debt is crazy and I don't want to go broke before I even begin in the work field so I need opinions on the data science and web dev programs and the probability of landing a job in the netsec department with with a math degree and certs vs. lambda data science and web dev degrees/certs and certs from UT coding bootcamp.

axtjrm,58,2019-03-05,i'm just. so. drained.,ineedtopassclass,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/axtjrm/im_just_so_drained/,"This post might be a huge stream of consciousness, so I'm sorry about that, but I have to let it out. For some context, I'm a current high school senior.

I just... I just don't know how to deal right now. I've been living, breathing, sleeping, eating college for years. Six months ago, I scoffed at our state school, and when I said ""I need to get into college,"" I meant, ""I need to get into the Ivy League, or maybe some T20."" I was awful. Truly disgusting. It's disgusting how I treated people who went to our state school, or any state school, or any school that wasn't a name-brand ""good school."" I wish I could take it all back.

But it's who I was, and it was partially my own doing and partially a product of my high-achieving peers and my Yale-PHd-receiving parents (oof). A-minuses provoked anxiety, fear of failure was my biggest fear, and stress was my middle name. Not uncommon, I'm sure, among high-achieving students.

But somehow, around the time when I actually had to apply to college, something snapped. I couldn't find the motivation to write good essays and submit good applications because I was horrified of rejection. And so, I applied last-minute everywhere, and said ""fuck it"" to my so-called dreams.

And I became okay. I became happy to go to my state school (which is, incidentally, where I'm headed this fall! Go IU!!); I became really, truly content.

But... somehow, I must've not been as content as I thought I was because I still have this sinking feeling every time someone mentions college. I'm so fucking drained from this process, and even though I know the school I'm headed to is an excellent school, I'm so mentally exhausted from the last four years. It's like, whenever I did something (studied, took on an extra-curricular, an internship, whatever), something in the back of my mind said ""This will pay off. This will pay off when you can tell people that you're going to an Ivy League/T20/traditionally ""good school."" And now... now I don't know how to deal with that not happening. It's not that I'm sad I'm not going - sad isn't the right word.

It's more that I've lost every milligram of motivation I could've had. Shit, I have a scholarship application that's due in 2.5 hours, and I'm not doing it, and I probably won't do it. I'm tired all the time, I'm content with never coming out of my room, and I can't seem to find the will to live.

It's probably more than just the college process - like yes, I'm sure there are underlying mental health problems that have gone untreated for too long at play - but college is a big part of it. Because our society defines so much by where you went to college. Like, just this evening, I was with a friend who got a likely-letter from an Ivy League school. And I am so, SO damn happy for her. She deserves it so much. But we were together at an event, and someone said ""yeah good for you for going to \[state school\]! But the ivy league is better lmao."" It was not at all malicious, but it just shows that college is a big part of who you are. There's a big difference between saying, even 50 years down the line, that you graduated from Harvard or that you graduated from X-State-U.

So anyway, my point is, I'm trying to be content. And I will be. When I get into the dorms and the college-life, etc. etc. I will be happy. But right now... fuck, right now I'm trying to find the energy to roll out of bed in the morning. Because it seems like I wasted so much of my life straining towards something that won't happen, towards something I won't get. And I know I'll figure out how to deal with that in a healthy way and wear my cream and crimson with pride. But today is not that day. Not yet.

It will happen though. I know it will."

axuvpg,16,2019-03-05,Should I still list internships from 5 years ago?,Kekarotto,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/axuvpg/should_i_still_list_internships_from_5_years_ago/,"I've got a career fair coming up and I am a less than optimal candidate for employment stats-wise (don't worry I'll still sell myself like one). I'm a super super senior chemical engineering student with a less than stellar gpa (2.7). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I got to participate in truly ground-breaking nanotech research my first year at the university (2012) and two internships, one in 2013 and 2014 for a petrochem fortune 400 company. I got to be there in a rare turnaround period for an old unit, work on high capital (300,000 and 220,000 dollar) projects working with re-designing RO unit configurations and alternate chemical suppliers. I met the CEO of the entire company and worked with him on safety training implementation, and even got to do some work with operators designing easier, more natural control systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds really great from an employment perspective but this was all 5-6 years ago. I hit a rough time in my life where I  moved back home, became my grandmothers caretaker after her bout with sudden heart failure, and began doubting my abilities. My grades slipped, I lost my full-ride scholarship, and I fell into depression and thought about dropping out. I honestly should have to save my grades but the choice was more clear in hindsight. I at least built a business with my friend and sold it in this time but I doubt that makes up for much in employer's minds as anyone can have a friend say they did that together. 

  
I can explain away my long time to graduate and less than optimal gpa behind closed doors in an interview environment but at a career fair I dont know how to tackle this problem and even moreso dont know if internships and research from 5+ years ago is worth it if it reminds them how long ive been in school or is considered too long ago. Any engineers out there sympathize with my situation and have some insight as to how I can tackle this?

If I do this internship, and apply again for new grad positions in August, would I be able to start immediately?

axvff7,1,2019-03-06,CPA vs LDP Program,TheFasterMAC,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/axvff7/cpa_vs_ldp_program/,"Hi, I am in my final year studying business management and have taken accounting throughout university. I’m currently considering 3 options , and didn’t know which one to go with for Full Time Recruitment that would look the best on my resume and skills learned!

Option 1) Audit at big 4

Option 2) Corporate accountant (industry, I’m assuming it’s financial reporting)

Option 3) Leadership Development Program (2 Year Rotational Program, not necessarily accounting may be operations)

I’m leaning more towards option 2, as I have done an internship in a similar role, but I would like to consider option 3 if some one could weigh in on their experiences in such a role. I don’t really want to do big 4 audit, but I would consider if it’s worthwhile. 

I just need help in choosing what option would be best for career progression, salary, and work life balance :).

If there’s any other information you need please ask, I’m new to posting here. 

Thanks!"

After eight and a half years of being together, she left me through a text message while I was fifteen hours away doing an internship. No warnings or discussion.  
When I got back home two months later, she let me take her to a mountain town for a day trip. We had such a wonderful time. She let me kiss her and she was happy.  
That night she still told me she doesn't want to be together and it makes absolutely no sense to me.  
  
That was nine months ago, and she hasn't spoken a single word to me, and I'm pretty certain she's blocked me from everything. I wish I was dead every single day. I dream of her literally every single night, can't focus on my last semester of college, and don't understand why my life ended up like this. I badly do not want to have this experience anymore and will likely kill myself soon.  
  
Our ninth anniversary would have been next week on the fifteenth, and she will never, ever speak to me again. I will never know if she is doing well, where she is in this massive world. She will surely be with someone else one day, and likely already is. And I cannot live with that."

Should I improve my GPA?,anibru92,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/axvv1z/will_it_be_difficult_to_find_a_job_once_i/,"I am graduating in a few months(May 2019) with a degree in Electrical Engineering and have been applying to places but have not received any responses. I have a 3.15 GPA and have had 1 internship that was for 6 months.  I’m afraid my GPA is too low and employers are filtering my resume out due to my GPA.  I am interested in integrated circuit design, hardware design and DSP and would like to get a job in these areas. From an outsiders perspective am I hopeless? How difficult will it be for me to land a job? 

Plan B: Also, I do have the option to retake a couple course I did poorly in that would help boost my GPA to a 3.25. The only catch is that I would have to postpone my graduation until fall 2019 but have told all my friends and family I will be graduating this spring and I don’t want to disappoint them.

So in summary, should I retake these courses because i have zero chance of finding a job? Or will I have no problem finding a job? Any guidance would help.

axwkar,9,2019-03-06,Job Offer and Waiting on Interviews,jubzneedstea,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/axwkar/job_offer_and_waiting_on_interviews/,"It's my junior year, and I've been doing a bunch of interviews for various summer internships, but as a safety net I reached out to my previous summer employer and asked if they would be willing to have me back for the summer. They said yes, but I really want to get one of the other internships simply because I would be doing more than office work, which is essentially what I did at this previous company (but I was well-paid, well-fed, and well-caffeinated). Interning for these other companies would diversify my resume and get me exposure to different career paths for my major. 

I guess I feel kind of dumb for reaching out so early, but I was having pretty bad anxiety about not getting anything for the summer, and I remember that this place had been hiring around this time and I would've felt so stupid if I'd missed my shot at getting my old job back and ended up with nothing to do over the summer.

My question is how do I hold off on formally accepting the job offer until I hear back from the other companies? I've only gone through 1st stage interviews so I have no clue whether I'll even make it to on-site or get actual offers, but I would regret having to later turn one of these down. It's just nerve-wracking because I have no clue when anyone's going to get back to me.

Do I come clean to my old employer about my situation and ask for more time to decide? Or do I just accept the offer and just hope for better next year? Definitely don't want to burn down any bridges if it turns out that telling them the truth makes them rescind their offer."

My hangup is that I really want to be a Software Engineer (specifically something high level like a Full Stack Agile Developer) as a career, and I'm not sure whether this role on my resume would actually help advance that goal.  However, after hundreds of applications and many interviews, this is the only offer I have. I'm not very confident I would still find something if I declined the offer, as it's getting pretty late in the semester.

I finish my BA this April and I have accepted an offer for an MSc to start in late September this year (with an option of deferral). This gives me 5-6 months out for summer to do whatever I want but I am afraid that it will not be enough to satisfy me, as I really want to do a working holiday visa (which is normally 12 months). The degree also includes a compulsory paid 3 month internship at the end of it too, so that could be my official start to professional work, or if I waited to take a gap year, the money I earn it could fund the beginning of my travels. On the flip side, I feel scared that an 18 month gap (because I'd postpone my degree to Sept 2020) is too long? Taking a gap year after my masters would mean being disqualified from graduate schemes, but my postgrad is in CS and therefore I feel like I could freelance and not worry about graduate schemes at all. Pretty confused so I'd appreciate hearing anyone's experiences or thoughts."

I have been getting a fair amount of companies sending me their challenges, but I always seem to fail and time is running out to get an internship for the summer, so I decided to get serious and prepare for my next challenge thoroughly over this week. I think I need to set up time to work towards these challenges as I assumed my classes would be enough to pass them, but I always fail. This is mainly due to me panicking when thinking about the question and just not being able to plan out my time correctly. I know I can do the solution, but I just get stuck mentally and do not perform well. Therefore I figured the solution would be more experience with coding challenge style problem and me recreating the setting and stress. The plan I made for the next week gives me \~40 hours to prepare for a challenge a big company sent me. I figured I would spend about 30 hours on Cracking the Coding Interview as I hear that recommended a lot, and the other 10 hours on Hacker Rank. Is this a good plan or should I be doing something else? Appreciate any help and thank you."

I saw the ad for the internship the night of the final deadline for submitting a solution for the application and made something really quickly. I honestly didn't think I was going to get accepted but I was hoping some of you guys could give me some feedback on what I should have done better in my code. The two csv files are provided in the Wolt GitHub link

That's the link to what I sent them. My solution I think technically worked but imo is kinda sloppy haha idk really?

 Any feedback would be appreciated the deadline is already long over due but I figured I'd try to post this here. The two csv files needed to run my code can be found in the first link from the Wolt GitHub page.

My guess is that if such a thing existed, then it would probably be offered by big companies( maybe in the form of special programs and such). After all, who could cover accommodation, transportation, and such?

Assuming it's possible, I know it would be super difficult to stand out but I'm willing to take my chances. So overall, what are your thought fellas and what can/should I do.

Background:

I'm majoring in computer and communications Engineering. Sophomore year already. I'm a resident of Lebanon. As you may know, CCE is pretty much a marriage between hardware and software. Already done /doing OOP, electronics, microcontrollers, digital logic, and more. Ideally, I would love to intern at a place that would require knowledge in both hardware and software. But I'm also open to those internships that offer either. Moreover, I'll be taking a lot of networking classes in my last two years with the chance to earn CCNA, CCNP certifications if I get high enough grades. So that could also be a path but obviously not for now.

I’m not looking for how to get into the BI field, since I am already involved, but more-so what roles/options are out there since I recently decided to stay into this area and move forward with my career. Upfront, I am 4 years into my career with 2 of those doing specific BI work. I’ll try to split this post up by first talking about the details about my current BI shop, what I am doing now, and my background.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work for a large financial company in the US. Our BI shop is primarily and heavily MicroStrategy based, and entirely situated in IT’s area. We sort of lend our services to any business areas within the organization who want to setup a BI solution, meaning everything from getting the data setup properly to finally creating reports/dashboards/webapps. We deploy internal stuff, but also external BI solutions, for example, to allow our customers to see the business they do with us through a web portal with visualizations (old monthly pdf reports are now transformed and acessible online and on-demand for customers). We are slowly on-boarding Tableau into our supported apps in conjunction with MicroStrategy.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, our BI team is so large that every single job/position is very siloed. We have data systems analysts whose job is primarily to make sure how we are getting the data, if business rules are good, create solutions for complex business rules if we are hardcoding it into the database, create the model, where to store the data etc. This position kind of documents everything and feeds the other people for the most part. We have people who only create DDL’s to create tables and what not (they kind of help with data governance and naming conventions a bit though). ETL developers, SIT/UAT testers, MicroStrategy architects who start building the cubes/ handle the systems, people who build MSTR attributes/calculations, UI/UX team. There’re probably some others I’m missing.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in the data analyst role mentioned above and I’m not 100% sure if I want to stay in this area. In some ways, I feel that we do the grunt of the work which is very beneficial, but also, I feel pretty useless. Mostly because once our part is done, it just kind of moves on down the factory line and I don’t get to do anything else with the process. I also am not learning as much as I want to because of this and feel like my skills as an “analyst” sounds shitty and not marketable when trying to move forward with the career. I also spend a lot of time trying to find data, or doing gap analysis on other database systems to see if a database has the proper attributes for a new project, which is a very very crushing process and doesn’t really work on my skills at all. So far, ETL work does not look like it would satisfy me. Maybe I would be better suited moving down the “factory line” and further away from the database, creating cubes or data attributes, or even doing UI/UX. The UI/UX teams always look like they are having more fun lol. I can also see a very slight ability to use some creativity in these areas more, which I would 100% enjoy, because the rigidity of the analyst’s work pretty much has to be 100% correct and just structured to the max. I am not quite sure If I want to stay on the tech BI side or move more toward the business BI side.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I am getting at is that I am most likely ready for a new job in the coming months, I just do not know what I want, or how other companies’ BI shops are like and what roles are out there. I don’t think I want to remain a siloed “analyst” with what feels like having no real skills, or barely using them. I will say though, being an analyst has opened my eyes a lot a probably the best stepping stone to move into other BI areas. There is probably something to be said working for a large company vs a smaller one. Should I start learning things that I am missing out on right now, like more SQL, a visualization tool and maybe Python down the road? Should I learn a specific BI application to be more marketable? For instance, just jump right into PowerBI and take some training on it and try to get a job using it?

&amp;#x200B;

My Background:

Schooling: Bachelors- IT information systems degree (business/IT degree) concentration: Business Intelligence

Internship- desktop support/ physical PC stuff

Internship- IT project manager

2 years- Windows Server Systems Administrator

2 years- Business Intelligence Analyst

86k salary. High cost of living area (not SF or NYC though)

&amp;#x200B;

BI Skills- SQL (need to improve on this some more), some MicroStrategy. Of course some other skills and knowledge about dimensional modeling etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If you could please share what you’ve experienced in your BI journey including technologies, roles, insights, large vs smaller companies, salaries etc. it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

In some ways, I feel that we do the grunt of the work which is very beneficial, but also, I feel pretty useless. Mostly because once our part is done, it just kind of moves on down the factory line and I don’t get to do anything else with the process. I also am not learning as much as I want to because of this and feel like my skills as an “analyst” sounds shitty and not marketable when trying to move forward with the career. I also spend a lot of time trying to find data, or doing gap analysis on other database systems to see if a database has the proper attributes for a new project, which is a very very crushing process and doesn’t really work on my skills at all. So far, ETL work does not look like it would satisfy me. Maybe I would be better suited moving down the “factory line” and further away from the database, creating cubes or data attributes, or even doing UI/UX. The UI/UX teams always look like they are having more fun lol. I can also see a very slight ability to use some creativity in these areas more, which I would 100% enjoy, because the rigidity of the analyst’s work pretty much has to be 100% correct and just structured to the max. I am not quite sure If I want to stay on the tech BI side or move more toward the business BI side.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I am getting at is that I am most likely ready for a new job in the coming months, I just do not know what I want, or how other companies’ BI shops are like and what roles are out there. I don’t think I want to remain a siloed “analyst” with what feels like having no real skills, or barely using them. I will say though, being an analyst has opened my eyes a lot a probably the best stepping stone to move into other BI areas. There is probably something to be said working for a large company vs a smaller one. Should I start learning things that I am missing out on right now, like more SQL, a visualization tool and maybe Python down the road? Should I learn a specific BI application to be more marketable? For instance, just jump right into PowerBI and take some training on it and try to get a job using it?

&amp;#x200B;

My Background:

Schooling: Bachelors- IT information systems degree (business/IT degree) concentration: Business Intelligence

Internship- desktop support/ physical PC stuff

Internship- IT project manager

2 years- Windows Server Systems Administrator

2 years- Business Intelligence Analyst

86k salary. High cost of living area (not SF or NYC though)

&amp;#x200B;

BI Skills- SQL (need to improve on this some more), some MicroStrategy. Of course some other skills and knowledge about dimensional modeling etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If you could please share what you’ve experienced in your BI journey including technologies, roles, insights, large vs smaller companies, salaries etc. it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

ay22xn,343,2019-03-06,I spent some weeks as a night-shift vet tech. It nearly killed me.,AdelaideHope,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ay22xn/i_spent_some_weeks_as_a_nightshift_vet_tech_it/,"When you're sixteen, you do some dumb things. Really, I would argue that you do a lot of dumb things. Or maybe, to be more clear, you *start* doing the dumb things that all adults do without realizing how dumb they are.

Like working for free. ""Interning,"" as they say. *At least* as a student you get class credit for doing it, but nevertheless: who works for free?

Parents are to blame for this. They cloud your mind with a lot of nonsense.

""This is your first foray into adulthood, Addy!"" my dad would say as he pitched the idea.

""Everyone has to learn some real-world responsibility one day!"" my mom would chime in in that authoritarian tone that I'd come to know simply as her voice.

And so I looked and looked, but nothing interested me. It wasn't until I was about a week from the deadline (the school forced us to do this-- another layer of bullshit I forgot to mention) that I came home and found a flyer in my bed:

""**PetsULove**

**PetsULove is hiring a new vet tech for an unpaid internship. School credit available.**

**Hours: 8pm to 6am Saturdays**

**Contact Mort for more details at** [**xxxxx@petsulove.com**](mailto:xxxxx@petsulove.com)""

I left out the email on purpose. It's not to protect Mort. Quite the opposite, it's to protect you. Trust me, if nobody hears of this place or internship for a thousand years, I will die happy, because what I saw there is something that I can't prove, but I know it's real, and you are the only people that I can tell this to.

I need to document what happened.

Let me start by saying that PetsULove has been the main vet in town since I was a kid. We used to go there with our pets Kuro and Sebastian (before Sebastian's untimely passing). In fact, we got Kuro *from* PetsULove, which will become pretty damn important later, so remember that.

I grew up wanting to be a vet because of that place. I met so many nice veterinary assistants there. Luke was the first I remember: he was the one that showed me Kuro for the first time.

""No Addy, this black cat is very gentle, as long as you're gentle with him,"" I remember him telling me. Kuro is still my best friend, to this day, over ten years later.

Then there was James, a shy and soft-spoken vet tech that took his job very seriously. He wasn't good with words but you could see in every motion that he loved the animals and was very professional.

And finally, there was Janice. Janice was sweet, charming, good-looking and great with kids. She wasn't a great vet tech (dropped things constantly, forgot to file paperwork), but she was so sweet you just loved to see her.

But as Kuro got older, we stopped visiting PetsULove as frequently. Animals have a way of not needing too much medical attention, if you're lucky. And so, when I came with the flyer on a day after school to check in at the vet and see if they still needed an intern, I wasn't surprised that all the veterinary techs had changed.

Now, there was only one, and his name was Mort. He ostensibly ran every facet of the vet except for doctor visits, which happened daily from 10am-5pm. He knew all the clients, charted all the prognoses and treatments, and organized everything. I found out later from my dad that a lot of people thought he was actually the owner-- a kind of silent owner, that ran things and paid the actual doctor (Dr. Gold) a salary to come in and work.

Mort was about 40. If he was really the owner, he must be new, I figured, or at least within the last ten years or so, because growing up I don't ever remember seeing him. As I opened the door to walk into PetsULove, he sat calmy behind the check-in counter.

""Adelaide Hope. Welcome,"" he said softly, almost as if in mourning.

I paused, surprised.

""How do you know my name?""

""How could I ever forget?"" he said back, deadpan, ""Your cat is Kuro, who came from this very place. Your dog was a very good guest here as well. I'm so sorry for your loss.""

""You.. knew Sebastian?"" I asked, confused. I think we'd only ever brought Sebastian for shots, and I don't remember meeting Mort ever.

""Why yes, quite well. I'm sorry, you must not remember, but we've met,"" he said, his eyes gazing past me as he outstretched his hand.

I shook it, and it was cold and clammy. It felt like touching something that just came out of a lukewarm aquarium.

""Anyway, you are here for the internship,"" he said, glancing at the flyer in my hand.

He told me the details. It was a night-shift, once a week. Every other internship was daily on weekdays, but this one, because of the inconvenience hours, got you the same credit for just that one night per week. I needed to start right away on Saturday (it was Friday that day) and I needed to get one thing clear.

""Any issue, no matter how small, comes straight to me,"" he finished, handing me a post-it note with his cell-phone number on it.

""Got it, Addy?"" he resumed, growing serious.

""Straight to you, yeah. Of course,"" I said back quickly.

The internship seemed too good to be true, and I wanted to say whatever I needed to to get it. Sure, he was creepy, but one day a week for six weeks beats the hell out of a Monday-through-Friday internship.

""Let me show you to the back,"" he now said, guiding me with his hand on my back. Even through my clothes it felt like a wet sponge was touching me.

In the back was a series of cages, most empty.

""This is where we house our guests. Not too many this time of year, but the few that are here must be cared for with great attention. Most will be sleeping while you are here, but if any awake, for any reason, you must call me immediately.""

""If they... wake up?""

""Yes, precisely,"" he followed up, ""Leave the room and call immediately.""

""I.. um, okay.""

""Terrific!"" Mort now bellowed, beaming a smile that I didn't know he was capable of, ""Then I will see you Saturday night to let you in, and then I'll leave you to it.""

He shook my hand again. Again, yuck. Then he hurried me out of the store and watched me walk down the long block back home. When I turned to check on him as his store was just dropping out of sight, I still saw him standing there, like a statue.

Was it creepy? Sure. But I was going to get that credit, so the following Saturday I showed up at 7:45 in the evening, ready for my night shift. He let me in, showed me to the back, and reminded me about the waking animals.

""If some animals should become... aggressive,"" he now trailed off for a moment, lost in thought, ""There is a buzzer over there."" He pointed to a stick dangling on the wall.

""Buzzer?"" I asked, confused.

""The shock wand, Adelaide. It is used to subdue the unruly guests.""

Then he handed me the keys and left, without another word. I stood in the back room, looking at the little creatures falling into their slumber. There was an older looking German Shepherd, a calico overweight cat, and an exotic bird that looked like some kind of parrot. Their cage-tags said their names were Jax, Cynthia, and Oscar, respectively.

*All seem rather mellow,* I thought to myself. I walked back toward the front office where a swivel-chair and a desk stood, and got out my schoolwork. What a sweet deal, I thought to myself, I can knock out all my school work, maybe even get some sleep, and after a few Saturdays I'll have a semester's worth of credit.

Thing were going fine until around 9:45. Until then, the place had been dead quiet. Most stores closed at 8 and so the little strip mall the vet office was in had no traffic. What's more, it was at the end of one of our small boulevards so even the street outside of it was rarely used when shops were not open. From my desk I could peer out into the dimly lit abandoned street and shops, some with faint neon signs still flickering in their storefronts.

But at 9:45, I heard some commotion outside. It sounded like some clutter being dragged or moved, and out of sheer boredom I figured I'd go take a look. Walking out into the street was an almost surreal experience as I realized that I truly was alone here-- the nearest residences were blocks away, and the outside of this part of town was just as quiet as the inside. I looked a bit up and down the street, but it was far too dark to locate the sound and I chalked it up to some raccoons raiding trash bins, because let's face it, that happens quiet a lot in semi-rural townships.

It wasn't until I was walking back to the vet office that I noticed the door slightly ajar. As I stopped to look at it in more detail, I saw that it was even moving a little bit. I trained my eyes but it was hard to see in the dark what was happening, so I slowly walked up as quietly as I could.

Finally, I saw it, all the way at the bottom of the door. It was Jax, the shepherd, butting his nose against the door and trying to scramble out. How he got out of his cage was beyond me, but I immediately rushed toward him.

By the time I got to him, about half his body was outside the door and I was shocked at his state. His head and shoulders looked like they lost a lot of their fur, and he was completely bare in places. Further, he had large, protruding tumors coming out of his shoulders and arms, and his snout looked misshapen and swollen. Even worse, he moaned in what I assumed was pain-- not exactly a dog moan, either. That is to say, it was a real *moan*, like an anguished vaguely human sounding moan. I freak out, snatched him quickly and, despite Mort's warnings, he didn't put up a fight at all as I carried him back into the shop. He felt weak and fatigued if anything.

I got him back in the cage as quickly as I could and locked the door, which seemed to get his moaning to subside. What's worse, I saw that the locks on the two other cages, of Janice and Oscar, were also opened and the door were teetering ajar. I closed the quickly and locked them. By this point I was freaking out a bit, and I called Mort. I told him what had happened, and in a frenzied pace I tried to explain that I didn't do anything to his cage, that he somehow got out on his own and I don't know how, and that he's having some kind of severe reaction. I barely remembered to breath as I was rambling this all to Mort, who cut me off in a gentle tone.

""Adelaide, Adelaide, nothing to be alarmed about. The important thing is that you called. You called only me, right?""

""I, uh, yes of course, just like you told me, it's just that Jax looks--""

""Don't worry, Adelaide, that's totally normal. Sometimes the animals get out, and as long as you make sure they don't run off you'll be fine,"" he said back in that gentle, mellow tone.

""But his face, Mort, it's--""

""I'm confident he just needs to rest a bit, Adelaide. He will be better soon. Be sure to call if anything else comes up.""

I said sure and Mort hung up the phone, as if he didn't have a care in the world. I thought that he hadn't understood me-- that he hadn't understood the severity. I hastily went back to check on Jax.

To my surprise, his growths seemed to have shrunk a bit, and what's even more interesting is that his snout, which had lost some patches of fur, seemed to have small, fine hairs on it. At least a quarter inch or so of *new* hair. That can't be possible, I thought.

But as I checked more and more, every thirty minutes or so, he regained his composition. I wanted to stay up all night with him, but by about one in the morning I passed out at my desk.

By closing opening time (around six in the morning) I was awakened by a knock on the door. It was Mort. I jumped up from my desk and let him in.

""Have a good sleep?"" he asked in a surprisingly cheery tone.

""I'm so sorry, Mort, I just dozed off.""

""No worries, Adelaide. So let's go check on Jax.""

We walked back, and to my surprise found Jax in perfect health. He had completely transformed and his face and body betrayed nothing of the misshapen beast I'd rescued the night before. I told Mort it didn't make sense, I couldn't believe it.

""Sometimes, Adelaide, when you start out in this line of work, the brain can make much out of small situations. Jax likely had an allergy flare up, but in your memory it was worse than it was.""

That's all he said as he took the keys off the desk and went to hold the door open for me, bidding me to leave.

""So, I'll see you next Saturday,"" he said back, calm as always, ""Great job, by the way.""

I said goodbye and trudged out.

I should have never come back. I should have called the police. But I didn't know then what I would find out a week later, on my second Saturday at PetsULove.

ay29al,881,2019-03-06,My experience with getting an Electrical Engineering degree,heavyd52001,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ay29al/my_experience_with_getting_an_electrical/,"I have been reading a lot of posts and thought I would add my experience with school to give some of you hope.

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated last December at the young age of 31 and it was a big struggle to get my degree. It took me 5.5 years because I failed a couple of key classes and had to wait a year to take it again. I was never able to get an internship after I sent out hundreds of applications. But I was able to overcome all these set backs and even had a job when I graduated. There are a couple of things I learned that I wish to pass on to you:

&amp;#x200B;

* Once you find what you want to do get with the Professor that covers that topic and become their friend. My Professor not only talked to me about the field, he got me a job with the research center and involved me in his own research projects. Since I never got an internship this experience is what impressed my present employer to hire me.
* GPA is important but a good employer will look at the transcript and see how you did at the end. I only had a 2.75 GPA but my employer saw that I got B+/A's in the high level classes that pertained to the job. I told my boss how I struggled at the beginning of school so he discarded my first couple of semesters when looking at my transcript.
* Look at what companies approach your school regularly. It is a lot easier for a manager to see a school they recognize and know the general quality of the students coming from there. If they have never heard of your school it is a crap shoot of knowing the quality of your degree. If are not sure what companies approach the school ask the professors in your department.
* Make your mental health a priority.  I suffered from depression and anxiety through out school and only decided my last semester to finally get professional help. I wish I had done it a long time ago. I felt so much better about school with the medication and counseling. I know this can be expensive but I found a place that only charged based on you income level and I was able to afford the help. Your school will also probably offer some free services as well.

I know engineering is a really hard degree to get but it is so worth it when you get that job and get to work on some really cool projects. This is an endurance degree and you just need to put forth your best effort and hold on til the end.

ay3gji,15,2019-03-06,Is a BA in biology useless?,lilgoosebeans,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ay3gji/is_a_ba_in_biology_useless/,"I completed two years of graphic design classes and a semester long internship, and then decided I wanted to switch majors. This past fall semester I took chem 1 lecture and lab, and biology 1 lecture and lab. This semester I’m in chem 2 lecture &amp; lab and bio 2 lecture &amp; lab. So far I’ve loved bio, and chem has been a struggle. I really wanna avoid organic chemistry if possible at all, but if I don’t take it, I can’t get a BS or go to grad school. I took chem in high school and struggled, went to art school thinking I’d never have to deal with it again, and now here I am! I just think if I’m struggling in general chemistry I’ll die in ochem 1 and 2. Also have to take labs with those, and I’m not a huge fan of chem lab right now. So it seems like it’ll be a rough go if I have to take another year of chemistry classes. 

I want to work at a zoo or aquarium or wildlife center or honestly anything involving animals. For a career in that, is a BA in biology useless? I’ve looked at jobs and careers online that I’d love to do one day, and they all require a bachelor’s in biology or other life sciences. It never specifies BA or BS, but I’m assuming BS is preferred. And I don’t want to get a BA and then realize I’m fucked and unemployable. 

Basically I’m afraid of ochem but don’t wanna get a useless degree.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have encountered this semester is I am struggling in my business classes quite a bit and have an extremely difficult time paying attention in them. My overall GPA is high, but I am expecting it to drop this semester and I am frantically studying for my upcoming exams and I am constantly stressing out about school each day. It worries me that if I receive a lower GPA, I won't be able to attend good law schools. My economics classes have not been the cause of stress in school, it's mostly been accounting and business statistics classes which have hurt me recently. I have been putting in more effort into my classes, and I expected a high score on one of my political science exams and I received a lower grade than expected. This has caused me to extremely question what I want to do in life and what major I should pursue. 

&amp;#x200B;

It hasn't helped much that when I have asked for help during office hours from the teachers, they put little effort into helping me out. They have only given broad advice and told me to review the notes, read the textbook, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I am seeking is how should I improve my grades and perform well on exams? I typically put in 4-5 hours of studying per exam but I have noticed the multiple choice has been my struggle this semester. Is there any techniques you used in college to receive excellent grades?

&amp;#x200B;

I am also seeking advice about finding a career path. I applied for a law clerk internship this summer and made it very far in the application process only to receive a call that I didn't make the last cut. I understand that this is only a small obstacle and I can move past it and pursue different opportunities, but I am losing lots of confidence in myself because of my GPA dropping lower due to tests this semester and it's put me into a state of confusion. I will appreciate any advice. "

I got this role I assume by putting in my LinkedIn that I was looking for cybersecurity internships for the summer and a few weeks later a recruiter reaches out to me, I take a few assessments and submit my resume and here we are. The reason I'm including this info is cause I want to make it clear I wasn't lying about my qualifications.

The job requirements include CISSP as desirable and Bachelors degree in IT with 3-7 years experience in cybersecurity role. I have none of that and they reached out to me. I plan to be pretty upfront that I'm willing to learn on the job, but how should I handle an interview like this?"

Next year i need to do an internship in order to graduate, basically it takes a whole year.

I've been anxious about from the moment i knew i needed to do an internship in order to graduate, because i'm afraid i won't like it/ won't be good at it. Last year i almost decided to change my studies to let's call it Study B but decided to stick to Study A, because I am able to do study B in one year if I finnish study A. so last semester I started looking for an internship but i went about it all wrong (i didn't know it then). I finally landed an internship but didn't feel really happy about it (because i'm afraid i wont like it/ be bad at it). Now i know i went about looking for the internship the wrong way and i'm afraid i actually could have gotten an internship that's better suited for me. But it's too late now to change my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I stop thinking about what I should have done and stop being afraid i will be miserable next year, and just go on with my life? i know it's something stupid to worry about but it's on my mind 24/7 and i feel like i can't concentrate in class because of it and that i'm actually procratinating my schoolwork because of it... I also have trouble falling asleep because i'm thinking about it, which is stupid because it's pretty far in the future. Can anyone help?"

I just graduated in December with a master’s degree in clinical psychology. I have complex ptsd and a ton of issues related to it. My parents never really loved me and neglected my well being my entire life. I’ve basically cut them out and rarely talk to them and neither of them care. My boyfriend who isn’t really my boyfriend basically told me in frustration the other night when I was having an episode that I want to be unhappy, go over the same issues time and time again with no purpose, and that he doesn’t want to talk to me about any of his own issues because everything upsets me and I constantly am afraid he’s upset with me. I know I put too much value on our relationship because it’s the only mostly healthy relationship I’ve had in my entire life and I’m terrified he’ll leave. I’ve done a good job pushing him and everyone else away. 

I had to wait for my license to process but was hired right before graduation at a local community mental health center, and my bosses keep harassing me about it when I have no control over how long the state takes to finish it. In the meantime they made me work their lowest paying, most intense and emotionally and physically draining job instead (“because they didn’t want me to be without pay”) of waiting to have me start when my license was done. I am constantly taken advantage of, pushed to work over time until I force myself to have boundaries and say no, work 11 hour days at times with no lunch break or any kind of break with severely emotionally disturbed children. I have never worked with children before and found out their “plan” for me once my license was done and I could switch to the therapist position they hired me for was to have me work almost entirely with children as a therapist and put me in a school setting out of town which was not mentioned or agreed upon as part of my interview. 

I have no desire to do therapy with children and again have no experience with child therapy and would therefore not be effective as a child therapist. 

I recently was informed by the state my license was done after I interviewed and am waiting to hear back about another job that I felt I would be perfect for me because it’s working with an adult only population I spent my entire internship working with and it’s back in a familiar setting. The employees all appear happy to be there which is a stark contrast to my current job. I am on edge hoping to hear back from the job I want before my current boss harasses me again and I have to switch to child therapy. 

I feel like I blew the interview and I have no idea why I have any ounce of hope things will get better and I’ll get the job. Nothing good ever happens to me and this has been evidenced by every repeated traumatic incident in my life. I feel doomed and hopeless and miserable. 
Everyone around me hates being around me now and I’m scared of losing them forever because I’m so miserable and can’t get out of it. I go to my own therapy and I feel like I’ll just be stuck in this mentality forever. Daily I think about killing myself so I don’t have to live this shitty existence where everyone leaves and I never come out okay. I try to be strong for other people but i can’t. 

The past week I’ve started waking up every night with severe stomach pain I repeatedly think about going to the hospital for and my body aches constantly. I feel like there’s no hope for me and no getting better and even if something good miraculously happens I’ll just fuck it up anyway like my relationship. I feel so alone and burdensome and like I should have never been a therapist to begin with. I’m too screwed up and I wanted to fix myself. I just don’t know what to do and I feel like when I find out for sure I didn’t get the other job I’m just going to sink even lower into feeling not good enough and severely unhappy which will make everyone separate even further from me because I’m so negative. I want to quit my job regardless because of how toxic and manipulative and hostile it is. I need help and have no idea where to turn especially not work because they openly express disdain and favoritism with their employees and let you know how easy it is the replace you, even as a therapist since it’s a college town with plenty of graduates. 

I just want to die but I’m too much of a coward to do it. I wish I could just go away where I’m not under the constraints of society. I need to heal and get better and I can’t or I’ll lose everything I have."
ay6rwo,1,2019-03-06,Former-friend fucking scares me and I dont know what to do,im_scared_help_me,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ay6rwo/formerfriend_fucking_scares_me_and_i_dont_know/,"R  will be friend in question.

Throwaway, for obvious reasons + R knows my Reddit account.

Me and R became very good friends last year, typical shit-talking type relationship. We told each other weird secrets, personal stories, other stuff. We would even serve as sources if sorta venting type therapy for each other. I think nothing of it, being the retard I am, and she eventually confessed to having a major crush on me. I'm in no way attracted to her. I tell her this, respectfully. I give her the old ""You're more of a sister to me"" line that you hear incels complain about. But from my perspective, it's true. Her family is nothing but overall neglectfull. On Fridays we were available, we'd take her to watch movies with us, go shopping, go out to eat. We treated her like family.

But after I told her this, shit changed. She had already had obsession with true crime type stuff but it went from obsession to worship. All she'd ever talk about was Columbine, and how much of these ""innocent wil' beans"" were awesome and she wants to me them. She made a fanfic about the short one that was...graphic at best. She listen to the same bands they listened to, plays the same shit they did, even bought a natural selection T-Shirt. 

I called her out on this, and she admits ""SOME of her opinions have changed because of Columbine"". 

Shit hasn't even hit the fan yet. I go to a school program where to go to work at a local business to get work experience [basically an inschool internship] (which she also happened to be in). While we're eating lunch in the staff room, we (the whole class) start theorising about what would happen if there were no teachers. Everybody says what think would happen, you know, udder chaos, weed, coke, that type of shit. She chimes in with ""You know what I'd do"" while she slyly notions to the TV, which doing a broadcast on Parkland.

And now shes been attacking me personally in class. I was having a difficulty picking up the tape the teacher gave us because she tape it to the corner of the table and I was too lazy to get up. My other friend (who we'll call J) calls me a retard in the middle of laughing. Obviously a joke. While me and J are joking back and forth at each other,  R turns around, looks directly at me, says some shit along the line of  ""What are you a fucking retard you ignorant cunt"". 

This gets the attention of the teacher, who thank fuck stepped in and moved us (although I had to get it small trouble for that to even happen). I overheard her talking to the teacher while I was moving all my shirt and she practically yells a secret at the teacher. The whole class could hear, I'm sure of it. 

Now I'm not gonna say I'm an innocent little bystander. I've told some secrets before, but not yelled them in front of the class, just told them to our friend circle. I had gotten called out for it apologized. No big deal. She clearly is mentally ill but she's doing nothing to improve her mental state at all, I told her than if she doesn't improve her mental state of mind, were done as friends. She didn't want that to happen, so she told me that she was seeing a therapist. Not a fucking week later she starts bitching and moaning about how the state won't  get her a therapist. First of all, filthy commie. Second of all, what the fuck happened to the therapist she was seeing? I Itold her we were done as friends, and tried to move on. 

Then, she started spreading rumours about me that I hate her because she's mentally ill. started ghosting her, avoiding her as much as possible. I'm fucking scared of her. She's already had the cops called on her twice. They claimed to not have found anything. Both of these times, reminder, are AFTER she wrote the fanfic. She also has folders upon folders of shit she found on DeviantArt of the Columbine guys fucking. Not crimes in themselves, but given the context, it's a horrific. I don't know whats gonna happen and she's making me not wanna be around for it. I already told my mom, but she said ""R is just going through a rough time"".

I don't know what to do. I don't know if she's going to shoot up a school, or kill herself, or kill somebody in general or what. Something's gonna happen and I don't know what to do. Help me."

I don't have any prior experience other than a 2 week contract job as a web developer. I've been struggling to find a job and have been getting a lot of rejection emails. The one on-site interview that I got, I bombed.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of going back to school for my masters, but this time, really try to get an internship and really try to get a GPA of 3.5+. On my last year (2 semesters and 1 summer), when I was taking the most difficult classes in the program, I got a Dean's List award (3.65+ GPA). I was also teaching assistant. I feel like I didn't really apply myself until the last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a habit of getting in my own way. I don't have a lot of self-confidence. Like many here, I seem to have impostor/fraud syndrome. My goal when I got to college was to graduate. I now know that that was the wrong frame of mind. The goal isn't to just graduate. It's to get an amazing job. Graduating is just a small step in that.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I think I want to go back to school and kind of redo it.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan:

1. Apply for my masters and start in Aug 2019.
2. Get a job in tech. Maybe not a SWE, but somewhere where I can be in the SWE environment. Maybe as a technician. Basically anything that can help my pay my student loans.
3. Spend most of my free time on campus and work hard to get that 3.5+ GPA.
4. Get an internship, and quit the job.
5. Graduate and get a great job.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I doing the right thing or should I just keep trying to apply for SWE jobs? Am I just not being patient enough? I'm so lost.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Should I go back to school, or just keep applying to SWE jobs?

I've been through 4-5 resume reviewers and they pretty much think my resume looks great, but I've had no luck with any online application so far. Now I have to admit I only put my application on competitive positions, because I worked hard to have a good GPA and some related experience so I kind of want to leverage that early when it still matters somewhat (vs. once I graduate, no one will give a care how I did in college, only company names and experience). But to never get a call back is just sad. Career fair at my school only have companies in the industry I don't have much passion for (same situation with my current), so I don't have much chance for direct interaction with the desired companies. I am confident with interviews, technical or behavioral, even mock interviewers who are working/retired professional have confirmed so.

I am senior BSEE finishing this fall, applying for software/firmware. Was applying for internships but only got rejections and silence (sad). Do you think there's some red flags in my resume that might get me filtered out either by computer or recruiter? I put some quotes from my rec letters in there do they look too braggy? Are my experience too irrelevant? (I wanted internship to make it more relevant, even though it would be a huge step back on $$ aspects compare to my current job, either way the window for internships has gone)

Again I know I'm a bit unreasonable for aiming at the more prestigious spots while there are other options, but I started school late and hope for a nice step up from my past career. Thanks in advance!

I am a high school senior but I also will be earning my AA degree from our local community college. So in terms of credits I'm going to be a junior but in terms of CS progression I am a freshman.

I have a list of pros and cons for each school. My main worry about UCF is that the class sizes are going to hinder my education. UCF as many know has over 55,000 students. I don't know how well I can handle 100-250 kids in one class. Another worry is the foundation exam. Obviously the FE is good to weed out those who are not cut out, but what if I'm one of the ones that gets weeded out? FSU doesn't require a foundation exam. FSU requires students to have a minor and a college foreign language but UCF doesn't require either. Some of my best friends are going to be in Tallahassee as well so that would be a plus to go to FSU. I've also heard that the opportunities for internships are good at UCF because of all of the tech companies but with all the students, isn't it just more competition? Lastly, if I am dissecting my financial aid package correctly, UCF is offering a bit more money than FSU. In terms of actual college life, FSU is known as a party school but I am not really a type to go out and get drunk (yet) so I'm not really worried about that part.

&amp;#x200B;

ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS I am also becoming nervous about the major itself. CS is really math heavy according to the curriculum. I am not naturally good with math or numbers so I am not sure how well I am going to do. I know that if I study I can do it but it's really nerve racking. (I got an A in college alg, B in pre calc, and an A in trig, im on the road to getting a B in calc 1)

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; UCF better for cs, offering more money but FE and class sizes are a worry. FSU offering smaller class sizes, no FE, but I have to decide and minor and take additional foreign language classes.**

&amp;#x200B;

ALL honest advice is helpful!!"

ay9osx,1,2019-03-07,Confused CS junior -- should I get an M.S. now or later? (or at all?),throwaway_acct_37,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ay9osx/confused_cs_junior_should_i_get_an_ms_now_or/,"Hi, 

I know r/cscq has gotten tons of questions like these, but I promise to make this post a lot more nuanced. And I've read tons of info online and I'm still confused. 

Situation: I'm a third year CS and Math double major at a top 15 CS school. I've done well in my classes (~ 3.6 GPA) and professionally (2 SWE internships, and I'll be incoming at a Big N this summer). I'm really interested in jobs at the intersection of software engineering and applied ML/research, like the jobs in this [link](https://i0.wp.com/blog.udacity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ML-Graph.png). I have the option of finishing the B.S. in Fall 2019 and doing an integrated masters  in C.S. program at my university whose tuition will be paid for if I TA or do research -- no GRE's are required and letters of recommendation can even be waived (and I heard it's not too selective). I'd need an extra semester to finish the masters though (4.5 years total). And from what I've read, an M.S. can help land these sorts of roles. 

On the other hand, I feel like another good option is to take a potential return offer from Big N (sources say their return offer rate is upward of 80%+) and do a M.S. in C.S. later while I work. The team I interviewed for at Big N is under their AI&amp;Research division which will hopefully get my feet wet with some ML stuff right away. I can start earning immediately this way. However, an M.S. will definitely take longer if I don't do it at my current university.

Has anyone been in this situation before? If you're a software engineer who works with ML on the more applied side (or a more research oriented side), how
much did your masters help, and what sorts of options did you explore to get into these sorts of roles? Is it even worth getting a masters to break into these 
types of jobs? There's plenty of online resources to help learn ML on your own and I've heard that it's possible to break into these roles with just a B.S., but will be tougher. 


Thanks y'all!"

Most job positions ask for 2 to 3 years of work experience. Very few jobs don't ask for previous work experience (usually entry level jobs and internships). 

I supposed it would depend on what you study. A useless degree isn't going to help, but what if its a useful degree like web development or computer science? 

Ideally I know the best thing to do is first get work experience in your native country and then immigrate. But the thought of spending another 3 years working and only then moving abroad is unbearable. I just want to move out as soon as I can.

Is it a good idea to try to immigrate without work experience if you're already in your mid 20's? "

I finished my bachelor's degree in Economics last year and I am currently working at a Big 4 in advisory. I like my job and earn a good amount of money - however, I don't feel 100% happy with what I'm doing and I don't want to have this job for the rest of my life.

I'm a very logical person (good at Maths, decent at statistics) and I would like to have some sort of job / preparation that would allow me to have a positive social impact.

Therefore, I'm thinking about entering the Data Science field. I have basic programming skills and I really like it. I'm interested in the fields of Data Mining, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

In my city they are going to open up 2 courses next september: one of them is a master's degree related to Data Science; the other one is a post graduation on software development. The post graduation is more intensive and focus more on JavaScript and general programming skills from a software developer perspective - at the end of this course (9 months), students start an internship at a partner company.

I'm not really sure which option to make at this moment. Should I take a Master's degree in Data Science? What if I'm not good enough or the degree doesn't meet my expectations? What if I end up not enjoying Data Analytics in practice as much as I like the theory? Would the post graduation course give me enough fundamentals to know general programming and then I could enter the Data Analytics field on my own?

I'm a bit confused at the moment. I'm doing the CS50 course on weekends and trying to figure out what I like ASAP before September comes.

Thank you guys! "
aybums,2,2019-03-07,Really been hating school,acct_4_questions,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/aybums/really_been_hating_school/,"Basics about me before I go into story mode:

19M

Finished an early college program at my community college with a 3.95 GPA and an associates degree in network security 1 year out of high school. High school GPA was pretty average (like 3.2 I think?)  but I didn't try super hard since I was in the aforementioned early college program. The college credits didn't count towards my HS GPA.

1.6 GPA (1 A 1 B 2 Fs) at my university last semester (after dropping one class). Started out good then it all went down the shitter. Kind of same thing happening this semester.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I just chose the wrong school or what but I have **really** been dreading school. And that has been contributing to a big downward spiral for me mentally. Anxiety through the roof. Pretty damned depressed. Zero self esteem or confidence. I thought the cause last semester was me living in on-campus housing so I moved back home and am commuting this semester. It doesn't seem to have helped at all.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things that I guess have contributed to how I'm feeling (in no particular order):

The school took away a scholarship because I didn't read some fine print saying I needed to apply by the early application deadline. I had already been accepted to transfer and committed and everything... but basically all they had to say was 'too bad lol'.

A bunch of stuff from my community college didn't transfer. Well the credits all transferred, but didn't fulfill any of my majors requirements so I still have at least 3 years left with the way my major is designed. And at least half of my major's required classes have descriptions that match the CC classes I already took.

The major I am doing isn't really fulfilling the job listings of jobs I was thinking I want to do. Along those same lines I don't even know if this is the career I want to do for the rest of my life.

I have 0 interest in any of the classes I am taking this semester. When I left housing it messed with my registration and blocked me from registering until classes had already begun so I got the shitty scraps that were left over.

None of the material is even hard. Some of the easiest classes are the ones I am doing the worst in.

I met with a school counselor and he kind of helped me mentally, but at the same time wound up making me question why I am even at this school even more. He basically made me realize the reason I am at school is ""because I am supposed to"" and ""to get a piece of paper"".

My friends who go to this school (a big reason why I went here) seem to want to hang out with a pedo they met online instead of me (see my other posts for details if you want to)

Socially I am at rock bottom. No new friends and I have social anxiety that has worsened a ton since I started at this school. I kind of feel like I should fit in at this school, but at the same time totally don't feel like I do.

My brother (different than the other one I mention below) had similar problems and became suicidal and has been really depressed the past 3 years. I think he is finally coming around... but his job now is semi legally delivering weed.

Pretty much the only thing keeping me from dropping out or at least taking a break is the embarrassment I will face from  friends and (non immediate) family. I suppose if I have a job it won't be that bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Things that make me think it might be worth taking a break and/or dropping out.

I made $16/hr as a part time intern last summer and the company was really interested in hiring me back.

I made $20 flat rate over winter break working as a mechanic for my brother (engine swaps and whatnot) and then $20/hr as a snow plow driver for him. Big negative is how physically demanding it is, and not super reliable.

These are definitely livable amounts of money. Especially if I stay with my parents for another year or two.

My main hobby (besides video games) is my race car I built by myself. I stripped the car down to just a shell and rebuilt the whole thing. It's an extremely expensive hobby, though :/ Entry costs are like $400 per weekend + wear and tear on the car is a pretty similar number. I should be able to instruct soon which will cut out my entry fees. I could focus on this again, and have some money to actually have fun. Something I haven't really done at all in the past 5 months.

I could be making a few thousand a year on the side from reprogramming ECUs and selling a few other high margin easy to sell items that show up to my local junk yard pretty often.

My parents were supportive of me taking a break after seeing how bad I was doing (mentally) after last semester

&amp;#x200B;

Options are:

Continue to be miserable for \~3 more years. Assuming I don't continue doing so bad I get kicked out (on probation rn).

Take a break and see how I am feeling by next semester. Work in the meantime.

I could maybe drop all except for the math I am retaking? It's an evening class so I could still work almost a full day and improve my GPA to get off probation. I was kind of thinking about doing this before I started this semester, but I was too nervous when I met with my advisor and just signed up for a full schedule so she wouldn't judge me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for such a long post and thanks to anyone who reads it. Which option should I do? Any other advice?"

I have attended two job fairs which have led nowhere, sent my resume to approximately 20 positions within 15 companies, several of which included cover letters. I've been to several networking events, have gotten contact info from hiring managers and executives, suggesting I search for jobs within their companies or contact them directly only to have them never respond to my emails. I have gotten one interview so far from an online application, but scheduling was clearly impossible for what the candidate they were searching for.

I was in a research program since first year of college, but quit the position this February; most of my serious job search has been since this. I'm part of multiple projects on ASME, am on honors and dean's list with &gt;3.7 GPA. I understand much of the recruitment occurs during fall and my resume has only recently had serious revision. I also understand positions for sophomores are limited, but I know several who have positions lined up. Still, I'm very stressed that I will have trouble getting into internships in future semesters and possibly post-college employment.

If I can't find employment this summer, I plan to seek a part time job for funding and work on student projects, and join a professional engineering fraternity in my junior year. Is there anything else I should be doing to not be un-hirable to engineering companies?"

Now, If we talk about data science field. In India, More supply than demand and for beginner there are not great opportunities available. Same goes to ML/DL. Applying for good role in these areas(DS/ML) require either good experience or at-least MS. I don't have both of them (completing btech in june which means I have 2 months).

Now, Going for SDE roles in big4 (amazon/google) requires to clearing DSA rounds. I can code data-structure and algorithm from scratch but for cleaning those rounds, I definitely have to study 1.5-2 months from site like geeksforgeeks or leetcode. I don't know if is it even possible to apply directly to them (Big 4 or equivalent in india) ?

I am interested in more production type of role which include both scaling of system and machine learning/deep learning. Recently I have been reading book ""Designing Data intensive application"" and got interested in building these type of systems.

I have few questions to ask.

\- based on my resume, which are roles where i can apply and How much of package to expect from company ?

\- Is going for Big4 and preparing solely for those type of interview is best bet because my interest area deep learning/ computer-vision interview require different set of questions (for example: explaining math behind backprop, SOTA methods).

\- I am not planning for MS/Mtech. I watched some job opportunities based on that I can say that there is are lot of under-paid market for ML/DL in startup as beginner.

I think it is has been one of the worst years of my life (not an exaggeration). My grades dropped drastically compared to my first year grades. This is mainly due to bad time management, which I am slowly getting better at now. 

My situation is this: In first semester I dropped a comp sci class with plans on taking it in the summer because I would not be able to pass it. I also took a very difficult c/unix class in first semester which i did really poorly in (59%) and this tanked my major average down to a 75%. I was also thinking about retaking this class in the summer but that would mean I need to drop 2 of the 3 comp sci classes I am currently enrolled in (because the c/unix class is a prerequisite) , and only one of the two is offered in the summer. 

If I did drop the class I would need to take 3 comp sci classes in the spring/summer, this concerns me because I am not sure if it is worth it. I am not sure if I should spend my summer taking 3 classes trying to improve my grades or taking one class and working on projects and improving my resume in my free time to try and land an internship next summer.

I am having to overload a little since I changed majors and switched schools and my credits didn't all transfer and I can't really afford to keep paying for school for much longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very interest in software development and I will be taking elective for data mining, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. I also have a bit of experience with VR.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not had an Internship and I don't think I'll be able to fit it in during the rest of my time in school. I have been told that Government jobs are less picky with your past experience than the Private sector and a bit easier to get a job in.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had any experience with this type of situation or have any advice about what jobs in the private vs public sector are like? 

  
Also if you have any advice or wisdoms to share I'd greatly appreciate it!

aygplz,93,2019-03-07,"19 yrs old, not sure what to do next.",jb_hand_made,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aygplz/19_yrs_old_not_sure_what_to_do_next/,"**Before You Downvote:**

I would just like to say that, I am not trying to humblebrag, sound rude or offend anyone in any capacity. None of my parents/family members are in the cs industry so it's hard to find an outlet, so I thought I would come here.

**About Me:**

So I'm a 19 yr old software developer and cs freshman at a top canadian cs school. And I'm not sure what I want to do next, I'm not even sure if school is right for me sometimes. I taught myself how to code when I was around 10/11 years old, and basically fell in love with it ever since, it was challenging at first since I didn't really have a mentor or anyone to go to. Over the years, I had learned a bunch of tech stacks, played around with robotics, competed in competitive programming competitions, etc.

Skip forward a few years and I'm a junior in high school, and I land my first tech internship at a large canadian tech company, Shopify. The internship went well, I worked on a distributed systems team and developed an internal HTTP bandwidth compression protocol that reduced round trip times, this caused Shopify to give me a return offer and I came back for a 2nd internship my senior year of highschool, at the end of that placement, I got a full time offer(Total Compensation was around $135,000 CAD), straight out of HS, that I turned down to go to university.

Now I'm a university freshman. Over the past few months I received software engineering internship offers at top US tech companies (Google, Microsoft &amp; Facebook). And I'll actually be interning at Microsoft this summer.

**What I'm struggling with now:**

Which brings me to where I am now (almost done my first year at university). And I've been conflicted on what to do with my career next. Almost everyday I sit in a boring CS lecture, where I pay tuition to learn about things I already know, I don't feel like I'm learning. On the other hand I'm working on an iOS app/startup in my free time, that I think has a lot of potential, and my overall goal for it is to have Microsoft acquire it (part of the reason why I'm interning there).

Essentially I feel like I'm wasting my potential at school, and I learn more by interning at companies and working on my app/startup. And I'm conflicted, do I go through with school for another 3 years? or do I work on my app/startup look for success in it and leave school?



Edit: Just finished reading through everyone’s comments, and honestly I’m not an emotional guy. But I have tears in my eyes from all the responses and support. I just wanted to say Thank you. I’m going to focus on finishing up my first year (exams, assignments, and what not) then, next focus on gaining as much experience/expertise from my internship this summer, while working on my app. I’ll be back on here in a few months to let you guys know what I decide to do. Once again thank you all so much (might dm a few of you to follow up)."

I am a junior at an elite (Top 30) American university studying communication. My grades are okay, I have a 3.0 GPA. Below are some things that I would personally consider strengths of mine.

\-Given enough time to communicate with someone inter-personally (male or female, beautiful or unattractive) I am generally able to make anyone like me.

\-Those same people would generally describe me as being a very funny (witty) individual.

\-I would consider myself to be an above-average writer.

\- I am very loyal.

\-I have an exceptional memory.

\- I know a TON about sports and along the same lines I am surprisingly a very good sports gambler.

Weaknesses:

\-My work ethic could definitely be improved.

\-I often lack confidence in my abilities. 

\-I struggle with public speaking sometimes.

\-I smoke weed more than I should.

Any careers you think would match my skill set would be greatly appreciated. Any other general advice is also welcomed. "

ayhut3,1,2019-03-07,"Want to change career paths, am I just being ungrateful?",idlesonder,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ayhut3/want_to_change_career_paths_am_i_just_being/,"So I'm \[F21\] graduating university soon, and I'll be finishing 4 years of a science degree that I told my parents before I even finished high school I wasn't interested in anymore. I told them I had a passion for the arts, but was met with strong discouragement and belittling of my passions. Especially from my mother. I understand her concern, because as a parent she's trying to look far into the future and she seems to think that going into animation will leave me penniless or jobless. So I went into the science degree to just give it a try and satisfy them. But I found that in the first 2 years, my grades really suffered because I was so miserable since this was something I DIDN'T have my heart set on anymore, and I would still turn to art to cheer me up. 

Now that 4 years have passed, I'm faced with my mother pressuring me to apply for jobs or internships so I can get a solid future in the science field. But the thought of it makes me even more miserable, and I'm so burnt out after 4 years of really trying to love science and failing. I wanted to take a year off to just think about what it is I REALLY want to do for the rest of my life. But I know if I told her that she'd just yell at me and say she knows best, and that I'm just being lazy or that I'm being spoiled because I wasted 4 years and only NOW am I saying something about not liking this field (which. isn't true, I did say something before I even went to university, and brought it up a few times throughout the years, but she will just claim I never said anything). I know some of the blame lies with me because I wasn't strong enough to stand up for myself and assert my feelings. I tried so hard to find passion in science and really make it work, to just think of what I could do as jobs in the future. But every job or career path I could think of, I just can't see myself enjoying it, because I have had lab work experience and it just isn't for me. In fact, I think trying to get myself to get passionate about science ended up having the opposite effect. I don't want to be one of those people that went into a work field just because they wanted their family to like them, not anymore. I don't want to hate my life when I'm 30 and regret never even trying anything else.

I've been getting so depressed about it, and feeling like such a failure, because I feel like completely switching from science to art will make my whole family jump on me and call me spoiled, selfish, and a failure. I'm just so miserable here, but I can't tell if I'm just being ungrateful and I should just shut up and stick to science just so my mother will be satisfied. I understand the concerns of pursuing a career in art, but it's all I've ever loved and had passion for, and even after all these years it's never changed. I just worry since I want to take a year off to really focus on my art and self-study, but... there's such a horrible stigma against gap years. I just feel so conflicted because I'm tired of being miserable and isolating myself from everyone and everything, maybe I'm just being too selfish to think I can just change career paths like this, but I'm... I just haven't been happy for so long from lying to myself and lying to my family about how much I hated these past 4 years. But I feel like I'm blind and walking around in the dark. I really wanted to move away for a bit and focus on myself and my art. Should I just take a year off to think about things? 

I'm sorry if I sound spoiled or like I'm an entitled brat, I'm just feeling really lost. "

ayi1mh,3,2019-03-07,First job advice,Loulett,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ayi1mh/first_job_advice/,"Hello everybody,

First of all, sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language.

I'm currently on my senior year of BS, majoring in CS. I was doing pretty well during my studies and got several internships in huge IT companies.

Afterwards I was trying to get as many offers as possible, interviewing mostly everywhere. I've ended up with 4 offers, which helped me to negotiate salary for a little bit, declined offers which I obviously wasn't interested in... And that left me with 2 offers, and I find it very difficult to choose between them.

Let me describe both.

First is one of the biggest and most famous IT company. They have all possible perks (food/gym/transporation/medical insurance/etc.), salary + stocks are great as well.

The other one is finance startup (yeah, there is a huge difference and choice is very hard!) They are amazingly good in finding investitions (last one was \~$500m), they offer even bigger salary and bonus than the previous one (pretty small amount of stocks, though).  
In the same time, during the onsite interview I've got the impression that while they are amazing in marketing area, engineering part is not so great. E.g. they are supposed to have big ML part and they just started to hire ML people (after several years of existing). Therefore, I assume that biggest part of my job will be create infrastructure and I am not sure that this is what I want to do. One more thing is that this will reqire much more responsibility from me, and I don't feel that give a lot of responsibility to a new grad is a great idea.

So, there is a question: what should I choose? I feel myself completely messed up.

TLDR: Cannot choose between huge IT company (with settled infrastracture and perks) and finance startup (with big salary but lots of responsibility) as a first job."

ayi2o0,5,2019-03-07,who should you ask for a recommendation letter from?,supa_fresh,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ayi2o0/who_should_you_ask_for_a_recommendation_letter/,"i'm applying to summer internships and jobs, and a few positions ask for letters of rec. i have one that i can definitely get from a past employer who knows me well, but i have a dilemma on who to ask for my second one, so i was hoping others might have an opinion.

my major is astrophysics, and letters of recommendation in this field usually have more weight coming from academic/research professors. i'm currently doing undergrad research with a professor i had last semester, but it's been taking a while to really get the ball rolling since i have to learn how to do everything from scratch. i haven't even really done any of my own research yet. so i'd be a little worried that the letter would be a more generic one rather than specific to me and/or the research i've done (or not done).

another option for a letter of rec is from an old math professor that i've had four times. we know each other pretty well and he's seen me go from failing/withdrawing from classes to improving a lot and actually doing pretty well in my higher classes, so he could probably write me a great letter. something to note is that he's actually a PhD grad student (not a full professor), so i dont know if that would also not hold as much weight.

TL;DR - my options are 1) a research professor that is directly related to my field of interest, but doesn't know me super well and i haven't accomplished much in research yet, or 2) an old mathematics professor that knows me very well and can attest to my abilities as a student and would write a pretty good letter, but not related to my field at all."
ayi76u,4,2019-03-07,"I'm finding hard joining any AAA company, need advice",Lullaby_Man,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ayi76u/im_finding_hard_joining_any_aaa_company_need/,"Hi there guys, I'm adding myself to the list of people in seek of advice

I've started game dev back in 2015 out of nowhere, without any previous experience or education, when a game I was working on with some friends got funded. We established our own company and begun full production.

Development period was really bad, a lot of stress and crunch time and bad blood developed between us.

On top of this, the game didn't sell very well, therefore, briefly after the release, we decided to stop working together and split up.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided then to go solo and develop my own games, to test my skills and build a wider portfolio.

I can't complain about the results, my own games sold a good amount of copies and have overall positive reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

While working on my games during the last year I also tried to join some AAA companies, mainly because I want to learn more and because it would be good for my resume, but I'm finding it very hard.

I have the opinion that it's mainly because I don't have an education in game dev (which would be Game Design in my case)

I seem to be more valuable to indie studios because I'm that type of person which can do a bit of everything but at the same time is not an expert in any specific field, which is the complete opposite of what a AAA company looks for as far as I understand.

I'm really concerned that if I keep having only small indie experiences this could be bad for my long-term career, am I wrong of thinking this? I'm also in my late twenties so I feel the urge to do something now to fix this.

So, the question would be, after 4 years of experience as an indie game dev with several released projects, should I strongly consider going to university? Like, I see lots of internship opportunities for graduate students around the world. It would be also good for re-establishing my current non-existent social life or maybe find some reliable partners for future projects.  
it's the only solution I can think of at the moment :/  


Cheers!"

ayls82,1,2019-03-07,Profile Review 24 Software Developer,[deleted],MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/ayls82/profile_review_24_software_developer/,"**Background**

  
Thank you in advance for taking the time to read/provide feedback. I've provided a bit more detail than may be absolutely required, but I also wanted to capture the narrative in my post undergrad career.  


Any feedback is welcome. Thanks again!

&amp;#x200B;

**Work experience:**

During undergrad:

* 6 month internship at small Company A as a software developer.
* 3 month Internship at HFT firm as a software developer. 

After undergrad:

* 1 year at a startup in data storage as a software developer. I worked on a performance team (2 other devs outside me) developing a caching algorithm/framework that the company intended to patent. Despite working on what may sound impressive, I actually found the work extremely dissatisfying. The startup is competing in a well established market and the incumbents' performance remains far superior compared to ours. This (mature) startup is understandably short-term oriented and that drove our work. However, the company didn't have anything that significantly differentiated our product from the existing solutions and customers view performance as essential. Regardless of whether the short-term product vision is justified, I mainly decided to leave because it wasn't satisfying to build a product that already exists with no charter to seriously innovate. In my opinion, it felt like we left a lot on the table with regards to caching. Working in the caching problem space sparked my interest in optimization problems and evolutionary algorithms. More on that later.
* From the startup I returned to Company A as a software developer about 8 months ago. I rejoined Company A because I knew I would have opportunities to manage my own projects, lead, and create something new. My primary work since joining has been building tools for our customer support team. Before beginning this work, I met with the manager of customer support to discuss what he hopes to achieve and when. I also met and continue to meet with the employees in customer support to understand the problems from their perspective. My solution has been to migrate customer support off this legacy application and on to a new website. In the process, I've taken the initiative to modernize our tech stack. Because of this architectural decision, the not yet fully functional but non-trivial website doesn't subject the users to the delays that are common in the companies other web applications, which is important given the size of the company. Lastly, the new architecture has resulted in IT's applications being more testable. This has the potential to improve IT's efficiency while reducing the number of bugs our users experience.   


**Extra curriculars:**

As I mentioned earlier, working on the caching algorithm sparked an interest in optimization problems and evolutionary algorithms. Since then I've read extensively about the current research into these types of algorithms and also evolution itself. I have sketched out my own algorithms in this space and plan on beginning developing prototypes to solve simulated caching problems. 

Also, I read.

&amp;#x200B;

**Undergrad school/major:**

One of the best public schools for computer science. Major: computer science and engineering.

**Race/nationality/sex:**

White/Us-Canadian Dual citizen/ male

**Stats**

* ~~GMAT~~ GRE Score: 165 Verbal 160 Quant 4.5 Writing. I took the GRE because I originally thought I wanted to do a Master's in CS, but after further consideration I think an MBA is a better fit. I'll explain later.
* Undergrad GPA: I got off to a rocky start which drags my overall GPA down to a 3.4. However, in my last two years I recovered nicely. In my last two semesters I made the Dean's List while working on my capstone project and taking courses like Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:

Realistically, I find product strategy fascinating and would like to be in a position where I help decide what problems my organization solves and why.    


Optimistically, I would like to found my own company someday. I think it would be great if I could apply my interest in evolutionary algorithms, or simply my interest in technology and science, to help solve a real world problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

An MBA gives me an opportunity to develop the requisite skills, and it connects me to likewise ambitious people who have seen different problems than I have.

**Target schools:**

Given that software development is pretty lucrative, I wouldn't want to leave unless it was for an opportunity to attend a top15 school. "

Any advice would be amazing guys. 


Here are the facts:
1. I graduated in August from a well known University in Europe, with a masters in management information systems. My GPA is 3.7.


2. My undergraduate degree is a bachelor of arts, German and Italian language, and my GPA is 3.0


3. I have 6 months experience with a huge corp as an Applications Analyst. This was a contract and not an internship. 


4. I have an internship visa to come to America for 12 months.


5. My technical skills are T-SQL, Linux, and have used these in my previous role on small and highly specific dev projects.


6. I worked in a call center two years ago and supported gsuite products and I know them inside out. 



TL;DR: I'm a young and naive and very unspecial idiot who dreams of working for google, preferably cloud computing or business strategy but I have no idea of what to learn or get good at to make them want me, any advice?

I’m a computer science student going into my senior year soon near Portland, OR and I am honestly lost. I’ve almost run out of savings and for personal reasons can’t take out more loans. My work background is actually as a sushi chef, but I have been putting myself through school to become a software developer. This brings me to my question:

What should I be doing?

Right now I mostly work on school projects, but haven’t had any I would want to put my name on because they just aren’t that interesting or outstanding. I started doing the daily programmer challenge to get my git activity up and thought about making a portfolio webpage, but I honestly have nothing to show. I’m lost because I’ve been applying to jobs by the dozens in the Portland and Salem metro area and haven’t heard anything back. This has been pretty disheartening, and I feel like skills I developed at my internship have now been forgotten (.NET web application).

I’m just kind of lost and need some direction as to what I should be working on and how to advertise myself better to find a job. I think the thought that scares me the most is that I get a job and just can’t cut it. I feel the classes I’ve taken haven’t really given me much experience compared to my internship, but every ad I’ve seen says you need a degree. In an ideal world I get to finish my degree, but I highly doubt that will happen. Any insight is appreciated, thanks in advance!

ayrhzs,78,2019-03-08,Not every job search is long and grueling,itriedsorry,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ayrhzs/not_every_job_search_is_long_and_grueling/,"Hi. I'm the guy that tells people to not use Times New Roman on their résumés.

2 weeks ago I had an all-day interview on Tuesday, got a verbal offer on Friday, and signed a written offer on the following Tuesday. It's a test engineering position at a large-but-not-mega semiconductor company, which from literally everyone I've talked to inside and outside is an incredible place to work.

Anyways, I wanted to share that maybe I'm an incredible outlier with the way my job search has gone, but I really doubt it—there's probably a good number of people who finish finding a job in 2 or 3 months, but the people who've spent 24 trying to find an entry-level position are probably drowning them out, at least on here.

**My experience**

I interviewed with TI this past fall because they got my contact information somehow. No prior internships or work experience. Was looking for design, analog or digital. Got through to the third (on-site) round of digital design, absolutely blew the technical interview, and less than 24 hrs later was told no. It was a good trial run.

Went to the spring career fair. Went to 3 booths day 1, and probably close to 10 day 2. Applied to 3 places. Went through 5 total interviews (at career fair/on-site, phone/on-site, phone), was about to the on-site with the third when I got the offer from the second.

**What I think made it happen like this**

Well, having a 3.5 GPA certainly helped, but I don't think that's everything.

* Spent some of the break making a quick bootstrap website to show some pictures of some projects I have on my résumé. Hosted it for free with the Github student pack credits for Digital Ocean. Paid like $3 for a domain for a year.
* Started really searching my final semester. Part of the issue I had with the TI interviews was that some content was stuff that was truly taught in classes I either *was* taking or *hadn't yet* taken. I was a lot more comfortable this semester as I had at least a base level familiarity with everything I was asked about.
* Switched focus from design to testing. I had the notion that design is what the *real* engineers did, but I didn't consider how it must be incredibly boring to draw schematics/layouts and write Verilog for a living. Sure testing may be *easier* schooling-wise, but at least I get to do different things—not to mention that knowing a little bit about everything fits me better.
* Actually put more than 5 seconds into making a résumé that didn't look *boring.* It shouldn't look like an office memo. (Conversely it shouldn't look like a flyer, but it's easier to tone down style than to add it)
* Going to the career fair. I bet if I just did what some people here do and filled out 50 applications a day, tailoring cover letters and résumés to every position and company, that I would have gotten *nothing*. You absolutely *do* get fast-tracked through screens if you know a recruiter.
* Having had at least a little bit of interviewing experience before seriously looking. Once you know how the technical question game works, it's much easier to prepare/respond in the moment. I actually did a particular problem earlier in the day at one of my interviews, so instead of doing it again I showed him a really tricky one I had gotten from TI. Walking through your reasoning and explaining your rationale is really all they want to see—how do you handle being put into situations that you don't know everything?

This has rambled a bit, but really I'm just saying that what I did doesn't seem incredibly above and beyond, and don't be daunted by people saying how hard it is to find a job because it may actually be easier. Hope this is helpful somehow to someone :D"
ayriht,17,2019-03-08,Is systems/low level programming a good career field?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ayriht/is_systemslow_level_programming_a_good_career/,"By this I mean everything made with C and lower (assembly etc) for products like compilers, shells, device drivers, etc. Not things like databases or high level languages. I might be using the wrong terminology here since I am not an expert.

I've had some internships in data science, high performance computing, and other visualization tasks with some programming for both universities and large companies, I've also done lots of higher level programming for school classes (Android, Java, etc). I've used a lot of languages for varying projects. I've also done full stack web dev which I found paralyzing because there were 100 ways to do any task and I needed to learn 50 frameworks. 

I can do these things but they aren't too interesting. I am wondering if systems programming would be more interesting since I'm taking a systems programming class and it's going well.

I have always wondered how operating systems, etc work. I did some IT work (nothing profound, just for my high school, and learning how to build computers). 

However that wasn't quite it I think. So I am thinking systems / etc programming might be more interesting. So I am considering pursuing this in my CS classes and in internships.

However I am worried about the career field for this kind of work. All I hear about is Reakt/node/swift/python/machine learning/web development/etc. Do only large companies that make OSes/device drivers/etc need to hire systems/low level programmers? Would I be hurting my career compared to higher level work?"

I majored in bioengineering/bioinformatics a few years ago. Then got my masters from Georgia tech. I had around 3 internships in software on my resume (robotics, front end/full stack, databases) but my actual job search was nil/zip in the end. I had around 400 applications, maybe 6 final round interviews and kept getting negative responses.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually burned out of algorithms/data structure practice, took up a sales job (sales development rep) in a software company. Things are cool but base pay is low. (50-60k) and commissions are okay but man, you really have to work your ass for those commissions. I.e if you want to go from 10K commissions/year to 20 K you have to put in 70 hours a week.  Its also brainless work. You're not even dealing with product value as much as trying to set a meeting for someone else, essentially you're a secretary. You can advance past this role but there's a ton of politics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Status:**

I'm from the bay area originally, moved to Portland. Would like to move to either Seattle, or anywhere in California again. Honestly pretty open to accepting anything more than 80 K in California, maybe a little higher (90K) if its in the heart of SF.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoyed programming but just never saw an opportunity to make a break in even with tons of referrals. I took it just as bad luck. I see new grads being able to negotiate salaries from 100 k to 150 K. (And I'm 100% aware that computer science is tons of intelligence and hard work), but I think investing my time back into comp sci vs sales will let me stop fighting for penny raises/butt kissing for 500 bucks extra on my next month pay check. I hope I'm making sense here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Plan of action:**

What I would like to do is self-bootcamp myself for the next 2-3 months as a front end developer. And try triplebyte etc, other avenues. For work experience, probably just going to do several projects on upwork. Is this a bad idea?"

This one is especially cool: [https://www.cia.gov/careers/student-opportunities/undergraduate-scholarship-program.html](https://www.cia.gov/careers/student-opportunities/undergraduate-scholarship-program.html)

Any senior who is 18 or any college student pursing a degree can get 18k of their tuition paid for by the CIA.  The only requirements are that you have to have a 3.0 and 1000/21 SAT/ACT score and your family (if family of four) income can only be up 70k.

Other benefits of the undergraduate scholarship program are:

* Daily allowance for meals and incidentals during summer tours
* Reimbursement for transportation costs between school and Washington, DC
* Annual salary
* Health insurance
* Life insurance
* Federal retirement plans
* Paid time off, as well as sick and holiday leave

It also doesn't matter what your major is:

 While working at the CIA, you will be exposed to real intelligence challenges while performing meaningful work that relates to your college major. An IT major, for example, might be given increasingly complex projects involving sophisticated computer systems. An engineering major might help produce a piece of state-of-the-art equipment. A finance major could be involved in developing and analyzing budgets for a worldwide operation, while a foreign language major might be instrumental in translating documents for US policymakers. An international relations major might brief a senior policymaker and, as a final example, a human resources major could have the opportunity to develop and implement personnel policies and procedures. 

I think you do have to be in D.C??? or willing to relocate for it though which is a con/

&amp;#x200B;

They have other undergrad internships as well you can look into [https://www.cia.gov/careers/student-opportunities/undergraduate-students.html](https://www.cia.gov/careers/student-opportunities/undergraduate-students.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

idk if any of y'all really \*want\* to work for the CIA but I'm sharing this because I think it might be a good opportunity for some people. "

ayved7,1,2019-03-08,Recieved a job offer but will have to break current contract. Any advice?,SweetLittleKermi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ayved7/recieved_a_job_offer_but_will_have_to_break/," I received a job offer at a company I used to intern with. I really enjoyed working there and had hopes to work there full time after I graduated. However, there were no open positions at the time I graduated so I took a different job on a one year contract.  Now, 10 months later I have been offered a position at the company I interned at. The position is only a 6 month contract but the company stated it would be easier for me to get a full time job there if a role came up in the future as I would already be working internally. The issue is that I still have 3 months left in my contract at my current job, I don't want to end the contract early and have a bad reputation. This new job would be my dream job but there is no guarantee I will receive a full time job after the 6 month contract is up.  

I am very conflicted on what to do. Should I take the offer? Any advice would be appreciated. "

ayw5q9,15,2019-03-08,I quit my internship at the hospital. Here's why (Part 2),Ann9900,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ayw5q9/i_quit_my_internship_at_the_hospital_heres_why/,"Well, I’d just gotten out of Calculus. I woke up at 5:30 a.m. for softball, pitched and practiced until 8, grabbed breakfast, went back to bed until 10:30 a.m., went to Calc., finished at 12:05 p.m., and then it was 1:20 p.m. I was just sitting doing work on my laptop until I had to leave for my Student Government meeting. Pretty normal Friday so far. Up until I got a text from one of my friends (We’ll call him W) who also interns at the hospital I was at. 

“Hey, I was just in the ICU with a patient who came in with a left-side pnuemo \[pnuemothorax- collapsed lung\]. We did the pigtail tube after we gave him some ketamine to calm him down, and all was fine and well, lung reinflated, we switched to morphine after, and he was doing alright. He just f\*\*\*ing flatlined out of nowhere. His heart monitor went ballistic, then he was just gone. We couldn’t get him back,” it read. I tensed. I had a gut feeling it was connected to my case.

When your lung collapses, it hurts like hell. I had it happen to me twice. It was spontaneous, but they think my diving habits in the outfield might have contributed to it. Mine was on the left side as well, and when they put the tube in, it affects the pressure inside the chest cavity, with allows the lung to re-inflate. But because it’s on the left side, they could hit the heart, which could have major consequences. I don’t remember exactly what, but I believe they could stick the heart accidentally because it is an invasive procedure. But because the patient seemed to somewhat stabilize and his lung reinflated, I think the chances of them hitting his heart and *then* having that happen after stabilization is relatively slim, if at all.

“Did Q look at him yet,” I replied.

“Not yet. There are puncture wounds in both arms, but the patient got stuck twice with the needle. She couldn’t find a decent vein in the first arm,”

S\*\*\*. So no way to definitely tell if it’s the same thing as last time. Another text came in.

“I’ll let you know when they do the autopsy. Older guy, they think he had a bleb on his lung. His daughter brought him, and when they asked her about his health history, she told them there wasn’t anything unusual. He exercised well, ate often, all that. Q said there’s only one of three options- unknown illness, hospital’s mistake in procedure, or… well, foul play,” the text read. 

“Thanks,” I answered, grimacing to myself. I went to my meeting and got out a an hour and a half early, at about 3:25 p.m. I took my phone off of airplane mode and found multiple missed calls from W. I walked out of the building as quickly as I could and into my dorm room. I locked the door so my roommate wouldn’t walk in on the conversation. 

I grabbed my phone, my anxiety pitting in my stomach and working its way up to my chest. Sitting at my desk, I cupped my head in my hands and just stared at the blank wallpaper of my lockscreen. Did I really want to know? I could be out of this right now. I gave all the information I had to the detectives and hospital officials. Though I liked the people I worked alongside with, and we’d all become close over the few months I was there, did I want to drag myself back into this mess? Was I putting myself in danger?

F\*\*\* it.

I picked up my phone, and before I could change my mind, I went into my contacts and dialed W’s number. He picked up on the first ring.

“\[W\], what’s going on there,” I quivered, trying to hide the heat from the anxiety in my throat. 

“Same thing,” he said gravely. 

I banged my hand down on the desk. I was angry. I know my job description doesn’t entail preventing deaths, but dammit, this is screwed up. Imagine going to the one place that’s supposed to be a safe haven just to have your life taken from you simply because you were under a certain doctor’s or nurse’s care . Or your friend’s life. Or your sibling’s life. Or your father’s life. My lividness at how helpless I was in the situation clouded my vision in a range of reds. 

“There’s nothing you could’ve done. There’s nothing any of us could’ve done,” he cried in a feeble attempt to soothe me. I sobbed. Memories flooded back of how little I was, how helpless I was in preventing my father’s death, and how this poor man’s daughter must’ve felt. I sympathized with her.

“You O.K.,” he asked softly.

I gather myself in an attempt to sound sane. I don’t really open up to people often or talk about my past much. I don’t want to seem like a walking sob story.

“I’m fine, just angry,” I sighed. He seemed satisfied with the answer and promised to keep me updated on the situation. 

I went to go lay down, but I couldn’t sleep. Normally, I’d attribute it to the medium chai latte I chugged before my meeting, but I knew that wasn’t it. I grabbed my phone and texted Dr. Q. 

“W told me about the new case. Do you need anything,” I offered. As an ME, you see everything. You see the worst in human kind. You see victims on your table who shouldn’t be there. Young kids caught in the crossfire of gangs. A woman who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up getting brutally raped and mutilated by a serial killer on the way home from work. A young child killed by one of two parents going through a nasty divorce, who had done nothing wrong but be born to the wrong people. We’re supposed to put emotion aside to fulfill our duties in an unbiased manner, and I exceeded at this, up until now. This victim in particular was personal to me, and so was the case itself was, but I just couldn’t exactly conclude why. But go figure we get what appears to be the beginning serial killing doctor right relatively soon after I join the team. Just my luck, right?

“If you wouldn’t mind, would you bring me a small black coffee, and just sit in the lab with me? I have no idea who’s doing this, but I’m worried it’s personal. I’m the one of 4 MEs in rotation at this hospital, and they both happen in the middle of my shift by coincidence? I’m not buying it,” he stated. I changed into business casual attire, packed my lab coat in my bag, went to Dunkin and grabbed both of us coffee, and sped to the hospital. 

After I checked in, I made my way to the basement. Everything seemed to be in slow motion. Nurses and doctors eyed me as I walked down the long corridor. We were all growing suspicious of each other, and I realized they all knew my major. They knew I could get away with this if I wanted to.

Silencing the self-incriminating thoughts in my head and all of the insecurities, I faked a smile and maintained a professional attitude. I walked down the the morgue, shoulders back and head held high. Two officers stood outside the entrance.

“Name, birthday, and authority,” one of them said in a rough monotone voice.

I gave them my information and stated I was an intern here at the request of Dr. Q. I handed them the ID card that the hospital had given me when I started, and after looking at it briefly, the one nodded and opened the door for me. I thanked him and walked in to find a solemn Dr. Q hanging his head over his notes, lost in thought. I knocked on the side gently.

“Oh there you are! Thank you so much, I’m so glad you’re here,” he exclaimed, sounding relieved. I smiled and handed him the coffee.

“Of course. I missed everyone and being in the lab,” I beamed. I meant it, too. I genuinely was happy to be back. The hospital felt like home to me, and I made the decision right then and there I wasn’t going to let the situation get to me any longer. I was going to play my part and fulfill my duties to help the families of the victims get some closure. 

Dr. Q briefed me, and we looked at the notes. I looked at the pictures he took of the body, the markings on the graphs, the notes, and we both put our heads together to try and come up with an informal list of people who we thought could be a part of this. 

“What about the doctor who brought in Victim X,” I asked him.

“She was the first one they interrogated. Her alibi checked out. As of right now they’re going over the tapes to-”

Dr. Q was cut off by the sound of the guards yelling, then bitter silence. We turned to each other in horror. We both knew something was wrong, and we were in danger. Seeing he was an older gentleman and didn’t believe in the use of cellphones, the only thing we had was the emergency phone. He picked it up and went to dial the front desk. 

“Nothing,” he cried out.

9-1-1.

“I think something’s wrong with the phone,” he moaned.

I picked it up to check it out myself. Dial tone. The lines were cut…?

“Wait my cell,” I half-whispered, half-yelled.

I grabbed around in my bag for it. Two missed calls from W. I texted him.

“I’m in the basement with Dr. Q call police,” I texted quickly.

“I was about to tell you two to get out, there’s a guy with a gun in the hospital,” he replied immediately. 

That’s when it hit me.

“W, how did you know-”

The sound of glass breaking broke my concentration and resulted in me throwing my phone. W came around the corner and into the office. In one hand, an empty syringe and in the other, a gun with a silencer attached to the barrel. Before Q or I could speak, he cocked it and shot Dr. Q. The bullet struck him and embedded itself in between his eyes. He slumped to the floor, lifeless.

“NO,” I screamed crying, tears pouring down my cheeks as I tried to stop the bleeding. “Please, please, please.”

W grabbed my wrists and pulled me up to him. “Sweetheart, stop crying, someone will hear you,” he growled, wiping away my tears. I was shaking.

“Why,” was all I could muster out. In a hail-mary attempt, I made a grab for the gun. I dug my high heel into the middle of his foot and grabbed the gun from his sweaty palms. He cried out in pain, and the gun slipped from his hands into mine. I turned it around, cocked it and put my finger gently over the trigger like my step-dad taught me.

“I’m not stupid, hun. I only filled it with as many bullets as I needed,” he uttered victoriously, still holding his foot. 

“I don’t believe you,” I whimpered, hoping he was trying to use reverse psychology so I wouldn’t bother shooting.

“Go ahead, darling. Give it a… shot,” he chuckled sadistically. I looked him in the eyes and, completely void of emotion, pulled the trigger.

Nothing.

“You’ve got balls. I didn’t think you’d actually try,” he snarled. “Bad girl.”

“W, what the hell-”

“I sent you her, and you *left me*,” he yelled in disbelief. “I knew you wanted to work mainly on bodies of homicide victims, and you were b\*\*\*\*ing about how you never got any, so I gave you some,” he explained. “The second one was personal. To draw you back. I knew you’d never be able to overcome the empathy for another daddy’s girl.”

“But you didn’t have to kill them, W,” I cried out. Why wasn’t somebody coming down?!

“I wanted to! You make sacrifices for the people you love,” he whined, almost shyly. I froze in my place.

“Excuse me? You killed people because you think you *love me*?! I just met you only, like what 3 weeks ago,” I cried out in astonishment.

“Actually 4 and a half. I have the day marked,” he retorted.

I looked at the empty syringe in his hand. “W, what do you want,” I questioned, eyeing the murder weapon in his hand as he spun it around his fingers.

“Well I’m glad you asked, love,” he purred. 

Next thing I knew, my wrists were tied behind my back, and a ball of cloth was forced in my mouth and duct taped over.

“Can you breathe,” he asked sternly. I nodded.

Upon confirmation, he turned around and grabbed another cloth. He then spun around to the desk drawers and rummaged through until he found what he was looking for. A grin crept across his face as I read the bottle- chloroform. I struggled against my restraints and kicked at him, but to no avail. 

“Cut it out,” he barked as he put his leg in between mine and pushed his hip against my abdomen, keeping me stuck between him and the desk. He dabbed a bit of the solution onto the cloth and put it directly under my nostrils.

But not before he carefully stuck the empty syringe in my pulmonary artery.

“Be a good girl and relax, it won’t hurt,” he assured me. I held my breath for as long as I could, but gave in to the lack of oxygen. My eyes began to feel heavy, and I felt them flutter shut. He kissed my forehead.

“Good girl,” he praised. Everything was going black. I watched him pull out rope, a scalpel, more chloroform and more syringes. I made one more attempt to escape, but as I started to crawl, he picked me up and put me on the desk. The last thing I saw was him locking the door."

aywtke,11,2019-03-08,I got expelled from High School then self-studied my entire final year. Should I mention that I self-study on my CV?,IBApplicantHelpMe,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/aywtke/i_got_expelled_from_high_school_then_selfstudied/,"I'll try to give a lot of details to give you a good understanding of what happened.


I went to school in a pretty religious country. I got a blowjob on campus from a girl in the year below. In the afternoon a friend (not a close one, more so a classmate) came up to me aggressively telling me to tell him ""what the fuck did you do"".


Turns out that the girl was his girlfriend, and that they had broken up the night before and she wanted to get back on him with one of his friends. In the afternoon, he wanted to talk to her about getting back together. She cried, told him what happened and told him that I had pressured her into it. 


His parents are teachers at my school, he tells them that I took advantage of her (those exact words). Long story short, her parents who are lawyers threaten to sue, and I get expelled in order to keep things from going public (since its pretty serious in the religious country I'm in). They promise to keep it quiet, and that I sit my exams in the school at the end of the year.


I go home, contemplate suicide (but pussy out) and decide that 'fuck it' I'll try my best. I wake up every day at 8am, study for a total of 6-8 ish hours for 6 months. I navigated the entire university application process by myself. 


Long story short, I manage to get accepted into a strong-semi target, get the grades for it and also manage to get a full scholarship through my government (they do a VERY rigorous background check so I am 100% certain that my school is committed to keeping everything under-wraps. I even have my picture taken for the yearbook lol).


Overall the year is not something I regret at all. I spent hundreds of more hours with my mom by watching movies, tv shows, learning how to cook from her and understanding the troubles and difficulties she had navigating her divorce when I was younger and raising us by herself (she is incredible.) I met an incredible number of people who's insights dramatically changed my view on the world for the better. I'm also far more disciplined yadayada.


Now comes the crux. I applied for IB internships this year, and didn't get any (though I did get a lot of interviews and a few superdays). I'll be able to apply again next year for internships because I'm doing a masters afterwards (always wanted to go to a particular target school and my mom said she'd be willing to support me since she didn't pay my uni fees or my last year of school). I am now debating whether to make a very brief mention of my final year of high school as justification for my grades which is still above average compared to other applicants, but definitely not the immaculate you'd expect from a strong IB candidate.


I was thinking something along the lines of:


Grades: ### - Last year entirely self-studied. 


I'm fairly sure that I could make up something about my parents not being able to afford it and my school allowing me to sit exams there (since its the only place where you can in my country). I don't like to ""flaunt"" my suffering, but I am from a single parent household from a developing country. If I passed my background check with my gov, I am quite sure that I can pass a bank check. 


Now, what do you guys think? I guess a few TL;DR questions would be: 


1.) Will banks even consider people who were expelled (no police record or anything).


2.) Would chalking my final year self-study up to financial issues (assuming I can do so) be significantly beneficial to my application? I believe it could demonstrate a lot of discipline and resillience, but I'm obviously not unbiased and could use a sanity check here. 


3.) Do you think it realisitically likely that I'd be able to pass it off as financial issues?


Additional info: My applications this year weren't always unsuccessful. I had second round interviews with Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, BoA, Jefferies etc and Goldman and Evercore Superdays. I genuinely feel that my grades did hold me back significantly (it was mentioned in like 80% of my interviews and my ACs why my grades in school contrasted so significantly to literal top of my class ranking in my first year university exams). I have since acquired a LOT of extracurriculars (i play rugby for my university and do a lot of extra curriculars etc) and a lot of relevant campus leadership experience + I managed to get a few internships back home to add to my CV this summer (1 VC and 1 PE).


Hope that the wall of text wasn't too boring. I genuinely am looking for advice guys. My mom endured a lot of heartache and stress raising me by herself and I know how a toll my final year of high school took on her. I really want to make her proud, and I know that getting into IB is far more easily done through an internship, and next year will be my last main recruiting season to do this.


Edit: As a final note: Pre-University grades are an extremely significant component of IB applications here. Obviously its unlikely to have been the only or even main reason as to why I couldn't get an internship out of my interviews. My technical knowledge was not good enough and in a lot of cases, I gave far worse answers to comp questions than what I can offer now. That being said, since so much of banking is a numbers game, I'm looking to get my interview rate as high as possible. High single digit interviews out of 50 applications doesn't seem like good odds to me and next year is my last chance for internships. "

ayxbic,2,2019-03-08,Abroad Internship in Sweden?,Nuolong,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/ayxbic/abroad_internship_in_sweden/,"Hi, college student here! I'm majoring in computer science and there's this company in Sweden that would be my dream company to intern for just for a short 8-12 week stay over the summer. The problem is, the company requires interns to be Swedish residents.

Is there a reason for this requirement? I initially thought that it was to imply that internships were only to be done in person, but upon contacting them directly, I needed a Swedish number.

But if I were to be living and renting a place near their offices for around two months, I don't understand any good reason for the requirement. So I'd love to be enlightened if there is one, or any tips I could use, since to be able to learn from the people of this company would really be a dream-come-true opportunity for me."

Overall I am satisfied with that keyboard, beside one thing:

The FN media buttons do not work like they should. FN + keyboard intern functions like changing lightningprofile or brightness work fine. OS FN funtions that are volume or mediaplayer related do not. They sometimes work but I have to spam the button very fast and it will activate between 3 and 5 pushes only once. If I want to activate it again I have to spam again. The buttons themselfes are okay, I tested them with online keyboard tester that visualise keystrokes and there they work 10/10 times. So I guess it is a software problem. Windows10 shows the full name of the keyboard under devices and the popup told me it installed the device successfully.


Anyone had the same experience with that or other keyboards with FN media buttons?

edit: Updated the firmware. Did not encounter the described problem anymore."

ayy98b,135,2019-03-08,I spent some weeks as a night-shift vet tech. It nearly killed me. [Part 2],AdelaideHope,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ayy98b/i_spent_some_weeks_as_a_nightshift_vet_tech_it/,"[Part 1 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ay22xn/i_spent_some_weeks_as_a_nightshift_vet_tech_it/)

&amp;#x200B;

I spent that week at school trying my hardest to keep my mind off the internship, but no matter how hard I tried it was no use. There was something so strange and off-putting about Mort, and despite his claims to the contrary I knew the state that that dog was in. I mean, it’s one thing to talk about a dog swelling-- my own dog, who I loved dearly, got an allergic reaction once too. It looks terrible and then can pass quickly.

But Jax, I mean, he had tufts of hair coming off that somehow grew back within a few short hours, and I’m supposed to believe that that’s normal? The cages all unlocking on their own is supposed to just be the everyday ins and outs of a vet clinic?

And what kind of vet has a fucking bird overnight? I didn’t even know that vets see birds, much less a bird like that. It was exotic, colorful, vibrant, almost like a bird out of a fantasy novel.

As the next Saturday was fast approaching, I agonized over how to avoid going back to that place. I ran through every scenario in my brain, but there just wasn’t a way to get out of it. If I quit, I’d lose that semester’s worth of credit and I’d be in deep shit with our school counselor. All other internships (believe me, I checked) had been booked up long ago. I had to just get through it, and I resolved this upcoming Saturday that I would show up, stay in that office all night-- never go outside, once-- and avoid dealing with the animals altogether, barring emergencies.

I arrived just before my shift was to start, and found Mort sitting behind the desk, looking out into space. It was almost as if he was meditating, but with his eyes open wide. As I opened the door, he awoke from his statuesque posture, handed me the keys and walked right out the door, all without saying a word. Was this what Mort was like when he was grumpy?  I didn’t know, nor, to be honest, did I care.

I rushed behind the desk and took out my schoolwork immediately. I’d fallen behind quite a bit that week at school from being lost in thought about the whole situation, and so I *knew* that I had to do work this evening or I’d get flack on Monday from my teachers.

And just like the previous week, the first couple hours went by without a breeze. I worked, the backroom stayed quiet, and the front of the building and street was empty and dark. No strange noises from the street, either.

But then, a crash and a flutter. It sounded like something heavy dropped from the backroom, just feet behind me. I got up immediately and ran back to check, but found everything in place.

But wait, I thought-- the bird. Where the hell is it? The cage was closed but I could see that the door had been unlocked. On the opposite corner, a big glass jar full of cotton-balls lay shattered.

“Adelaide,” a raspy, high-pitched voice called out. I heard it from within the room, but I had no sense of direction as to where it came from. I darted back and forth with my eyes over every square-inch of the floor, but there was nothing.

“Adelaide, I’m up here!” it shrieked again. I looked up, and to my amazement, on the light-fixture, there sat the bird. It ruffled its feathers.

I looked down at the other two cages, wherein Jax and Cynthia slept peacefully.

“Oscar!?” I said back, still surprised. How did this bird know my name?

“Not Oscar,” the bird now called aggressively and swooped down in front of me, landing on a counter just a couple feet from my body.

It sat there, motionless for a moment, but made eye contact with me the entire time. I didn’t know what I could possibly say. It ruffled its feathers again impatiently.

“Take dog for walk,” the bird now called.

“I--” I began, before being interrupted by a shriek so loud it felt like it was going to burst my eardrums.

“TAKE DOG FOR WALK!”

“Okay okay, Oscar--”

“NOT OSCAR!” it shrieked again, a shriek so loud it felt like someone drove a screwdriver through my brain.

“Okay, I’ll-- listen, get back in your cage and I promise I’ll take Jax for a walk.”

The bird looked me over, appraisingly. Finally, it flew over to its cage, clasped on to the side and with its beak opened the gate. There it carefully traversed that vertical cage, climbed inside, and in a tremendous display of dexterity managed to close its cage door and engage the lock.

So this is what I was up against, I thought. The damn locks aren’t a match for this bird. But tonight, I wasn’t going to have any shenanigans. I saw a roll of duct tape beside the cage, and it dawned on me immediately why that was there. I lunged for it and quickly jammed the lock in place, as the bird fluttered wildly in the cage.

“Not smart enough, Oscar,” I mumbled as I fastened the lock in place.

“TAKE DOG FOR WALK,” Oscar now shrieked again. The pain of his voice nearly buckled me to the floor, and I scrambled back to the front room by the desk as quickly as I could.

Again, a shriek. It didn’t seem to matter that a wall and heavy door separated me from the cages, the shriek seemed to pierce all physical barriers. It almost felt louder as I got further away, and it repeated, the pitch getting higher by the second. I barely lasted a half minute before I burst back into the room with the animals.

“Fine!” I blurted out, “Just once!” The bird’s shrieking subsided immediately.

What was going to happen now, I had no idea. This dog might die on me, I thought, considering how sick it got the previous Saturday. But I also knew that this bird was going to kill my hearing, and I remembered how lax Mort was about the whole thing in the first place. He didn’t seem concerned at all about Jax, so maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.

I decided to grab a leash hanging off next to Jax’s cage and to let him out. He was tame and mild-mannered, a very mellow dog to be sure. I figured I’d go out and the second I noticed any issue I’d just rush back in. After all, what kind of dog doesn’t enjoy a walk?

I led Jax out to the lobby and carefully unlatched the door. I checked behind me one last time-- all was quiet-- and I walked outside with Jax. My intention was to walk in the little strip mall where the vet was located, and for the first minute or two everything seemed to go quite well.

But then, I noticed Jax’s breathing start to labor. Within seconds he began wheezing, as well, and just as I looked down to check on him a tuft of fur flew right off his neck. Like a fistfull, falling to the ground in a big clump. My heart jumped into my throat. I grabbed Jax immediately by the collar and started leading him back to the vet office.

Then, a bustle and flutter sound rang out just ahead of me. I looked straight at the vet office door and saw it: Oscar. He had managed to get out of his cage, and now was working the door-lock to the vet’s office. I ran as fast as I could drag Jax behind me, who was making those throaty, guttural moans just as he had the previous week. Just as I got to the door, I heard the lock engage. I grabbed it and pulled as hard as I could, but the door had been locked from the inside. And Oscar sat there, on the desk where my books and schoolwork and-- most importantly-- my cell phone lay, staring at me with a blank expression.

“Uuuuuhhhhaaaaa” the moan came again, and I peered down at Jax.

In that short time, his shoulders protruded and swelled. Most of them were bare skin, and beneath his body and around it, in the vague shape of a dog’s silhouette, were piles of fur. The upper half of his body had tripled in size, but his hindquarters remained relatively unchanged.

“Jax!” I screamed, kneeling down to him, “It’s okay boy, it’s okay!”

“Uuuuhhhhhhaaaaa” another moan came, now far deeper than the first.

“Jax, hang on, just wait here. I’ll go get help-- I’ll find someone with a phone, just wait!” I yelled down at him in a panic.

“Aaaahhhhhhh” another moan came, now strangely familiar in tone.

“Jax?!”

“Ahhhhduhhlaaaaaiiiiid!” the voice now bellowed, labored and slow.

I saw now that even the dog’s head had swollen and mutated, and was bulbous and round. In the evening night it was barely visible, but it looked strangely human.

“What… are you?” I questioned, goosebumps and shivers going through my body. The dog, or whatever it was, paused now, and took slow, even breaths. It flattened its body and seemed to save up some energy. Speaking was ostensibly quite difficult for it.

“Not what… It’s me, Adelaide… It’s Luke.”

ayzowo,31,2019-03-08,Did the UC Davis applicant pool become much more competitive in just one year?,IBslut,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ayzowo/did_the_uc_davis_applicant_pool_become_much_more/,"Last year, I half-assed my applications as I managed my time between college apps and school work poorly. As a result, I decided to take a gap year so that I could work on myself, as well as my essays and overall application, and give my best shot at it.

When I applied to UCD last year with the shitty application, I was waitlisted. However, this year I was straight up rejected (applied to CS both times). Has UCD become significantly more competitive in just one year? And how does this translate to the other UCs, like LA, SD and SB, all of whom outright rejected me last year?

NOTE: for anyone that is curious, I didn’t turn into a God who cured cancer in one year. The improvements I made were:-
- SAT 1370 —&gt; ACT 34
- IBDP Grade (International student): 30/45 —&gt; 35/45
- Took an SAT Subject Test (Math2): got 800
- ECs: did an internship at an AI firm. 
Also started a project where I acquired computers from local businesses, which I then set up at schools for the underprivileged to digitally educate them
- Started working on my college essays August onwards (compared to last year where I started one week before the UC app deadline)."

After leaving that job after 1.5 year, I scored an internship (Data Engineering) with a decent size company.

az1fry,2,2019-03-09,Wondering if I should go all in.,ComidaDeHaro,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/az1fry/wondering_if_i_should_go_all_in/,"Tl;dr: Should I take out a $20,000 dollar loan to complete an engineering degree?

Long part:

I began my love affair with engineering a few years ago, as a community college student. When I began my journey, I was in the lowest level of math and science comprehension. Over the course of 2-3 years, I fought my way up the math and science curriculum. I eventually earned all the math and science credits needed for an engineering degree. Along with the general requirements, I finished statics, thermodynamics, and materials science. I had a few proud accomplishments such as becoming a NASA Aerospace Scholar and completing an internship at an advance materials laboratory.   

Everything was going great until 2 years ago.  As the oldest in a single parent family, my family was struggling in my absence. I was running out of federal loans and my minimum wage job was interfering with my studies. All the stress, fear, and guilt culminated in a near mental breakdown. I left school heartbroken and full of regret. I began to work full time to help my family. Working some demeaning jobs and seeing professional engineers at work has given me a renewed motivation to continue. Over the last two years, I had plenty of time to reflec upon why I failed and what I could do differently.  For starters, I believe I have an attention deficit disorder. Imagine having to read a paragraph 7-8 times before understanding anything or having to fight to keep focused. My struggle to read forced me to study at an absurdly slow rate. I  also realized something about my feelings towards engineering. I love mechanical engineering, but I'm scared. I'm scared of failure. I constantly look for alternative majors, but I know that's the one I want. It's a gut wrenching limbo to be scared of what you love. 

As I lay here and ponder, I have two opportunities to finish: private loans and tuition reimbursement. Should I jump the gun and take the loans or go for the more drawn out journey of reimbursement? Who would I talk to about getting a diagnosis for whatever it is I have? "

ANY ACTIVITY THAT YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOING OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL CAN BE AN EC. Babysitting even, can be an EC because you can derive lots of lessons from. Time management, multitasking, humility . . .even things like skateboarding. Things you did with other people are especially helpful , because  COMMUNITY INVOLVENT IS IMPORTANT! Even if it's not a typical way to be involved in the community, you are involved and you can talk about how you fit into that group / how it's impacted you in essays.

When applying for reach schools, you have to do what I did here- You have to really spill out who you are as a person, every part of it to really stack those odds in your favor. I didn't give any sob stories because they did not affect my education significantly, but if you have stories of adversity that got in the way of your education AND CAN EXPLAIN HOW YOU OVERCAME IT , write about it! ~~I didn't even mention I was half deaf owo~~

Make sure you apply for schools you actually care about, and not just prestigious ones. Whether or not you care about the schools you are applying to will show in your essays.

I'll add more later if I think of it but yeahhh I GOT IN AND I'M SO THANKFUL

I'm also thankful to /r/A2C, you guys dealt with my constant questions about UMich and other things about the college application experience. I deeply thank you for all of your help and reassurance. 

Got questions? Ask me!!

Hopefully this helps people :D

az404i,4,2019-03-09,I really want to quit my job with no notice,eauv,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/az404i/i_really_want_to_quit_my_job_with_no_notice/,"(Sorry about the wall of text!!)
I’ve been at this assistant job for just over 4 months with a well known fashion designer who has been highly respected in the industry for a couple decades. I was thrilled about as it is difficult to get a hold of a job in the fashion industry in the country I live in, and as mentioned, he is well known and highly respected. Pretty much it would look really impressive on the resume.

It’s definitely not a normal fashion design house; the only other person working there aside from myself is the head designer and a bunch of unpaid interns that come and go. This means I manage almost everything from general administration, PR, production, order dispatches, to inventory management. Despite the lack of employees, I only work two days a week, as he is incredibly frugal and doesn’t believe the workload is high enough to bring in more employees or have me take on more days. As expected, I do a lot of unpaid overtime.

Since this is my first graduate job, I do make mistakes often, especially being underqualified for most aspects of the job with not much other support. I guess this is where my problem lies, he is a micro manager and mistakes are harshly reprimanded, even the smallest ones. Sometimes he belittles me. Overtime I’ve become increasingly anxious and nervous about fucking up. Recently I’ve finding myself depressed, crying a lot before and after work, losing weight and just generally anxious most of the time. 

Two weeks ago I was getting chastised over a fault in a production garment that I hadn’t noticed, I was in a bad state and in the heat of the moment tried to quit, and offered two weeks notice. He didn’t take it well, I (stupidly) didn’t realise that there was a 6 week notice period written into the contract and was told either I can fuck off or give him 6 weeks. He took offense to my idea of 2 weeks. At the end he eventually apologised about being too harsh on me, and he will try to be better. I was told that he would like me to stay, and that we should see if I still want to leave after the first week of April, which I agreed to. However nothing in his attitude/behaviour has improved and I desperately want out.

I’m feeling a bit lost. I'm know very naive for wanting this, but I’m so much tempted to just quit via email, no notice, and just burn the bridge. Money won’t be an issue as I already do have a higher paying job in furniture retail that I spend my other working days on; with a manager I enjoy working with, who is happy to give me a good reference and more shifts. At the same time, the reference would be nice and I'd feel bad for leaving him with no time for someone else to fill the role. I also feel rather pathetic that I can’t handle this 2 day a week job, and that I’m giving up this so quickly.

I guess I’d like some advise as to how I should go about this. I’ve been going around in dizzying circles about this in my head and I’d really like some unbiased opinions.

Many many thanks in advance.

az4gj4,13,2019-03-09,Should I go with PRESTIGE or a CHEAPER one?,makeit2college,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/az4gj4/should_i_go_with_prestige_or_a_cheaper_one/,"   First, I would like to share with you guys about my personal background. I am an international student from Vietnam, and I have been studying in the American Curriculum back here throughout HS (I studied in Minnesota for only 1 year, on sophomore). I am an avid learner, love contributing to society, and seek to study Business in college. Here are my academic stats:
+ Class rank: 1/25
+ GPA: 4.40/4.8 (My school does weighted only)
+ SAT: 1350
+ SAT Math 1: 680 
+ SAT Math 2: 630

   So far, the college application process has been great, and I have gotten into around 10 schools out of 25 total. So far, I am only rejected from Georgia Tech and UT-Austin. I have gotten in UNC-Chapel Hill, UGA, UW, MiamiU of Ohio, U Minnesota, IU-Bloomington, and many more. I am still waiting for some UCs, BU, NYU, Wake Forest decisions. At the moment, I have been thinking a lot about where I will be ended up, and I have narrowed down to 2 institutions: 1. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and 2. Miami University at Oxford.
     
   For me, financial is not a problem, so I am free to have a decision on either choice. The biggest problem is that at UNC, I have to work hard to apply for Business school, while at Miami, I can do projects and internships on Farmer B school straightaway. I have been researching carefully about their programs and students' body, and I think I cannot go wrong on either one. However, Miami has given a good scholarship that I can save around $30,000 every year. If I go to UNC, do its name and networks really worth it? Does going to a harder school makes it harder to maintain a high GPA throughout college? 
       
        Question: In short, should I go for prestige or a cheaper one? 
 
[Every perspective from you guys is truly appreciated. I would like thank beforehand because your opinions mean a lot to me!]

     1. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:
Pros: It is ranked amongst one of the best public university and top university national and worldwide. Especially, I have fallen in love with the campus and varied student clubs. I imagined that I could be a great fit there.  

Cons: First, I am not directly-admitted to its Business school, so I have to jump through another hoop and apply again. As a result, immediately on the next year, I have to work extremely hard to fill in Preqs and do another application, where I have to compete with my qualified peers. Secondly, I understand the academic-caliber is much more competitive and stressful, so I understand my GPA is not as high if I attend an easier one. Not to be mention, there are chances I can not get into Kenan-Flagler Busines School. Third, I have to pay more every year to study here, although it is not an issue.

     2. Miami University at Oxford:
Pros: Similarly, I love the European campuses and architectures of the school. Miami has a lot to give, from varied student clubs and organizations. By directly admitted to Farmer School of Business, I can develop my interests right away, such as doing projects and have experiences of internships. Especially, Miami is one of the best colleges in the nation, when it comes to undergrad teaching. Most importantly, there are many chances I can be a bigger fish on the pond and perform better. At the same time, I can save aound $30,000 / year to the bank.

Cons: First, I can only think that Miami's degree may not be as valuable as North Carolina's. Next, I understand that Miami is a big frat and party schools.
However, I honestly think Miami U is a fine institution and it is quite a bargain in terms of tuition. 

   Once again, thank you for your times and insight! I hope you have a good day.

az8hn6,10,2019-03-09,PEY internship RBC vs CPPIB?,PEY_Student,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/az8hn6/pey_internship_rbc_vs_cppib/,"Hey guys,

I recently got 2 offers, from RBC (12 months) as data science analyst co-op and CPPIB (4 months) as software developer intern.

I've been doing some research on both places.

&amp;#x200B;

RBC: big name brand, could be a cog in a machine. The team is small, maybe between 5 \~ 10 members. Manager is working in different province, thus I won't be seeing him very often. On the description, I will be utilizing big data tools like Hadoop, SQL, Python, Tableau... etc. But I may not obtain meaningful projects and only do repetitive work like generating weekly business reports and excel VBA at most. At the same time, it is 12 months, so I'll get a lot of exposure to various tools within RBC and the business field. I'll also be able to job search for a 4 months internship after my RBC co-op to further diversify my work experience.

&amp;#x200B;

CPPIB: decent name brand. Interview was much much harder, and co-workers seem very intelligent and willing to teach. My technical learning experience is pretty much guaranteed. But I heard there's a huge disconnection between IT (developer) team and business team. Thus, developers get less respect compared to financial analysts, since the company revolves heavily in finance and investment. This could be misleading though, as the review is from glassdoor back in 2017. This position is more tech related, doing back-end development, building APIs, also gaining exposure to financial / trading industry. Choosing CPPIB will bring my graduation by 1 year earlier, since regular engineering students do 4 years + 1 year full co-op, where I'll be skipping the 1 year co-op through 4 months internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Pay difference is only $0.25, so choosing company based on pay would be out of the option.

I honestly don't mind either, I have interest in both data science and software development, so this will boil down to whichever company is better in terms of internship / co-op experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have insights on either company, and if so, how was it?

Thanks a lot for the help!!"

I'm finally graduating with a B.A. in Computer Science this year and I'm trying to increase my marketability as a mobile developer. Unfortunately, that marketability is extremely low right now. I've never had an internship or any work experience because of:

*A) Me being an idiot and waiting too long*

*B) My dad's death during the summer that I was finally going to do one*

Currently, my resume is essentially just some related courses, and two projects ( A Snake/Tron game in Java and a compiler for a subset of MIPS in C). I have more projects but I feel like they are not on par with the quality of my current code. 

Obviously, I'm not in good shape right now. Knowledge-wise I honestly think I'm more solid than most graduating future developers I meet. Unfortunately, I spent a lot of time in college pouring through documentation and learning rather than actually doing large-scale projects. I'm not gonna try to sell myself right now with all the languages, frameworks, etc. that I know but for related context, I self reportedly have a thorough understanding of Android programming, Java, and Kotlin. 

What I really need is more experience. For the past month I've been working on an Android app as a side project, and I'm also working on a pretty ambitious cross-platform parental control software with a group of students. Both of these I think would look great on my portfolio, but either way, my experience section of my resume remains blank, which I assume will lead to many companies discarding my resume immediately.

**So what am I doing about it?**

I've been applying a lot recently but I don't think I'm gonna get anywhere with my current resume. I need experience as soon as possible. I'm going to make an app for a small family-owned restaurant I go to. I'm going to charge almost no money (like $20 with a money back guarantee) and deliver the best product I possibly can. This way, I can at least add Freelance developer under experience. 

**My question**

Is this enough? Am I screwed? Does adding that little bit of Freelance experience make enough of a difference to where I should actually spend my time developing an app for that small business? And if not, what would you recommend I spend my time doing instead?

*Bonus Question: Does anyone know if I need to set up a sole proprietorship to make an app for this company/add Freelance Developer under my experience?*"

aza4yo,7,2019-03-09,"Anyone here have the problem of being called the ""genius"" of the family but fall short of expectations? Did you ever overcome it and how?",aGeniusButNotReally,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aza4yo/anyone_here_have_the_problem_of_being_called_the/,"Let's first get this out of the way, I don't come from what they call a ""tiger parenting"" family, in which children are pushed really hard on academics. My family is not overbearing in that sense at all. 

But what I did get often growing up is that I was called the ""genius"" of the immediate family, or a very talented kid. I had a seemingly innate skill for drawing and some math.

And growing up that was mostly true, getting good grades and GPA, until in college which, long story short I didn't go into a STEM field, and I felt more misguided. My parents weren't upset or anything, but this was mostly on me in that I didn't really make a lot of friends in college and ended up feeling isolated and graduated with a mediocre 2.7-ish GPA. Coming out of college I had some personal programming projects that may have been impressive back then, but impostor syndrome kicked in and I felt unfit for large companies. 

I took whatever programming job I could out of college because, no internships yay, but while it seemed easy going for at least the first few years, insidious problems started showing up. 

The first one is, I'm not very social with co-workers and I never was able to draw a bead on office politics very well. And the second is I got too complacent learning new tech skills. So every new job hunt became challenging as the first one.

My family, especially my mom is now puzzled that despite being smart, and the first one in my family's generation to get a college degree, I'm not ""winning"" the game in financial security.

Right now I am still in the process of overcoming this issue. A lot of it has to do with soft skills, honestly, but it is hard to just get used to it as that's not where my ""genius"" comes from."

azagcj,17,2019-03-09,Tips for (Upcoming) Juniors,KingSisyphusXV,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azagcj/tips_for_upcoming_juniors/,"Hello. This advice is probably better suited for September, but I saw some upcoming juniors asking about how to best prepare themselve for Junior year. Here is my advice on how to have an enjoyable junior year and set yourself up well for college. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Take the SATs and Subject tests during Junior year**. Do not wait till the August SAT leading into Senior year. It is very nice to be done with all test taking and not having to study for anything over the summer months. Plus, the May SATs are a great time to get your subject tests over with because they coincide with AP tests, so you can study for both simutaneously. 
2. **Take classes you enjo**y. Throughout high school, Junior year was the easier year and I was the most successful that year. I'm a STEM kid, so I took 4 STEM courses + 2 required courses and enjoying my classes made the year not feel like a constant grind. 
3. **When you visit colleges, make sure to take notes**. When you're writing your essays, especially the ""Why X,"" it will be nice to have somethings to reference. For example, during my Columbia tour, I heard that 1 dining hall was opened 24/7, which no other college does, and that small point ended up in my Columbia essay.
4. Apply for summer programs / internships. Ask your parents if they have any friends who have some leverage at their company. I was able to land an awesome and unique (unpaid however) internship leading into my Junior year by asking a neighbor if he had any positions at his labratory open. If you don't know anyone connected, you have the option to apply for programs and/or email professors. At the end of your emails, always put: *If you don't have any opportunities open, do you have any coworkers who might?* Or something along those lines.
5. Do some nationally recognized stuff. I didn't know about USAMO, ISEF, DECA or anything of the like until this year, but if I knew back then, I would have definitely competed in more nationally acclaimed competitions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, I'm not telling you to do all of this, just make sure some of these points are checked off and you will have an enjoyable Junior Year AND set yourself up for getting into better colleges than if you ignore all these points. Hope this helps someone!"

azbe8z,2,2019-03-09,"How the Disney Fox merger messed up my first several months of 2018, and how I got over it, and turned my life around.",jordanwhite916,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/azbe8z/how_the_disney_fox_merger_messed_up_my_first/,"This topic has to do with mental health because I let something that only existed outside my circle of influence bother me where my behavior was troubling, but then through a series of events, I not only got over it, but also turned my life around and kept my career when I started performing way better in my career.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Disney fan and a fan of family films, like Home Alone, made by 20th Century Fox. I am also a special case because my mind is like a steep trap, and remembers dates very well. This is all part of what makes me do very well in my career and is a natural part of my autism. However, the problems started when on November 6, 2017, Disney proposed buying 20th Century Fox. I took this as a move of monopolistic practices, and more becoming of a dictator, because as a Disney fan I know almost every single thing Disney has bought over the past 20 years. This started pumping up the anxiety in my head. Violent thoughts, extreme dark scenarios, popping up in my head. It was hard for me to work because of this. On December 14, 2017, Disney bought 20th Century Fox. I felt sunk, defeated, couldn't even feel happy or excited. It was Christmas. I couldn't even feel happy or excited when I had my company's annual Christmas party. I couldn't even feel happy or excited when I went to see Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi that night. The situation was made worse when I felt the bad guys won in that movie, and when I discovered the backlash against it, and when I realized we no longer had Carrie Fisher or Debbie Reynolds. I felt just sick to my stomach, achy, loss of enthusiasm. The big breaker was some guy on Twitter named Mathew Buck, who goes by Film Brain, and does film reviews for Channel Awesome (Nostalgia Critic's site), declaring on Twitter that Fox was effectively dead and that it would be destroyed under Disney, loss of a Hollywood legacy, things like that. Unfortunately, at that time, I was a guy who would believe anything people would say online or in the news. 

2018 came and I felt worried about the state of film making. However, I don't work in the film industry. I work as a software engineer at a large retail corporation. You would think I would be worried about 20th Century Fox, but then the biggest problem arose. My manager gave me some rough constructive criticism, said she felt like I was the weakest member of her team, and that I was performing like an intern a year after I first started. I called Dad and I was to the point of tears telling him about my problem. I didn't take it with a grain of salt. I took it with a sledgehammer to the gut. The problem was not Disney and 20th Century Fox coming together. The problem was me. I was making this happen to myself. So I did what any man would do when he's in a situation like this. Cried out to God for help to turn my life around. I already am an avid Christ follower, and have been for 17 1/2 years. I just cry out to God more when I'm in a crisis in my life.

Dad and I worked out a plan to help me get better at doing my job and to stop performing like an intern out of college. I knew I just had to implement those strategies. I had a month to do so, otherwise they would transfer me to a different department. I felt bad too when I got my annual review from my boss. Nevertheless, I still persisted on implementing those strategies. When my boss was promoted to director of the team, and one of my coworkers was promoted to manager, I believed that things would change for the better, even though I was not out of the woods yet. The day of my next one on one with the managing director came on April 27, 2018, the very day Avengers: Infinity War stormed into theaters. I came in there fearing the worst, ready to tell her about the strategies that I have been implementing. That's when things started to change for the better. She said that she liked the strategies I have been implementing, and that she has noticed a change in the way I do my job. From that point I started a turn around.

The rest of 2018 passes quickly. I stuck with the same job, and found out that a new holding company called ""New Disney"" would be created, becoming the parent of both Disney and 20th Century Fox. Another article early in 2019 stated that it would be business as usual. Also, I got an answer on Quora saying that while 20th Century Fox will be owned by ""New Disney"" or The Walt Disney Company, they will continue to operate in the same way that they did before the acquisition. I also started doing speeches at various venues talking about my progression as an autistic person. I also had my pay increased because HR wanted the IT department to be competitive with other IT departments. The biggest change is that I am more confident, and that I have not hit myself since Christmas Day 2018. Don't ask why it happened, but I did, and in the time span of a year, I was able to do a complete turnaround of my life.

Now whenever some news outlet says that 20th Century Fox is dead, I want to pop up through the screen, breaking the fourth wall, and telling them that they're lying. I know I can't even do that because it's not possible, except in cartoons. What is happening though, is that I'm applying more critical thinking to the situation. This has started happening to me more in the past year. I'm finding out that a lot of the stuff put out on the Internet just isn't really true. More often than not, they're opinions, thoughts, and most likely trolls. Even the trusted news outlets have to put in something called Op-Ed to warn readers that what they are reading isn't going to be 100% true. My misguided belief in everything bad that the Internet has spewed out for the longest time has messed up my behavior and mental health, but now everything is starting to turn around. 2019 looks to be like my year.

Looking back, me being affected and heavily troubled by the news that Disney would be buying 20th Century Fox, may have been the best thing that ever happened to me.

On the other hand, I really want a job doing computer graphics work. For these types of jobs I feel like I need to work on projects.

aze8jw,280,2019-03-10,"Pathrise: A Warning Sourced From An Internship ""Fellow""",QuietAccess3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aze8jw/pathrise_a_warning_sourced_from_an_internship/,"UPDATE:

I have been in contact with Kevin Wu, the CEO and founder of Pathrise and we have resolved my dissatisfaction with the Pathrise program by fully releasing me from Pathrise. After chatting with Kevin, I want to make some updates to the original post as I personally felt I had used extreme language in an unfair manner. Pathrise did make some mistakes with me as a fellow which caused me to have this opinion of Pathrise. It's entirely possible that other fellows may feel differently. Nobody in Pathrise is forcing me to do this, Kevin made it clear he is helping me withdraw at no penalty or cost. I'm posting of my own volition because I want to be as fair as possible so people have a chance to evaluate Pathrise on their own, thus I am making an update to the original post.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be marking my edits from the original post with brackets, \[\], to specify areas where there has been a change. An important note I would like to highlight: Neither in this update or the original post do I call Pathrise a scam. Other posts and comments, not written by me, have called Pathrise a scam and I disagree with that notion. I believe Pathrise is not worth the price they are charging. Debates can be made on whether that is a scam or not but, I do not believe Pathrise is a scam.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Post:

tl;dr: \[\] Even if you don't have good programming skills or networking skills\[, most e\]verything they share with you, you CAN learn on your own, for free or at the very least, for a price that is more justified than the Pathrise rate. \[As a better alternative, I would suggest to j\]ust grind leetcode, brush up on your social skills, and get out there. Exposure is key. \[N\]o matter how desperate you are \[, I believe joining Pathrise is not worth it's price\]. Be patient, you will get SOMETHING. It may not be Facebook, Google, or wherever your friend is going but, if you put in the effort, I believe something will come your way.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I am writing this post:

I know there have been some posts about Pathrise before. I am writing anonymously as a current ""fellow"" at Pathrise. I feel called to write this post because I am nearing the end of my internship search and I feel that Pathrise has not helped me in any way shape or form that is worth 24% of a potential internship offer, regardless of how much I would have gotten paid. I want to help others who are desperate for an internship, avoid \[paying, what I believe, is a high price for the service they provide\]. They seem to have good intentions but are \[charging a very high price\].

&amp;#x200B;

Do all the advisors have strong credentials? Yes, absolutely. Does that make it worth it? No, not at all. If Gordon Ramsey cooked me a McDonald BigMac, I still wouldn't pay more that $3.99 for it. (This isn't a perfect analogy. Yes, Ramsey could cook it in a special way or something but, this is just to help get my general point across.)

&amp;#x200B;

* I understand that no part of the agreement between Pathrise and myself guarantees me an internship or job.
* I understand that I am responsible for doing a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of internship searching and application.
* Nothing they say or do will make you better software engineer if you don't put in the work. The thing is, \[most\] everything they say or do can be found online thus rendering this service a waste of money. \[It is possible that there is some knowledge you may gain and find useful if you are not active or inexperienced in the CS career sphere.\]

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I feel that Pathrise has not held up their end of the bargain\[\]. If I did manage to land an offer, I would say Pathrise had no contribution to helping me land that offer. The advice they offer is generic and can be found online. They, at least my advisor, is mostly unresponsive, ignoring my messages days at a time. \[The average response time was approximately 24 hours. However, the range of response time varied from a couple days to just a few minutes. I do understand that Pathrise is working to grow and that its possible my advisor became busy enough to not provide me a response under a reasonable time frame. But, I believe that understanding the situation and accepting it as acceptable are two different things, however.\] My requests for referrals were either ignored or redirected with suggestions for cold-emailing along with more generic advice. I would go so far as to say, \[most\] everything they teach and ""advise"" can be condensed into a small book or medium post \[\].

&amp;#x200B;

I will source and add to the material from u/SCP_ru2ite's post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ak8y1s/opinion\_on\_pathrise\_worth\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ak8y1s/opinion_on_pathrise_worth_it/)

""What is Pathrise? From their website, ""It is a career accelerator for students and young professionals that is free until you're hired."" Accelerate your career for free until you're hired. Here is a brief list of what their program offers:

* 1-on-1 meetings for coding/product/behavioral interviews (this is their most useful offering. However, definitely not worth any rate they offer)
* Info on resumes and online profiles. (the advisors will just nitpick and point out super minor things to make it seem like they know what they are doing + they won't say directly to lie, but its implied to embellish your accomplishments)
* Info on networking. (also useless. main idea: get yourself and your resume in front of as many people as possible)
* Info on interview preparation. (leetcode. leetcode. leetcode. seriously, they just use leetcode problems too. many interviews will also just leetcode problems)
* Info and assistance on salary negotiation. (you can't negotiate as an intern. they will say you can try but, lets be real, you have no power as an intern. Especially if you end up at a big tech company. )
* Assistance with referrals. (this was their biggest misrepresentation. i asked several times for referrals. they flat out ignored me or changed the subject)
* Weekly programming sessions. (leetcode. leetcode. leetcode. go to the discuss section of questions if you want to get in-depth explainations)

&amp;#x200B;

As of January 26th, 2019, listed are the percentages you must pay for a full-time position or an internship.

A Full-time position requires ""9% of the salary of 1-year income throughout six months.""

A 6-month internship requires ""12% of income throughout employment.""

A 3-month internship requires ""24% of income throughout employment.""

Consider an untaxed income of $41,600 a year, respectively $3,467 a month and this is what you would pay.

$41,600 \* 0.09 = $3,744 (for a full-time position)

($3,467 \* 6) \* 0.12 = ($20,802) \* 0.12 = $2,496.24 (for a 6 month internship)

($3,467 \* 3) \* 0.24 = ($10,401) \* 0.24 = $2,496.24 (for a 3 month internship)

~~that internship pay rate is probably what pulls in the most money not because its the highest percentage but, because many of the ""fellows"" are looking for internships and those in the internship search, are the most desperate for help hence, why they joined Pathrise.~~

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: according to u/mavenform, Kevin Wu, the CEO of Pathrise, ""Interns make up &lt; 20% of our cohorts, have the lowest average salary given their experience level, and have the lowest equivalent annualized income share (6%)..."" - [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aze8jw/pathrise\_a\_warning\_sourced\_from\_an\_internship/ei810f8](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aze8jw/pathrise_a_warning_sourced_from_an_internship/ei810f8)

This however, is sourced directly from him.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I joined Pathrise:

I joined Pathrise at the start my junior year and I've been in the program for 2+ months. I am not disclosing the exact month duration to avoid doxing myself.

To give some context, about who I am while maintaining anonymity:

* I go to one of the top public universities in my state and it's CS program is ranked in the top 20 of the US
* I am currently a third year student
* I would say I am roughly average (now) in terms of my software engineering skills.

Since I go to a high tier university, many of my friends, even during freshmen year got internships. I wanted to perform at the same rate as my friends, so I tried applying to internships. I had, at the end of my freshmen year, done 150+ online applications, 3 career fairs, sent roughly 300+ emails to recruiters, engineers, and managers, talked in-person to dozens of engineers, gone through 5 interviews and I still came up empty handed. Of course, this made me desperate so when Pathrise came around, touting their ""90%"" offer rate, with 10% increase in pay through negotiation, and what seemed like a great support infrastructure, it seemed like a sign from God if you are into that kind of thing. So I signed up, I interviewed and did all the steps to become a ""fellow"".

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

When they first contacted me, the idea of just having an internship was all I cared about. Giving away 1% short of a quarter of my income was overshadowed by my fear of missing out (since most of my friends had one under their belt). It wasn't until about a month into Pathrise that I realized I have been shafted. 24% of anything is a big portion gone especially when you consider the fact that is pre-tax. So depending on where you end up working, you could potentially lose roughly half your income in total after taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I could just let this all go, wait until the contract expires and be on my merry way but, I hate when people get taken advantage of. I am seeing some of the fellows start getting offers and it drives me nuts thinking that they are going to pay upwards of $3000 for what was essentially a resume revision, a few practice behavioral interviews, and generic advice which can be found anywhere online.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to warn other internship seekers who may be in a similar position and mindset as I am (this why I provided some context as to who I am and why I joined pathrise) to avoid locking themselves in a contract, getting a great internship, and then paying a\[n overpriced\] rate when they were already qualified to have that internship without Pathrise's help. They just need some more time to develop their skills and more exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

\[It should be noted that I did not notify anyone at Pathrise about my dissatisfaction before writing this post. I believe it shouldn't be necessary to file a complaint in order to get the advisor's attention. Especially when I could potentially pay them and Pathrise a portion of my income, so I don't really know if they would've made significant efforts to improve my experience if I told them. It's possible that I could have had a better experience if I brought my dissatisfaction to a staff member at Pathrise but I chose not to do so because again, I believe it shouldn't be necessary given the rate of the income-sharing agreement.\]

&amp;#x200B;

Other things to note about Pathrise:

They offer access to a Leetcode premium and various [educative.io](https://educative.io) courses through a single shared account. I get it, it'd be costly to pay for a Leetcode premium for every fellow. It just seems lazy to make everyone use a shared account. At least put in the effort to copy the question and write a solution and an in-depth explanation to premium questions on the Pathrise curriculum homepage. This still wouldn't make Pathrise worth it\[, in my opinion\]. I am pointing this out to show how \[\] Pathrise sources \[some of\] their material rather than produce their own curriculum. \[Please note, there are some portions of the curriculum which I believe to be original content, produced by Pathrise. It is unfair to say to that ALL content is sourced online. From my perspective, there isn't enough original content to justify the Pathrise rate.\]

&amp;#x200B;

\[Personally, I find the price of Pathrise to be too high. They are still a young service and have lots of room to grow. During my participation in Pathrise from late 2018 to early 2019, I felt Pathrise didn't provide a service worth the price listed in the income-agreement. Understand that Pathrise does have something to offer. What you are willing to pay for that is entirely up to you.\]"

Background info:
I am currently studying abroad and can't get my laptop to start working again. It happened a couple of days ago when my laptop froze and I decided to turn it off by pressing the off button. I would bring it to tech support, but I do not trust the tech support shops here (heard stories of them just selling stuff foreigners bring in for repair).

I have posted pictures of my screen to imgur here: http://imgur.com/gallery/mosnDZI

It is in Dutch (cannot change that now, I have translated each screenshot to English in the description of each photo)

The issue:
When I start my computer, it tells me I have to start Automatic Restore due to an error. After letting it run for a few minutes it tells me that the issue cannot be fixed with Automatic Restore. I have tried every option (except restore to store setting as I would lose all my files). Every option gives me an error except one: System Recovery

System recovery actually starts up a process; it tells me I can revert to an earlier version which would be fine as it's from only two days ago. However, this eventually brings me to an endless loop and does not solve the issue (see also the photos I have posted in the imgur link); these will show clearly what the problem is.

I backed up everything before I left. The files I am concerned about are the ones I need here for my internship (I could not back those up due to their large size and the pitiful internet speed here). If it is possible to save those, it would save me a lot of trouble. For the laptop itself, I would want to have it work again, but this is not essential.

If anyone can tell me how to fix this issue, I will be very grateful.

azgj1h,1,2019-03-10,Is having a creative mind a must for becoming a successful software dev/engineer?,Hyperzhi1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/azgj1h/is_having_a_creative_mind_a_must_for_becoming_a/,"I'm going to enroll at university this autumn. I've yet to decide what to study, but computer science/engineering has been on my mind for a long time. Partly because Im interested in tech and programming seems really interesting and something I would like to learn. As such I've started to dabble into learning some programming.

Im currently an intern at a mobile phone company and have started learning Android app development(XML and Java) through Udacity. Having learnt some basics, I just cant come up with an idea for app to develop, which I feel like you need a certain amount of creativity to come up with. This has always been a big weakness of mine throughout life and school, creativity wise I suck. When we had science in school and were supposed to come up with inventions I could never come up with something. So I have a very primitive creativity.

Now from my interpetation of software development it feels like being creative is essential. Coming up with ideas for software, then implementing it by coding, to me it feels like having a creative mind is really important.

So thats what my question to you guys, is being creative a must for being good at and enjoying coding? Or is it something that you will just get better at as time goes by and you develop your coding skills?"

Without internship experience, he interviewed at several tech companies and got a job at one quickly growing company.  He also mentioned that bootcamp grads were having a relatively ok time since CS was not as big in colleges as it is now.



Right now, CS is incredibly competitive at my university as the biggest major.  I feel very lucky to have gotten one internship, and 2 full time interviews that lead to a job offer.  Is there a chance our field could get over-saturated in the future?"

azkbo0,20,2019-03-10,Homeless developer having trouble finding work.,Animonster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/azkbo0/homeless_developer_having_trouble_finding_work/,"I've been searching for probably around 6 months and am nearing the end of my rope. I feel relatively comfortable with interviews, and believe my resume looks decent enough as I've had it reviewed quite a bit. 

In my most recent run I've probably applied to 300+ positions leading to around 10 phone interviews, 3 interviews, and 1 offer. 

Sounds fantastic, however the one offer reneged for whatever reason. 

The reason I'm looking in the first place is that my current place of employment does not pay me enough to afford rent for a room in my area. I've worked here for about two years and have been homeless for a large part of that (Self-employment taxes regularly clean me out and then work will go dormant for a month.)

As such I do most of my developmental work from Starbucks or what have you. I believe this instability affects the quality of my work and my ability to prepare for interviews. 

I've asked for a raise however because the greater company is not making much I've been denied.

I've applied for other supplemental work but haven't had much luck. It is a bit demoralizing to apply for jobs not related to my degree, but that hasn't stopped me. 

...So I guess what I'd love to know here is how I can remedy this situation.

I'm completely open to relocating, and actually the above offer was in a different state. I'm open to any organization and have applied to private, state, and federal organizations. I have no salary requirements other than that I can at least consistently pay for a room in the area.

I'm also open to finding supplemental work as I generally dislike being homeless, though this is not my ideal solution. That being said I believe my hard dependence on my current income to survive makes me easily exploitable.

Added detail: I've been working solo and remote (Me! A Junior Dev!) since I started with the company on generally older tech (WinForms) and worry that greatly affects my marketability.

-----------------------------------
A little more personal information below.

I grew up in and around the greater Sacramento area of California and later found myself attending University near there at UC Davis.

Around 18 years old I found myself completely on my own. I was lucky to get a part time job around this time which helped my survive throughout school. The job was also unfortunately very inconsistent and seasonal.

As such I also spent a fair amount of school in and out of my car. 
Though in retrospect a loan might have helped, I saw it as simply losing more money or enabling a lifestyle I couldn't afford so I chose the car instead. I was also just generally not well informed on the process. 

The plus side of this is that I made it out without student loan debt, though at this point it may have ended up costing me more in terms of potential lost. 

Although I was really proud of my grades given the circumstances I only managed to get around a 3.0. I also generally worked alone because I was scared of any partner I had finding out I was living in my car. I think this ultimately really messed with my confidence career wise and in general, which again makes me exploitable. 

In spite of this I was able to snag an internship in town which helped me get my job out of college. 

I graduated in CS, got my current position a few months later, and having been working semi-transiently since. 

TL;DR I need work ASAP, and am open to literally anything"

Hello everyone,

I am 21 years old, I am little bit lazy student with 2.6/4 GPA.

I already have a bachelor of Mathematics and currently I am studying computer science at university. After studying 3 years, I have to choose a major (field) to study for one year and half and then do a final study internship at it.

I am having a hard choice (because no option is totally better than the other option for me) between choosing ""Data Science and going to this challenging field"" or ""take a safe path and go to Web Development"".

We all know that there is a big competition in Data Science and I am scared that I don't catch-up with them.

I heard some people say that Data Science requires a lot of hard work, challenges.

**1-Can a student with just attending university courses and spending few hours learning at the internet succeed at this field ?** ( by few hours I mean spending about 4-5 hours each week ) .

The only thing I find interesting about Data Science is Machine Learning.

I like programming, creating applications and I don't mind coding for hours and searching to fix errors. so I am thinking to choose Web Development over Data Science because it's easier and a safe path but then I tell myself that a Data Scientist makes more money than a web developer so maybe in the future I will regret taking the Data Science Challenge .

Hope y'all are doing great. I'm currently a freshman in his second quarter at on of the UC schools. I'm currently an Applied Math (but looking to switch to Math/CS) as I was unable get into the CS major here. The transfer rates are also hell as my school of engineering here is extremely difficult to get into. So anyways, I'm trying to become a Software Engineer. Chances of me getting an internship this summer are slim to none. I'm currently enrolled in a coding course that is equivalent to CS majors coding courses, and I've learned up to data structures and a few algorithms. Then class is going to end on the topic of templates. Unfortunately however, I was unable to enroll in the third class in the series because all the spots were taken. So I'm basically stuck without a coding class until the next school year. So with that being said, what type of side projects would you guys recommend for someone like me trying with the limited knowledge I have? (I have only been taught C++). I'm probably going to join a club spring quarter  but then that leaves a large chunk of summer to work on side projects. I'll take any advice you guys have. Thanks!"

azmlsi,1,2019-03-10,"None of my friends showed up to my 21st birthday party, and I’d like some advice on how to move forward",emminentdomain,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/azmlsi/none_of_my_friends_showed_up_to_my_21st_birthday/,"Howdy, folks. I’m a junior in college, and I’m a theatre minor, so practically every single one of my friends are from the theatre department. I’m a very chill, very kind person and we as a department would be together constantly. This semester, however, I got a pretty intense internship for my political science major, so I haven’t taken any theatre classes or participated in any of our shows after two and a half years of having a hand in every single production. 

I knew I would feel a little left out, but I’ve been with some of these people since day 1, and we are all really close due to the nature of preforming theatre. What I didn’t expect was for them to slowly but surely stop responding to me in group chats and not telling me about hang outs or events anymore. The kicker was, at the last event I was invited to, no one really spoke to me. 

It was a birthday celebration for three separate friends in the theatre department, where a ton of us were going to meet for dinner and then go back to campus to keep the celebrations going. I always like to be early and I was so excited to see my friends who I hadn’t seen in a while, so I got there 30 minutes before everyone was meant to arrive. It just so happened that no reservations were made for our huge group during the busy dinner rush on a Saturday, so it was great that I was there so we could get a table. I was told it’d be an hour wait, so I found a spot and waiting the 30 until everyone was going to show up. They all showed up 15 to 20 minutes late, so I was alone for 45 minutes before anyone got there. When they did get there, they didn’t overtly ignore me, but I ended up sitting at the very end of the table with no one to talk to while they all laughed and talked about the show they were in. 

After dinner, there was a whole lot of drinking (gotta love college) but since I’m a commuter, I don’t drink because I have to drive back home. I felt so bad at dinner and then felt even worse at the party so I went home early. 

I was hurt, but I knew since I was no longer with them for hours a day, every day it was bound for some separation to happen. Then, the perfect opportunity: my 21st Birthday! It’s at the end of February, so I made the invitations at the end of January, and invited all of them. A pretty healthy number of them RSVPd, so I got busy planning for a pretty good turnout. It’s the day before the party- I ordered my cake and had all of my decorations ready for a great party when at 9 pm the night before, I get a message from one of the people coming saying that she and the rest of them won’t be coming to my party after all. They were all staying at school to do tech on a student show that I didn’t get invited to audition for, let alone be alerted that I would have to reschedule around it. But with the food I ordered, there was no way I would be able to call it off. 

So, I wait all day until the party starts, and not a single one of them shows. The only person at my party was my very best friend in the whole wide world I’ve been with since high school, who wants to throw hands with these people. 

It’s been a couple of weeks and I finally got the courage to message one of the girls who blew me off and she said that they were all feeling weird around and about me, so they didn’t know what to do about my party. She suggested I contact them and apologize, on the grounds that they all felt “lied to” because it turns out my major and minor declaration paperwork never made it from my advisor’s desk to registrar, so I wasn’t technically a theatre minor on paper even though I’ve completed the entire course load for it. 

I am very, very angry, and I’m not the type of girl who gets angry. I feel like they all did me very, very wrong and I don’t know if I should ever try and reconcile with them. Am I the asshole here? Or could my distancing myself have hurt their feelings, and they genuinely thought I didn’t want anything to do with them. Any advice on how to go forward would be incredibly appreciated. "

Hey all, I’m taking a degree in Electrical engineering, currently doing an internship with an well-known (sort of) automotive corporation (EE based + R&amp;D) and will be entering my final year of study once my internship ends. I will have to decide on my specialisation in 1 more week and i want to ask for more advice from you guys. 

I’ve narrowed down to these 2 options and wanted to know more about the job scopes of each field  and the job opportunities:
1: Biomedical engineering
2: Intelligent systems and control engineering

From my understanding, biomedical engineering is more technically inclined, designing new products related to and maintaining equipments in hospitals?
System controls i still don’t quite understand the job scope so I’m hoping someone who has experience can advice and enlighten me of that field.

My current plan (can be changed) after graduation is to hopefully come back to my internship company and apply for a full time job as the starting pay is slightly above the average salary in my country for fresh graduates studying EE  due to my GPA being mediocre as i struggled a fair bit during my earlier years and I’ve heard that once a fresh graduate gets a job then future employers will tend to look at that more instead of their results. (main reason for wanting to apply back here)

I’m hoping for some advices for my career choices or what would be the best choice of action for me.

Thank you very much!"

azpqdq,7,2019-03-11,Electrical Engineering Student,b3nnybaby,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/azpqdq/electrical_engineering_student/,"Hey guys.  I am an engineering student going for electrical/ systems double major at the University of Arizona.  I'm acing most of my core classes (circuits, programming, digital logic, etc.) but I feel as though I am behind my peers in many ways.  Throughout most of my childhood I spent my time doing sports and playing video games while my fellow students were building PCs and developing technical skills.  I'm applying for internships and some of the interviewers expect me to have background knowledge in areas I do not.  So, I am looking for suggestions of some side projects I can work on or ways to beef up my resume to stand out more.  Id appreciate any feedback."
azprgx,4,2019-03-11,Student with offer. Want to have *other* offers but don't want to disrespect past employers (at internships).,corporate_profit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/azprgx/student_with_offer_want_to_have_other_offers_but/,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone could provide a bit of advice or at least sanity check what I'm about to say?

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have an offer I'm excited about without compensation details. Generally, I've heard that students have a bit more room to negotiate when they have more than one offer.

&amp;#x200B;

**My situation**: I don't have another offer on paper but *very* good feedback from past hiring managers when I was an intern who've said to contact them when I'm looking for full time. My working assumption is that it'd be trivial to reach out and have high odds of a job offer. (This is the case for 3 well known companies (in their industry) for data science roles.)

&amp;#x200B;

**My concern**: My past hiring managers were incredibly nice and invested a lot of time in me. I would personally feel uncomfortable reaching out, acquiring an offer, just to turn it down for the sole sake of having more leverage. These are managers who I respect and would most likely be happy to work for again but I'm just currently more interested in this current job offer.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question**: While I can't throw around my weight in the same way a person with an offer can, I was wondering if this has any weight when communicating with HR about salary expectations? (past companies would provide competitive salary)

&amp;#x200B;

**As a follow up**: the current offer is in the Bay area while 1 past company is in a city with *much much lower* living expenses and the other 2 are in NYC/metro area which won't be too much cheaper but that's where a majority of my friends and family are. Are these also reasonable things to say when negotiating?"

azqdd1,3,2019-03-11,Did I make a right choice in choosing cs?,Aquariaz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/azqdd1/did_i_make_a_right_choice_in_choosing_cs/,"I recently graduated and started working at a big company without internship experience. However, my position is more front end but my time at school was more focused on back end. So I am learning as much as I can about how to program front end and my team is very patient. 

I am able to do the work being handed at the moment, granted it's not really important pieces or features. For the parts I worked on, I had guidance to how to work on it but I felt bad about taking up their time. I want to work on my own parts independently without bothering my teams but I still have questions on how to approach things. The stress of learning frontend as well as trying to do my part without delaying my team is building up. I hadn't had experience working in the field prior and I mainly chose can to try and get a stable career. But I am having a hard time imagining myself working in this field for several years.

Is this just a temporary feeling I am having from the anxiety and stress? Or did I make a mistake and chose the wrong field?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious to see which route would be a better option:

I am currently as junior at a local CSU, majoring in Computer Science. I have to ongoing interviews still (entering third interviews) for a summer internship at local tech/start up companies. I also work full time at a hospital doing ""analyst work"". I was presented with the option to work for the IT department and be able to gain computer skill and being able to list a computer related experience in my resume. My current job doesn't have direct experience with a computer and feel like this would be better for me in order to prepare exit from the hospital field and entry into the tech industry with allowing me to gain experience in the computer/tech field while i finish out my last year at my University in hopes by the time I graduate I can hopefully lock in a tech job. Plus the benefits and pay are a lot better since this would be a higher position, have about a year of experience before i exit the University that what I am currently making and already got reassured by the director that if I want it, I am in, once the position opens up in about a month or so. Any input..

&amp;#x200B;

A)should i stay in the boring field I am in, and get a summer internship and take that route to become a software engineer

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

B) Should i transfer jobs within my current hospital to IT&amp;S in order to give myself a better chance to get hired as a SOftware Engineer. I am aware that IT&amp;S does NOT do any direct coding or anything related to what I want to aspire to be, but maybe it could give me  better chance of getting n interview ( as well as building up my skills and projects on the side) In order to better prepare my entry as a Software Engineer into a tech company.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any further input is appreciated on my exit from University and Entry into trying to enter the software engineering field.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks Y'all!"

The problem is, he is leaving for a better job, and I am the only one in the companies team who knows something about iOS development . He taught me great things, in Swift, but the whole companies project is built on Objective-C and upon leaving, he told the manager that I am not capable of maintaining the project (and I was like why the fuck you teached me Swift all the fckin time). So basically I have 1 month and 20 days left to prove to the manager that I can grasp something in Objective-C and fix some bugs that QA can find in the iOS project. Anything that I try learning in Objective-C seems to me gibberish, I know it is powerful and based on C, but how the hell could I learn it in the mentioned period of time...

Excuse any typos, on my phone. 

I'm currently a 3rd year and I'm also currently studying abroad in Singapore for one semester. 

So here's the thing: I want to study abroad again, but in Korea. Korea had always been my first option to study abroad but their weird semester dates had kept me from pursuing it, which is why I went to Singapore instead (which is an amazing place and I'm glad I chose to go here). 

I'm currently set to graduate in May of 2020. And I want to go abroad the spring semester of my 4th year, so Jan - May. Thing is, Korea starts in March 2020 and ends in June 2020. Grades are due in May. I talked to my advisor and she said if that's the case, then instead of graduating in May, I'd graduate in August. 

That would be fine but... I need a job. Particularly in CS. 
I talked to a friend of mine and she said that I shouldn't go abroad because employers care about your graduation date and there's stuff about legal paperwork or something. So I don't know what to do. I genuinely love Korea (for its culture, not the whole korean kpop thing) and would love to study abroad there but I'm also concerned about job prospects if I have to graduate late. 

Career-wise, I'd like to do something in VR and/or game development. I have one internship experience at a fairly well known company and some research experience at my home University. I don't know if this changes anything but what are your guys' thoughts? Any advice? Does graduating late really affect my job search? "

azy3fw,2,2019-03-11,Getting coffee with recruiter?,Czebos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/azy3fw/getting_coffee_with_recruiter/,"I started to applying for internships in September/October. After months of waiting, I finally accepted a big n company. 

A week ago, a pretty big tech company in the valley reached out and said they’d move forward with me if I didn’t have an internship already. I told them that I was actually all set but interested for the following year. They said to let them know if i was in sf, so I did. They finally asked if I wanted to grab coffee, which I agreed to.

What exactly does this mean? Is this common?"
azy647,11,2019-03-11,Getting a masters degree in something OTHER than CS.,Damarius_Maneti,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/azy647/getting_a_masters_degree_in_something_other_than/,"Hey guys, I'm a fairly greenhorn CS major (graduated Spring 2018) and have been in a (fairly) dead end coding job since about 6 months before graduation (intern -&gt; full time). 

I graduated from a top 10% ranked engineering school but didn't do well with a combination of laziness and personal issues. Overall though, I'm starting to realize that I'm more of a social person than just a computer scientist.

Is there any benefit to me possibly pursuing a non-CS related degree in my free time? I was thinking finance or an MBA, but I don't know if it would help me or if I should just revisit my fundamentals and get good again? Or are there career options that I'm simply overlooking mostly because I am so engrained in looking for a job as a software developer?"
azyauw,8,2019-03-11,Employer claims he cannot pay me my “accrued” salary by the time of my deparature,Amanateee,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/azyauw/employer_claims_he_cannot_pay_me_my_accrued/,"So I just quit my job (&lt;5 person startup) and gave my one month notice (my employment contract elects a month notice instead of two weeks). This was my first job out of college and looking back, was riddled with red flags. This is going to be a pretty long post, detailing the financial issues throughout my employment in case any of it is helpful. 
EDIT: Whoops, forgot to put location. The company is based in California, although for the past six months I've worked remotely from Texas.

My employer, who for the most part has personally funded the company since the start (July 2018) started me out at $2800 a month for a ten week internship period. All payment has been through a payroll he set up with a bank, so it’s all been over the table, luckily. Throughout the internship period, he threw many differing numbers at me about my salary increase in the case that I stay as a full time employee, ranging from $60k to $125k. Nothing ever written but spoke about it many times. 

I decided to stay after ten weeks because I enjoyed the work and had good feelings about the product’s success that I was developing. My employer wrote up an informal plan to start to pay me $6600 a month starting Mid-October (an extra four weeks of my internship pay). I trusted him that he would increase my pay and agreed. Come October, he writes up a more formal business plan that requires me to be very flexible with my pay since this is a personally funded startup and he convinced me that everyone must make sacrifices. 

The plan dictates that I will continue to make $2800 a month until November 1st (another two weeks past his original raise promise), at which point I will begin “accruing” an extra $5200 a month, effectively raising me to $8000 a month, although this accruement will be paid to me in lump sums on January 1st, March 1st, and May 1st. So $10,400 at each of those dates, along with the steady $2800 a month throughout that time. The plan said that at the point of May 1st, I will stop accruing money and outright be paid $8000 a month with biweekly paychecks. Makes sense? I hope so...

So, come end of December, I sit down with him to write and sign a formal Employee contract (yes I know, months too late) and he again changes things on me. He says he doesn’t have the money to pay me the first lump sum of $10,400.  At this point, my employer has already raised $75,000 which I recently just learned he prioritized other payments (not my accrued salary). 

I end up agreeing to continuing on my internship pay of $2800, along with continuing to accrue $5200 a month in addition to the $10,400 I’m already owed to be paid “at the employer’s discretion based on the financial status of the company.” Looking back I’m kicking myself in the ass for agreeing to such muddy words. Along with that, he promises me 10% equity of the company (which is forfeit in the case I leave within the first 5 years). Lastly, at the point in which he successfully raises $150,000 in investment capital, I will stop accruing pay and will just be paid $8000 a month outright. 

Ok, so that’s the official written agreement. Now, I just gave my one month notice because of a multitude of reasons (inability to pay me the money, no longer confident in the product, and mismanagement to name a few). I finish work on April 8th. I said that I expect him to pay me my backlogged $26,000 (5 months x $5200) and he agreed, but also said he doesn’t have any more investment money so he’ll have to wait until he has the money. No set date. 

The entire reason that I stuck with this for so long was that my employer’s charisma, optimism, and excitement about the product we were developing was infectious and I was naive in thinking that things would work out as quickly as he thought they would. Then I learned that he had the investment money and chose to spend it on different things than his employee’s wages. 
Since December, I recently learned that he has not made any more attempts to fundraise (his main job as the CEO) because is so sure that the product will be successful by this summer. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post and I hope it all made sense. I completely realize a lot of what I agreed to was pretty shady and I regret it, but I’m basically asking what I can do to maximize my chances of getting my accrued $26k as soon as possible so I can separate entirely from this company. I don’t want him to push back my accrued pay date again like he has done with my salary time and time again. 

Thanks for reading. "

The position also wouldn't start till May/June so I could utilize these next few months to learn the basics.

azz6v1,3,2019-03-11,Bah... what do I do?,TheN00bBuilder,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/azz6v1/bah_what_do_i_do/,"Hi, I've posted here before and I am familiar with the community (kind of) but I have a question. Sit down and grab a cold one though, it gets lengthy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since June, I've had an internship in the IT department at company A, which lines up nicely with my cybersecurity degree program. Company A has a bunch of tenants within it, and Company B is a MSB in Company A.  We at Company A work closely with and enjoy working with Company B, and Company B also has a lot of customers. However, times have been a bit weird at Company A. There's less and less stuff for me to do there since I started there (as in, only one person is telling me to do things), and Company B is losing some people and gaining customers like nobody's business. At Company A, I mostly do Python work as well as a lot of day-to-day IT stuff, but a lot of my time is spent sitting and learning from one person. I'm grateful for that one person, as without them, I wouldn't be doing anything but sitting around twiddling my thumbs.  

&amp;#x200B;

But, I'm starting to feel like I've overstayed my welcome. The person says that I am not overstaying at all, and I fairly believe them, but it's hard to find stuff to do a lot of the time which leads me to that conclusion. At Company B, I would work closely with the Company A IT team, Company A employees, as well as working support with external companies, so I would be very busy, which I somewhat enjoy as long as it doesn't bleed into my school hours.  But this internship was a friend-of-a-friend sort of deal. Originally I thought it was a traditional internship that ended after this semester, which is when Company B said that they'd love to have me on their team, as they know my work well. I accepted, but later talking with HR, it works out that I am somehow there for as long as I wanted to be (or if I would have been fired)... which is odd but that's how it was. It's been roughly a week since this happened and so far I'm on a course to join Company B. I feel horrible though, I loved working at Company A and feel bad leaving that one person behind as well as the rest of the team. I will also now need to get up stupid early (read 5:30AM as a college student) to get to work on time compared to the fact that Company A didn't really start operating until 2 hours later than Company B. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I will be learning and doing a lot more than just programming, watching other people do things, and little run-around tasks. I'll still do programming somewhat to automate tasks, but I'll also be learning about networking, interfacing with customers/clients, leading people through support steps, troubleshooting network problems, and learning about/configuring VOIP phone systems. That sounds very fun. The one person at Company A said to just do it and soak up as much knowledge as I could while over there, but I feel bad leaving the team after not only being given a part-time job and being taught, but also for leaving the team after this long stretch of time. The rest of the team doesn't seem to care either way though, I didn't do too much directly with them all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

My pay will stay the same, and hour flexibility with college will also be exactly the same. Maybe I'm just being a bit ""noob-ish"" to the whole office job thing (as this was my first ever) by worrying about that, but I still feel bad leaving. Did I make the right decision? At the time with the information given, yes, but after that, did I still have the right decision? I feel like it's too late to turn around but I still don't know and probably can if I want to burn that bridge with Company B. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so sorry for the length. I just need opinions/reassurance on that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading!"
azzbu0,0,2019-03-11,What do HRs look for in internship applicants?,fqGmUjDT2GCAmFqN,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/azzbu0/what_do_hrs_look_for_in_internship_applicants/,"Hello askcomputerscience, I've got a few questions regarding internships. I'm aware of the fact that cs internships are hard to get, especially if you're still classified as a sophomore in college. I've been applying to all these internships, still have yet to actually get an interview. I keep on getting calls for full-time positions, but I know for a fact they won't hire.

I've got a GitHub, and a small amount of projects. Would it be better to include the code with the resume or is it fine? What sort of projects should I include? 

Do HRs actually look at portfolios or do they just look at education and previous work experience?

Aside from CS I and CS II, I've completed data structures and algorithms, assembly, and discrete math. Should I so include the overall GPA and/or the major GPA?

If anyone's willing to give some extra tips or advice, I'd be grateful. I don't have much connections in the cs field so getting an internship via another person isn't really possible for me.

Thanks in advance!"

Thought this month's theme would be a good place to start working on a story that's been banging around in my head for a while.

\[Crackling Insanity\] is the tag I'm going with, but it'll kinda take until the second chapter to really show its colors, which i'll get up on here in half an hour or so. Would love any feedback you have.

Cheers!

&amp;#x200B;

*Log date: 1st of January, 2171*

*For our mixed compatriots of 200 M.H species (52 Sko’ra, 37 Sasquatches, 25 Rora, 86 Harpies to be exact) and the 50 of us aboard this primary expedition, FTL descents will be few and far between for this first leg of our journey. As we speak, we are heading to a solar system located in the Perseus arm, approximately 6,400 light years from our home rock.*

*Within that system lies a planet with signs of life. One of three to be investigated by identical spacecraft, working toward the same end goal: locating the newest sentient species to set off a Pulse, and assisting with Uplift Oversight.*

*Though the exact location of the Pulse is unknown, whichever of these three planets prove habitable for the cooperative species of the Untied Sentient Alliance will be used as primary outposts for the following ships to delve deeper into this unexplored arm of our little galaxy.*

*But what* ***is*** *a pulse you may ask, dear accomplice? Well despite what the prefabricated pretense of our little soiree into the cosmos may be, I’ll give ya a taste of the bigger picture.*

*See, the Pulse of our own wasn’t just the first jump towards our lovely post-scarcity utopia, bloody as the lead up was. It was also the reason why our Mythical Humanoid brethren ended up on earth; the force behind us playing them so well at their own game, that they simply had to acknowledge us as worthy of joining their little galactic collection club. But it was never about the Pulse its self, no no no, not even the Zero-State crystals that caused the pulse that they, and now by extension we, are heading out for. Its more complicated than that, much more. But since this is just a formal letter of introduction, I'll try to keep it short.*

*The pulse made Kana, Ara, Ragan, and more importantly* ***me,*** *what we are. What I used to be, at least. And what would that be exactly? Well given your line of work, I’m sure our mutual friend Gest has mentioned us quite a bit during your tutelage. For we are none other than the prominent figureheads of humanity.*

*The Valkyries!*

*Though there are still some unsavory religious fanatic types out there that may still refer to us as angels and deities and whatnot… but you’re not really one to follow that type of persuasion, are you?*

*It was a wonderful thing in its own right. You get a substantial boost to your lifespan, increased vitality, and wonderful floaty-floaty wingy bits that look like shards of hardened light.*

*But things get muddy once you understand that all those shiny features go by another name. The oh-so-unimaginatively named Valkyrium, also unofficially dubbed: “the scifi-powering element!”.*

*But I’m sure you’ve been privy to the truth behind that for a while now eh, dear accomplice?*

*So try to stay with me now: if aliens invaded earth to get their hands on our sweet sweet goodies, and we showed them how ridiculously proficient we can be with said sweet goodies, and we just discovered a new planet with more of said goodies, which we now have a rather insatiable taste for; as we are the new kids on the galactic block… What exactly do you think we, as a newly roided-up planetary society, would do?*

*Well, if you’ve read your pre-uplift earthly history, you’d know exactly what’s in store for whatever “uncivilized” folk we will inevitably come across.*

*That’s why our good friend Gest had you working with her on our newest valkyrium-fueled drives for the majority of your engineering career. Why she got you the position on this ship with said drives, and why she handed* ***me*** *over to you in a little box outfitted with a pretty golden ribbon, and more counter-scan tech built into it than the old pope’s hard drive.*

&amp;#x200B;

*We’re on a mission of our own. Here to do one thing, and one thing only.*

&amp;#x200B;

*We’re going to save them, from us.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For Reg, sleep was always something that came naturally and easily. From the vast expanse of his old employer’s manufacturing line to the comparatively tight work space deep within the Fafnir II’s core, time could always be found for additional shut eye if one was motivated enough.

However, waking up was another matter entirely, which is why a physical copy of that first log always found its way into Reg’s front pocket; despite the risks it might carry. It was his own personal mantra of sorts; a motivational tool better than any synthetic shot of espresso could ever do to jumpstart his brain.

Reg’s current resting placement in one of the core room’s few descent pods afforded him an additional motivator though, in the form of an equally food-fixated maintenance crew. The heat of the chambers generally called for occupation by Sko’ra, heat loving lizards that they are. That or the salamander-like Rora, whose water-filled terrestrial suits allow for a more comfortable buffer against the unending heat.

But valkyrium-based tech of the level that FTL engines occupy are demanding at best, and downright uncooperative in the worst cases. That’s why Reg, the human, is included in the roster. In a field of engineering more akin to an art than a science, his position is more on par with a conductor’s leading an orchestra. One whose misplaced notes and rhythms could cause issues ranging from sub-par travel speeds to warp-skips: an infamous phenomenon that plagued lighter exploration-class ships, resulting in unstable jumps that could the ship systems off place.

As it was, all was going well for the last leg of their journey from earth. By all rights, Reg should have retired to his own quarters after the ten-hour shift, to sleep away the time before FTL descent. But small luxuries never dissuaded Reg from the duties tasked.

However, the distinct clanking of Sko’ra claws against the poly-carbonate shell of his pod, along with the gravely yet feminine voice accompanying it, was enough to wrest him from sleep that much faster.

“Ey mate, me and the crew were wondering if you could change locations to the commons. Could use us some refreshments down here.”

Reg rubbed the sub-par sleep from his eyes as the casing of the descent pod slid upright on hydraulic pistons, illuminating his resting place in full. He stepped around his coworker Ses, along her uncooperative tail, to acquire his work pack from the affixed locker. He loaded it onto his back, giving her a wordless thumbs up before beginning a brisk walk towards the loading elevator. But as his key-card moved towards the access scanner, the same clawed hand placed itself firmly on his shoulder.

“Reg, we’ve got it covered here. Maybe wait up there until the mess opens up eh? Take that extra time to get us some fresh brew, if you know what I mean.”

Though the shifts were lengthy, they tended to melt away when he was linked into the core, discomforting heat aside. It was the entire reason behind him being part of the roster, directly involved as he was in the development of the core system that the Fafnir line was running.

The upcoming descent out of FTL only required a skeleton crew, but that didn’t mean that things couldn’t go wrong. That was why he was down there in the first place. It was a kindness that Ses was showing him during these moments, but it felt patronizing nonetheless. He wasn’t a crew lead like her, though work ethic may say differently in terms of the efficiency of the group he belonged to.

And they all knew that.

And more importantly to Reg’s small but solid ego, he knew that they knew that. And knowing that they knew that he knew that they knew made it all the better, in a rather roundabout and confusing sort of way.

This train of thought always went through Reg’s mind, but as his old mentor had said: good work should go without saying. So as a matter of efficiency for dealing with this veiled attempt to award a break, he would simply reply with a curt nod and accept it for what it was.

And so with the small ritual completed between the two, he stepped into the empty elevator and tried to ignore the extravagant wink that the Sko’ra were able to produce, as the doors closed between them.

*“Offplanet log 127: time aboard the S.S Fafnir has been going along without a hitch. Tethering to the FTL control is now fully complete, breach security has had a whoppin’ 1 flag raised on account our rather… extravagant actions within the system since launch (approximately 1 flight year), core integrity fluctuates as damn well much as we want it to, and staff files are 100% accessible, netting us a whopping 3 continuous years worth of back-to-back media for our own viewing entertainment.”*

“I really wish you’d cut it out with the audio logs, Cerrus”. Reg said, or thought, to the Human Intelligence unit safely stowed away in his pack.

“not like you need to vocalize every thing that pops into your head over the tether”.

*“well when you’ve been around as long as I have, its nice to have someone else to bounce thoughts off of every now and then.”*

Reg interrupted his countdown of the second minute it took to reach the common staff floors, fighting the groggy dregs of pre-REM sleep.

“Now and then being a very conservative description. I’m going to get ready to strap in near the mess hall.”

He took a moment to survey the sparsely-occupied hallway once the elevator doors parted, resting on the retracted doorway. “You need anything before descent?”

*“well I’d like you to go over the above info in case anything is out of whack.”*

Reg sighed. “Once again, the SS prefix is for steam-powered ships, which are an outdated concept. And we are aboard the Fafnir II specifically. Also its been one year and one month, September 24th to be exact… Don’t you have a clock app or something?”

*“yeah but I stopped it to save on RAM.”*

Another audible sigh escaped Reg as he slumps onto his favorite doorway for moral support.

“every day you say something that completely confounds me.”

*“its uhhh… complicated. You’re not actually gonna go through with Ses’s little errand are you? Running coffees like an underpaid intern again?”*

Reg departed from the safety of his corner, beginning the short walk to crew common areas, weaving through the other shipmates preparing to leave FTL travel.

“Yeah, why not? my end of preparations are done. We have another 6 hours to look forward to down there, on top of the 10 we just finished. And I’m starving.”

*“Wow, really? Didn’t feel that long at all.”*

“Well maybe if you had some sort of timekeeping running, you’d be more up to date.”

Cerrus stayed quiet for a while after that, allowing for a brief moment of peace within the common’s hustle and bustle as Reg made his way to the briefing room. A few others had taken up similar positions as himself, commandeering some of the room’s descent chairs nearest the cafeteria. They were designed both for facilitating meetings and as braces for FTL descent, though they made for comfortable lounge chairs, apparent from the handful of scattered crew fast asleep inside.

“I guess time’s subjective for someone in your state though?” Reg asked after settling in.

*“That’s true, but not really the um, issue… I just don’t like having something around telling me how much of it has passed. I had enough of that back when, well…”*

“Right, sorry. Gest mentioned that every time the got back. Aside from her, you were locked down for what? 50 years?”

*“And 32 days, 16 hours, 35 minutes. That’s not including the 2 years, 235 days…”*

“you get the picture.”

“Rough…Wait, if you weren’t wanting to keep track, then now do you know timing that exactly?”

*“They put a fucking digital clock on the wall, my dude.”*

Reg couldn’t help but smirk at that. He already could feel work’s toll lulling him away, and with another 6 straight hours to look forward to after descent, he found himself feeling just a little gratitude towards Ses. Especially with the promise of a hot meal waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

An hour or so later found Reg wrapping up his habitual reading of Cerrus’s first log, folding it into a crisply-creased square and returning it to his coat pocket. Now descended out of FTL, the Fafnir II would find itself somewhere within the new solar system of their destination, though at a safe distance away from any planetary bodies. This heralded the beginning of their real work: setting up the base colony. This part of the affair would bring opportunities to find allies for his and Cerrus’s cause, laying the groundwork for when they finally discover the latest species to join their ranks.

But there was a more important event to attend before any of the difficult details should be thought of.

Namely: food.

With most of the others catching some additional shut eye while intercom messages played out and the edible compilers warmed up for operation, Reg stood front and center in the queue waiting patiently. Five different planetary cuisines were available on-board the ship, and it was always a toss-up between which flavor to go with. Luckily the tether between him and the Cerrus H.I. allowed for more than thought transfer. More often than naught, the grub stalemate was decided by what the H.i. wanted to “experience”.

“Hey Cerrus, I’m stuck between some grilled meat or sashimi-style Rora food. you have a preference today?”

&amp;#x200B;

“…”

&amp;#x200B;

Usually the tether immediately brought up some form of detectable connection between the two, be it stray thoughts or a shallow feeling of his partner’s mood. At this moment however, it almost felt like there was static buzzing about his senses, like some kind of interference.

“Cerrus? I’m getting a weird feedback, what’s going on?”

Reg fidgeted with his pack, more out of nervousness than hopes of making any real adjustments. The intelligence unit was little more than a rock stuck in a padded box.

&amp;#x200B;

“…”

&amp;#x200B;

The static had disappeared, but in its place there was just silence, sprinkled with something else. Whatever it was, it brought Reg a sense of unease. It was like the onset of an ASMR chill, though as the seconds ticked away the sensation only increased and radiated outward from his spine, to the tips of his fingers all the way to the bottom of his feet.

“Whatever you’re doing, stop it! It's hurting me!”

Reg’s vision began swimming with a head rush-like ferocity. His hands went clammy, shaking feebly in an attempt to hold onto the tray. The spine tingling became an all-out wave of force that rhythmically crashed into his body, like the ringing of a gigantic bell that tolled out from all sides.

Then the tray crashed to the ground, and the altered senses disappeared with its metallic clang.

Reg cautiously looked around, only spying one or two stray glances. He moved slowly to retrieve the tray, trying not to pay attention to the few beads of sweat that fell from his face

*“…Sorry… Nice save by the way. Hey do you have anything in the room that you can’t live without?”*

Reg didn’t respond. Instead, he turned to walk away from his place in the cafeteria cue, depositing  the now dirtied tray in a repository on the way. With the practiced ease of an introvert always wary of his outward appearance, he calmly made-

*“If that’s a no, you need to make your way to the surveyor pod now.”*

Reg switched off to as inconspicuous of a jog soon as they rounded the first corner from the commons, heading straight for staff quarters.

“What kind of question is that?! what the hell are you talking about?”

*“It’s uhh, complicated… What’s important is that we’ve got about 10 minutes of free time here before something bad happens.”*

With the hallways still vacated from descent, Reg broke out into a sprint, nearing the last turn for his room.

“Because of WHAT?”

&amp;#x200B;

“…”

&amp;#x200B;

“Damn it, stop! Fine!”

Reg’s key-card slammed against his room’s outer console, taking the moment to catch his breath as the door parted in half and slid away with a slight hiss. Throwing his work pack on the small desk, Reg removed another from the cot’s meager floor space. He unzipped the top, checking the interior pockets and moving to the outer once the contents of each were verified.

“Whatever is going on, we’ll want the micro-reactor and my diagnostic kit. The compiler should be able to handle anything I can’t think of if we’ve got enough time.”

*“Good that’s gonna be the case, actually. Right now, the sooner we can get to port-side the better.”*

Two bulky containers went in a duffel bag, joining the full pack on his shoulders.

“And why is that?”

Almost as if in answer to Reg’s question, a rumbling boom erupted from somewhere in the ship’s center. A moment later and emergency lights emerged from the hallways, blasting pulses of red into the room along with the din of a dozen different intercoms.

*“Because* ***that***\*.”\*

Even with the extra load, Reg managed to keep a good pace through the still-deserted halls. Though how long that would be the case wasn’t something he wanted to think about. The emergency messages didn’t help with the mood either, as he had picked up on three broadcasts so far that were directed to staff involved in core maintenance. That was his job, which was also Cerrus’s by extension .

They were the first to arrive at the escape pod bay, without even the usual attendants having made their way back from the descent chairs.

*“Well we’re a bit ahead of schedule actually. Hey buddy, is there any difference between the surveyor pod and shuttle compiler units?”*

The escape pods were arrayed along the sides of the hangar’s large dome-like structure. Explorer-class ships were routinely outfitted with a few smaller one-team ships for scouting new planets, deploying cargo, and even inspecting the mother ship to help the surveyor pod with maintenance, thanks to their scaled-down EM drivers.

Reg approached the first of three, hurrying up along the departure rails which acted like a less-destructive rail gun to make the initial launches easier.

“They have larger capacity for parts, and can make smaller constructs simultaneously. Though the pod’s is reinforced for- Wait what? We cant even get aboard that thing with my clearance!”

\*“\****Pffff*** *clearance? that’s nothing we need to worry about right now. Trust.”*

With a grunt, Reg dropped their bags, pulling out a small and unassuming wooden box from the backpack.

“I can almost feel you spraying spit from that.”

Reg undid the equally unassuming latch, which disengaged all the security measures to keep prying eyes away, and dropped out a grey diamond shape that he could just fit his right hand fully around.

*“Whatever. Hurry and jack me in, chop chop”.*

Reg placed the diamond next to a port on the shuttle’s diagnostic console, watching as the point of grey material rearranged its self into the hole before refitting himself with the bags.

*“its going to take a sec to get everything straight away. This ship is just one piece of outsourced garbage connecting to another”*

“Yeah because *everything* is the fault of cheap engineering, right?” Reg said sarcastically.

*“look I’ll be real with you, I say the same stuff about the Americas but they at least kept NASA around.”*

That wasn’t a word that Reg was familiar with, but his pondering was cut short as the first few crew became visible vaulting down the stairs towards the hangar. It was mostly humans in the lead, with a few of the more cardiovascularly-fit Squatches intermixed.

“We have company Cerrus, what’s the plan here?”

*“Oh shit! Umm, yeah let me get the door.”*

The hydraulics of the bay door were barely audible over the intercom’s din, and Reg trudged through soon as they touched down.

“You done?” Reg asked, stowing the bags near the large compiler before retrieving the Cerrus H.i. The front runners were beginning to flow out onto the hanger floor, seemingly unsure what to make of a shuttle beginning to spool up for launch; and the single human staring out at them with what must have been a very confused look on his face.

*“Yeah grab me. Flight control now, it’s a key-card so it’ll take a second to morph.”*

“Wait the problem is on the *exterior*? How the hell are we going to justify this?” Reg sputtered as he swiped the diamond from the outer console.

As soon as Cerrus was removed, the bay door began receding back into place, and with a few quick-fire curses Reg followed it in and onto the pilot seat, replacing the H.I into the port. Once  the material made contact, a holographic display appeared from the half-circle structure ringing the seat. It showed all the usual startup information, control prompts, and camera feed from the front, sides, and rear of the craft. On any other flight, most of the display would be considered normal; save for the rear cam that now featured a dozen figures beginning to make their way towards it, instead of the multiple escape pods.

“Why did you shut the doors? We could use some help here!” Reg yelled.

*“Look I'm not gonna indignify your intelligence with a reply right now. But be a dear and strap in. We launch in 6…5…*

“What? Shit!”

Belts and buckles whirled around as Reg affixed the safety devices needed to keep his spine and cranium from twisting up like a wet noodle going through a vacuum hose. And with one second to spare, he was afforded a glimpse at a few confused and terrified crew members that he had spent over a year working alongside, picking out a few familiar faces. Then a sickening lurch of G’s assailed his body, and those previously known individuals, along with the ship, disappeared into mere pinpricks on the display as the shuttle rocketed out into space.

Stabilization only took a few seconds, but to Reg it felt much longer while the momentary weightlessness settled down and artificial gravity began to reset. As soon as his feet touched the floor he was up, taking to the pilot console and smashing a fist on the dash.

“Cerrus talk to me! What the hell are we doing here? Why did you launch us so far away?”

An unfamiliar face appeared on the nav-screen, almost exactly at eye level. It had a cartoon-ish quality afforded to it by the grey-scale pallet, thin angular geometry of the face, with thicker shadowy lines along dark sinewy hair that rested around shoulder level. The whole visage looked drawn-in; like a cell-shaded game character more than a digital avatar. Odder still was a glitchy portion over its left eye, which erratically shifted in both structure and color.

*“the Pulse, Reg. It came from this planet. Right* ***here***\*.”\*

Reg had continually pestered Gest for a description of the valkyrie that she had work ties with. Accounts ranged fromCerrus's persona being similar to grizzled action movie war heroes, to decrepit figureheads. Some even went as far as twisted abominations comprised of more cybernetics than human remains. But Gest always had a way of dodging around the question, never pinning it down to any concrete visage. Though the revelation that was currently staring him in the face, was decidedly lost in Reg’s current situation.

“Then what the hell are you doing? You just doomed the whole plan by blasting us out here! Those pods will catch up to us in a matter of minutes, and the ship will transmit a distress beacon back to earth as soon as they figure out whatever’s gong on in there! They’ll send a fleet after us, and whatever’s down there will be finished before they even have a chance to be something!”

*“Hey hey hey, look.”* Cerrus said, defensively raising what amounted to his digital avatar’s hands.

*“I know this has been a hectic couple of minutes for you, but c’mon, have some faith. I wasn’t just getting this shuttle ready here, I was also sealing off said escape pods, scrambling the relays, and a few other uhh… things. Almost forgot about the actual door until you said something . And as for the rest of em’... Well, that’s been in the works since you first unboxed your little present.”*

“what do you mean?” Reg spat at the on-screen avatar.

*“Well it wasn’t just by chance that the core alarms went off just after ftl descent. I… well, maybe it’s best if you see for yourself.”*

With that, Cerrus’s avatar disappeared, replaced by the rear-facing camera feed. It zoomed in on the gleaming speck of the Fafnir II, until the ship took up a quarter of the screen.

It had been a long time since Reg had seen the vessel in its entirety. At over 400 meters it would be unmistakable anywhere near colonized worlds. The outer shell was similar enough from species to species, but human-made ships such as this pioneered a revolutionary design for the drive core, forming a long spire running through the center of the craft, jutting out from the main body by an additional 50 meters in either direction.

For a moment everything seemed normal in spite of their apparent hijacking of a rather expensive piece of equipment, but then the space around the craft began to shimmer and warp. The telltale sign of a FTL engine spooling up. However, the process was happening far too quickly for a ship of its size; something that should take a good hour was unfolding in seconds. And after another moment, the drive core fired with a great iconic streak of light leading off into the void of space.

&amp;#x200B;

But oddly enough, the ship remained.

&amp;#x200B;

At least, the main part did.

&amp;#x200B;

Cerrus’s face popped up in the display’s corner with an odd smirk. “Brace for impact boyyo.” he said, before disappearing again.

Then the ship disappeared, a blinding flash of light and radiation expanding outward faster than the eye could track, frying the shuttle’s back feed moments afterward.

Reg knew that there should be more urgent things to be doing, other than staring slack-jawed at a monitor filled with static. But as the explosion’s shock-wave hit, setting off all manner of error sirens and jostling him around like a pinball against the console, he still couldn’t pull away. That is until an improperly stowed mini reactor, or possibly the diagnostic unit banged off the back of his head.

&amp;#x200B;

Then everything went black.

I've been taking Vyvanse 30mg for about 3 weeks.,bla_k-,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b025jc/my_psychologist_prescribed_me_vyvanse_30mg/,"Hello! I made a tl;dr for this post. It is below the longer sections of the post. 

Reddit has always been an important source of community for me. I don't post very often and I tend to just brows the site. But, I have made some posts. I was somewhat active on a computer building subreddit. I even posted my opinion about a short story someone had posted. For a while, though, I didn't post or brows reddit at all.

More recently, however, I have been brought back to this site.

I considered looking into if I had ADHD due to a host of school and personality issues. I was persistently anxious and routine tasks always took so much energy that I felt like I could never keep up. I worked as an intern, so I was experiancing ""work life"" for the first time. I also had worked in a warehouse building impeller pumps, but I only held that job for 6 months. I always looked for ways to lighten the mood, or add energy and excitement to an otherwise dull office environment. If I didn't, I would be bored out of my mind. 

Im am also attending a University for my main source of education. I have been in College for One and a half years. Classes have gotten harder, and found that I could not keep up. I have failed a couple of classes multiple times. I am now a guest student at a local university trying to catch up. So far I have not made much improvement with my academics, though. 

Three weeks into the guest University semester the psychiatrist that I visit prescribed me Vyvanse. I have been prescribed Paxil 10mg in the past to help move along through some depression issues I was having. It never did much, but it seemed to help me bounce back more quickly from the depression. My depression was coming from my habits during college semesters. Long story short, consuming alcohol did not make my mind feel any better. There are other subreddits for positive and healthy alcohol advice. I only mention it because of the effect it had on any psychological therapy or counseling I participated in; First I was depressed. Then, I was considered to have Bi-polar disorder. Now, after about a 6 to 8 months, I have been authorized by my doctor to consume Vyvanse 30mg. I had to overcome many other self inflicted issues before I could get back to working on my focus. 

Vyvanse has been the only drug, other than caffeine, that seems to really help me. I do not drink caffeine anymore, though. I even quit caffeine immediately when I switched to Vyvanse.

So what have I learned so far while taking Vyvanse? I like rhythm in music more than I ever have. Also, I seem to be more active when I communicate; thoughts, emotions and feelings do not get lost as I converse with someone. Additionally I have an unshakable creative nature, and being scatterbrained is not always the method behind art and expression. Spirituality is also very important in my daily life, and it is a source of inspiration every day. 

tl;dr I am increasing my Vyvanse dose to 40mg soon because of the positive response I've had to it. I hope with the new clarity I can push myself to achieve a more stable life. This subreddit has helped me get more active and involved with the idea of ADHD.

EDIT: In the title I typed Psychologist instead of Psychiatrist.

b02ivy,6,2019-03-11,How are some of you guys able to apply to HUNDREDS of companies for internships?,KingOfTheUniversal,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/b02ivy/how_are_some_of_you_guys_able_to_apply_to/,"Take a look at the comments of this post - someone applied to TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO internships - WOW! https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/azmj25/should_i_apply_for_more_internships/


I understand some of you may be attending a name-brand university where 100s of companies come to the career fairs. Even then, I highly doubt all of the companies there are looking for computer science students. Even if they were all looking for CS students, going to all the booths AND still going to class, having lunch, and maintaining your sanity would not be possible.

So like, HOW do you guys apply to 100s of companies? I read a few posts earlier on this sub where people applied to 200+ companies for internships. Take a look at the post I linked in the first paragraph for an example. I just can't fathom how that is possible.

Don't get me wrong, I know that there are tons of tech companies out there. But how are you guys able to find 200+ of them that you are eligible for AND fill out applications for each one? I just don't get how y'all are able to find so many companies to apply to. It seems crazy to me.

I personally have applied to ~30-40 companies. I'm originally from California (currently out-of-state for college) and mainly just applied to Bay Area companies so that I could stay at home, spend time with the family, and eat home-cooked food when I am not at work. I'm still  desparately searching through  Indeed.com for any internship here in the Bay that I am qualified for and am applying to it.

But clearly, I am missing out on something. Some of you guys are applying to 200+ companies and here I am struggling to apply to 50.

What's your secret? Fill me in y'all! I'm impressed and also genuinely curious about how you guys do it."

**DISCLAIMER:** *This is not meant to be a brag. This is here for you to learn.*

I'm an Electrical Engineering student at a small private university in the US. I finished up my first year with a 4.0 GPA, an internship at General Electric for the Summer, and two past internships in high school doing manufacturing and IT. Other than that, I wasn't anything special. I wasn't in any serious clubs (unless ski club counts) and didn't know anything about the real engineering world. So GE was an eye-opening experience for me during the Summer of 2017.

I had applied to 3 different positions at Tesla for the semesters of Spring 2017, Summer 2017, Fall 2017, and Spring 2018.  So there were 12 applications before I heard anything. It was the Fall 2017 semester, a few days after I applied for the internships in Spring 2018, when I got an email from a recruiter. **For the interview, I studied probably 5-10 hours reading up on everything online (Tesla website, news articles, Glassdoor Intern Reviews, Glassdoor Intern Interview Questions, etc.)** and had it about two weeks later. **During the interview I was asked generic internship questions like why I chose my major, a time I had difficulty working on a team, and what I do on campus.** Since the previous semester, I had joined the Formula SAE Electric team and the campus sustainability organizations, but also declared a concentration in Power Systems and a minor in Sustainable Energy Systems Engineering. So I was able to answer these questions with my new college life. He then asked me how much I knew about Tesla and we nerded out for 15 minutes past the expected end time. To finish, I asked the several questions I had and I was on to the next interview. Both interviews only took a few days to setup - Tesla has crazy fast turn-around time.

Turns out, this interview would be my second and final interview. My hiring manager told me about what they do for 5-10 minutes and then anti-climatically asked ""Does that sound good to you?"" I said ""Yes"" in confusion since I had expected a technical interrogation. So I asked him ""That's it?"" and he said ""Your resume is good."" I later figured out that he's very very intelligent but very quiet. I asked him roughly 10 questions so that the interview lasted another 10-15 minutes. The recruiter emailed me an hour or two after (yeah, crazy fast turn-around times) and said an offer letter was on the way. **I've learned since then that this is not usually the case for interviews. It really depends on the hiring manager but some require multiple interviews with very technical questions and others don't.**

I accepted the offer letter and was there from January until May 2018. At Tesla, you mostly work with your mentor and they guide you through the projects and work that you do. My mentor was super smart, nice, patient, and I still talk to him this day. To be fair, **everyone at Tesla is very smart and hardworking**. I worked 60-80 hours a week typically. Like the recruiter had told me, **the work was addicting and I loved every second of it**. **Most internships will give you BS work, but Tesla does not.** It took me a couple weeks to get my feet on the ground (I should note that where I worked, the Gigafactory 1, Tesla did not hire first year students and I was the fifth ever second year student hired so I had a steeper learning curve then most other interns). I learned an incredible amount in those 5 months and accepted an offer to return to Tesla from January to May 2019 for a different team. **Tesla is a flexible environment where you can jump around like I did - you just need to prove that you're worthy of it.** I watched a lot of people crash and burn as much as I watched people succeed. **Like other internships, you get out what you put in**. So currently I'm on my second internship and I think I've found my dream job. But, **Tesla is a volatile company.** Sadly, I won't be able to stay for the Summer because of this. I've seen 4 job layoffs in my 8 months at Tesla. Yes, 4 layoffs. I've also seen colleagues get fired. **There's a great risk that comes with the immense reward of working for Tesla.** Admittedly, I'm not sure if a full-time job at Tesla is the best thing for me. I will try to get a full-time, but not all interns get it (because it's so volatile with hiring freezes, head counts, etc.) and it may not end up being the best choice. But that's a risk I'm willing to take.

To fill in some gaps, I accepted an offer at Intel for the Summer of 2018 so I couldn't extend my internship through the Summer when my Tesla manager asked me to. I went back to school for the Fall of 2018 so that I was finally a ""rising"" third year student.

Feel free to ask me anything about this experience. I didn't want this to be too long so I'll include another post about advice for those seeking internships at Tesla, GE, Intel, and other similar companies - and I can post about those other two experiences if you are interested.

**TLDR:** I interned twice for Tesla and can confirm that it's an awesome company where you will learn a lot from cutting edge technology and real responsibility, but it's a tough company to work for at times."

Did well in one, didn't do so well in the second. I haven't had a call for an IT related job since my second internship. I have to wonder if they are badmouthing me over the phone to the places I apply to or at least saying they wouldn't rehire me to these places. I want to include that experience because there is a lot of valuable stuff I did there that makes me look more attractive. I got more calls with the first internship on my resume last year. They won't even respond to my emails to ask them to use them as reference.

Would you include it if things did not go so well? It feels like such a huge loss because I feel like I don't have a huge chance of getting something else in my area(Philly) without it. I don't currently have a car so I can't get to a lot of places and the places I can currently reach require much more experience than I have. I feel pretty hopeless at the moment. I also am afraid I made the wrong choice for myself. Don't know where to go from here to be honest."

To give some context, I am a student graduating this May with a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems.
 I managed to land an IT internship last year giving me solid helpdesk and desktop support experience in an enterprise environment. This year I was promoted to Helpdesk analyst and was given several projects in addition to the helpdesk day to days. One project included redesigning their asset management system, where I got to clean up a database and identify work processes improvements. I really enjoyed this aspect of the job and want to continue doing support projects in the future.

With ~1 1/2 yrs of relevant experience I don't think I'm ready for a sysadmin role quite yet, but I don't want to stagnate in Helpdesk after I get my degree.

Does anyone have a guideline for following the IT Support career path at my level? Or do you suggest I try to make a jump to a different sector of IT like infrastructure?"

b03oz1,2,2019-03-12,Am I on the right path for IT?,YoSeanE,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/b03oz1/am_i_on_the_right_path_for_it/,"Hey everyone! I'm currently a college student (sophomore-ish) and have about 2 years left of classes. My major is Information Technology, but I have some questions that hopefully someone in the field can help debunk for me.

1) A lot of my classes have to do with coding (C / C++ / Java) as well as other database languages (MySQL). I'm not totally against coding, I just don't see myself being a software developer. I understand that being able to Script is very important, as well as understanding languages to an extent but how much development do you usually partake in?

2) CERTS! Summer 18 I studied for the CompTIA A+ and actually never got around to taking the exam because I got an internship during that study period. My employer said ""Don't waste your time on a A+"", and now that I have some experience in the field I don't blame him. I feel like a lot of my classes in college and the work experience help solidify the knowledge of the A+. I'm very curious about Cloud computing and security though, and have been studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate. I think I'll be able to take that exam and pass by summer, and then I was planning on learning about Linux (specifically the RedHat distro) and getting certified in that. I feel like any good sysAdmin will need to know how to script and maneuver linux, so I feel like that's a strong path. 

3) Work experience. I'm currently a help-desk technician at a small IT firm (internship mentioned above wanted me to stay part time). We have a lot of different clients and we're also a small team, so I'm very hands on with clients as well as all kinds of different software, so the experience is great even at an entry level position. I feel like I've learned a lot about being at the help-desk, but I want to do something more technical for better experience (nobody wants to be help desk forever)! Since I'm interested in cloud computing, I'd IDEALLY like to be a part of some company that helps deploy and develop apps/websites/servers for themselves or clients! That may be very hard to come by though, so what would be the next internship/job to look into for a different, more challenging experience?

I feel like this is a lot, and thank you for taking the time to read this and leave your input! I feel like I'm heading in the right direction, but I would really like to know some personal experiences or some good advice or next steps! Thanks again!"

What are some reasons why people are so happy? I just can't seem to understand. I find life annoying to live. It's just another day I must survive until the sweet release of death. Days I must survive until I can finally sleep forever. 

I don't know what is happening to me. Back in high school I had hope life would get better. But not that I am in college (2nd year) I have no hope. I hate all the work I have to do. I am hopeless about getting an internship or a job. I don't have much friends because a lot of them have drifted away or tried to use me, and now I don't trust people. I can't let my husband know this because he doesn't understand. 

I am thinking of transferring, but how would I know life would be good? I used to be able to focus on work, even those who I hated. But now I do everything last minute, because I don't feel motivated. I am wondering if I have dysthymia. I think I need to get medicated. I feel so bad for my parents for being so unmotivated and lazy. But I just don't feel much anymore."

I got an internship offer for a pretty big bank firm in Canada. This would be my last internship as I’m entering my 4th year. I had already accepted the offer and gone through the background check. I haven’t signed the contract for one simple reason: to hear back from the company i previously interned for. Today i got another offer (interview set up by the VP who believes in me so pretty sure I’ll get the job) to work for the group I previously worked at. I absolutely loved working for this group and will definitely be one of my options after I graduate. The offer that I got and accepted is under a new discipline. The work is actually something I think I would enjoy but unsure if I’d want to stay after I graduate. I’m worried if I decline this offer I’d have a harder time getting a job with this bank in the future. I also see myself working for this bank maybe in the near future because of its global presence and the opportunity to work in Europe with them. What should I do? Is it too late to back out now? Will I damage the relationship with the bank?

My degree was in Computer Systems, and prior to my current job I did a brief internship as a Software Developer. The company that I currently work at is a software company, and the majority of my time is spent doing things related to hosting our software in AWS for clients. I much prefer this type of work to just general sys admin work, however, I am burnt out with having to support software that is lacking in quality.

The company itself is a little bit backwards with the way they want to do things. Simply put, it is just a small company, and for whatever reasons, they really lack the ambition to grow or takes steps to improve their product. Thus, I have been stuck in a role where I have had to deal with many of the problems devops seeks to solve, such as division/competition between departments, long release cycles, major issues after upgrades, etc. The unfortunate part about it is that I have been powerless to suggest or make any kind of changes, even simple things like fully taking advantage of AWS. Just as an example, I tried to get the development team to switch from Visual Source Safe to Git for their version control software, but they still insist on using something that is over 20 years old.

This brings me to my question. I fully intend to leave my current job as soon as I find something, but what really is the best path to a devops role when there is nothing about my current job that involves devops? I feel somewhat comfortable with software development, and with sys admin work I usually pick new things up fairly quickly. I just don't have experience with any of the tools used in devops, or with the different practices/workflows, etc. For that I have joined Linux Academy and I am starting to do some of those courses. Besides that, what would really make me stand out in regards to devops roles?  It would be ideal if I had some projects at my current job I could talk about, but it doesn't seem like that will happen. Are there any specific personal projects I could do that would serve as a portfolio? Any suggestions would be helpful.

So here's the jist of it:

Company was recently migrated from Rackspace Hosted Exchange to Office 365. 

For the most part this went swimmingly, however, shortly after, it was reported that some (very few, seemingly random) Calendar entries on the CEO's calendar were not showing up at the correct time.

The CEO has two assistants. The first, his Executive Assistant (EA) and an Executive Intern (Intern).

Both users have access to CEO's calendar. EA is the primary delegate who makes entries into his calendar for him. It was found that entries made by EA were very occasionally (~1 or 2 per week) showing up incorrectly on CEO and Intern's Outlook. They were off by one or two hours after the time scheduled by EA. The CEO and Interns iteration of the calendars both reflect the incorrect time entry.

Timezones have been checked on all user computers, and I'm reasonably sure this can be ruled out, especially considering the variance in the occurrences (that it's one or two hours different).

It's a mixed PC/MAC environment, and there are also iphones involved. 

To me, it's been a bit of a head-scratcher, and difficult to replicate for testing. Any ideas or leads would be most appreciated.

Thanks for reading!"

Want to apply either to Math or CS majors, haven’t decided yet. Inclining towards Math just because I know how hard can it be with this CS competition

Ethnicity: white, international 

Low-income, cannot pat for the college whatsoever

Scores: took SAT in March, expecting high-tier 1400 (planning on making up for this in May); going to take SAT Subject Test Math 2 and Physics

GPA: 3.92 or something, school doesn’t really count it

ECS: 

1) Created two clubs (Math and IT Club),first ones in the history of my school. Current president of both

2) Created a volunteering group out of my school’s current juniors; we led a few class hours about importance of not polluting the environment; had a few meetings with our principal to discuss this topic. We plan on going cleaning beaches of the Volga river this summer, too

3) Collaborated with my Social Studies and Math teachers while writing research papers, one of which was published in school newspaper and the other one won a region-level award. Math was done with some implementation of programming

4) Internship at local startup

5) Class’s starosta (idk how to translate it, it’s like a head of class or something)

6) Program in Java, Python, know Swift. Have several math-related projects+basic apps, nothing genius

7) Math and CS tutor for all-russian exam (not sure how to translate it)

Prizes:

Quite a few winner spots on English and Math olympiads. English is up on national level (prize winner; city winner), Math is on city level (also prize winner). Lots of winner places on school level olympiads (social studies, english, history). Have a few notable participations on college olympiads. 

Again, have an award for research paper. 

Recs: teachers love me, but I haven’t asked for any of those. I’m pretty sure those will be in 8 out of 10 range.  

I definitely plan on pursuing this whole research papers thing as I really like it. I will try to do one with a college professor. 

However, I’m kind of frustrated. I was and still am aiming for top schools, but I know that higher-tier 1400 is not a score for top 20s, so I don’t know what are my chances at those. My dream school is MIT so heck this is not even close to the score that I need I guess. 


So could you guys evaluate my chances at top colleges and help with finding matches, safeties? I’m looking for any kind of help, would appreciate every answer!

I don't have a job yet, but most likely by the end of the year, I will have a well paying job. I'm proud of myself for everything I've achieved, but to do this I have had to work really hard since high school. Missed hundreds of parties, avoided relationships because they wasted time, not gone on holidays,  have interned or (done something else time consuming  to improve my resume) every summer for the past 6 years, the list goes on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like your 20s are supposed to be for finding yourself, trying different things, traveling, meeting people, and in general having new life experiences. Instead, all I've done is studied for exams, assignments, and internships. I know that having a job and a career is important but I feel like once I finish my masters and get a job, I won't be able to do these things. I really just want to take a year off and travel, maybe find new hobbies (or even *a* hobby). But since I'm here on a visa, I need to stay and work for atleast three additional years, and hopefully get a more permanent visa in that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to make time for other things right now while getting my degree also seems impossible. Every time I try to get my friends to go out, no one is free because everyone is studying, or working on additional projects etc. And then once I know they're working, I feel guilty for not working just as hard, so I end up staying at home and studying (or more likely, worrying about not doing enough).

I really don't know what to do to fix this. Any advice would be really appreciated.

b0c350,10,2019-03-12,TIFU by locking myself out of my house twice in the same week and burning/puncturing my feet,DoogXCV,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b0c350/tifu_by_locking_myself_out_of_my_house_twice_in/,"Obligatory this happened a year ago

&amp;#x200B;

I had recently moved in with my girlfriend of 3 years and was in my finally year of college. My girlfriend had recently gotten an internship at a hospital for undergraduates which you basically just follow doctors around all day and experience what the adrenaline is like. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well its the middle of summer in Arizona and if you don't know this already, Arizona gets HOT. My girlfriend had just left for her internship and I was play some good ole' video games. As shes leaving she asks if I can do some things around the house I.E. vacuum, feed the cat and dog, check the mail, etc. She is usually gone from 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM so I usually do most of the chores (aside from taking care of the pets) at night time and its usually in a rush because I procrastinated way too much. Well today I was feeling exceptionally motivated to make sure the house was clean for her when she got back so I started right away. 

I started off with picking things up around the house, followed by dishes, throwing the trash away and then I vacuumed. All I had to do was grab the mail and feed my fur babies their dinner later. It was a sweltering 115 degrees outside and my flip flops that are usually at the front door weren't there. 

""thats ok, I will be super quick and it won't hurt"" is what I convinced myself.

My girlfriend and I didnt live in the *best* part of town so it was just instinct to lock the handle when you are leaving. Well I did just that without realizing. 

I scurried on over to the mail box grabbed all the mail that was usually addressed to the previous tenants. Slammed that puppy shut and ran as fast as I could to the door as my feet were starting to get very warm. 

I gave the door a quick turn but nothing. ""Damn it...""

Now this is where some of you may be like ""DoogXCV, why wouldn't you guys keep a key under the door mat or under a rock for this exact circumstance?"" 

""Well heh heh, we do. But I had just used it to get inside a few days prior when I did the exact same thing and forgot to return it to it's hidden home...""

Quickly I call my girlfriend to see if there happens to be a second key laying around somewhere but the call goes straight to voice mail because she is already at her internship.

At this point my feet are on fire so I take off my shirt to use it as a blanket for my feet to keep the sun off my feet and the pavement where I am standing. This only works for so long as I am thinking of how I am going to get inside this house. 

I look through the front window and I see my cat sleeping in his hammock and my dog staring at me waiting for me to come inside to pet him. ""You two are **no help**.""

""Ah! I just used the back door to take the trash out to the back alley, so maybe the door is still unlocked!""

I start making my way to the side of the house, open the side gate and what I saw just crushed my hopes. Half dead jumping cactus lay all over the side of the house and the back yard. I look down at my red feet, quick apologize to my feet for the torture they were about to unfortunately go through as I power through the rocks, needles and thorns that lay in my wake. 

After slow and calculated steps to minimize the punctures, I make it to the concrete slab that leads to the back door. Triumph fills me as I make my way to the door, I can almost feel the air conditioning. I turn the knob, just to realize its locked also. At this point I just feel defeated and I want to take a cold shower. 

I know one of the doors is coming down. The back door is glass and from what I can tell is dead bolted as well as the handle being locked. There is no way the front door's dead bolt is locked so that one is the obvious choice. So I have to make it through the cactus covered side alley yet again. 

Before I start my return journey, I take a quick look at my feet. They are the color of cherries and they have miscellaneous needles sticking out of the sides with some broken ones in my sole. I really don't want to pull them out and risk breaking more pieces off inside my foot. 

I try to retrace my steps because there wont be any needles left in those spots, my feet can confirm that.

I make it to the front door, text my girlfriend "" I think there is something wrong with our front door"" Then I kick then sumbich open so hard. Pieces of wood go flying across the front room and my dog chase after them. I close the front door and it swings right back open. LUCKILY, since the deadbolt was not engaged, we could still deadbolt the door shut. 

I run to the bathroom, turn on some cold water in the tub to soak my feet and grab some tweezers. After 30 minutes of soaking my feet and pulling countless needles that I could reach out of my feet. I finally lay down. 

My girlfriend comes home later that night to a broken door and knows exactly what happened right away. Instead of being mad at me, she was apologetic. There was no need for it, of course, because it wasnt her doing but that is when you know you have a keeper.

My feet hurt for weeks to come from all the abuse. 

TL:DR. I locked myself out in Arizona summer heat without shoes. I used the spare key earlier in the week and forgot to replace it. Walked to the back yard through cactus ridden grounds and back. Then decided to kick my front door down because the heat was too much. The cat didn't even wake up."

He is literally the smartest student in our program, this guy is a human calculator/dictionary/etc.. of course he has a 4.0 gpa. He’s also an officer for AIChE and is a chem-e car co-captain, which is a lot of work. He is an undergrad researcher at the college too. He actually does a great job with everything he’s involved in. He’s good with people, which I find interesting because usually people as smart as him are awkward. Like this nerd literally taught himself numerical methods over the summer for FUN. 

It makes no sense why he hasn’t gotten at least a few interviews. He’s ridiculously intelligent, personable, organized, very hard working, has leadership skills and research experience. I just don’t understand why he isn’t being considered for jobs and it’s paining me to watch him lose hope in getting a job. 

I already have an internship offer and he deserves one more than me. I also helped him work on his resume in the hopes that rewording it would make it scan better. He’s tried writing cover letters too. 

The only thing I can think of is that maybe he’s one of those students who seems “too good” or “too smart” so companies assume he’ll just be going to grad school and isn’t a good choice for a program that prepares interns for a full time job.

I really want to help him but I don’t know what else to tell him at this point. Not trying to job hunt for him or get resume tips, I’m just at a loss. Any input at all is welcome and appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you guys so much for your help!! This has really helped clear up a lot of things for my friend and now he has a good idea of what to go moving forward. We both appreciate everything!"
b0darl,0,2019-03-12,Seeking Internship Advice,2DoorSedan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b0darl/seeking_internship_advice/,"First a little background on me. I am a third year Computer Science student at a top 10 school in the US.  I do a lot of work on health services related to Computer Science.  I have done some work with devices and am interested in learning about intelligent systems.  I recently changed my major from another engineering discipline.  I have some coding experience in the workforce from my previous major.  But I just worked on and implemented a personal project in a self taught programming language.  Brass tacks, I want real coding experience in the workforce before I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto my dilemma.  This Summer I currently have an accepted internship offer at a Fortune 50 company in the Midwest.  The company is not a tech company but I would be working in the IT department as a software developer.  I believe my job would mostly entail of building a companion app in JS and the following

Pair programming to complete user stories and add to a valuable existing software, develop across entire stack (browser, mobile, server and database), develop automated unit tests for working software, review continuous integration build status, preform exploratory testing to confirm application execution.

&amp;#x200B;

This sounds like a pretty general list of SDE tasks and priorities.  The compensation package for this internship is 20 ish an hour plus housing paid for.  I think that this internship is a safe option to get more experience in the field but I am not particularly interested in the space, or the location.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently through a lab that I work in on campus I came into contact with the CEO of a less well established company located in California near a tech hub.  First off, I love the location and would love to spend the summer out there.  In my lab, we utilize this IoT companies system to accomplish our goals in the IoT space. I like this because I would be able to better contribute to my lab when I return after working with this companies IoT system for the Summer. The company mission is attractive to me and I believe that the work that I would be doing would be useful and interesting.  I have a conversation scheduled with CEO next week.  I need to create a list of questions I need answered to know if I want to move into the position.  This is what I have thought of so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Compensation - Obviously, I need to know what type of compensation I can expect.  My question for you all is what is a reasonable hourly wage to ask for at this company?  I would have to make enough money here to cover housing and have money saved to pay for school in the Fall.  I don't know what housing prices are like in the SV area. I am willing to slum it for a Summer if necessary but, I still need to put a roof over my head.  **What can I expect summer intern housing to cost in Silicon Valley? What can I expect summer intern hourly compensation to be like in the valley?  Especially at a similar company that is established but, not doing gangbusters like a big N.**  Something that scares me about this, I found a previous interns review of the company and while they loved working there (not doing CS) they were only compensated in stock. In a private company....

&amp;#x200B;

Tech Stack and Responsibilities - I want to work with a relevant tech stack.  I believe I would be working with Python creating backend intelligent services.  But, I want to make sure that I won't be wasting an important Summer that could be spent learning JS at my other offer.  **What sort of questions should I ask to make sure I will be doing relevant and important work at the company in question?**

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any other questions I should ask to gauge the viability of a potential offer from this company please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude//TL;DR:   I have accepted a ""safer"" offer with a really large company in a location that I am not expressly interested in.  Should I hedge my future bets by working here and getting an average experience with average compensation?  Or should I take a chance with a company in a much cooler location, that I am much more excited about at the risk of having a less well established internship program.  Which of these options seems better for my future career prospects?  Am I overthinking this entirely?  What does comparable compensation in the valley even look like?  I know its way more expensive to live in California."

We also have video calls sometimes on webcams for when people are wfh. 

I lose 25 hours commuting a week. Getting to work every day takes 2.5 hours one way. I leave my house at 7:20, and I don't get back until 8:45pm(or 20:45)

I started as an intern during the summer of 2017, and started full time after I graduated college during summer of 2018.

I really like coming to work, and I enjoy being a part of the team, and I enjoy what I do and the people I work with. 

However, the commute has been draining. It's not that I have a poor work ethic, which is why asking this pains me so much, but the commute time really takes away from being to improve my skills and knowledge so I can grow in the CS world, focus on personal goals, do hobbies, and see friends and family.

I would like to WFH 2 days a week so I can get a better rest and also be able to focus on goals.

How do I ask my boss this without seeming like I have a bad work or team ethic? Because that's completely untrue but I have to if I want to be able to focus on improving myself.

He's a nice guy and understands my commute, but he also has strong feelings on making sure everyone has a high team ethic.

I would be willing to be flexible and even come in on scheduled days where I should be wfh

I've been looking for new jobs and I really don't want to leave, and I hate this is the only reason why I am searching for a new job closer home. But if this can be accomadated I would be willing to stay longer. "

b0gb59,1,2019-03-12,Finishing Contract - do I walk or accept the foreseeable full-time offer?,immiserablebutimtryi,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b0gb59/finishing_contract_do_i_walk_or_accept_the/,"Hi, first time poster here.

So in short, my contract ends at the end of this month. It was 4 months, sort of an apprenticeship/paid internship inside sales role at a small startup. Essentially I’m a BDR who handles other operational roles in the company as needed. These roles have changed and increased over time it’s a startup with 10-15 employees.

In two weeks I currently plan on walking away. Sales, or at least corporate B2B sales, isn’t really for me... at least in this industry. I’ve become more miserable overtime here, but at no fault of the company or employees, it’s just really really really not my thing.  I’ve become lazy because of the lack of passion/motivation. It feels like everything is forced, and I’m doing the minimum effort with everything which is not the minimum expectation at a startup.

On the contrary, the company is growing rapidly. They are backed by some very prominent names, will soon be approved for third round funding, and certain teams have grown multiple members since I’ve worked here. Based on my negotiations at the end of the month, a full-time offer could come around just in time for more rapid growth and expansion to new markets. This doesn’t change how miserable I am here. I was never a corporate person, and took a leap of faith by even applying for a job in this realm. 

So Reddit, Where should I put my priorities? Do I take the full-time offer, be fuckin miserable and stressed for a year or two and reap the benefits? Or do I leave to get a job that will be better for my mental health and create more stability in life but without imminent growth? I’ve flip-flopped a lot depending on the day or even hour. For reference, today  i feel like I want to walk away. I’m now 13 work days from that final decision. Pls help


TL;DR
Contract at first sales job ends in 2 weeks. I hate sales and I hate it here to the point of it effecting mental health...BUT they’re a rapidly growing startup backed by names and most of you know, third round funding but still early-growth stages. What do? "

About me:

- Sophomore CS student at rank ~50 state school

- GPA: 3.9/4.0

- Did all of this interviewing before taking Data Structures &amp; Algorithms

- No projects or organizations outside class

- One IT internship summer of my freshman year

- Did not apply to any internships intended for freshman/sophomores. All interviews/offers were for SWE.

So how'd I prep for interviews you ask? Literally just LeetCode, probably 70 problems in all. Starting with the highest acceptance rate, I struggled through the problems, trusting the process. If I couldn't figure it out within an hour, I'd look at the solution and come back to it. If I didn't know what a concept was, I'd look it up on YouTube (mycodeschool is the best). Also bought CtCI and skimmed through it. I did a lot of the problems with friends at my internship, which made it more tolerable. 

90% of my interviews are offers were from my school's career fair. I found that most online apps were shots in the dark, or they would send you an insanely hard coding challenge (Two Sigma, DRW, Jump, Dropbox)

Anyways, feel free to ask me any questions, and here are the stats:

- **Applied:** 100+ 

- **Coding Challenges:** 20+ 

- **Interviews:** 11

- **Offers:** 7 (2 Big 4, 1 IB, 1 fintech)

The interviewer for the first one called me and said I was denied but offered to be a recommendation for other companies (when I followed through he ignored my email). The most recent mentioned that even though I interviewed very well I was passed up on. 

My internship last summer was very unstructured (first time having an IT intern) and the IT team had very little time to answer any questions I had let alone train me. Because of this the project I had to do was completed very slowly and in the end required assistance from a member of the IT team towards the end of the internship, so I assume my manager may not have the best reference to give me. At the time I was completely oblivious to the fact that I should ask him to be a reference but I didn't and just listed him.

I am growing increasingly concerned as summer is getting closer and have no idea what I would do this summer without an internship and have a strong feeling it would be a death sentence for my starting career post grad.

I’ve been here for a little over 1.5 years including my internship, and have noticed a scary phenomenon in the industry working for this startup.

We started with ~15 engineers in the US. Some H1b, mostly American, and me as an intern. Fast forward 1 year we’re down to 2 engineers in the US, one engineer with 30+ experience, myself, and one engineering manager who works remotely. 

The other ~10 engineers are remote, international (Europe and South America) contractors provided by a software consulting firm our execs found out about. 

So far, our app has been managed to survive: they seem OK in their intellect, and competent ins skills, but I’m 1 year out of college and some of them apparently have 10 years of experience, so who am I to say?

But it seems like a deal of the century for management: they get paid 60% of what I get paid, no benefits costs, no office space needed

So the question is, why don’t, and will companies soon start outsourcing engineering talent like this? And when they do, will the ‘tech bubble’ burst?

b0j5o4,6,2019-03-13,Did my two internships abroad but seeking employment in the US.,hamengkubuwono,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b0j5o4/did_my_two_internships_abroad_but_seeking/,"I did my two internships abroad (Indonesia) in two of the biggest tech companies there (They really are big. Asia-size big.). I'm looking for a full-time job in the US. Would my previous internship location hurt my chances for a job here? Would I stand out amongst a sea of fresh graduates?

My initial thought of doing this is because companies in Indonesia gave bigger responsibilities than what I've been offered here, hence my biggest chance to grow. My family's also in Indonesia so I can spend my summer with them. But I'm starting to doubt that strategy.

PS: I'm a US citizen, studying here in the US."

b0l5c5,353,2019-03-13,What no one tells you when you choose your degree,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b0l5c5/what_no_one_tells_you_when_you_choose_your_degree/,"So the standard advice when you choose a degree is that you should find something you can be good at, which you like, and which also is in demand. This actually applies to quite a lot of fields. But there's one thing no one tells you, which you don't learn until it's too late:

You should choose a field filled with people like you. It will make the job hunting process a whole lot easier once you graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to study Psychology and specialized in I/O Psychology. I very quickly fell in love with the field, I attained excellent grades, and the demand within the field is very high and still growing. Unfortunately, one thing became apparent when I started getting close to graduation: Although I got a lot of interviews, I got nowhere with any of them. In contrast, my classmates who had worse grades and worse resumes in general (in terms of internships, extracurricular etc) would get job offers after a few interviews for similar or even the same positions. I tried everything I could to improve my interview performance - I went to training workshops, I asked friends and family for mock interviews, and I read up on every imaginable preparation method. I tried asking for feedback on my interviews, but it was all nonsensical - typically related to something that was neither asked about in the interview nor specified in the job posting - and I got the feeling that most interviewers weren't comfortable telling me why I wasn't getting an offer. No matter where I tried to look for feedback on what I was doing wrong, I ended up with nothing. Six months after graduating I finally landed a job (even though I had started applying a year before graduating) in recruitment. It was the last thing I wanted to do, but it was something.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while I realized that our clients would reject perfectly qualified candidates for no apparent reason. When I Inquired on why they had rejected those candidates, they'd all tell me that they didn't feel like the candidate would fit in. My colleagues informed me that this was pretty normal, and told me to find some random point on the candidate resume to provide feedback on. I instead opted for honesty, which a lot of candidates expressed enormous appreciation for. Not once did I experience a candidate getting angry with me (as my colleagues had warned me about). However, being an I/O psychologist I also had the necessary skills and vocabulary to explain this to candidates.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I realized that this had to be the reason for my lack of previous success as well - it fit perfectly. Suddenly I realized that I was very different as a person than most people in my field. For instance, I was very concerned with the quantitative and analytical aspect of psychology, and how it could be systematically applied. However, a lot of my classmates absolutely hated this part of the field, instead studying psychology because they wanted to work as much as possible ""with people"". I would also describe most people I know in the field as more mild mannered and consensus (as opposed to competitively) oriented than myself. This has resulted in a pretty frustrating aspect of my career: Interviewing for jobs is a nightmare, and by far the most difficult professional task I face. For my previous classmates it seems to be quite the opposite: They ace the interviews, but are stressed out when they start their roles.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Before you choose your degree, try to meet someone working in that field and see if you have chemistry/common values with them. This will make the job hunting process a lot easier.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit: Made some clarifications on the paragraph about my interviewing experience which I realize came off wrong.** "

b0luqx,0,2019-03-13,Job Terminated - Severance Questions,Lucky_Diver,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b0luqx/job_terminated_severance_questions/,"My job was terminated yesterday March 12th. Technically the job is terminated on the 31st, according to them. I have been told I do not need to show up for work during this time. I have been offered 2 months severance because I worked there for 7 years. I actually might have 8 years since I technically started on March 6th 2011, which matters because that's a threshold between 7 and 8 years that bumps me up to 3 months of severance. I believe they technically counted the internship I did. I was also given a bonus of $4,300 (of which I typically only see about 40% due to taxes). We earn that every year. I also had 15 vacation days left on the year.  The reason given for termination was restructuring. Below are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can I expect something for vacation time? Or can the count the fact that I'm technically not working right now (through March 31st) as my vacation time? They did tell me to go home. If they can count it... can I just go back to work and get the lump sum of vacation time?
2. Will taking severance eliminate me from unemployment benefits? Their brochure says that I cannot file for unemployment while on severance pay, but after the fact they won't contest it. However, I don't know how the state feels about that or what the laws are regarding that. I live in Michigan.
3. Is this a generous offer?
4. I'm not sure if I should be asking about anything else?

Now as I’m going to be graduating next year due to prerequisites and changing my major after my sophomore year into Computer Science I’ve started looking at entry/junior level frontend positions around me to see what all they’re going to be looking for after graduation. 

Unit testing keeps showing up as a required skill everywhere I look and honestly I can’t quite wrap my head around what it is exactly. Unlike with most of my programming experience where diving in and working through bugs and errors until you figure it out, there doesn’t really seem to be a very straight forward way of going about learning it.

I guess, I really don’t know where to go from here. Do I find a good book that covers it thoroughly or a YouTube channel that cover the subject? Any help/advice would be super appreciated."

Is there something I could be learning in my spare time to really impress employers?

If I end up not getting an internship are there an summer jobs that could help me develop and learn skills?

If you got an internship, how did you get it?

Is there something I could do in an interview to really “wow” employers?

b0nkaz,4,2019-03-13,Is it a lot easier to get an internship/co op/etc as a junior (compared to underclassmen)?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b0nkaz/is_it_a_lot_easier_to_get_an_internshipco_opetc/,"I am a sophomore at one of the top 15/20ish CS schools in the nation. Not Berkeley, etc, but a school many recruiters know of which has a good program. (Purdue). I have a half ride with my college's most prestigious scholarship and another scholarship for being a disenfranchised/poor student in a science major with a good GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had 4 internships, 3 which I did while in high school, or the summer after graduating. 3 of them were full time and involved bioinformatics, HPC, etc, a combination of programming and data analysis. 1 of them (which I am currently doing) is part time and involves visualization/Python/etc. I have a bunch of minor experience in many languages from my internships and more experience in Java/C. I have all this on my resume (which I can PM to anyone who wants it, don't want to post publicly). 3 of these internships/research/whatever you want to call it were at local universities, 1 was at a prestigious company in the area (not Google but it is in the Big N of Indiana). I asked various professors and other faculty to review my resume and I have gotten lots of compliments and made some changes.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had a hard time finding a summer internship in college, last summer I worked a well paying white collar job which I put on my resume as a customer service/consulting/soft skills experience. This summer I have nothing lined up for sure though I have had about 6 interviews and I have a shadowing onsite on Friday with a very large company in Chicago. I was accepted into a recruiting website which companies pay this company to basically vet potential interns, I was offered an unpaid internship which I turned down, and I almost got an internship offer from a startup but missed the last interview. In high school I was strangely able to find work very easily because I wasn't really competing with tons of CS majors because I was just a high school student with some programming knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

I have gotten much better at interviewing as a sophomore compared to as a freshman; I have had several successful interviews (gotten the part time job/second interview/accepted into the recruiting website/etc). So I don't think this is the issue since I have a success rate in interviews of roughly 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone said this in response to something I said a couple days ago and I am wondering if you guys think this is true:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Probably because you're a sophomore. Your apps will start getting taken more seriously once you're a junior or senior. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this true? If so should I basically give up trying? I have applied to about 100 jobs, each of which takes a while to do, with questionable success. I know people with similar scholarships and worse experience who got Big N, etc internships easily as a sophomore.

I'm graduating next spring with a BBA in Finance from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (online). My GPA is 3.84, it should go up a little bit by graduation.

So here is where I'm at. I've interviewed for a few corporate finance and financial analyst internships, while I've gotten great reviews of my interviews and have made it pass the first few rounds I've been getting passed over for candidates with more experience. My only work experiences have been in manufacturing, real estate, insurance sales and mail room positions. Being realistic, in the event I can't land a summer internship (have about a dozen or so left that are still pending), would graduate school be something I should start to seriously consider now?

The only companies that I am still pending with for internships are Lockheed Martin (general finance) and Morgan Stanley (private wealth management) and a few random companies. Since internships are slated to start in two months, I don't see many more opportunities being posted (I've utilized indeed and glassdoor and LinkedIn the most).

I have a fall co-op lined up with a financial planning firm in the midwest. The firm does not sell any products just financial planning services. I've considered a career in wealth management but don't think I'd do well, I'm ok at prospecting but I don't have any HNW contacts to pitch to. Also the fail rate is really disconcerting.

Not sure how my job prospects will be upon graduation but if my internship search is any indication its not looking good. I've spread out the duration of my undergrad (left and came back after a few years), I don't feel I really learned any finance concepts in-depth. I'm a hands on learner so studying theory and textbooks really only made me really good at taking tests but applying the knowledge to real world situations is another story. Should I look into MSF programs? Obviously I wouldn't qualify to pursue an MBA.

I still don't really know the career path I want to take. I majored in finance since I really enjoy learning it and it holds my attention more compared to other subjects. I like reviewing numerical datasets, financial modeling and financial planning. I like dealing with people just probably won't excel at hard selling. Like most uneducated money hungry high school students I had a notion of going into investment banking or management consulting for the money but I had very little knowledge of the careers. Upon finding out what the career paths actually entails I believe ai'm severely under-qualified academically, professionally and intellectually.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

Almost all the recruiters I found by searching ""companyName recruiter"" are in some kind of senior position: senior tech recruiter, senior healthcare recruiter, senior recruiter, etc. I found 2 that aren't listed as senior recruiters, one is listed as a contact recruiter, the other, HR recruiter.

Are there any unspoken rules here I should make sure to follow? For example would it be inappropriate to contact the senior recruiters?

b0oijk,2,2019-03-13,Mental Health and Poverty,braziliancrazyperson,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/b0oijk/mental_health_and_poverty/,"Throw away for privacy.

I have cyclothymia, severe anxiety and agoraphobia. I am also a victim of emotional abuse (gaslighting) and racism all my life, in really direct ways.

It cripples me in a way that I can't go to college anymore, I have lost already 6 weeks of classes this year.

It also cripples me in a way that I can't really work. The last time I tried to work (ap/17-ap/18) I suffered emotional abuse from my boss, that humiliated me in oct/18 (also sistematically during the time) in such a way that I became phisically sick for literally 10 days. After that I became increasingly in worst and in feb I ended up quitting. I also changed college because my college was 2 hours away and I thoghth that in a closer college I would be better and it indeed was. I made friends (I didn't have any in the first one) and was fine in the first semester, but lost the second one because I couldn't go and now I have already lost 12 weeks this year.

I also just got the news I get a job, an internship, in a well respected institution that I am very proud to be a part of.

But of course, I am nervous.

One of the reasons I am nervous is: I was NEVER EVER anything above ""lower middle class"" but I also was never poor.

This means that in times where I was worst, I had the immense privilege of counting on people like mom, dad and grandma, to help me pay bills and live in a very simple but confortable way.

Now dad and grandma are gone, my moms retirement income is really low and bills are stacking up. Even with my internship job I need to have some other kind of job to afford living.

I AM COMPLETEL AWARE that this may sound like a princess bitch ""wondering how poor people do it"" but it is not, I assure you. I have worked many other times, have made many many many sacrifices for my family, both financially but also in care giving. I have paid a lot of bills and I know what life is really like.

What I'm saying is: I recognize I was privileged in the help I got but I am also really nervous thinking that if my mental health fails me, it could mean I am putting me and my mom in real poverty.

I am a healthy, inteligent person and the only thing between me and (proudly) supporting my mom is mental health.

So I wanted to talk with people about how poverty and mental health relate. Because what I would ""guess"" is: Does it mean mental health doesn't ""exist"" in people living in extreme poverty? Is anxiety and agoraphobia ""rich people"" diseases? In my mind the answer would be that I am actually weak, because poor people ""don't have time"" to ""not be able to do things"".

I KNOW it is not true. I KNOW mental health is an epidemic SPECIALLY in poverty.

So what I want to know is... What is it like to live with mental health in poverty? How can one cope?

How can a person with severe mental health problem still function to basic functions to survive?

EDIT: I have lost 6 weeks of college... I am quite nervous right now and that's why some dates are weird. I also was in the last for from ap/17 to feb/18. Sorry for the crazyness lol"

Maybe it's because I fell heavily ill for 2 months where I couldn't move from my bed but I still really long for that grad school. So far I have filled up 6 applications but only 2 have been completed as my teachers are taking some time with the recommendations for the other 4, but the deadlines are still at least 3-4 weeks away so I am not panicking. I have already got one rejection from LSE. (very ambitious to even apply but it was my number 2 priority.) The point of all this is that the LSE rejection has really put me off, it was my second choice and one of the only few institutes which actually had a full course for Behavioural Economics, I still can't find many master's courses for the same and thus my application list is more ambitious than it should be and which is exactly what worries me. I never got around a relevant job relevant to my field as it's a very selected field and my country doesn't really have a lot of internship or job opportunities regarding the same and although I have finally found relevant internships, I can't add them to my CV just yet and this is all that bothers me, a weak CV and a rejection from LSE makes it feel like the Statement of Purpose that I hounded for and worked day and night to create something that I cannot find anywhere else and discussed thoroughly with the best Economics Professors in my city and approved as great original and promising content from the same professors. (including those who I don't know) and before I know it, a graduate admission looks like a mountain to climb. I feel like after working so hard and carefully for the application period, I still don't feel confident enough, and to top off everything, I don't' have a job because my Bachelor's In Economics has little to no value in the job market and my internship is going to be minimum stipend too (100$ a month), so I am stuck with no option but to pay for the applications from my dad and I just don't feel right. Here in my country, that's always been the case, that parents pay for your education but seeing my dad not earn any money for 6 years (farming is tough) and still giving me a wide smile when I apply for colleges breaks me. They keep telling me they've enough saved for me to get a good education abroad but they want me to apply to like 10 more universities and I'm not sure if I should be spending another 1000$ of his just to get a generic reply to my application. I believe in my statement and I would sit down and love to explain it to anybody if I get an interview call but what if nothing works out. I have put in too much effort to let go at this point and I don't know what to do, I am just writing this here because I love you guys and how enthusiastic you always are, I really like this sub, I just wanted to vent out a little and I am already feeling better by letting all this out.  


TLDR: I love every one of you.  


Thank you for reading this and take care fellas, best of luck for your applications, it's a long road."

Just gonna say a little about my current situation:     

I started working at a small local branch of a company that has offices in many countries.       

Things were going ok, i got my internship extended from 6 months to 1 year, and my boss told id be in charge of a product we were trying to break into the local market.     

A month has passed and im currently on month 7, and the only big opportunity we had got postponed to december

Im feeling pretty down, as i feel all the work i did to get this going was in vain.     

And if we dont have any business before my contract expires in august i feel like theres no reason to keep me here

This is my first job

Since the branch is pretty small i got to see a little of everything, but i feel like i havent learnt much.

Theres other businesses they want to start so for the meantime ill try to help there.  Whenever i look into a new product i gave to start from zero though.

Ive been handling the data and met a couple of potential clients.

But i feel like i havent accomplished much.

Any advice on how to move forward would be appreciated.  "

b0p95f,4,2019-03-13,23 yr. Brother is metaphorically/literally destroying our home,PRIMEMAN3457,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b0p95f/23_yr_brother_is_metaphoricallyliterally/,"Hello folks. I apologize in case this comes off as a rant, as I am somewhat irritated as I write this. I will do my best to remain calm and objective about explaining what's going on and seeking advice.

For some background: I'm in my 3rd year of college right now. My family and I have lived in the same home for about 10+ years or so, even though my parents had a divorce right after my first year of college. Now, it is myself, my younger sister, my mother and her new husband, and my older brother. We also have two happy cats that have been here as long as we've been at this house.

My older brother flunked out of college and is now working a 2-11 factory job every week day and some weekends. He usually goes to work and then sleeps at home. When he's not working, he's gaming or going out with his girlfriend. He already doesn't really clean up after himself, and he's only just now starting to take on some of his own bills like his own phone plan. Usually we get annoyed when he doesn't clean up after himself, but it's something we can still clean. However, the larger problem is that, in my perspective, he is genuinely selfish. He hardly ever thinks about the people he's living that are providing him a roof over his head rent-free. His messes spread all throughout the house (socks all over, kitchen messes, his room is a mess, etc.), and it can be disrupting when we have guests or just want a nice time watching a movie.

His own messes and lack of respect for my mother are one thing, but his pets' messes. Oh boy. Last year, he brought in two kittens that were very cute and playful, but their playfulness did cause some messes in the home. My brother was hardly ever around to help clean their litter or feed them among all the other responsibilities with raising kittens. As a result, my mom had to pick up after them (as did I whenever I came home from college for break), even when my brother was off work because he'll simply hide and play games or go out with his GF. They were also never neutered/spayed and ended up having a kitten. We eventually got my brother to put them up for adoption. As I went back to college after Christmas, there was a week of peace before he brought in a DOG. I should also mention this dog came from his girlfriend, so I would imagine he feels inclined to appease to her. It's all the same issues as with the kittens, except ten times worse. Now I love animals, but it's clear that my brother isn't bothering to give any of these pets he's had the right type of attention (or hardly any at all) they need, ESPECIALLY for the dog. I'm trying my best with the dog right now because I know this five-month pup doesn't know any better and needs training, but I'm only here at home for another few days before I go back to campus. In the middle of having a job, raising my sister, and continuing her relationship with her new partner, there's only so much my mom can do too.

I spoke to my mom about what's going on, and she's having the motherly love that's keeping her from just telling my brother to move out or to get rid of the dog or whatever. 

I guess my question to all of you here: What should any of us do? If anything this is mainly for my mother, as I'll be heading back to college in a few days and won't be back until May UNLESS I get an internship, which in that case I'd most likely have to relocate elsewhere so there's even less that I could do.

I'll be happy to answer any questions and listen to feedback.

**TL,DR: Adult brother lives at home with mom, doesn't clean up after himself or his pet that he hardly gives attention to. House is figuratively and literally a mess because of him. What should my mother do?**

Edit: I will put in updates if anything more happens with this. Thank you for the advice thus far. I’m open to all advice/thoughts/etc. 

Edit 2: I am back at school now, as I was able to talk to my mother about how she needs to put her foot down on the situation, or at the very least tell my brother to rehome the dog. My brother also wants to put the dog outside but at that point, why own a dog? There’s not much I can do myself now but I’ll be sure to post an update on what happens while I finish my semester. Thank you. "

Finally, after hundreds of applications, dozens of hours spent perfecting my resume and writing cover letters and re-typing my resume into shitty web-forms, I got an offer! I’m a junior BME, and this is my first real internship, and I figured if I didn’t get one this year then I’d just be screwed. If you think it’s hard to get one as a ME/EE/ChE/whatever, then you’d be surprised how few jobs there are that want BMEs lol. 

And it’s pretty ideal for me because it’s in the city I already live in so I don’t have to move, and it pays pretty well too!

I’ve had one phone interview in the past, and one in-person interview that didn’t pan out. The in-person one of those I thought went pretty well too, but then a few weeks later I found out I didn’t get it. 

This time, they gave me a call, invited me for an interview, and offered me the job the next day!

Just goes to show you guys, even if you’re struggling to get a job or an internship don’t give up. I was actually stressing so hard about what I’m gonna do this summer, and now that it’s figured out I couldn’t be more relieved. 

That’s it, I just wanted to get that off my chest! Thanks for reading if you got this far!"

It’s high time I found a therapist instead of venting all this shit to my friends, so here I am briefly until that happens. 

I didn’t get the job again. The dream job - entry level, yes, but like, my IN into the esteemed industry I’ve be working towards for years. I’ve interned there before (unpaid!!), I’ve worked one other internship in a different type of company in that field, and I worked in a related industry for 2 years. I am extremely qualified for the position. When I left my internship there, the “advice” they gave me was to network constantly and be friends with employees at their company and other related ones. Without giving myself away, there are only a few others in my city, but the community surrounding this field is vibrant and jobs are highly coveted. Obviously I could move to a bigger city but I’m stuck here and I WANT to stay here. When I asked them how they got their jobs, they’d always say “oh I was an intern! And I guess I got lucky!”

Seriously, it’s been 4 years since my internship, I can’t afford to do more unpaid ones, and I’ve made friends and networked and it always feels sleazy. I never fit into these social groups and I’ve literally been outcast out of events and such because I’m not “in” yet. Asking for favors, such as someone putting in a good word for you, is extremely taboo (I lost friends to this right out of college, without ever being told why). I had to leave the related field because it only paid $11/hour. People judge me now for being a house cleaner but I actually enjoy my job, I’m respected, and I’m paid a living wage. But like, no I don’t want to be scrubbing toilets forever haha. 

So yeah. Just got the notice I wasn’t even considered for an interview, no excuses listed this time. Fuck my life. Is it too late to return my useless $30k in loans degree yet? Goddamn. "

I will have finished my bachelor's degree (EU/Germany) until then - he will already be in his last year. Currently I am considering to apply for some kind of internship in the same city (max. 3 months).

I would like to know what the specific definition for an internship in american companies is. Is it usual to receive money for your work or are you kind of an voluntary/unpaid worker? What are things you should consider as an international (student)/person? Which american websites are good for searching internships?

I already worked during my computer science studies in an integrated degree program. That's why I won't be a beginner regarding software development - but a 'more experienced' working force. My goal is to work in this city for a certain amount of time and get some technical experiences/language skills (english skills should already be sufficient to exchange myself with other students but I want the interaction with native speakers)!

Yet right now I'm simply learning HTML  from a school class simply to try and have some time to code, and  far from linear algebra, I'm confused about how I could tie math and programming together at this time, or at least prepare. How could I begin to make strides in learning regardless? What studies should I pursue to prepare ? What is life like as a computer science major? What are the branches and the topics you are allowed to pursue?   

&amp;#x200B;

And for work;

How is work like as a computer science major? How are internships like as a computer science major? I'm worried I might not be cut out for it when it comes to a job. While I can appreciate the challenges  of math and programming in the realms of unbridled curiosity, I worry that I will quickly burnout if I might be homeless if I don't solve it before the deadline. I worry I won't be good enough to  compete, that I won't do well, that my coworkers may hate me, or I may not even be seen as good enough.

I've also worried about the workload a 'CS' job will bring (sorry for the odd terminology), what does your job usually expect of you?  What has your work experience been like? 

 I've wanted to keep my studies, but now I have to narrow them down for preparation of college and beyond. I have a few that I've wanted to keep as hobbies or miraculously-freelance part time, but I have no clue if that will be possible in the realm of the industry's work expectations. My preconception is that I won't have this time and  have no clue if work as a part-time programmer will be possible if the industry  does demand 9-5 at the minimum. My mind gets foggier for work as a freelance programmer, is it more competitive? Less competitive? For freelancers, what is your job like?

And generally, has the industry been healthy for you? Is it worth it? Have you suffered crunch times and fatigue? Looming fear of possible unemployment? Have you ever been expected to work extremely long shifts or anything that began to take a toll on you and stress you to the point of affecting your life? Has a job ever weaned you of your joy of programming, and challenges that before might've playfully puzzled you send you into spirals in a job? And if so, did you ever quit/ seek out different paths? If so, what did you do/do you do now?

Thank you, and sorry if this isn't the right place, but I just wanted  to know how things have been like for you. Thank you."

I'm a junior Math &amp; CS major at a top 5 CS university, and I will have \~4 software engineering internships under my belt by the time senior year comes around. I have a few courses I am required to take, two of which are extremely difficult and shouldn't be taken together, but also extremely relevant to industry and a career in CS (they are Systems Programming and graduate level algorithms). I am taking algorithms I in the beginning of the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be interviewing for new grad positions in the fall, and I am hoping to get into a really competitive company. I know most of what interviews are are leetcode questions, and Algorithms II covers topics that really teach you how to confidently solve leetcode mediums and hards (advanced dynamic programming, much deeper topics in graphs, randomized algorithms, etc...). I was heavily leaning towards taking it to have the best success for leetcode style interview questions, but this might be due to me not understanding how much algorithms I can help with leetcoding. I also don't know how common systems programming questions are, but I have not taken systems programming so if I go into a new grad interview and they ask me systems questions I'm basically screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, should I take algorithms II over the fall to get better at algorithms and ace coding interviews, or should I take systems programming because I already have taken an algorithms course and I could be screwed if I get asked a systems question?

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I go, I would take the other one the following semester.

b0t6ff,15,2019-03-13,27 years old college graduate with language skills/international experience that can't seem to find a job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b0t6ff/27_years_old_college_graduate_with_language/,"Like the title says, I'm 27 years old (so not fresh out of undergrad) and I can't seem to find a job, despite attempting to leverage my language skills (fluent Spanish and intermediate-level written/spoken Brazilian Portuguese) and international experience (i.e. in my cover letters, I say stuff about how living abroad taught me persistence and patience and how to overcome adversity, et cetera). 

I have one of the worst B.A. degrees possible--Anthropology (technically ""Sociology/Anthropology, emphasis in Anthropology"" as the two departments were combined at my undergraduate school) with a minor in Spanish. My real passion, though, is fiction writing, though I'm not naive enough to believe I can live off of ""being a writer."" I applied to MFA programs this year and have been rejected from all of them (though with an acceptance rate lower than that of Harvard Law School--we're talking 1-5% of total applicants in both genres (fiction and poetry)--you're pretty much expected to apply at least twice or three times before getting accepted to the places that pay you to write creatively). Last year, when I thought I wanted to go into academia (the obvious path for someone with a ""useless"" degree like Anthropology), I got rejected from all the Ph.D. programs I applied to. Now I don't want to go into academia (except for the MFA degree, which really is just a paid opportunity to work on your art) but part of me thinks that I should get a masters degree (or at least a certificate) in something that would help me professionally.

I'm fascinated by book publishing/the publishing industry and so I'm considering applying for publishing-related courses (Masters degrees, certificate programs or the six week courses that NYU and Columbia offer), but they want you to have some previous publishing-related experience, which I don't have and can't seem to get. I had a terrible time during college, as I was very depressed constantly and it's a miracle I ended up with a 3.35 GPA, because I was contemplating suicide constantly, I was so unhappy. This means I didn't do any internships or work on campus (except as a dishwasher in the cafeteria, but I don't list that on my resume). I studied abroad for a year in a Spanish-speaking country but was also depressed there and that + external factors (like the university going on strike and my sorry excuse for a ""program"" not really knowing what to do with us) made it so that I ended up with quite poor grades from there (luckily, they were not factored into my GPA but they do show up on my transcript). 

Another big issue I have is that I love to travel, and so upon graduating, I wanted to GTFO as soon as possible. I ended up spending 3 years of my life living in a Latin American country. I enrolled in a Master's degree program there (also in Anthropology because I didn't have any idea of what else to do) and long story short, I was fine in the classes (I did quite well in them for a non-native Spanish speaker, as the entire program was completely in Spanish), but it was damn near impossible to find a way to support myself (this is a country with a very volatile economy and economic situation), so gaining any real work experience beyond ""freelance English tutoring and translation"" was difficult to say the least. I managed to get a temporary, semester-long gig for a US based study abroad company but that was basically it. Upon returning from Latin America, I got a temp job (badly paid, basically no benefits) and I worked at that for a year (but was very unhappy), before moving home with my family, where I currently am. 

Currently, I'm living at home and working remotely, as I used to work food service in town but got fired due to my bad social anxiety. 

My dream is to be able to live in a big city, either in the US or in Europe, with a job that pays me enough to live on with good benefits and also pursue my writing. That or get into an MFA program in the next couple of years. I guess I'm just at a loss on how to go about doing this. I've been applying for jobs in NYC (which I know is a very competitive market, but it's my dream city) and I got one interview (for a sales/account exec job) which turned into a rejection. I'm terrible on the phone, especially in interviews, but I thought I did a decent enough job on this one. I don't have a car and nor do I have enough money to buy one now so that's why I'd prefer to live in a city with a decent public transportation system (I know the NYC subway is shit but it can't be worse than the subway system where I lived in Latin America). I've looked into a ton of different options but I'd like any advice on how to make an objectively shitty resume (terrible BA degree, spotty job experience) look less shitty so I can at least have a chance at getting a good job.

As far as I've been told, I was going to be put on a project (QA) where 3 people were wanted and now that they've dropped I'm hanging in limbo- I've spent my entire time here sitting at a computer screen, messaging/calling my managers and hearing a vague ""yeah we're working on it"" once every 2-3 weeks. The office is loud and distracting, laptop use is not permitted and I can't install any software on the 50% of the work computers that boot up (got in trouble today for downloading Python)- I'm learning what I can from reading and algorithm questions but I feel like there's a hard limit to what I can properly remember without hands-on coding experience. Unfortunately I can't get away with working from home.

I feel like I shouldn't complain- there are half a million things worse than getting paid to do nothing. That feeling hasn't kept me from losing my mind, though. I'm very concerned for the future because I know it won't look good if I leave (early at 3 months, and without ever being put on a project) and it also won't look good if I stay (bad rep QA might not give me much upward mobility). By the time the day's up I just feel dead and dead tired

I guess the question is, can I do any better with my background or do I need to get over this hurdle? I'd be perfectly fine with a drop in pay if it meant a role with more room for growth. I spent most of my time applying for internships after graduation but in hindsight I don't think most of them were willing to consider a graduate- maybe I might have more luck with entry-level jobs? Are there any alternatives to the interview process that might be more likely to find me success? Would grad school be a feasible option?

I've paid my March rent, and April is covered (shoveling agreement with my landlords) so going by my rent cost and maybe 400 a month for living expenses I can make it until roughly January 2020 before I end up full hobo.

Thanks for any advice"

b0ua2k,1,2019-03-13,Should I break up with my bf of 3 months,spillmces,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b0ua2k/should_i_break_up_with_my_bf_of_3_months/,"We’ve been talking for 4 months including our relationship. This past summer I fell in love so quickly, which is very unlike me. This summer boy (SB) and I tried to do long distance. I ruined a great thing I had going before the summer with a very mature and genuine guy to be with SB. Our relationship grew, and SB started talking about our future. As much as I tried to distance myself from him I felt myself getting sucked in. Unfortunately things ended just as I thought they would. During the long distance after the summer he wasn’t trying at all so I dumped him on Labor Day. It hurt me so so much and I promised myself I wouldn’t date again until after college. (I am currently a junior) I had some flings here and there, but met someone through my internship and we began talking. I let him in and began developing feelings for him. I told him about past and he understood. He didn’t push me into having a relationship, but I got scared of losing him. So we started dating officially in January. He made me feel safe and comfortable everything that I was missing in the summer relationship. 

It’s now March and I’m in Hawaii on spring break. I found out some family news that turned my life upside down (for the worse)
My boyfriend hasn’t been there for me at all. Aside from saying he was sorry he was an ass when we fted the night I told him what happened. He’s in Tampa with his baseball team for spring break and I didn’t want to ruin his time. But if he truly loves me like he says he does (which was wayyy too fast by the way) wouldn’t he care enough to ask how I’m feeling? This news was life altering and I ultimately talked for 40 minutes about this with the guy I ruined things for for SB. (Him and I are now just close friends who understand each other) he even said that it should be my bf should be talking about this with me instead of him. I’m so confused because this was the guy who made me happy after such a dark time, who I thought adored me. He made me believe in relationships and love again. But in this time of need he’s completely absent. He apologized when I brought up how I felt, but then went back to acting like everything is fine. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to ruin his spring break, but I am also not the type of person to put these feelings aside and act like everything is fine until we get back to school. This is slowly eating me alive and adding to the sadness, anxiety, and confusion I am already feeling due to the family crisis. "

I don't think living is worth it anymore.,thnowawayformylife,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b0ukwt/i_was_told_to_move_this_from_rteenagers_to_here_i/,"I feel like absolute shit and want to die. Here's some backstory you'll need; grab some popcorn and settle in, this is a long one. Throwaway account because schoolmates know my account.

Backstory: I live and go to school in a wealthy town. I come from a decently wealthy family as well. I'm a sophomore in an extremely competitive school; we're in the top 30 high schools in our state. Almost everybody takes AP classes and gets a 4.0+ GPA while being the model student: EC's are insane, they have a good social life, Stanford internships, etc. Since the town is wealthy while being in a technologically advanced area, a lot of people drive Teslas (important later in the story).

Here's where the ""fun"" begins. All through elementary and middle school, I was a good student. I'm involved in music, volunteering, and the works. I got good grades and made my parents proud. I was not really prude about my scores, but I was an annoying kid. I did things that looking back on, were cringey and I shouldn't have done (nothing malicious, just r/blunderyears material). Freshman year, my grades tanked. I couldn't handle shit, and I was honestly a clown. I degraded myself publicly, and didn't try in a lot of my classes. I didn't have friends at all, my friends from middle school went to the other high school in town due to school-zoning. My downfall, worst of all, was public. People from the other middle school that fed our high school knew of me, and I got snide comments throughout the year from teachers as well as schoolmates. I didn't approach my parents at all; I didn't want to talk to them at all and I budgeted my time all wrong. I kept on being a clown, making fun of myself and just generally being untasteful. It wasn't until my parents threatened to cut my music lessons and program participation that I started to realise how far gone I was. By then, it was the end of freshman year, and I could do nothing about it. My grades were all terrible; when all my friends talked about how their report cards looked I kept silent and dreaded showing my grades to my parents. Needless to say, it didn't go well. I got enrolled into a college counseling program and tutoring in order to get my GPA up, but didn't address my mental health to my parents. First semester of this year, I didn't do well in either of the two AP Classes I was taking, AP Statistics and AP Chemistry. I kept my mouth shut to my friends at school about my grades, but my parents, I knew, were disappointed. I vowed to myself over winter break to get all A's in my classes by doing all the homework and studying more than I had been (which took 4-5+ hours a day after my extracurricular classes). I tried, and I didn't get results. By this point, I had been feeling worse and worse every day. My dreams of going to an Ivy-League college were already crushed freshman year and my dreams of going to my dream school were starting to be crushed too. I kept trying, and my grades started to change. My AP Chemistry grade started rising, and slowly, my AP Statistics grade started rising too. Even my non-AP classes, which I had done decently well in (all A's and B's both semesters), started to move up. I started to feel better about myself and even began to open up to my family. Until today. The hardest class in my schedule is 100% AP Chemistry. Our class average had been a 73% for the previous test, and I was happy that I got the average score (I usually score lower). We were taking powerpoint notes as the teacher lectured, and the topic was our last of the year (before the AP Exam): Electrochemistry. One slide talked about different types of batteries, and someone asked our teacher what type of batteries were in Teslas. Being relatively friendly with the teacher, I commented that there were too many Teslas in \[Town Name\]. Someone chimed in saying there are too many rich people in \[Town name\] and there was just general conversation about that for a minute. The topic then turned into the whole college admissions bribery scandal going around recently, and the teacher said that people who bribe their way into schools are taking away seats of people who worked hard. Somehow there was a general ruckus and people were saying that I wouldn't get into a school and would have to bribe my way in. I know they said it in a relatively joking manner, and I laughed along with them, but something inside me just snapped. I came home and I've sat down feeling like shit about myself. I know that what happened was completely my fault, but I don't feel confident about myself anymore and I genuinely just want to kill myself now. I have no friends and I just keep on making myself the clown who laughs at himself. I know that what happened was brought on by my previous actions but I don't think that I deserve however much shit I've had thrown at me in the last year and a half. Almost everybody I know has talked shit about me behind my back for my grades and life and people I thought I could trust could obviously not. My life has been a downward spiral and I seriously want to end it all.

Sorry for the long wall of text, I don't have anybody to talk to except Reddit."

b0vi2g,0,2019-03-13,Worried about the quality of my internships,Quinn___,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b0vi2g/worried_about_the_quality_of_my_internships/,"Hey all, 

Currently a Junior at a small, pretty much disregarded state school in VA that happens to be relatively close to a much more well known school (I bet you can figure out which one). I'm getting a degree in CS with a concentration in Software Engineering.  


I attended the career fair at my uni last fall, and applied to a few places. The career fair was pretty disappointing, none of the big companies you hear about on here were there. The most notable were Eastman Chemical, CIA, FBI and Geico (as far as CS related stuff). 

I talked to them, as well as a bunch of smaller software firms (almost all of which orbit around DC). 

I received several interview offers, and went through all of them. The only one that went poorly was Eastman, who told me they wouldn't consider me this semester due to my GPA (3.1) and that I should try again next year. 



Anyway, I received 3 offers. One from an insurance company doing .net stack stuff, one from an artificial intelligence company, and one from a government contractor that does software for satellites as well as some other stuff. 

I ended up accepting the offer from the insurance company for a summer internship. I also accepted the offer from the gov. contractor who offered me a fall co-op. 


Long story short, I have an internship this summer, then a co op in the fall, then I have two more semesters to graduate (spring then fall 2021). 


Maybe lurking this subreddit has skewed my perspective, but I figured based on my far from prestigious university and my low GPA,  I wouldn't have much luck. 

I'm starting go worry that maybe I got these offers because the work I'll be doing isn't going to prepare me for some of the more exciting and well paying jobs that people in this sub strive for. It's hard to get perspective because most people in my degree field at this university hardly give a shit and have no ambition, so not many people I know have received any offers for me to compare myself to. 



I guess what I'm asking is, is having internships on your resume enough? Or is having names that people recognize something that is essential to getting offers (or even interviews)  from bigger places like Big n or even companies like boeing or Northrup Grumman?"

I've had suggestions regarding switching majors, but I run into a dilemma as our university has a special rule where I would have to start again from freshman year. Since changing my degree isn't an option, I decided to do as much internships as possible. So far, I've done 3 internships and on my 4th one where I use SQL to do digital marketing analysis. However, I still feel like this isn't enough to get involved in the tech industry. 

To summarize my post, I have a series of questions...

* For social science students, can we get into the tech industry by self-study alone?
* Where can I learn the required mathematics skills for CS online?
* I did a lot of internships so far (All of them over a month), how would this look for future internship/job prospect?

b0vxxt,1,2019-03-14,Early Career Advancement in Transition to Other Companies,NullCoreGames,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b0vxxt/early_career_advancement_in_transition_to_other/,"Hi all,

I have some questions about career advancement, especially in machine learning. Here's a super quick summary of my background from when I graduated undergrad, just to get a vague idea of my profile.

- 2 summer internships in big data analytics &amp; machine learning (self-driving cars) research respectively, both at major companies
- 2.5 years of full-time undergrad research in robotics/computer vision, 6 publications (mostly 1st or 2nd author)
- Graduated summa cum laude with a BS in electrical/computer engineering, minors in math/comp sci

After graduating (lat year), I became a machine learning engineer at a large company on a state-of-the-art NLP platform, automatically hired in as an 'level 1' ML engineer due to my lack of advanced degree. However, I made some very key innovations that were quickly adopted by our product, and thanks to the help of my very supportive colleagues + manager, I was promoted to 'level 2' ML engineer after 6 months. I do not work at FAANG, but the promotion timeline at my work from level 1 to level 2 is generally about the same as that from SDE1 to SDE2 at Amazon.

I plan on staying here for at least a few years. I feel that I have a lot left to learn, work with brilliant engineers, and have an awesome manager. After that though, I may try to transition somewhere else, which brings up a few questions.

1. Does early career role advancement matter when you are moving to a similar area of expertise at comparable companies, or is the new role scope usually based on years of experience above all else?

2. For those in research roles: any advice on advertising my research background when eventually applying to new jobs, without making half of my resume publications? I've been told that I should only include a select few, but it's less black and white without an advanced degree. A PhD is not an option at the moment, but I will be starting a Master's (part-time) next Fall, which may help that barrier a little bit.

3. We are trying to patent some of the stuff that I created. Bluntly speaking, do people care about patents when hiring for research roles, or are they not comparable?

Thanks for your time and thoughts!"

I used to love computer science, but lately I feel some sort of dread towards the field. I'm just starting out but I can't help but to feel this way. It's such a popular and competitive major everywhere and I feel like I'm not doing enough to stay competitive with my peers. I start to question the reasons why I start my own personal projects. Is it because I'm actually interested in it or is it because I want to pad my resume? How would I stand out compared to so-and-so who has an internship at Big-N this or unicorn that?? Reading about how many internships and jobs yall apply to and how little responses are received are a bit discouraging. I'm sure you guys are a talented and bunch too. Just thinking about how resumes are filtered out before they even get looked at by a human being because you don't have experience in a certain language or maybe you didn't format your resume correctly seems like some sort of little game. I'm becoming guilty of it too-- being a computer science major in college just seems like I'm in some grand race to get jobs.

I don't know. Do any of you feel the same? Maybe I'm putting too much pressure on myself. Maybe computer science isn't the field for me. Maybe  this is how the ""real world"" is like in any field and I'm being naive.

I was really interested in computer science. It seemed like there was so many possibilities by going into the field. So tell me, what do you enjoy about the field? If you've done internships, do you feel that you have impacted your community? Have you created any projects that you genuinely enjoyed? How do you push yourself to keep learning everyday?

b0wcnm,4,2019-03-14,Sudden conflict and escalation with supervisor - how to respond?,BeforetheBullfight,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/b0wcnm/sudden_conflict_and_escalation_with_supervisor/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Having a sudden workplace issue and could use some advice. I have been interning (no, not employed technically, but effectively acting as a employee) for a couple months at a local company that offers health services. I go to location A and B, each one day a week, doing different tasks at each. Things were going decently until this week - I'll do my best to summarize:

My job at location B is to handle phone calls with clients and run insurance information. At the start of the day, my immediate supervisor (we'll call Sup Y) told me she wanted me to start working on efficiency. This was fine, as I felt I had a decent grasp of the essentials at this point. I was working as usual for the first part of the day until I took a client call (who was clearly having serious issues), which led to a series of difficulties with running her insurance information with the insurance support line. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to resolve it (even in spite of our system actually shutting down a couple time), but was unfortunately unable to resolve it before leaving for the day. 

As I was leaving, Sup Y told me that she wanted to review basic concepts with me when I came in next week.

Here's where the conflict more or less begins. I was confused by this parting comment, as it essentially stated that she found me incompetent. I just said okay at the time as I felt too defeated by everything to engage in further conversation (plus my shift was over), and I assumed that would be that until next week. I am frustrated by this comment for several reasons: a) I had been successfully completing other insurance verifications, b) she actually stood near me and observed over speakerphone the problem I was having, c) she should have clearly heard me (quiet office) throughout the day with this, and d) never offered more than the obvious (and ineffective) solutions the multiple times I approached her. As far as I was concerned, I did everything I could with what I had.

Turns out, she decided to escalate the issue. Today, I woke up to a fairly detailed email where she discussed her various issues with me and my performance - this was also copied to higher-up supervisors. I was entirely taken aback by this, both the choice to do so and some of the content. My issues with this:

1. This feels a bit out of nowhere, like we went from 0-100. I had never heard any concerns from others, and had actually recently received praise from a Sup at location A about my performance, who herself indicated that she herself had heard *positive* things about me from location B. 
2. She expressed disappoint with my lack of ""efficiency"" (as highlighted earlier that day). While I can understand the desire to have had more tasks completed, this was impossible in combination with speaking to X (lengthy call), the insurance hullabaloo, and the systems blips. The only way I could have been more ""efficient"" was to turn this case over to another intern, who was not as familiar with things and did not have the notes of the case that I did (plus X expressed that she wanted me personally to be dealing with her information so as to prevent crossed wires). Considering how client-focused the company is and the seriousness of X's issues, I felt no qualms about focusing on her case. I was never told to drop it.
3. I was accused of generally leaving ""more difficult work"" for the other interns, which feels blatantly unfair considering the time I dedicated to the above issues. While I was happy to be helping X, it was an emotionally draining process, and definitely not what I would call easy.
4. At one point, Sup Y even made a complaint about my personal demeanor. As far as I can tell, I have no issue in this regard, and have gotten along perfectly fine with others. See point 1. 
5. I feel Sup Y could have handled this much better. I never heard such concerns from her before. Her comments made as I was leaving implied to me that there would be further discussion later, and that would be it for now. Having woken up to a long email (also copied to others at that) feels passive-aggressive. Never once during this process did she ask me to walk her through what I was doing and my concerns, and as stated earlier, her own guidance during everything ended up being quite limited. I'm afraid this will have tainted everyone's perspective of me, ultimately effecting my ability to get a reference, over something that should at least have been discussed face-to-face in detail first.

Of course, I have to respond to this communication. How do I do this and maintain assertiveness of my perspective and own concerns without just being blindly defensive? I'm afraid it would be easy for everyone involved to just ignore my side, as I'm the mere unpaid grunt. Never once in my time in supervisory settings have I had this degree of issue. Welp.

tl;dr - had a rough day handling an unusual and difficult issue, supervisor help was limited and assumed me incompetent even though I followed direction regarding the issue, made parting comment about my ""need to review"", and then sent somewhat passive-aggressive email that essentially misrepresents me or at least greatly misunderstood some things. Afraid of how this will effect things, how to respond?"

b0xfww,8,2019-03-14,Being a good intern,sowokose,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b0xfww/being_a_good_intern/,"Hello.

I am a Computer Science student. To my utter surprise, I got accepted as a Production Engineer Intern to one of Facebook offices (not in US).

After the internship I would really love to get a return offer. How do I do that? Let me say something about myself so that you have a clearer picture:

Pros:

- I have no problem initiating communication, that is I am not one of those that just sit and smile when they don't understand something, I do ask questions to clarify things. Of course assuming the other party is willing to communicate.

- I am a hard worker. I've never had the 'oh my god the project is due tomorrow, but I haven't even started yet' problem, unless I had to rely on other people.

- Given an interesting project, especially something where I can learn, I can just sit and be gone for hours doing it. In other words, if the job isn't mundane, I can just focus on it and do it.

Cons:

- The overall communication skills are a mixed bag. I've never got along with people. It's hard for me to understand what type of behaviour they expect. As a result, I know many people at my university, but I don't consider any of them my friends.

- I have little talent and my knowledge is simply lacking. Despite putting a lot of effort, most of my grades are 'barely passing'. I accepted this and just follow the idea that 'Cs get degrees', but I fear they might expect too much from me. I don't learn computer-related stuff outside school, as I prefer to develop myself in other areas.

- I. Am. Stubborn. If you give me a good reason why something has to be done your way then there might be a chance I will be convinced, but otherwise (and often design choices are, well, a matter of preference, just like tabs versus spaces) I really prefer to stick to my way of doing things. One time it did happen during an interview that I simply refused to code because they expected a super-extreme version of test-driven development, which I found a highly inefficient way to do things. It becomes a nightmare in group projects when designing the core of the program and basic interfaces that you won't change easily later - I will do literally everything to avoid dealing with someone's decisions I consider bad. This also means that teaching me new practices isn't easy. But on the other hand it's a blessing when I am right.

It would be great to give me some advice, indicate problems that might arise, things that I should try working on and so. In general, please tell me how to not fuck it up. I see this internship as an once-in-a-lifetime chance and it would be a shame if it went bad because I had not made sufficient preparations."

Hey everyone. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the sleuthing you’ve been doing over the past couple of days. I honestly would not have made as much progress on this as I have without your observations. A special shout-out to u/\_Raymond\_Reddington\_ for commenting my wife’s post in its entirety when I otherwise had not access to the information. Another special shoutout to u/lileevine for a concise rundown of the information presented to her so far. It was vital in keeping my research organized. Here is a link to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ayhvjp/my_wife_is_not_my_wife/), and this is the link to my wife’s [apparent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ay40cr/my_husband_is_different_and_i_dont_know_why/) that I for some reason cannot access. I have been told there is another post, but I have not been able to find it and have not received a link/pasted copy of it yet, so I cannot provide those for you at this time. Since I believe I will be updating you as I go, I will begin marking these posts as a series.

Here is what I have so far from my experiences. For clarity, I will use the apparent names from each of our posts. It seems my wife had the same idea that we shouldn’t reveal our identity. Because of this, I will use the names that the readers are familiar with. I will be pasting a portion of the layout from u/lileevine for this purpose:

&gt;names  
&gt;  
&gt;wife: Kayla/Kay (h) / Megan/Meg (w)  
&gt;  
&gt;husband: Mike (h) / Daniel/Dan (w)

It is worth noting that Megan belongs with me (Mike) and Kayla belongs with Daniel. Mike and Megan from the original ""dimension,"" and Kayla and Daniel from the other ""dimension.""

Things I know First-Hand:

* Kayla, in this “dimension,” never suffered from the childhood trauma that granted my OG wife, Megan, the depression that she has struggled with for her whole life. Kayla tried to convince me that I made it up, but you don’t just magically imagine something like that. I think she is used to weak-minded me (Daniel), who seemed to follow along with everything she said, which leads me to my next point.

&amp;#x200B;

* Daniel, who got sent over to my wife, had a bit of a mental break after his mom died a couple years back. He never fully recovered from the grief and was diagnosed with depression last year. I know this because when I attempted to call Kayla’s therapist the other day to get information about her progress, the receptionist seemed very confused. She explained that they had never seen my wife, but that I was the client. I asked for my session notes, and read through every page. Daniel was hurting for love and meaning, apparently none of which he found.

&amp;#x200B;

* Kayla works at a research firm that has been going into some crazy stuff that I cannot understand. She has a degree in Physics (just like my Megan), but unlike Megan, since she didn’t have depression, she went right into internships and, ultimately, her job at the firm right out of college. She has been working on a super secret project, about which I can find little information. I did discover some in the cabinet of the desk, but what I read, I could not understand, and I could not access the hard drives. This leads me to...

&amp;#x200B;

* THE BRIEFCASE: Holy shit, folks. This briefcase felt like I was cracking into a CIA Agent’s field notebook. I don’t know if that is actually a thing, but let’s cut to the chase. There were three files in the briefcase. Two had my name on it. But one was about Daniel, and the other was about Me. (Recall that both my wife and I changed the names for our posts. In reality, both Daniel and I share the same name. Megan and Kayla also share the same name. See how confusing this is?!)

&amp;#x200B;

* SO in Daniel’s file, there were lamentations basically about how unsuited he was for life in this timeline. Apparently being deemed a “Perfect Candidate for Transfer.” Likewise, in my file, I was being lauded for excellence, essentially being deemed unsuited for life in my original timeline, and likewise a “Perfect Candidate for Transfer.""

&amp;#x200B;

* I have no clue how this timeline transfer stuff works, but it seems like Kayla is able to view aspects of people from other “dimensions” and take notes on them. My file was thick, and full of odd details about my life, even from times where I was completely alone. I cannot fathom how she got this information, but it made my skin crawl. There is something absolutely wrong with this woman.

&amp;#x200B;

* The other file in the briefcase: a file for my wife, Megan. I’ve gotta tell you, it was hard to read it. The distaste that Kayla has for her is immeasurable, and my heart was breaking reading the awful notes she wrote about her, summing up Megan into one word - “worthless.” That is the farthest thing from the truth, and brought me closer and closer to wanting to punch this broad in the face. Megan was labeled as “Ideal Recipient of Client A,” with Client A being Daniel.

&amp;#x200B;

* The most jarring thing, there are observations about Megan from as recent as Friday. I was told that Daniel committed suicide by a couple commenters, which was confirmed in both Daniel’s file, and Megan’s, as Kayla listed in detail how she was handling the loss. Apparently she is sleeping a lot. I can’t blame her, I can’t imagine how she is going through this. I was glad to read that her mom and dad are staying with her right now, which gives me some peace of mind. Can anyone tell me if she has posted an update since the death?

&amp;#x200B;

* Based on the notes, Kayla seems otherwise unfazed by the death of her husband, only placing a large red DECEASED stamp on his file with the note “hanging” next to it. I believe a user in the comments mentioned a suicide note, but there is no mention of the note in either file, so it stands to reason that Kayla does not know about it.

&amp;#x200B;

* Kayla has mentioned a couple of times that work is really getting busy and that she will be working longer hours. She said that something isn’t going according to plan and they have to work out some kinks. I think what she is referring to is the fact that Daniel’s suicide did not lead to Megan’s suicide like she may have originally planned. It seems that she is worried that if Megan lives, I will try to get back to her. She’s absolutely correct.

&amp;#x200B;

* It seems that Kayla is now attempting to cause disruption in her life through timeline manipulation so she can urge her into suicide in an effort to keep me here, based on some notes in Megan’s file. She wants to make sure that if I ever find out the truth (which I basically already have) that I will have no choice but to stay. It is hard for me to understand how a company could violate ethics in such a profound way, but apparently they needed a volunteer for this experiment, and Kayla offered up her unhappy husband in hopes that she could come up with a better companion. She underestimated me.

&amp;#x200B;

* Additional Details:
   * Dog still hates me. With a passion. I can’t even let her outside now or she gnashes her teeth at me. I stay away from her at all costs, and she affords me the same courtesy.
   * When I brought up my suspicions about something being wrong with Kayla, like another user suggested, she got irrationally angry with me and told me not to muse with childish pretend. She deflected and deflected until I had no choice but to give up the conversation. There was no progress in communication.
   * After I brought up my concern, she somehow changed the lock on the desk cabinet, and from what I can assume, keeps the key with her at all times because I have not yet been able to find it. I can no longer access the documents and hard drives that were in there, so I have not been able to try new passwords. Right now, this is my secondary objective.

&amp;#x200B;

My Primary Objective: to get in contact with my wife. I have tried as hard as possible to contact her. I clicked the links to her posts, I searched her username, there is no record of the user at all from where I am. Her email address is the same as Kayla’s as well as her phone number, so I think I am locked from communication based on my present location in this “dimension.” I’m not sure how to get ahold of her, but I need to reassure her, and make sure she stays alive. I am going to need her help if I am going to succeed in getting back to her. I really might need the help of some of you readers. If you are able and can be bothered to send this message to her, I would be eternally grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Megan,

I am alive. I am stuck with a different version of you who is all wrong. It seems that the same thing happened to you, but you experienced much more devastating results. Just know that the man who killed himself was NOT me. I am still alive, babe. And I am working hard to find a way to get back to you. I need you to stay strong, because I’m going to need your help if we are going to pull this off. You might get this message from a random person, but that is just because I can’t find a way to contact you directly. Here is how you know it is me: Our first date was an absolute train wreck. I spilled my wine on your skirt, and it got stained. You told me you liked it like that because it looked artistic, so you never tried to get the stain out. You wear that skirt on the anniversary of our first date every single year. I love you more than words, always have an always will.

&amp;#x200B;

Things might get weird for you, but it seems you recognized right away when something was wrong with “me.” I need you to promise me that if you sense that feeling again, that something is a little off, go with your gut. Don’t trust anyone or anything that doesn’t seem quite right. I’m going to fix this and we are going to be together again. Stay strong, beautiful. God, I love you. And I can’t wait to hold you again.

\-”Mike”- (That’s what I’m calling myself. I promise it’s me, but I still don’t feel comfortable using our real names)"

b10qrb,0,2019-03-14,Internships?,RemarkableSignature0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b10qrb/internships/,"Good morning everyone, hope everyone is doing well! So I’ve recently started looking for internships because the classes I need to take are online this summer. 

A little back story about myself. I have done one internship, and I must say I was pretty successful. I am an upcoming junior in college.  I learned a lot over the summer, and loved being there. I worked at a startup and loved the feel. I’d definitely give corporate a chance too. 

My question is, are there any companies out there that’ll help with relocation, and transportation if it not in my area? I’d like for the internship to be paid if possible. I can do a lot, not as much as I’d like to be able to do but I can do a decent amount. I know that there are some HR personals in this subreddit, and if you could point me into the right direction you’ll be such a blessing. 

I am willing to learn, willing to sit under someone smart, and knowledgeable to teach me things all summer. I want to learn more than anything. I am eager to learn and achieve and will do anything in my power to do so. 

TLDR; Rising Junior in college willing to move for the summer to do a paid internship. Hoping that relocation and transportation is included. Willing to learn.

Hey all.

I'm a senior and I'll be graduating this spring.

I recently just heard back from my second interview with a company to do software development. They want to hire me. This is not an internship - this is a full time position I'd likely be committing to for a long time. 

However, I'm really nervous since this is my first ever ""real"" position and it's not just some internship. (I've only ever worked retail before and only interviewed twice, both for positions I was in no way prepared for). My skills match their requirements almost perfectly, which is good. Also all 3 of the people I interviewed with were graduates of my college. One 50 years ago, one 30? ish and one seemingly about 5 ish years back. 

I'm not sure if I should jump on it or take a step back. ~~The pay is a lot lower than I expected looking at average salaries of software developers out of college, for one. (Not that I need to have oodles of cash since I tend to live really simply, but I may want to support a family at some point and putting money into some kind of investment so I can actually retire one day would be great) However, they did state a couple times they do offer good raises yearly. (But didn't state how much)~~

I'm going to try to avoid spilling too much, but I'd be developing simulation software for an R+D company that ultimately does work for the DoD.

In general, the benefits are stated as:

* competitive salaries
* comprehensive insurance options
* paid time off and holidays (though I was told in person this would start out small and grow as I gained seniority in the company)
* 401(k) retirement and profit sharing
* ""flexible spending""?
* tuition reimbursement and more.

In their e-mail today they stated:

&gt;We’ve lately been hiring junior programmers with experience levels similar to yours starting at $55K per year. We’re also fairly generous with salary increases given your future performance. There’s also a decent package of benefits ranging from merit bonuses to health coverage to retirement benefits and more. 

**My options:**

As I understand it, I have a few options:

* Accept immediately
* Tell them I'd like to wait to hear back from other options (in reality I only have one other, and I've gotten very little communication from them despite their apparent enthusiasm)
* Stay in college? Get a masters? 
* The site mentions tuition reimbursement. Somehow continue work on a masters? They didn't really talk about that though.

b15rdq,1,2019-03-14,When can you begin to tie math and programming in projects/ what is work like as a programmer?,Pineappleorange3,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/b15rdq/when_can_you_begin_to_tie_math_and_programming_in/," (This is somewhat of a modified crosspost)

Lately, my goals have been to pursue something with mathematics and programming, so I've thought that I'd pursue computer science during college. Yet right now I'm simply learning HTML from a school class simply to try and have some time to code, and far from linear algebra, I'm confused about how I could tie math and programming together at this time, or at least prepare. How could I begin to make strides in learning regardless? What studies should I pursue to prepare ? What is life like as a computer science major? What are the branches and the topics you are allowed to pursue? While at this time I'm just trying to learn what programming is, when in my math studies could I begin to merge them and do projects requiring both? 

And for work;

How is work like as a programmer? How are internships like as a programmer? I'm worried I might not be cut out for it when it comes to a job. While I can appreciate the challenges of math and programming in the realms of unbridled curiosity, I worry that I will quickly burnout if I might be homeless if I don't solve it before the deadline. I worry I won't be good enough to compete, that I won't do well, that my coworkers may hate me, or I may not even be seen as good enough.

I've also worried about the workload a programming job will bring (sorry for the odd terminology), what does your job usually expect of you? What has your work experience been like?

I've wanted to keep my studies, but now I have to narrow them down for preparation of college and beyond. I have a few that I've wanted to keep as hobbies or miraculously-freelance part time, but I have no clue if that will be possible in the realm of the industry's work expectations. My preconception is that I won't have this time and have no clue if work as a part-time programmer will be possible if the industry does demand 9-5 at the minimum. My mind gets foggier for work as a freelance programmer, is it more competitive? Less competitive? For freelancers, what is your job like?

And generally, has the industry been healthy for you? Is it worth it? Have you suffered crunch times and fatigue? Looming fear of possible unemployment? Have you ever been expected to work extremely long shifts or anything that began to take a toll on you and stress you to the point of affecting your life? Has a job ever weaned you of your joy of programming, and challenges that before might've playfully puzzled you send you into spirals in a job? And if so, did you ever quit/ seek out different paths? If so, what did you do/do you do now?

Thank you, and sorry if this isn't the right place, but I just wanted to know how things have been like for you. Thank you."

\- Sophomore General Engineering major at a reputable polytechnic University

\- Interest in computer science

\- Basic coding experience in Matlab, Java, and Python

\- Basic experience with Excel and Visual Basic

\- 3 years work experience as a lifeguard and head lifeguard at the same beach club

\- Experience working on a formal engineering project with a team

b16oqs,1,2019-03-14,Finally got a good job in IT but I'm returning to school soon. (Need Advise),inkblowout,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/b16oqs/finally_got_a_good_job_in_it_but_im_returning_to/,"This is a long story so I'll try and shorten it as much as I can. So I was fired from my help desk job back in early November. (the feeling was honestly mutual since I didn't like the job and I wanted to quit. It was a stupid decision to take the job career wise.) But during that time I wanted to go back to university for a business IT degree, but I have recently graduated from College for a diploma related to IT.

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward to this month and I just nailed a job as a system administrator. It's sort of a help desk job but they empathized that a bunch of hands on work will be done because their database is walking distance away from their office. So I'm pretty excited... but then yesterday I got an offer for my university from my application I've sent in December. So now I'm sitting here like ""oh fuck I start work in a week and my school starts in 2 months."" (it starts in the summer.)

&amp;#x200B;

So ya perfect timing right? I'm unemployed for about 5 months and when I do get a job, I also get my offer for university. Now the only reason why I'm going to university is that I noticed the high position IT jobs they ask for a degree in their job postings + my mentors have told me that getting a degree for anything computer related on top of your diploma will help you out a lot in job progression as one of them told me they lost their jobs to people who are ""more qualified"" by just having a piece of paper that costs $50k.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question to you guys is... do I work the 2-3 months with these guys and leave when my first semester starts and find some student IT internship during my school year? (And is 2-3 months of experience enough for IT managers and etc?) Or there some other alternative that could help me keep my job and do school at the same time because this job really does look cool and seems like a good learning experience for me. But school is my top priority here.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Might as well add a TL;DR

TL;DR: Unemployed for 5 months.. Got a sys. admin job, got an offer from a university the same week. Is there a way to keep the job when my school starts or is there no hope and I should quit when my year begins? "

As for personal interest, I think I'm more interested in the ex-unicorn's products, but I'm not interested enough for it to play a serious factor in my decision.

&gt;!For work culture, I hear really good things about the ex-unicorn's culture, and I hear the Big N has a toxic work environment. I'm aware that a lot of this is probably blown out of proportion/highly dependent on the team I get placed in, but I've had bad enough experiences in the past with toxic environments affecting my motivation/mentality to be concerned. Am I relying too much on hearsay/circlejerk, or is it really that bad? I'm currently trying to contact some alumni/people I know who work there, but I'd also like to hear your opinions. Also, I'm not going to lie, a lot of my leaning towards the ex-unicorn is probably because it was the first company I actually passed the resume screening with, and due to sunk-cost fallacy from spending 2+ months in the interview process and 4+ hours inside of actual interviews.!&lt;

Which company should I choose, and does it even matter down the line?"

I'm in the Houston area, I wouldn't mind driving up to Austin since their tech scene is bigger. Any advice from Houston/Austin natives?

b173ie,20,2019-03-14,I was fired from my internship,AnnaisMirbel,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/b173ie/i_was_fired_from_my_internship/,"Let me introduce myself first. I am an international student, coming to US for college, and this is my last year. Before graduation, I hope to have an internship for credit, and for gaining my experience. I asked my professor, and she introduced me to a founder of a small accounting firm (like 10 members). About a month later, a person from her firm got back to me and said that I was accepted for the internship.


Things worked out quite well. I came there during December to learn, like part time I would say. Then during my semester, I interned 10-12 hours a week. I listened to a few lecture, then work with Excel and bank reconciliation. Normal stuff of accounting intern I would say.


During that time, I was happy that I learned a lot from them. Everyone was nice. When my supervisor was out, I learned from other employees, and asked them if they needed anything from me. Sometimes when finishing with my duties, I'm just gonna learn the function of accounting software.


To be honest, I was not an excellent one. I got introduced to the software or the process, trying to take notes, and realized that I would never touch those software months later. I made mistakes, a lot when it came to software, because I did not understand their functions. I made mistakes on numbers a few times. I did some AR and AP, I was assigned for arranging stuffs and typing numbers for update Excel sheet, and I did it okay. Sometimes I need to wait for half an hour to get assigned, but I find something else to take a look at. 


Then, I had a strange feeling that the founder did not like me. She did not assign work for me much. When she did, it was just office stuff like copying or scanning. However, she made me feel like I am not a part of her firm.  


I was not allowed to know any passwords from clients, nor touching any paperwork they had without permission. I got the worst computer in the firm, and it ran like an old nanny. As such, whenever I wanted to do something, it took so long to just even access to the system. 


When my supervisor tried to teach me a new thing, she told him that he needed to work with something else, then bring silly things for me to do. Even when he tried to get me into payroll learning, it was just that. Observing, but never actually get the experience.


When I looked around to observe what form they had for tax return, for example, she just told me like ""What do you want?"", like I'm trying to steal something. 


One time, we were doing a rennovation to the office. I waited for my supervisor to check my work (he was busy with carrying stuffs so he could not check me yet), so I looked around, excited and curious to see they changed the office. She just looked at me and said something like: ""Oh X, don't you have anything for her?? If not just let her call it a day."" And not just once, she told that three times in a row. 


When she could be so warmly welcome to other employees, asked them about how their lives were, she never cared for me once. 


I even heard she said sorry for my supervisor to have him take care of me. 


I felt like my appearance was a burden she must carry, and it was terrible. 


I still smiled to everyone, try my best to do assigned work. I tried to ignore myself from her attitude, but sometimes I felt really sad, because I could not understand why she did not like me that much. Perhaps I was not good enough for her. 


Then today, I was shocked to know that I was fired from my internship, because they have hired a full-time employee. It is the middle of March, and my internship class end on May. 


I want to cry so bad, but I just can't. My supervisor said sorry, that if he could have time, he could teach me more than just reconciliation. 
I thanked them for everything, not even know how I got out of the office. Just a few moments ago, I was still counting my time to finish an assigned project. It should be done two weeks later, if I tried my best. Should be. 


Or never. 



Just want to share :)

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated with two degrees: one in computer science, the other in politics, and I'm very confused as to what I want to do with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoyed my CS coursework, often having fun completing my projects and assignments. I haven't done much outside of class, except for an internship. As for my politics degree, I realized halfway into it that I was more interested in looking at the same issues from a historical perspective, rather than a political-science-y approach. (Maybe I felt this way because  my school doesn't have a very strong politics program.)  Anyway, I ended up just finishing the degree. Throughout my life, my strongest subject has been English, and I've always really liked classes that allow me to do some writing &amp; researching, as well as creative writing. (I just wasn't that interested in studying literature in college.) And I'm really interested in dedicating (at least a part of) my life to issues of human rights, (in)justice, &amp; social good.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn between these two paths. Do I pursue CS, which I do find really interesting/fun, &amp; go into industry/academia? Or do I step away from the more straightforward path and try to make a career for myself as a writer/something related to politics/justice? Or, is there some way to combine these two paths? I keep thinking of people in STEM fields who were also writers, like Chekhov &amp; Lewis Carroll.

&amp;#x200B;

Something that kind of haunts me is what my brother, who is trying to switch out of a CS major, said to me recently. I asked him if he was switching out because he didn't like CS. He told me: ""I liked CS in the same way that I'd like to solve a logic puzzle. It's interesting, but this isn't what I want to do with the rest of my life."" I'm a little confused as to whether that is how I feel about CS. Would I really have completed this degree if it were just 'a logic puzzle' to me? Especially because it was much more difficult/time-consuming than the politics degree?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really sorry for this mess of a post. Just feeling very lost &amp; would appreciate any advice that you have to offer."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my Junior year of undergrad studying CS, and I'm currently *pretty afraid* of starting to apply for full-time positions next year, especially when I compare myself (resume, LinkedIn, etc.) to my peers. Over the past few years at school I haven't had great luck with securing an internship with my ""top-choice"" companies-- or any for that matter-- sending hundreds of applications and hearing back from roughly 5% of them.  I feel as though I'm being passed over on the spot because I don't have a ""Big 4"" internship on my resume, or a very extensive work/research history, and I really don't know how to remedy that at this point. I know I'm on a time-crunch now to seek out full-time work, and was wondering what I could do in this time to, at the very least, get my resume in the ""send coding challenge"" bin instead of the ""ghost"" or ""We thank you for your application..."" bin.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you a general run-down of where I'm standing:

* I go to a relatively prestigious (I mean with everything regarding the admissions scandal here you can be the judge of that) college
* Have an ""ok"" GPA: \~3.3
* Have 4 personal projects (mostly toy projects written in C++, Javascript, Python, and Rust) on my resume
* Have won a small school data science competition, and a hackathon hosted by a local (Los Angeles-based) company
* Have interned at a large hardware storage company, doing a mix of DevOps and Systems Programming, and will return to intern at that company again this summer

Hey guys!

I’m still in the internship hunt for this year (I know, I’m super late but in my defense I’ve been searching since September) and I’m looking for internships in the finance industry, specifically banking. 

This one medium-sized bank near my house moved me through tot he second round of interviews, but by the time the HR manager got back to me they only had spots left for two positions: risk management and retail lending. 

He asked me which of the two I wanted to interview for on the spot - I didn’t know those positions were the only two left, so I said retail lending as my eventual goal is commercial lending and I thought that’d be a good fit. But, from talking to others in the banking industry it seems like risk management might be a better path as it’s more analytical.

I want to potentially ask the manager to see if I can still interview for risk management instead of retail lending, but I don’t know exactly how I should go about this or if this is something I should even do.

All advice is welcome.

My apologies of my post is unclear - ask me if you need clarification on anything I’ve said and I can clarify.

It's not all terrible, but I'm really fed up with the heavy processes that go into getting anything done and the emphasis on following those processes over building high-quality, robust software. The long and short of it is that I really want to switch industries, but I don't really know much about marketing myself. I got my current job after I went to a job fair junior year of college, got an internship and then a return offer. The location kind of worked for me, and my attitude was ""hey, no matter where I go I'll get to be writing code, which is what I love, right?"" so I didn't really look around or apply to other places. Now that I'm out of school though and looking around for job listings hoping to move into the tech sector, I get a little apprehensive as I don't know what kind of job reqs I should be looking for / applying to. No matter where I look it's tough to find positions where I'm familiar with all the tools and platforms specified on the reqs, and I kind of blew my chance to apply to places as a new grad because I took this job without too much consideration. I would just like some guidance as to key things to look for / good potential entry points back into the commercial tech sector.

A little about me:

While I was in school I always felt pretty confident in my abilities. In every class I took, when it came to technical assignments / projects / problems I was always the one who solved it quick and people would come to for tips/tricks or direction. When it came to group assignments / projects, I always ended up taking the lead technical role and put together most of the infrastructure for my teams. I really hope this doesn't make me sound boastful. I don't want to sound like a ""pick me! pick me!"" kind of person; I more want to communicate that I do feel like I have some level of ability and technical strength, I just feel woefully lost in navigating the job market, and I feel like this may provide a better understanding as to what areas you might suggest I start applying.

Experience:

Most of my language experience so far has been C++, and is probably right now the language I feel most competent in, but I also feel pretty strong in Python, and Java will always have a special place in my heart as it was the first language I used back in middle/high school. 

Any advice on places I should be looking to find a job / frameworks or tools I can learn in my spare time would be greatly appreciated. I am happy to put in whatever work is required, I just don't know where to start when it comes to looking at the job market. 

Sorry about the wall of text:
tl;dr -- I feel stuck in a very process-intensive, slow and soul-crushing defense job coming straight out of college and I need some advice on good ways to start branching out."

Were you able to work on projects outside of the coursework in addition to your (full-time) job?

Were you able to secure summer internships before the placement in 3rd yeard?

How good did you find the course and how prepared did you feel when entering the workforce?

b1b82i,3,2019-03-15,College age “kid” who got taken advantage of by a big US bank. My take one the experience.,bryannbb,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/b1b82i/college_age_kid_who_got_taken_advantage_of_by_a/,"I (21M) am a Junior at a major public university in the Midwest. I’d like to think I have busted my ass to date and played my cards right, but rightfully so that will always be up to subjugation. I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to work as an Internal Audit Intern for a public company in my area prior to  starting my Junior year of college. I am approaching a full year with them (full time during the summer, part time during school year). 

With the mindset of expanding my horizons, and pumping my resume, I thought it was a good idea to pick up one more internship prior to my senior year and pursue a new role in the security services division of a major US bank. 

I had the typical phone interview, followed by a full day of onsite interviews. After a month of trying to get ahold of the HR representative responsible for hiring the current location, I was “lucky” enough to be given the position.However, a week went by and I hadn’t received a contract agreement regarding my start date, end date, and compensation (albeit I knew all the details prior to applying to the position). 

Long story short, 10 days go by and they revoked the offer. I devoted 6 weeks of my life to this processes and allowed the overthinking that came with it. 

BUT, being a guy with small experience in IA my thought process was this... documentation, documentation, and more documentation. 

What I’m getting at, and the little wisdom I am trying to share with anyone else who may go through this process is this: 

Nothing is set and stone until it’s in a written contract. DO NOT reject offers, or tell your current employer your leaving until you have put ink to paper.

The greatest decision I made in this process was being patient. I’m looking at one more summer in IA with the plan of going full time in the location I’m currently at. 

Had I put all my eggs in one basket, It would have been a massive mistake.

I am currently a 3rd year CE student. I am here to get some advice. I have realized that there are many micro-career paths that you can choose from while pursuing a CE degree. I have had 3 internships so far and all of them have been as a software developer. From the experience I have gained from these 3 internships I know that I love working as a  backend or a full-stack developer and if I get to do that for the rest of my life I will be happy. However, there are a few courses that I have taken in the past 2.5 years that I LOVE. However, I dont know which positions to apply for that will let me use the knowledge that I have gained from those courses. The official titles of those courses are:

1. Digital Circuits and Systems: We learned about boolean algebra and other bit stuff here. I remember being super excited during this course.
2. Digital computers: We learnt about the history of computers, the memory hierarchy and types etc
3. Embedded Microprocessor Systems: Continuation of the previous course
4. Operating Systems and Systems Programming
5. Digital Hardware Systems: Currently learning about FSMs, DFDs Pipelining. this is also the second course with VHDL in it .
6. Compilers

&amp;#x200B;

the main thing  I am confused about is if there is a career path that combines the interest I have in embedded and low-level software development(compilers and operating systems) If so, what would that position be? Which companies hire for such positions? What do I do to build my resume so that those companies at least interview me?

I don't know if I am in the right forum/subreddit for this but i thought I would try, since I'm using reddit a lot for different topics.  
I am a german working student (I study mechanical engineering)  for an internship in Italy.

My project was chosen for me and I am kind of overwhelmed a bit.

I am working for a automotive supplier company.

My Task is to write the software using S32 Design Studio by NXP and the S32K146 EVB.

In the following I try to describe what my Task is, I have never worked with anything comparable like this, the knowledge I have are some youtube tutorials and c++ basics with Arduino from university 1 year ago, so please be kind.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my setup:  [https://imgur.com/a/dB6DtID](https://imgur.com/a/dB6DtID)

  
The touch Panel uses serial communication to send a 8 byte string to our board using UART0, if the string is not defined it should just echo back. If the string is pre defined, the Board should send a Lin command using UART2 for UDS Commands (Unified Diagnostic services).  
Through the basic examples in S32DS (Design Studio) I was able to do the first part with UART0 Communication between the Board and the touch panel fairly quick, but only with serial Commands. So if i send out a known serial string, I get a set answer back in serial on the panel.

Now I struggle a lot, trying to send Lin commands to change the ""Diagnostic session control"". 

For monitoring of the Lin/Uart2 I am using Vector Canalyzer 11.   
I found a basic example for Lin communication, but I am not able to modify it so I am able to send these commands.   
Do you guys have any advice for me or something similar to look at. I am willing to do a lot of reading but don't know where to start. They gave me the specifications for Lin and UDS but these are 300 pages each and it's very hard for me to read it because I don't understand much. I hope someone can help me out, if some information is missing, feel free to say something.

Thanks a lot for your time"

We have had a lot of courses on software engineering, including development life-cycle, requirements specification and software testing. However, all projects result in a prototype on some repository, which you hope will run correctly on the teachers computer. Gitlab CI runners and any sort of infrastructure (e.g. Spark or Flink clusters) are already provided for us. We get nothing on provisioning infrastructure, (continuous) deployment, security or monitoring. 

Did anyone have any practical courses on these aspects in their university study? I mostly see posts on this reddit about MOOCs and side-projects outside of University. From my limited experience as an intern I notice that these aspects are the limiting factor in the development life-cycle and I feel at a loss because I haven't been prepared for this*.

I'm trying to learn these aspects in my spare time and I'm having a blast. I feel like this could be an interesting course where you are required to keep a simple website online while you are going through real-world scenarios such as roll-out during high traffic, complex data model changes, change of provider (e.g. AWS to Google), DDOS, hack attempts and forced roll-back. Add in some gamification and you are golden, in which a student gains points for causing these scenarios on your fellow students' website, while countering those attempts on their own website.

I chose to focus on Networking and DevOps during my education. I worked a couple internships during school, one of which was a Network Engineer internship. 

    I applied to a position titled Network Engineer at my this current company. After months when I finally went in to interview they explained to me that this wasn't your typical internal IT team networking gig. Instead you are working with configuring networking stuff for their customer's systems. The interview went very well and they hit me two weeks later with a job offer that matched my salary range but...for a different position, titled Project Engineer. Found here https://osii.workable.com/j/C596F373E3

She explained the reason was that after they all talked about my interview, they all agreed I had a certain charisma that set me apart from the typical ""IT nerd"".

The HR gal assured me it was still a technical role and while it very much is, so far I have no evidence that it touches on any computer networking (which is where I want to focus my IT career). They did reassure me that I'll be able to move into other groups if need be. Whether or not that's right away or over time, I'm not sure.  This is only my first week but I feel very worried that this isn't what I want to be gaining experience in. 

 Any thoughts on what I should do?

I do have a goal that I want a master's degree, however I am leaning towards doing it after working for a few years and going into it later on (maybe a few years or so).

Reason being is one, I am absolutely sick of school. Been doing it for 17 straight years, and the I can taste the end of it. So being told, ""oh yeah you gotta another 2-3 years left,"" would just be outright bad. I just wanna get out there and do what I enjoy, experience the real world, and go to grad school with experience in my back pocket. I've also heard stories where sometime employers pay for it? Not expecting that to happen to me, but it's always worth a shot. I go to a small state school, not much in terms of internships and such here (employers are mostly at a big engineering school that's across the river from here anyway, lmao). My GPA is okay, not good or bad, 3.00 (exactly average) and I assume after this semester I will be about the same (maybe like a 3.05 or so).

So just firstly, is this an okay plan? I mean, shit happens and things can change but right now this is my goal and what I wanna do. A lot of people are telling me mixed things about this. Secondly, I have been questioning whether I wanna do a MS in Computer Science and Mathematics. I do have a Math minor here at the school, and pretty much has me take the classes that Math graduate admissions look for in a applicant (outside of an analysis class).

Thank you all for the help, and reading through this. If I am coming off as some whiny 20 year old, I do apologize I am not trying to be that way. I am just simply asking for some advice here!

I completed my undergrad in mechanical engineering nearly 2 years ago. Having got under the top 50 ranking in my batch

 ""BUT"" 

I didn't do any internships and focused on my research works even after completing my bachelor's for 6 to 7 months I did research works and after that decided to do my master's so I started to prepare for my entrance exams it took another 4 to 5 months and I applied to the university's but got rejected and was depressed for some time again I decided to improve my scores and try again but I didn't apply for any university's this time.(was literally depressed and had severe anxiety problem)

So I decided to take some time off and did volunteering work like teaching children and animal welfare for 7 month's while preparing for my exams BUT now if I want to do my master's I need job experience.

During these past 2 years I didn't apply to many jobs (applied 4 jobs got a call from one of the companies but I didn't attend it because of my depression) and

Some time ago I got a internship for a company for 3 month's but I quit after a month because of the way they treat their employees and I didn't get a certificate for what I did there( I know I was the one who quite I probably deserve that )

I just don't know where to start or what to do

Should I send my resumes (tailored ones ofcourse:) ) to companies?

Should I go for internships ( and that to in what)?

Should I apply for start-ups ?

I have attended workshops and got some certificates in product development, six Sigma, lean manufacturing etc.

I am talented in mechanical design engineer/ product development / product design

I am also thinking about applying for research analyst/ business analyst) ( have interest in business)

I know this a unique problem I just don't know what to do, where I come from I am the black sheep in the family and I have few friends with whom I didn't keep touch due to my depression problems.( So I can't discuss it with them)

Also therapy is not a options in my society is considered like your some what mentally ill and should be thrown into a mental asylum and people would treat you differently (in a negative manner)

Feel like I've been mistreated and need some help.,kreempuffpt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b1h5ju/intern_applicant_feel_like_ive_been_mistreated/,"TL;DR: I'm a Sophomore that applied to a summer internship that was looking for Juniors. Went through 4 rounds of interviews and received a verbal offer. After receiving the offer, the company tells me they're considering rescinding their offer because I'm a sophomore even though my graduation year is very clearly stated on my resume and I explicitly said I'm a sophomore in most if not all of my interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. From the top.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a sophomore in a US college studying CS. Earlier this year I was sending out a bunch of internship applications. Taking the advice of this sub and career advisers at my school I always apply even if it says they're looking for juniors. Worst that can happen is they just don't consider me, right? I see an application for a huge company in my area. It says they're looking for Juniors. I don't think twice about it and send my application which includes my resume and a very clear ""Graduating in 2021."" A few weeks later I get an email to schedule a technical interview. The interview comes around and I do a quick introduction. I'm pretty certain I specify ""Hi I'm u/kreempuffpt, I'm a second year at my university."" The interview moves forward. It's a couple coding questions. And I make it to the next round.

&amp;#x200B;

They give me a ""homework assignment."" It's basically a sheet with a problem on it that I have about a week and a half to solve and in the next interview I give my solution. In the week leading up to the interview I worked extremely hard on my solution. Definitely sacrificed actual school work and sleep. In the end I thought it was worth it since when I presented my solution my interviewers seemed to be pleased with my work. I ask my interviewers what the next step is and they say it's a quick behavioral interview with a manager and then that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later I get an email to schedule said interview. The interview comes around. It goes well. I give and take with the manager. Answer some questions. Ask some questions. It goes well. I make absolutely sure to specify that I'm a second year in the interview. At the end of the call the manager says that based on my tech interviews and this one, it looks like they're going to be giving me a call soon. I know this is nothing for certain but in my head I'm thinking this looks like it's going to end well for me. I take it easy and expect to hear from them soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 week passes, 2 weeks pass, nothing. I get a little worried and email my recruiter. They say that they're going to set up a quick interview that I don't have to prepare for with a manager. I really don't know what's going on at this point but I'm just going to go with it. The interview rolls around and I realize this is the exact same interview (same questions) I had two weeks ago but with a different manager. I'm extremely confused and nervous at this point. I tell the person interviewing me ""Hey I actually already had an interview similar to this with \[insert other manager name\]. Was this supposed to happen?"" The guy says no and that this must have been a mistake and that he'll contact the recruiter to solve this problem. I'm worried that there's something missing from the records of the recruiter so I send them an email specifying each of my 4 interviews and what their contents were. Later that day I receive an email from my recruiter that is very very explicitly a verbal offer. They say they ""Would like to offer \[me\] an internship position"" They say that ""this email will serve as notification of your offer."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The email requests some information (including graduation year). They say they will follow up with the official offer (pay, start date, etc) after I fill out the information. In my head I'm thinking ""Okay, they have known from the moment I submitted my application that I'm graduating in 21. I also told them explicitly multiple times that I'm a second year, there is no way they'll be able to rescind the offer at this point."" I submit the information. Finally, the arduous application process is over.

&amp;#x200B;

About half an hour later I get a call from my recruiter. ""Hey /u/kreempuffpt, are you a sophomore?"" I beat around the bush a little bit but I end up telling them.... ""Yeah, like it said on my resume, like I explicitly said in my interviews."" They tell me that this is going to impact their ability to give me an offer. They have to submit a request to a superior to approve it. They have brought on sophomore interns before but they told me it's like a 50/50 chance I make it through at this point. I asked why they kept interviewing me if they knew that they wouldn't be able to give me an offer. They said that a lot of the time students end up changing their status and are able to graduate a year or a semester early. I never once suggested during the process that I'd be able or willing to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly just feel deceived and mistreated. This process has been so stressful and has taken a serious toll on me mentally. I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship. I'm desperate for this offer so I feel like they could literally ask anything of me and I'd do it. Does anyone have advise for what I could do? I was thinking of sending an email to the recruiter or their superior and explain that I've been completely honest and diligent through the whole process and that I feel like it's unfair for them to rescind their offer at this point. I still want to work with them. They're a huge company and I feel like I could gain a lot of experience from them. It's also probably the last prospect I have of having an actual engineering internship for the summer. "

I’m an electrical engineering student (junior) and I currently have 2 offers for an internship for the summer. Keep in mind both of them might offer full time positions once I graduate.

   First offer - relatively small company that is growing pretty fast (they make kitchen supplies for fast food restaurants). They offered $21/hour and they are located 1 hour and a half away from Chicago.

   Second offer - engineering consulting company related to construction. They offered me $18/hour to work on the office downtown Chicago.

Now, I like the downtown location A LOT more for many reasons (not going to list them here), but is it worth taking the downtown job with that low of a pay? I know people who are going to be working downtown (also engineers) that will be getting $30/hour.

I also know that the second company sometimes requires people to work on weekends, while the first has many reviews on how work-life balance is good and they have many benefits. But the second one also has a nice work hard play hard motto and people seem to be very nice (and everyone there is also younger, which isn’t something I’m looking for, but it would be nice to work with people closer to my age).

If you could give me some advice so I can make a decision, it would be very much appreciated!"

I have been very active on A2C throughout the class of 2023 season and I think my experience is pretty indicative of what most people who apply to T20s can expect. I think my overall profile puts me in the running, but obviously not guaranteed anywhere. My goal is to provide as much info for future applicants. I had a pretty rough season, so expect the reflections to be rather bitter although I think I had a few decent points with regard to what you should expect.

**I am being as descriptive as possible, but the summaries and most important info of each section are in bold.** Hopefully my results will show you how truly random this process is. 

**So far I have heard back from a few schools, but I still have many left and will update as they come out. The full list of schools I applied to is at the bottom of the post.** 

Now for the rundown of my application:

***Background:***

**White Male in NC going for Chemistry with a premed intention. I hyper shotgunned T20s because I had a ton of free time and supportive parents.** I have only gone to public high schools. My father died when I was young and I have been living with my mother, step-father, and a stepbrother who has cerebral palsy (more on him later). I lived with au-pairs (basically foreign babysitters that live with you for 1-2 years at a time) throughout elementary school. In middle school I lived in San Francisco, CA but moved to a rural town in Nebraska (under 10k total population) for 2 years. We did not have APs/honors courses and the majority of kids did not attend college, must less a top school. **We did not have a weighted GPA due to only having 1 ""level"" of class (i.e. regular).** I moved back to NC in 11th grade and loaded up on APs/honors. This is major context for my application. My stepfather was recently diagnosed with cancer, but it hasn't majorly impacted my grades.

***Stats:***

**GPA:** Officially 3.88UW but colleges see **3.95UW** when non-academic classes (PE/typing) are taken out. My only B in an academic class was in freshman English. Due to not having a weighted GPA for 2 years my weighted GPA is a  **4.20W. My weighted GPA should be irrelevant due to context though.** On my commonapp I only reported my UW although my transcript shows a weighted. So far I have taken 5 college classes, (calc based Physics 1&amp;2 with labs and Calculus 3). **My college GPA is a 4.0.**

**Class Rank:** Class rank at my school is based off of weighted GPA which due to my context should be irrelevant. **My rank is 60/475 which is top 12.6%.**

**Rigor:** For those first 2 years there was no such thing a less/more rigor due to all classes being the same. In junior year I took Chem Honors, AP Lang, AP Calc AB, AP Calc BC, AP Stats, World History Honors, and American History 2 Honors. That summer I enrolled at a local university and took College Physics 1 w/ Lab which is equivalent to Physics C. In senior year I took AP Lit, Calculus 3 at a local university, AP Chemistry, Spanish 3 Honors, and College Physics 2 w/ Lab. **I have 100% taken the maximum rigor available. I am the only student at my school dual enrolled at a 4-year university.**

**ACT:** My ACT is comprised of two scores both 32s. My first score was **32C (34E, 35M, 28R, 32S).** My second score was **32C (30E, 32M, 35R, 30S).** These scores superscore to a **34C (34E, 35M, 35R, 32S).**

**SAT 2s:** **Math 2 (800)**, Physics (650). I only sent my Physics score to Harvard, MIT, and Cornell. MIT/Cornell require Math+Science, and Harvard basically requires 2 subject tests for those who aren't low-income. Since I had not taken Physics 2 when I initially took my physics test I suspect that the negatives from it were minimized, and for most schools it's not a requirement. Note for some reason, engineering/CS programs often require or heavily look at subject tests.

***Extracurriculars:***

1. Published 2 research papers in the field of Chemistry and Materials Science. Presenting more research at university symposium in April. I submitted an abstract to all of the schools that allow it. Both papers were published in low-impact peer reviewed materials science journals with me as the 1st author and my mentor as the 2nd.

2. Stepbrother has CP, and throughout middle school/high school I have spent a significant amount of time volunteering at events he attends and taking care of him when my parents aren't around. This is something that stretches well beyond standard volunteering and is arguably the most important aspect of my application. These events are anything from stuff like mock dances for disabled people in the area to volunteering at special sporting events. I spoke a lot about how my personal connection to this community was what made me unique and in my interviews it was a major focus. So much so I had 2 interviewers (Brown/Cornell) contact me after the interview about more info to give to admissions.

3. My mom is a nurse practitioner, and I have gone to shadow at her workplace several times. I have followed around her colleagues as they went to check up on patients, and spectated 3 surgeries (2 open heart, 1 neuro). I wouldn't call it an internship since I am not officially tasked with things (I was only 16-17). Though for premed, this is a good thing to have.

4. Varsity Science Olympiad/Math Team, competing in 3 events and placed in all of them. I also mentor a JV (freshman) member who has autism.

5. Tutoring, I tutor math after school as well as over the internet. Not a unique thing, but just something else. My YouTube channel has had like 5k views last month. I mostly used it to upload videos of doing integrals/derivatives I found interesting. Something I did a lot was upload videos of myself explaining how to solve integrals from the MIT integration bee. I also did short (10min) recaps of formulas/concepts in each of the major calculus units. 

6. In 10th grade I started playing in gaming tournaments with my friends and in 10th/11th grade we practiced and placed well in a few tournaments (amounted to about $900) overall. 

7. I lifeguard occasionally, but never had a serious job. Just a few positions here and there for a month.

***Recommendations &amp; Essays:*** 

**Recommendations:**

I got a strong recommendation from my tutor who is an MIT alum that used to teach calculus at Westpoint. I got a good recommendation from my research mentor who is a physics professor at my local university. I got a good recommendation from my AP Lang teacher who I had a strong personal connection with. Decent recommendations from my College Physics 1 professor as well as my counselor. My counselor echoed the context of my GPA/rank in her recommendation. I also got a good peer rec for Dartmouth.

**Essays:**

Arguably the most hit or miss^(ig they never miss) part of my application.

**My CommonApp essay** was about growing up with au-pairs throughout elementary school and how the unique relationship I had with people who were barely old enough to drink affected my perspective of the world compared to my friends who lived in normal father/mother households. I spoke about how visiting my grandfather in the UK was like getting to revisit my biological father and that it had a major impact on my relationship with my family and my au-pairs. Overall I think it was a good essay, and certainly unique (I've never met anyone who has had au-pairs in the wild other than people my au-pairs knew).

I will list schools based on whether I thought I had good supps for them. **You will notice that on some of these I still got in despite feeling worse about the supps.** If anyone wants more detail on why I think one way about a specific school's supp then PM me and I can give you a summary of my thoughts on my supps. **I don't think any of my supps would work against me though.**

**Good Supps:**

MIT, Duke, UChicago, Johns Hopkins, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Brown, Vanderbilt (duh), Cornell, NCSU, Stanford (Took a lot of risks on Stanford because I knew essays were important), Rice

**Weak Supps:**

UNC, GaTech, Harvard, Penn, Dartmouth, Northwestern, WashU

***Reflections:*** 

Welp season is finally done, and I did not expect to get straight up rejected from literally every RD so rant about how I feel my application was handled inc.

Just kinda dumbstruck that I got GT with merit, but then nothing. I'm likely going to commit to UNC which is a good school although I am fairly disappointed considering I just thought I would get another option given my app and how many schools I applied to. **Truthfully, I think transferring high schools simultaneously gave me a competitive app and killed my app. I got a ton of new opportunities that I took advantage of (research, shadowing, AP classes, killer state schools, etc.) but also had to deal with the downsides (unfixable class rank/weighted GPA, form new bonds to get recs, transfer to boarding school, etc).** I know that the fact that I took advantage of these opportunities is what's important, but now I have to do it all over again for med school and by time I get to that step, it will probably be fucking impossible to get in. Bachelors degrees have gotten to the point where it's so easily attainable you *have* to go to some form of grad school to do anything. Literally everyone I know that isn't in CS, is planning on doing grad school. You know what doesn't matter one bit when you have a graduate degree? Where you went for your undergrad. A person with a graduate degree from UNC or NC State or any standard state school is way more qualified than someone with a bachelors from MIT or Harvard. Both my parents have PHds, and they have both always considered undergrads to be irrelevant and merely stepping stones for graduate degrees. My mom went to University of Phoenix for her bachelors but did a masters at Duke back in the mid 2000s. 

**I look forward to college because I anticipate a time when I can go back to thinking about school instead of trying to figure out whether I have a 3% or 5% chance at Stanford. I applied to college not to say I went somewhere, but to actually learn something, so let's actually do that.** I'll have all the time in the world to worry about admissions again when I am applying for grad/med schools.

All of the kids in the top 10 at my school got amazing offers i.e. full rides at UNC/NCSU or T20 acceptances. **I'll just be candid and straight out and say that my application was stronger than all of the kids at my school other than the valedictorian who has been having an equally shit season as me because she is Asian.** Our #2 got into Duke RD (more on that later) and the #3 was rejected Yale EA but got a major UNC scholarship. My application was easily stronger than #2 and #3 stats wise and even EC wise.

I admit for these schools rejection is always in the cards. Though I can't help but think I was robbed a little bit when it comes to how my application was read. To not get 1 waitlist in RD makes me think that my application was thrown in with all of the pipe dream applications. **I swear to god, my unrepresentative class rank turned what could've been a good application with a decent shot at some of these schools into me just getting weeded out.**

I've lost a lot of respect for some of these schools. It's certainly changed my view on what these institutions actually add to society. Everyone says there is some grand meaning behind admissions practices and that AOs are gods at determining fit/academic potential on campus. The fact of the matter is that they aren't, they just want higher numbers to flex higher stats to get more endowment for their graduate school where the actual advancement is done. **Colleges are a business, and they market the achievements of the graduate school with the face of the ""smart, hip, and diverse"" undergraduate population.** Something needs to change or in our attempts to distance ourselves from the privileged history of top schools, we will end up returning to it but in a more soul crushing way. The fact that top schools have allowed this to happen in the United States of America is gross. 


I used to shit on Caltech/Oxbridge for being super stats focused, but I'd much rather have it be a real measure of stats than a fake measure of character. In 15 years, IIT Cambridge isn't going to be a joke. We're already nearing a 1% RD acceptance rate at Stanford/Harvard.

b1lh9a,4,2019-03-15,Is it a bad idea to work full time while studying engineering full time?,Joshalander,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/b1lh9a/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_work_full_time_while_studying/,"Background on me:

I'm a 20yo MechE student in my sophomore year with basically a full ride scholarship so long as I attend full time. I have been working part time 25-30 hrs at an Amazon warehouse 15 mins from my dorm for about a year now working 8pm-6am 3 days a week just fine with my busy class schedule. I have recently accepted a job as a mechanical assembler for an engineering company to assemble machines, which I believe would help me gain experience, and potentially join their engineering team in 2 years when I graduate. They are located a little over an hour away, but said they would be willing to give me 25-30 hours if I desire and would work with my class schedule. Problem is, they only operate from 7am-4pm Mon-Fri and I originally told them I could work 4 days a week so long as I have no exams. Well, now that I think about it, I have class everyday but Friday(mainly night classes), and that would be around 50 hours of physical labor I'd be doing a week, in addition to school full time. So my plan is I'm thinking of telling them I can only work 2 days a week, on the days I work Amazon at night and have no classes the whole day so that I can spend the other days of my week studying, but I don't know if that would be a good idea changing my availability after only a day of working and fear it might make me look bad asking for only 15 hrs a week. Its either that or just quit which I would hate to do. I do not want to leave Amazon since I get benefits, its so close to me, the times are perfect, and my coworkers keep me sane and mentally stable after a long week of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

So thank you to anyone who read my rant, if not, basically I'm just wondering if this is a good idea or not and if I should continue with 2 jobs doing 40hrs/week and gain the hands on experience, or just quit and keep my 1 job at Amazon so I can focus more on school and just try to get internships during my summers?

It's pretty easy to find extracurriculars in HS: we had teachers who had tons of connections and programs in my school that helped with that, and there are tons of outside programs available specifically for highschool students, like internships at labs or firms and stuff like that. But as a freshman in college I'm guessing most extracurriculars would only be available to upperclassmen, and the most I can do is participate in clubs and stuff there.


For reference, I'm interested in Computer science and labwork (bio and chem), and I'm pretty good at drawing and drawing fundamentals. I've also taken college-level writing courses (not stated as college level but they're college-difficulty at my school) for two years so I'm a pretty skilled writer. So how do I get extracurriculars? Is it really more difficult than obtaining them as an HS student, or am I completely wrong in my assumption?


Thanks for any advice, I really appreciate it :)"

Personal Info - I’m a 2nd year at USF studying Business Analytics and Information Systems(basically MIS) minoring I’m IT. Looking to graduate into a Sys Admin, I would love to do Project jobs and eventually leading into being s consultant/contracting and run my own IT firm.

Enough about me, I have a couple questions.
I went into a interview for a internship with MarineMax and I thought it went magnificent, I kept trying to keep on contact but absolutely no response. Do you guys think I should wait until next year to apply to internships (3rd year).
Or 
Should I continue applying for internships and Desktop part times??

What road would you map for a College kid looking for Sys Admin work once he graduates?"

I only have 2 classes I have to show up in (the others are online) and I struggle to do that. I work in a government building doing IT (an internship) and I noticed quickly that there are no repercussions to people just calling off a lot. Unfortunately, I got into this habit and with nothing stopping me it's hard to break. When I was younger and not in school I worked a shitty farm job 56 hours a week. I just don't understand where my work ethic went. I feel overwhelmed even though I am doing so much less. 

How do I fix this? Even when I take a day off (like today when I have no classes) it just goes by so fast and I don't feel refreshed at all. Can anyone give my any advice to get myself back into the crazy work ethic I once had?

I currently am in the position where I need to choose between allstate and Cisco for a software engineering summer internship for the summer after my junior year. This will probbaly be important because it effects my full time offer for after I graduate. I know allstate pays a high full time salary of around 81k in the Texas area I am in, not sure about Cisco but heard it's around 70k a lot lower in comparison. The Cisco internship I'm in pays roughly the same as allstate. Cisco seems to be a bigger more valuable brand name that can get me to a bigger company, but allstate is basically guaranteed full time for a much higher starting salary.  What do you think I should choose I am very conflicted over this?"

It’s not that I didn’t try, but it was hard for me. 

I scrambled to rearrange my life and ended up back at my local community college to get a degree in IT as a software developer. Though I’ve been doing a lot better (all A’s), I feel as if I fell short of my expectations for myself and feel ashamed of the fact that I won’t be graduating from a university. 

I don’t know how to get over this feeling. It’s not like anybody makes me feel bad about it besides me. My mom was super understanding and was proud I worked to get back into the local college so soon after being kicked out. My friends and boyfriend told me it was okay and that there’s nothing wrong with graduating from a community college. 

Yet I can’t seem to accept my position. I’m glad I’m getting a bachelors but it doesn’t feel legit. I currently work at a engineering firm as an intern and it took me months to swallow my pride and let them know I “switched” majors, they were okay with it but I felt so embarrassed. I’m not sure why the shame  has lingered for so long 
even with everyone in my life accepting what happened. 

Any advice? 

Edit: Thank you so much for all your comments. I got home and didn’t expect to see so many people taking the time to answer. I think the hardest part about this was not having people in my life that have had similar experiences so reading everyone’s comment made me feel more normal in a way. I’m going to always look back at this thread if I ever have any doubts or shames about where I’m at and I’m going to try to feel more proud about what my failures and achievements have taught me! "

Long time lurker, made the plunge and created an account. I see a lot of posts about people applying to internships and the process and I'm unfamiliar with it all. Honestly, seems a little scary so I want to be prepared when my time comes.

I recently changed my major to a hybrid computer engineering program that focuses on IoT beginning May 2019. I'll be a junior, but taking 2000 level courses in the summer such as Java. I'm trying to figure out how to layout my classes to be ready for internships Summer of 2020, however, I would like to start applying for Spring internships if the opportunity arises. Should I have already completed all the 3000s level courses? Or are there specific classes or subjects I should have under my belt before then? (I only know C++, so far.)


For example, should I definitely have data structures, embedded operating systems, and Unix down before I even bother applying?

b1o1q5,11,2019-03-15,Is a masters worth doing?,trojanrob,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/b1o1q5/is_a_masters_worth_doing/,"I know this question gets asked many times, but I was thinking, as im coming to the end of my final year - I can always switch to MComp degree and get student funding akin to UG (11k) instead of the Postgraduate financing which leaves a lot less after take home fees.

So technically, while the option of a masters would be cheaper than stand alone - will it be worth a years worth of salary?

Pros:
- If I get 2:2 then MComp would cover it up
- proper UG finance
- another chance to be summer intern
- higher academic qualifications
- masters can specialise I.e big data spec 
- some firms let you start higher or with slightly more pay
- get to be a student and delay real life lol

Cons:
- opportunity cost of years salary and experience (I.e at least 20k salary plus a years of career progression)
- doesn’t necessary guarantee a better job
- bit bored, wanna graduate and look into postgrad a few years as a professional instead of a typical student

I was personally thinking of taking Big Data, Cloud, Security, InfoSec and Enterprise Middleware modules.

Here are Newcastle’s modules: https://www.ncl.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/g405/#coursedetails

What do you guys think? Will it set back my career? My careers goals are to get a years exp and try for big 4 every year whilst working in React or something "

I just started a position a week ago as an Observation Tech in the psychiatric unit of a hospital. (If you don’t have this at your local unit, I essentially just do safety rounds.) I’ve also been doing my internship with a partial hospitalization program for children and teens, although I primarily work with kids in Acute when I go in the classrooms, and have a lot of case manager-type duties. 

I’m typically really calm in the workplace, which is awesome, considering I’m typically the anxious type. I just know that stability is needed when there’s utter chaos. But that doesn’t mean that what I see doesn’t make me sad. 

Tuesday night was my third ever shift. I had already seen some outlandish stuff and was fine, but that night I witnessed something that just filled me with incredible sadness. This was also on the children’s unit. I got off work at 11:30 PM. It was very hard to sleep after that. It was even harder to get up at 6:30 AM the next morning after hardly sleeping and have to be emotionally present for my clients at the internship site. 

I talked to my supervisor at my internship, since she had worked at the same hospital for 10 years at one point. There was a lot else we talked about, since I’m having some concerns about how unprepared I feel-training wise in that place, plus some other ethical stuff. But when I suggested the idea of primarily working 1st shift on the days I’m available for that, she said that wouldn’t be likely to happen, since everyone wants that shift and I just started working there.

So, I have to be able to handle second shift and still going to sleep when that happens. What are some ways that you guys have dealt with this issue????"

b1pcai,2,2019-03-16,Need help deciding whether to finish a Computer Science degree,ehscrewyou,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/b1pcai/need_help_deciding_whether_to_finish_a_computer/,"Hey everyone, I've reached an interesting crossroads with my career; I'm looking for advice on what might be the best steps for me. If you have experience in the recruiting world, or have been in a similar experience, I would appreciate your opinion. I have a TL;DR for each part, I just wanted to give details, but I know some people don't got the time for that and I'm inclusive.   
 

I am currently attending a local community college in the Dallas, TX area getting as many transferable credits I can before going to a full university. I originally started studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science (started Fall 2016). All was going great until I hit Calculus, I have attempted it twice and dropped it both times. 

This time last year, I decided to change my focus to more of the design side, UX/UI, and changed my major to Graphic Design. I regret that decision, because if I'm honest with myself, I just did that to avoid Calculus - at least it was a GPA boost. I've changed back to Computer Science and have been doing everything I can that does not have Calculus as a pre-req, and I'm running out of those. I re-made my degree plan, and if I follow through with everything on it, I would be graduating in 2022 with about $15K - $20K in debt... :/

**TL;DR (PART I): CS Student, Calculus is scary. Switched to art degree, bad idea, so I switched back. Calculus still scary.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on the other side of things; I have an opportunity to start my career before graduating (TL;DR at the bottom). 

I work for a fairly small company as a remote live chat support agent, I've done so for the last year and a half. When I was in my final interviews, part of my pitch was that I was a CS student and I would be interested in development positions to grow into. I never really followed through, so nothing ever happened.

Last summer, I had a kick to develop something elaborate, so I made a project for the company. It was a proof of concept thing, and something to keep my mind busy during the summer. I showed my progress in company channels and it got some attention. I kinda reached a point of completion with that project, the next steps were pushing for production, and I was not really comfortable doing that yet (first major project in React.js). 

A few months ago, one of the co-founders (the business-side founder) of my company was in Austin asked if I could visit him out there. We talked about my story and the companies background that I had not known before. We talked about my education and where I want to be. We got on the topic about development and I asked about any junior positions or internships, and he said he'd talk with the more technical founder. Just based off the tone, I didn't think anything would come of it since I was still in college. 

Fast forward to just a few weeks ago, and I'm invited to fly out to Kyiv, Ukraine for a paid summer internship in Fullstack Development. If everything goes well, I would be hired as a Fullstack Developer for my company and finally get out of customer service. If I don't get the position, I will probably quit and go full steam ahead into school.  

**TL;DR (PART II): Made a project, got company's attention, offered me an internship half way across the world**

&amp;#x200B;

My original plan if I got the position, was to work M-F doing my job, and just do either night classes or weekend classes. I've told that to a few people and they just tell me how bad of an idea that is. Full-time student, full-time dev does sound like a 24/7 headache. I want a degree for some sense of security, but I don't want to waste $20,000 either.   


**Tl;DR (FINAL): In school for CS, but kinda struggling. Switched majors twice. Calculus sucks. My company offered me a paid internship in fullstack development in another country. Don't know what the best decision is for the future.**   


I guess what I'm looking for is, out of these options, which is the smartest for the estimated future of the industry: 

1. Take the internship, get that position and continue school at the same time.
2. Take the internship, get that position and drop-out of college
3. Take the internship, get the position, complete any commitments and quit and finish school
4. Decline the internship(?), quit customer service, go full tilt into college.
5. Other (please specify): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"

I've been looking at laptops for my CS degree (VMs, heavy coding), light gaming (League, Hollow Knight, Ori and the Blind Forest), Netflix, and for (this is important) video game development. I do everything from Unity to Unreal Engine 4, from 2D pixel art in Aseprite to 3D modelling in Blender and Maya. I need something that keeps up. 

I have a tower that I use primarily, but I intern across the country and need a laptop that allows me to function elsewhere. 

I bought and have been using for a couple of days the Eluktronics Mech 15 G2R with the following specs (info on ram and ssd later):

8750H 6-core
NVIDIA RTX 2060 6GB DDR6

However, I find the mechanical keyboard to be a tidbit loud and the edge where I rest my arms to be uncomfortably sharp. It's also a bit heavier with a bad touchpad. 

Performance-wise, it's a beast. That 2060 is a monster and the thermals are beyond compare. 

However, I was also looking at the Spectre x360 15t GEM-CUT from late 2018 with the specs:

8750H 6-core
1050 Ti Max-Q (4GB DDR(4 OR 5?))

Consider the RAM (16GB) and SSD (512GB) to be the same, because they are. I use my own stuff. 

If the Mech-15 was more comfortable, I'd never leave it. However, it's not very comfortable and is heavier than the Spectre. Overall, the Spectre is way more comfortable with a lighter weight and better visual design. I can also use it as a tabletop tablet, which let's me diagram stuff. Not a die-for feature, but it is cool to have. 

The primary difference between the two is the GPU. I'm not sure if I need all the power of the 2060. Since the Spectre has Thunderbolts, I could get an external GPU in a couple years and use that when I need it. This is one thing I'd like to have answered and hear opinions on. 

Otherwise, there's one other important thing: thermals. Good thermals are a must. Obviously, the Mech-15 has the better thermals. I just want to know if the Spectre would have thermal issues or throttling on any of the tasks I mentioned above. Keep in mind, I'm talking about the GEM-CUT Spectre from late 2018, which allegedly improves the thermal situation of the last iteration. Will it still have issues?

I'd like to keep it to just these two laptops.

Thanks for any input you can give me!"

b1qnka,1,2019-03-16,Take a risk with a startup or look elsewhere?,evilcockney,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/b1qnka/take_a_risk_with_a_startup_or_look_elsewhere/,"So I'm finally about to graduate with an MPhys (in the UK), and have been approached by a recruiter on LinkedIn (I won't be naming the recruiter or the company) to be in a research/modelling role with their company

There are two main concerns I've got with this being a startup and not something bigger. 

Firstly, I'm not really sure how confident I can be with job security - since I looked up the company and they currently only have one product which is still in the research /development phase (although they seem to have had a few big investments - which I suppose is a good sign)

Secondly, since I'll be a fresh graduate without much work experience (besides one summer research internship at my university) I'd like my first job to offer a lot of training, and feel as though with this I would just be thrown in the deep end.

Also, one more minor worry for me is that they approached me which makes it feel as though they're desperate for staff - but I'm not too sure if this actually is a red flag or just me worrying for no reason

Any thoughts?"

Instead, I’ve got interests in a lot of different careers, ranging from law to IBD - so when it comes to internships I’m rather lost. Before someone says it, yes, money and prestige is very important to me, I don’t know why, maybe it’s to do with my parents doing well and wanting to emulate that but still.

I’m looking at applying to the following areas upon graduation (from Durham University - as already live in London so didn’t bother applying to a London Uni - but it’s still a top uni in the U.K.):
1) Commercial Law at Big Law
2) Civil Service (Fast Stream)
3) Sales And Trading at a top bank
4) Corporate Finance at a top bank
5) BA at an MBB
6) M&amp;A at a top bank
7) Assurance at a Big 4 (was already offered an apprenticeship with one before uni, but rejected it to go uni - accountancy is probably my least favourable route to follow)

Firstly, is it realistic to apply to all these different areas and still have enough time to prepare for interviews, assessments etc.?

Secondly, an internship lasts about 8 weeks to 10 weeks I believe, would an internship at, say, IBD also cover Corporate Finance possibly? Or would I need a specific internship with Corporate Finance as well?

Thirdly, do banks care if you apply to a number of different roles at the same bank?

Finally, would an internship at one of these be detrimental to the chances of getting an offer to another?

I've just received an offer for a 3rd that would last 4 months , straight after that is my MSc, then a 4th internship and then PhD and a 5th internship during the PhD.

my question is, I don't feel like doing 4 months of work right now, and my supervisor says I could publish some of my work from my final year dissertation so I could work on that.

When it comes to applying to jobs in tech such as research scientist at Google and other companies, would there be a difference between my having 4 internships vs 5? Is it even worth doing this many or should I enjoy my summer's and study things that I've always wanted to learn.

I feel really torn between the fear that this internship could improve my career vs I feel that I need rest before the stsrt of my MSc.

Any advice or others who have been through this?

Don't know too much, but pay is $13.50 an hour.

The other job feels like a more obvious choice. It's an on campus job where I am a student assistant for a couple of buildings. I would also be troubleshooting PC's, projectors for classes and organizing rooms. Stuff like that. I would also deal with hardware, linux and probably some things to do with scripting. Projects would consist of potentially implementing things in the network or just playing around to learn. This job is only $11 an hour.

So, about that. I was offered a lab assistant position by a prominent PhD scientist at my school, and I was supposed to meet him for the first time yesterday to discuss that. However, I also had a final exam a couple hours later that day, and due to prior events it was imperative that I did well on that final (which, for the record, I'm pretty sure I aced, but that's beside the point). I was in panic mode studying for that final, and I had turned off my phone which is where I had set reminders to go to the meeting. My whole brain was focused on that final and I completely forgot to meet the professor. 

I realized it this morning as I woke up and looked at the date. Saturday. The day after I was supposed to meet him. I feel like absolute shit, and like I just threw away an important opportunity. I emailed him basically saying that I apologize, explaining the final but acknowledging that it's not an excuse, apologizing for wasting his time and understanding that this reflects very poorly on my reliability, and saying that I still want the position if he will still consider me for it.

There’s a steep learning curve for the administrative, on-boarding and payroll processes that I have fortunately mastered for the most part. With that being said, I admit that my job has taken a toll on my mental health. My manager’s behavior could be described as draconian (i.e. expecting me to acknowledge every email she sends, telling me to constantly smile, bluntly interrogating/humiliating me in front of everyone to explain my logic when an error is made). A number of my coworkers have approached me to ask why she treats me as such and if I’m okay. 

I recently attended a 1-on-1 meeting with my manager. I was told that my performance is satisfactory, but she is wondering why I haven’t approached her to ask for more work. Moving forward, she expects me to send her a list of tasks (with timestamps) on a daily basis. When I politely asked why this was necessary, she said she merely wanted to know how much work I could handle. I personally feel that I’m being treated worse than an intern and this abusive leadership is getting worse by the day. 

How should I approach this situation? I don’t know if emailing corporate HR would be appropriate.

I’m reaching the tipping point. Should I wait for her to terminate my employment (maybe even hint at it) or resign from my position?"

     I was wondering if I could get any advice on choosing my career? I'm new to working and finding out about this stuff, and I'd rather trust someone on here.
     So I'm a 19M college student under a transfer program, but my field of study is generalized so I could move to an associate's or keep going to a degree. I have a lot of various skills when it comes to things I could do to get paid for.
 [A] My first option is Logistics and Supply Chain Management. I've got high school work experience and I've apparently got a knack for it. it's cool and I seem to understand it easy enough, but I'm worried the warehouse work isn't for me. I like to work with people more often than not, although they seem to take notice of my ability to fix the SAP system on my own. I finnick, I mess around with it, I learn it.
 [B] My second option is Office Admin/Management. A lot of my professors tell me I have the personality and work ethic for management. I'm capable of learning and environment and keeping people to their responsibilities, and I have a tendency to think in what they call an ""expanded responsibility perspective"". I would enjoy the management but I hear office jobs can be depressing or overly stressful. Idk though.
 [C] my third option is some kind of IT engineering or software engineering. I love to code, I've taught myself HTML, and little of Python and more JavaScript. I plan to learn a lot more, I'm using Sololearn right now. I enjoy working with technology, it seems to make sense to me more than some, and I have gotten good at fixing and showing people how their computers work (or lack there of). I'm mostly worried here about job security. I have no idea what kind of market IT or software has job wise.

     So yeah there is my situation. I have no idea what I should do. I like all three of these career types, my only worry is finding one that I'll like, that'll make me decent money for it to be worth the degree, and Jon security. I don't want to be trying to find another employer every 6 months. I want to build a career with a company I'd enjoy working for. Also, for anyone who thinks I should just ""try them all out with internships"", I'm not able to do that because I'd need to be choosing that major/field of study. I can only get an internship if I'm studying that thing in school.

     TL:DR - I need a good career with job security, decent wages, and to work for a good company. I'm torn between Supply Chain Management, Business Admin/Management, and IT/Software Engineering.


Thank you to all who reply!

I am going to college in the fall and I want to major in mechanical engineering. I have narrowed down the schools that I am considering to Maryland and Virginia Tech. I have been accepted into both and money is not a factor. 

There are a few things that are holding me back from a decision.

For Virginia Tech I was accepted into the general engineering school. For Maryland I was accepted into their letters and sciences school and I have to apply to their engineering school. I am not sure how much of an advantage it is to start off in the engineering school  rather than applying to it.

One thing that holds me back from Virginia Tech is the location. Blacksburg seems like it is in the middle of nowhere. I know that If I go to school in a more populated area there will probably be more opportunities for internships, Co-ops, etc.. I could probably find these somewhere else in VT but I am not sure how much of an advantage it is to have more of those opportunities close to me. Virginia Tech does make their students work for their last year of school so it may not be that much of an disadvantage. I also know there are some companies that recruit at colleges. It seems to me that recruitment may happen more at Maryland than Virginia Tech. Since Maryland is close to DC there are probably more opportunities because there are so many companies that have offices close by.

Also, Blacksburg doesn’t seem very lively. It seems like whenever I want to have fun I have to do it on campus.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have two internship offers at the moment. I'm an undergraduate CompSci student.

&amp;#x200B;

One internship offer is more relevant towards the line of work I want to be in (data analyst)

&amp;#x200B;

The second one is aligned towards IT (I still want to work in IT too, but at this present moment, it's data science that interests me a bit more)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck between the two, because at the interview for internship #1, the panel said there will be an opportunity to take on part-time employment with them during my university studies, and I feel that is going to be invaluable experience on top of my summer internship. Also, I won't need to go through the annoyance of another interview + application form. I also really liked the panel members and the work environment seemed a lot more pleasant + relaxed

&amp;#x200B;

The data analyst internship is just an internship - no opportunity for part time employment afterwards as there is no business need for it

Here, we have 6 4-month internships in our degree, which makes it 5 years long. So knowing that I'm doing computer engineering, how much of getting a software job is self learnt?

Is most of what you learn to get an interview and pass it learnt in courses or by yourself.

I know that you need side projects too, which are usually done outside courses.

I'm asking because I want to compare it to CS and CS students. Do they need to self learn or do they learn everything needed in class?

I have gotten offers for both of these programs and have been super confused.

I am leaning more towards GBDA due to the business aspect and internship. I want to focus on Branding, Web and UX Design.

**GBDA**

* $10k - 15k w/ Meal Plan &amp; Residence (This is without Tuition)
* 4 Month Paid Internship - Summer of Year 3 and 4
* Workload is decent, a lot of projects and group work
* Nothing city like, old buildings, many stores

Pros

* Business Aspect
* 4 Month Paid Internship
* Waterloo Coop/Internship Connection
* Design Contests
* Group work/Projects/Small Group (200 Students)

Cons

* Cost of program
* Being in Stratford 3 years

&amp;#x200B;

**York Design**

* $10k - $12k - Don't need residence
* 3 Week Non-Paid Placement - 3 or 4 year
* Heavy workload, a lot of projects and group work
* “Many sleepless nights” - Student comment
* First 2 years is boring, less freedom. More basics and theory for the first 2 years BUT helps a lot in 3rd and 4th year
* Campus is big, area around it is okay, nothing great

Pros

* Industry connections - A lot more design focused
* Small group (72 Students)
* Design Contests
* 3 Main Streams - Many Web design/UI/UX/Branding courses
* Could stay home

Cons

* 3 Week Non-Paid Placement
* Sheridan disconnection
* Strike problem

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions I wanted to ask to students at Waterloo that are in GBDA or know about it:

How is it? Do you like it and would you recommend it?

How are the courses? I mainly want to focus on branding, Ui/Ux, and Web design so are there many courses relating to those? I know 2 of these are York Design's specialties

What are your thoughts on the York Design program?

York's program seems to be more connected into the design industry then Waterloo but not sure how well Waterloo is connected to the DESIGN industry.

Any info helps, I know this is a lot and I might be overthinking but I just want to make sure I don't regret my decision in the future:)

b1zg0f,2,2019-03-16,"Planning to Get BS Degree over Summer, I don't know where to go next",SukaNekoto,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/b1zg0f/planning_to_get_bs_degree_over_summer_i_dont_know/,"A bit of background about myself... I'm a 22 year old female, and live in Bakersfield, CA. I haven't had any job yet, but I've done internships here and there. Basically I couldn't afford any time to pursue a job harder because of my living situation with my parents and brother. Ya see, my brother is currently 18, turning 19 next month, and is severely autistic to the point where he can't do almost anything by himself and is extremely stubborn to be taught anything. If you want to know more details about it, you can always ask me and I can even show proof. This is an important note for later, trust me.

Anyway, I think now that I'm almost done with university, it's finally time to try and do something about myself. Unfortunately, it's not what I originally wanted to do with my life... I am getting a Business Administration BS because my parents wanted me to, when I originally wanted to do something in art. My parents said that I am a terrible artist who would have no future, and even if I wanted to go to an art school out of town they wouldn't let me even get a loan to try, so I stayed in my town to get the degree they wanted me to get instead. I like learning about business though, and I do think business is important to learn for all sorts of jobs, but I don't have any ambition to go anywhere with it like I did with art... At this point, I'd be happy to get any job and move to a cheap apartment, but my parents would never allow me to move out with minimum wage. It's understandable.

I should move out soon though. My parents will finally be getting help for my brother. In 2015, I was in a severe car accident with my parents, and we won with a good amount of money to spare after medical expenses to try and help my brother. So, my parents are stressed about me staying here. They want me to leave, but at the same time, because of how over-protective they had to be to raise my brother, they want me to move out by following their extremely strict standards, which is almost impossible. They have strict standards partially because they at the same time, don't want me to move out, because I'm the only other person in the family who knows how to take care of my brother, so it's a paradox.

I think at this point, if I were to continue with my Business degree, I think International Business interests me, and I've been studying a lot of Japanese the past year and a half and want to do something with it. I rather hinted at it with my parents by saying ""I want to take the JLPT test"", but they refused at first. It was only until today when I convinced my cousin to help me go that they are more okay with it, but I think they know the implications of me taking the test will do. I may need to move out to a city which has more of a Japanese population than Bakersfield if I want to do something in that field, like Los Angeles, San Diego, or even Japan itself.

I have maybe around $9000 for myself after I get finished with University this year to spend, and all this money is mostly from the car accident. I do have other certificates though that I got from taking summer classes at Bakersfield College, such as Job Readiness and Customer Service, which I think can also be used for something, but of course it'll be extremely difficult for me to move out and also get a job. It's dangerous to live alone in Bakersfield in an apartment, and it's expensive to move out without a roommate, but I don't know where to find good roommates... One of my online friends said that their company in Japan hires foreigners and I could try to apply to be a translator and they'd help me with an apartment and roommate, but my parents would never accept this. They'll be pissed that I'm going so fucking far away and they trust no roommates whatsoever and that they won't let me stay with anyone who doesn't follow their strict standards and I don't know how to tell them that I'd be moving to Japan if I did that other than either lie and say ""I'm only going traveling"" or just flat out sneak out the window at night....

I dunno. Am I a lost cause? I really don't know what to do at this point... But I should do something soon.

(As a side note, I did try moving out once when I was 20 to Utah with a roommate, but my parents threatened to close my bank account, rearranged my packed belongings, and did things such as remove the door from my room, only talked with me by yelling, saying how much they regret even having me as a child if I moved out so far, etc to prevent me from going... I can't just say ""I'm an adult and I want to make my own decisions"" especially if it's farther than Utah, because I'm scared what they'll do...)"

I have posted here quite a bit the last two weeks just because I have had lots of general questions. I would like to start off by thanking you all for all of your help. This subreddit has been an amazing tool, and an amazing guide for making a well informed decision.




Using all information given to me in previous threads, I have narrowed down my countries of choice to move to as Belgium being first, and the Netherlands being second.


I have weighed pros and cons in regards to comparing the two countries to each other


Belgium Pros




* Allows dual citizenship 



* Has a better and more affordable housing market 



* I speak 2/3 official languages



* Decent distance from other European countries


Netherlands Pros



* Thriving tech scene 



* [-Dual Citizenship is becoming legal possibly](https://www.neweurope.eu/article/the-netherlands-moves-to-allow-dual-citizenship-2019/)



* I can do a semester abroad there, opening the doors possibly to possible work experience 


Now these are both very good countries to live in based on my research, however there are some cons too that I need to address.


Belgium Cons

* Tech scene is not as lively and unemployment is higher, meaning it may be tougher to find a job, though obviously not impossible.

Netherlands Cons

* Housing market is extremely expensive
* No guarantee I will not have to renounce Canadian citizenship 


So my main question would be, does anyone have any specific insight into the Belgian Software Development industry? I am aiming to become a Fullstack developer, however I am also open to working in IT.

I also got a job as a Web Developer for the school newspaper, and I am going be working summer internships (in Canada I assume) before graduation giving me about 3~ years of real experience. I'm sure this adds something to the playing field


Also, I was wondering if there were any schools in Belgium that offer CS in English for exchange students, as I would love to study in Belgium given the opportunity.


*I speak French and German, however I am just now starting to learn Dutch.

I see lot of posts by programmers with adhd saying how programming is a perfect job for their condition.

&amp;#x200B;

One major symptom of adhd is poor working memory. You can't keep much information in your mind in the short term.

&amp;#x200B;

For example I forget the variable I declared or the name of the function I wrote a few minutes ago. Or, I am debugging an issue by googling for solutions online. I forget which solution I tried and what happened. Have to keep all the tabs open in browser. I refer fields in a table and when I am about to code I forget them. The list goes on. This is harder when working with javascript due to lack of strong typing. You look up a table and go back to the code and you have forgotten the fields. 

&amp;#x200B;

 For remembering things in the long term I use spaced repetition software anki an it seems to be working. Like when learning a new framework.

&amp;#x200B;

So, about the people with adhd who enjoy programming, are they just a subset who don't experience problems with short term memory?"

b21p4c,11,2019-03-17,Anybody else somewhat struggling from transition of UK based grading to US grading?,corimaith,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b21p4c/anybody_else_somewhat_struggling_from_transition/,"As somebody who has been part of the UK/European education system from the start, where it was pretty much an 80% for an A* for most courses, I have to say that now, being at a US based university it's definitely somewhat trickier to get that A/A* with the 90% grade cutoff on most of my courses. Alot of this comes from the fact that I do think that it is somewhat difficult to maintain effectively 90% on all assignments, and that one fuckup basically dooms you to a B for the rest of the course. 

Of course, my current assignments and grading is definitely far more lenient here in the US compared to the UK, some of the essays where I got A here definitely would be only a B level, but at the same time, especially with ambiguous questions/silly mistakes, it's very easy to loose marks with much larger consequences. 

While I do believe that 'B's are good, as a CS Major I do want to get that higher gpa for eventual internships and potential grad schools.

Any thoughts?"

Not only is the minimum qualifications a ridiculously long list that better describes an intermediate developer, but the preferred qualifications sound like it's describing a senior engineer. 

The kicker? The education section lists Master's Degree + 10 to 12 years of experience designing large-scale system architecture... 

If someone with those credentials and experience is a junior, I may as well quit this industry and go live off-the-grid as a caveman. 

Also, a related anecdote. I observed one of the companies I used to work for hire a new grad with no internships for a position that supposedly ""required"" 3+ years of experience. Props to the new grad for the hustle and for impressing the interviewers. But again, what was the point of the hard requirement if it didn't matter in the end? (rhetorical question)

I'm an international student who's been admitted to both Penn State (University Park all four years) and Rutgers New Brunswick for Computer Science. I've been searching the internet for the past month trying to see something that will help me choose one over the other but nothing I've read so far has helped.

All everyone is discussing is:

\-affordability, which should be overlooked in my case (government scholarship),

\-partying is something I do not care to participate in too (or drinking for that matter).

\-after graduation employment in the U.S and internships. The scholarship's agreement is that after finishing my B.S I'm to get back to my country and work for a decided period of time.

\-Sport scene. Although I'm a volleyball player, I didn't see exclusive opportunities in either school, so I'm also quite neutral towards this aspect. 


Although I do know what I shouldn't look at (the points above), I do not understand what factors should affect my decision. I hope someone can help me because I'm quite struggling here.


 Edit 1

+Rutgers. I liked that classes are quite small compared to Penn state. 

+Penn State. A summer semester opportunity is something I'm looking forward for. Rutgers have nothing on their page regarding summer semester for newly admitted students.

If I stay for another year I could graduate as a Business Major as well.

A majority of individuals I consulted have told me not to accelerate my college experience and stay for all 4 years for the following reasons:

* I could triple major if I stay the full 4 years (the more the merrier?)
* College is a once in a lifetime experience, you shouldn't rush it
* I could use the extra two years of college to study abroad through my university's programs (though I'd have to pay the tuition for the extra two years and pay travel fees associated with studying abroad, as my university simply gives us the opportunity to do so, they do not pay for it)
* It's going to be hard to join the workforce at such a young age if I only have two years of undergrad experience. Companies won't like seeing that, and the only reason I got the internship opportunities I did as a freshman were because employers had lower expectations for me because I was a freshman. If I graduate next year they'd have higher expectations of me.
* I'm not a fully-fledged adult yet so leaving college so soon is a bad idea
* I should use college to explore my interests
* I can gain connections in college by using my college's alumni network

Some things about me:

* I am trying to pay off college by myself (don't really want to burden my parents with the cost of college, they've been working their whole lives so I'd prefer that they spend that money on themselves)
* I am interning at Amazon this summer and I am currently conducting AI and machine learning research with a professor. I was also given the offer to conduct research at Microsoft for the summer (but I ultimately picked Amazon)
* I've been programming ever since I was in 4th grade (created my own website for me to play on that was like Neopets but for Pokemon- the code and design are REALLY bad though but it was a good experience), so I 100% know I want to do Computer Science 
* I plan on attending graduate school, so I'd still have 4 years of college experience"

b29s5v,304,2019-03-17,How did I end up here...,sn3akyshady,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/b29s5v/how_did_i_end_up_here/,"This is my first time posting here or really in general so please don't crucify me. Also it's a long one

&amp;#x200B;

So some back story (Skip to the 3rd paragraph if you want to just read the incident). I went to a pretty good University, graduated with all A's and B's with a bachelors in Computer Engineering. Spent a few years after college doing odd jobs and some contract work doing break/fix out of my apartment to earn some money while trying to get into that ""dream job"" that I was always told about.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending a decent amount of time applying, doing internships that went nowhere and feeling kind of hopeless on this degree i spent thousands of dollars on I finally got hired at a internationally recognized company doing IT. We'll call this (N). The interview was great, the money was too good to be true, I felt like I had finally made it, my time to shine.

&amp;#x200B;

The first month on the job was, well, not what I expected. The training had made this seem like i was diving into the meat of issues, tracking down outages, hacking the mainframe and saving the day. When in reality I was basically just a glorified help desk with more access to internal system than I needed. At the end of the day, I didn't really care all that much though. I was making decent money and I rarely needed to do anything apart from insuring that servers weren't offline and the occasional call from End Users (EU's) saying they couldn't get into their shared drives. Life was good, I own a switch so i would bring it to work and basically do what I do at home but getting paid. Until... She called.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a Sunday morning, I had stayed up fairly late because Sunday's are slow and not many (EU's) call in so I wasn't really on top of my game, not that their was much game to be had but I did my best. My shift started at 10 so after grabbing coffee on my way in I was officially in the system at 10:05, i remember exactly what time it was because the call will forever be engraved into my mind as the call from hell. The phone instantly rang when I logged in and we'll call this person (B).  (B) was having an issue with the lights in her office, that's right, the florescence lights would not turn on and she was calling me about it. I was very polite at first despite it being something I couldn't do. This is how this conversation went .

&amp;#x200B;

(B): Hi, I can't seem to get the lights in my office to turn on, is there something I'm doing wrong? I've flipped the switch but they don't seem to do anything.

Me: Uhhh, Ma'am this is Frontline support, I'm not sure this is the right number to be calling for your office lights. I can redirect you to the right number to get this issue resolved okay?

(B): No this is the number I meant to call, I spoke with (Rando)  yesterday and he seemed to know what to do, can you get him.

Me: \*never having heard of (Rando) before and this being my fourth month here, I was very confused as there was only 7 of us managing the 5 buildings on site and none of them had this name\* I'm sorry ma'am I don't believe anyone by that name works in this department, as I mentioned before I think you have the wrong number, would you like me to redirect you to the right people to have this issue fixed

(B): \*getting clearly upset now\* NO! Is this NOT the number for IT?

Me: Yes Ma'am this is the Frontline support number \*Still confused on what she wants from me but wanting to at least get her help\*

(B): \*yelling now\* Then this is EXACTLY where I need to be, don't send me to someone else when YOU are the one that needs to get off your a$$ and come fix this!

Me: (I'm not a loud person, but I don't like being yelled at, especially when it's to do something that's not my job. So i raised my voice a little. Big mistake) Ma'am unless you have an issue with network access or need application support, then frankly, there's nothing I can do for you!

I have never been flamed harder in my life, I won't go into details but it was like watching the first Nuke test but instead of being in a bunker somewhere off miles away, I was at ground zero and watched it go off in my face. Like in raiders of the lost arc and that German guy's face melts.  She destroyed me to say the least, I hadn't heard her kind of vocabulary since playing MW2 and you didn't have anything to hit back with. She was screaming at me to get up to her office and fix her problem immediately or she would get me fired for not helping her, and at this point I was not having it. I told her.

Me: Ma'am at this time I'm going to disconnect the line, if you want assistance, please call this number here. \*click\*

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was over, an hour goes by uneventfully until I saw one of our servers go offline. Now this is normal and isn't at all a big deal, the only people effected are internal users and nobody over seas.  I just quickly let me team members know and send out a downage email to the affected users for that machine. I put my coat on and walk from my building over to the building where the server is located.

&amp;#x200B;

(This is where it gets absolutely insane)

&amp;#x200B;

As I step into the building I heard a crash from the room above me, the same room the server is in. \*Not good face\*. I take the stairs 3 at a time and run into the room to see a women unscrewing the server cases and pulling them from the racks. Again \*Not good face\*. I didn't know what was going on or how this person got the idea to start breaking our server room. I thought we were being robbed or something, It hadn't yet clicked what was going on. As soon as she opened her mouth I knew it was her and she knew it was me.

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly ran over and wrestled the screwdriver from her hand, she had already damaged 2 of the housings and i'm sure drives had been damaged. She jumped at me like Gollum in LOTR saying something about how ""This a IT probelm now??"" and I sprinted from the room to get security who very quickly detained her. The police were called and she was arrested for industry sabotage or something. The fallout from the incident was the real headache, over 300 internal users were not able to access their shared drives and some couldn't get VDI access for days while we installed the new servers and plugged in everything. From that day on, we referred to this women as the ""lights out"" lady and at any chance we got, we would flicker the lights in our office like she was still haunting us.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you like my story! It's always a good conversation starter when meeting new people and I hadn't thought about posting it here until someone mentioned it to me the other day."
b29zei,1,2019-03-17,How to avoid becoming chronically serious,[deleted],selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/b29zei/how_to_avoid_becoming_chronically_serious/,"The more I work, the more serious I become.

I am in my third year of Uni studying maths and it involves a lot of grind. I manage and I do well, but it takes up a lot of time. This year, along with the increased work load my friend group has diminished, either because they’re busy too or internships and such. Unfortunately I’m finding that my personality now is not what it once was, and I don’t like it. I imagine this is because of less social interaction and becoming more devoted to the work. I am becoming more serious, less jokey, and less silly. I guess what I mean is that I find that I take myself more serious now and less likely to do thing’s which make me laugh at myself. Occasionally I find myself talking shit with a flatmate and I do or say something silly which makes me smile, but those moments are becoming rarer and I don’t want to lose that part of myself as I become an adult.

How do I avoid becoming a dry adult who is unable to laugh at themselves? Is it possible to be super hardworking and have a fun, silly persona? Would improv be a good idea? British TV? Thanks for reading xoxo

b2arsj,13,2019-03-17,Applying to College Guide,PDWAMMO,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b2arsj/applying_to_college_guide/,"Hey juniors, I’m compiling a small checklist for you guys in case it’s of any help. My junior/senior year I was really in the dark so I had trouble understand the necessary paperwork and deadlines. 

DISCLAIMER: I am a student and this guide will be prone to have issues, if I’ve missed important steps than I’d appreciate if you commented them below and I’d be happy to add them.

This is also a rough checklist and meant to be provided as an estimated guide, all students situations are different and it’s always good to do more research.

I hope this formatting isn’t completely terrible (I’m on mobile)

04/2019 - 05/2019

While many internship applications deadlines are already gone, there may still be some local ones you can apply to! This is more of an optional task, but I’d highly recommend it if you plan on applying to T20s, it would definitely strengthen your application.

05/2019:

At this point in time you should be preparing for your standardized tests, if you haven’t taken them yet, both the SAT or ACT, depending on what your strengths are — if you excel in stem than I’d recommend the ACT, however it never hurts to take both! 

Also, keep in mind to study for taking the SAT Subject Tests, specifically Math 2 + another which corresponds to your intended major.

Summer 2019: 

You may already have some schools in mind, but research colleges with strong programs in your intended field of study. Other factors to consider are the schools size, climate, their generosity with financial aid, and how far you are willing to go to attend the school. By the end of your research, you should compile a list of the schools which you intend to apply to. A typical/conservative list is 3-4 Safeties, 2-3 Matches, and roughly 2 reaches. 

There is no “right” amount of colleges which you should apply to, but you’d like to apply to enough to have your options open. Applying to too many colleges will inevitably result in weaker essays on your part as you try and fill out applications for 20+ colleges.

Important note: When choosing your safety schools, apply to schools where you would actually be happy if you attended. Don’t apply to safeties just for the sake of saying you have safeties. If the worse situations occurs, than you’ll end up attending there and dread every moment. 

Summer 2019 continued: 

If you do end up securing an internship and you are working in the summer, GET CLOSE TO YOUR SUPERIORS. Seriously, if you’re working under a respected professor, be polite, send thank you e-mails, get them a gift before the end of your internship. You want to make sure they like you and understand who you are as a person because they can potentially be one of your writers for letters of recommendation. 

Also, start signing up for your SAT/ACT dates as soon as you can, they fill up fast and you do not want to end up taking your test an hour away from home. 

School Year Begins:

As your senior year begins, start identifying teachers who can potentially write your letters of recommendation. Early in the school year, you may want to have conversations with them discussing how you’d want to them write your letter. If a teacher is hesitant or not enthusiastic, RUN, you do not want half-assed copy/paste letters. 

You’re also going to want to pull up that list of the schools you intend to apply to and look up last years essay prompts, many schools tend to recycle their prompts, this means you can get started on your essays ASAP. You’re going to also want to start deciding on the common app prompt you’ll be answering (if applying to privates) and start brainstorming how you’ll be approaching them. 

10/2019:

The FAFSA opens on October first, be sure to fill this out online with your parents so you’ll receive your financial aid if need be. Also, if you apply for financial aid on your applications, check out your schools policy because don’t schools require supplemental forms such as the CSS to be filled out in order for you to be eligible for aid.

09/2019 - 12/2019:

By this point in time, your standardized tests should have been taken and you’re nearly finished tidying up your revised essays and applications. You should be looking at the standardized testing policies of the schools you applied to and see what they require you to send. If a school allows self-reporting, than you simply tell them the scores you received and you send them AFTER you’ve been admitted. If a school allows you to choose the scores you send/requires them all to be sent, than you’ll want to log into your college board/act account and send  those scores roughly 2 weeks before the application deadline.

01/2020:

Decisions haven’t yet been released but if your using common app/your school requires it, than you’ll want to remind your counselor to send your mid year report.

Congrats! By this point you should be done applying to college, this post doesn’t cover scholarships/special circumstances and you very well may encounter supplementally documents which are not listed here.

After that shitty spectacle last year where I got rejected by all of the undergraduate colleges that I want to go to, I'm not going to have a repeat by going to a graduate school that is not at the top of my list. I'd apply again the following years until I get into Caltech or Princeton or, better yet, both. Right now, I didn't have a single A in my first quarter at my top 20 college. I will probably have two A's or an A- and a B in my second quarter. I'm taking five courses next quarter and I will get A's in all of them, bolstering my G.P.A. to a 3.5 by the end of the school year. I'll take some summer classes too, getting my GPA up to a 3.72. I still feel fucked because of my first quarter grades. I know that I may be overreacting since grades are not everything. 

What should I do then? Should I work at Google or intern somewhere? I will probably earn a computer science degree as well. Any other ideas? My ultimate goal is to become a professional astronomer researcher."

I plan to keep a record/log of my studying in hours, as well as what I am using to study to attempt to pass.

**My Background:** I am a computer science student graduating this upcoming May 5th. I have completed two software development internships over the past two summers. I have no IT background and have only completed a Principles of Networking Class for my degree (only class that seems to be relatively relevant for this certification). I was inspired to keep a record of my learning experience by Mike Boyd on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIRiWCPZoUyZDbydIqitHtQ), and r/dataisbeautiful. Possible impediments that I have going against me on this is that I'm taking a full load (17 credits) of University and working 24 hours per week as a TA/Lab operator.

Currently I have spent about 2 hours of preliminary ""research"" about how to study for this exam and am going to start by using the following:

**Resources:**

b2efj9,41,2019-03-18,I spent some weeks as a night-shift vet tech. It nearly killed me FINAL [Part 4],AdelaideHope,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b2efj9/i_spent_some_weeks_as_a_nightshift_vet_tech_it/,"[Part 1 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ay22xn/i_spent_some_weeks_as_a_nightshift_vet_tech_it/)  [Part 2 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ayy98b/i_spent_some_weeks_as_a_nightshift_vet_tech_it/) [Part 3 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b0hlu9/i_spent_some_weeks_as_a_nightshift_vet_tech_it/)

&amp;#x200B;

I peered around my little cage. Funny, it looked so roomy from the inside. It wasn't until the massive beast that I recognized as Jax-- stuck in the cage next to me-- turned to me that I realized I couldn't have been my normal size. His face looked monstrous, and each hair on it looked thick and textured, almost like a heavy bristle of horse hair. Then he spoke to me, his voice distorted and low.

""Hi, I'm Jax. You're new here, aren't you?""

I tried to speak back, but even though I heard only faint meows coming from my mouth somehow the message got across. It was alien, hearing a new set of sounds that made perfect sense.

""Luke-- you're Luke!"" I said back in a hushed tone.

""Yeah, I used to be Luke, I guess, but really I'm Jax,"" he followed up, his mouth opening and his tongue sticking out.

""Luke, we have to get out of here,"" I followed up quickly, ""We have to get Mort to let us out."" What he was saying made no sense to me.

""I'm comfortable in here. I don't remember too much of the outside, truth be told.""

I didn't know what to say. I turned eagerly toward the bird.

""Oscar-- get us out of here.""

The bird, I found, was in fact my other old vet tech, James. True to form, he was straight down to business.

""They don't know about their former lives,"" he chirped to me and signaled over to the other cat, ""Janice over there has been in lala land since we got here. They want to stay-- that's all they ever talk about. Only I am cursed with my memories. Hmpf.""

He even made that same sound that James used to make-- that pensive ""hmpf"" at the end of his sentences. I couldn't wrap my mind around the whole thing.

""James, I don't know what's going on, but I need to get out of here,"" I pleaded.

""Don't we all,"" he shot back, ""Even the other two. I tried, Addy. I think you just need to get out of the building, but as you saw Mort has an eye on things. I think he's got cameras in here.""

None of it made a shred of sense, and slowly I was starting to realize that that serendipitous pamphlet that lay on my bed, the easy hours, the absolutely no-interview process to get this internship, and the fact that no one had heard it was open except for me added up to a lot of suspicious coincidence. Mort wasn't some random vet owner in town that needed an intern, I now realized-- no, he was gunning for me. He was looking at add another one of whatever I'd become into his collection.

And what would he do with us now, I wondered and asked James. He had plenty of theories. Funny, he was much more talkative as a bird than he ever was as a human. But ultimately, he had no idea. Just as we had started to cook up an idea of how to get out (James would undo my lock, let me out, and then I'd rush back with police), Mort entered the backroom and looked upon us appraisingly.

""I can't for the life of my understand what you all are on about,"" he muttered, ""But rest assured, you won't be here much longer.""

He reached for the shock wand at the wall.

""There's no use keeping you all in the dark, I suppose,"" he began, ""You see, I now have fulfilled the order. Exotic pet buyers-- the are a troublesome bunch. An African Grey that comes with spotted feathers and speaks, a calico male cat, a russian blue that perenially looks to be a kitten, and a regular German shepherd. What boor even requests such a variety?""

He stopped, as if it was a rhetorical question, but of course he went on to answer it.

""A boor that pays well, that's who. And with a final treatment, you will all be shipped to this imbecile, and I will have fulfilled my first order,"" he finished, a sense of pride in his voice.

Was it true? Were we really all just an assortment of commodities, carefully crafted for Mort to turn a profit? The prospect was insulting almost for its very lack of diabolical and cynical elements. I won't lie, I was scared, but I was also disappointed that the method to all this madness amounted to simple economics, and not something more sinister.

And yet it was ostensibly true, I thought. Mort was preparing some syringes on the counter and through his mutterings we understood that these were to maintain our current form indefinitely. Jax and Janice didn't seem to have a care in the world, but James was apoplectic at the notion.

""I'll get out, Addy. I'll get out and peck him, and then let you out and you can make a run for it!"" he chirped in agitation.

That wouldn't work, I meowed to him. He needed to get me out first, quietly. To open my cage and give me a head start, and then to help me with the front door. If it was true that I'd transform once outside, then the rest was easy, I told him.

After much bickering, he relented. We waited for the opportune time, when Mort had stepped out to the front office. It was daylight by now, and customers were trickling in steadily. We decided that when he went to sign someone in we would move.

Oscar, or I should say James, acted marvelously. When a ring chimed, indicating that a customer had walked in, and Mort stepped out, he deftly unhinged his cage and flocked immediately to mine. Within mere seconds, he had had my door open.

""Hey, what's the rush?"" Jax asked as I exited the cage.

""Yeah, stay a while longer,"" Janice chimed in in a soft purr.

I ignored them both. I was convinced that they didn't know what they were saying or asking and headed straight out of the ajar door of the backroom. Unfortunately, as I peaked around the corner, I found a waiting room filled with two customers, their pets in tow. Both dogs.

I knew there wouldn't be a way for me to sneak past those owners without their dogs noticing, but if I was spied too early Mort would surely come retrieve me. Mort stood just feet away, his back to me, checking in another customer who had just walked into the door. Their pet dog eyed me, not sure yet if he would growl.

""It's okay, it's okay,"" I tried whispering to the dog, but that only seemed to agitate him.

My only shot was to pray that another customer would come into the front door, giving me a chance to bolt out while it was open. There was no way I could open it by myself. I saw someone pull into the parking lot through the glass front of the vet's office-- I hoped, so badly, that they were coming through that door.

They got out-- an older man and his wife. My dreams were shattered until they opened the back door to reveal a beautiful little labrador puppy. They were coming! I rejoiced to myself over and over, realizing that now it was just a matter of time.

But just as they were about to reach the door, a massive bark erupted from the door that had been eyeing me. Immediately Mort and the dog's owner looked down and saw me.

""I'm sorry, miss, let me just deal with this. We have an escapee!"" he said sarcastically as the older woman with the dog laughed.

I was done for. I know I couldn't save myself if Mort got his hands on me, but every path forward just took me to dogs in the waiting room, and going back was no use either. He just nearly got his hands on me as I intently looked at the new couple with the dog coming closer, they were just about at the front door. If only they could open it sooner!

I felt Mort's cold, wet hands start to nestle around my body and press firmly. He had my in his grasp. The couple outside had just put their hand on the door to open it, too-- if only I'd had that extra second.

Then a flailing, a shriek in pain-- I looked up and saw Oscar, fluttering around Mort and pecking at his eyeballs. In the heat of the moment I swiped at Mort's wrist and he let go, and I bolted straight out the door that had just inched open. I ran and ran, never once looking behind me. I ran for what felt like miles, with each passing minute feeling heavier and slower. Finally, I collapsed from exhaustion about three or four blocks from the vet's office.

When I awoke, I was groggy and had cobwebs in my brain. I couldn't think straight. As I tried to stand, however, I saw two beautiful human hands pushing me up. I looked down at my body and saw that I was myself again-- even still wearing my clothes from when I checked in to work the previous evening. I ran and ran and ran further to my home, to my worried parents. I wanted to tell the everything, to call the police and to get Mort thrown in jail.

But all I got was scolding. They had been worried sick, and I didn't call even once! And the police had already been called-- *many times*, my mother eagerly pointed out, because I was with that psycho Mort. Did I even hear what had happened, she asked me impatiently?

Nobody knew the full story, but word in the town is that Mort had been attacked by one of his birds. In a fit of rage he strangled it to death, right in front of all of his customers. He fled with the few animals he'd had and left town, and police were actively looking for him.

When I heard the story I cried terribly. My parents thought it was from trauma-- they thought I'd been kidnapped, or that I'd run away-- but really I cried for James, because he saved my life and gave his to do it.

This happened about four months ago, and there hasn't been word on where Mort is. I can't lie: there's no way he just left and stopped doing what he's doing, because he found a secret that no one else knows, and his potions or whatever he uses can probably make him a lot of money in a different town.

I never found out what happened to Luke and Janice, but when I'm a little older I will. I'm sixteen now and I've put a list together of people who I need to bring to a reckoning. I call it the Mort List, because he's the first name on it. And he better pray the cops catch up to him before I do.

The main reason was co-op, but now I realized 
my college experience could have been so much better and I could still get summer internships in Ivey so co-op shouldn’t have played such a vital role in my decision. I know that you need to get certain average and ECs to be officially accepted into Ivey, but with AEO I’m confident I could have got into Ivey if I accepted my offer to Western.

Could someone please tell me in what aspects does Waterloo Math/CPA have an edge comparing to Ivey? Did I make a really bad decision? Or, in the worst case, should I consider transferring? 

Any insight/advice is greatly appreciated!"

**Morgenthau Station**  
**35,800 km above Earth**  


“Alright, time to talk,” General Márquez said to Enuzai, several hours later. As much as he’d wanted to immediately question the Anaban scholar after dropping his little bombshell, he knew he needed someone with better scientific credentials to make any sense of it. With that in mind, the Doctors Astrid and Sabine Liao had been bundled onto a fast shuttle and sent directly to Morgenthau. He shook his head, and turned his attention back to Enuzai. “Well?”


The Anaban sighed. “I am afraid I know very little about the actual workings of the Erialyichi drive, General,” he said wearily. “The few bits of information I *have* managed to piece together have taken years of painstaking research. Obviously, they guard their secrets carefully.”


“But you are certain that the object we’ve been studying is at its heart?” Astrid asked.


“I am,” Enuzai agreed. “The Erialyichi call it *Tsal’urok*...literally, ‘Strange Power’. They believe it was formed in the moments immediately following the Singularity.”


General raised an eyebrow, and turned to the scientists. “Singularity?”


“The Big Bang,” Sabine supplied. “When the Universe was created.”


“Ah,” Márquez nodded. He turned back to the scholar. “Just how much of this stuff is floating around out there, anyway?”


“No one knows,” he replied. “Only one or two other sources have been located, to my knowledge. If there have been any others, the Erialyichi have gone to great lengths to keep that information hidden.”


“And yet *you* are somehow aware of this,” Astrid pointed out. “I assume the Erialyichi did not share this information with you voluntarily, so I must ask how you came to learn their secrets.”


“Through years of painstaking research,” Enuzai told her. “In many ways, it has become my life’s work.” There was a pause, as he suddenly found it difficult meet their gaze. “When the Erialyichi decimated my homeworld, I vowed to do everything in my power to find a way to strike back,” he said quietly. “I am no warrior, nor do I possess power, or position.” His head slowly came back up, as a defiant gleam filled his eyes. “However, I *am* a scholar, and knowledge can be a weapon of its own. It may not be much, on its own...but it is all I have to offer.”


The humans looked at one another in sudden uneasiness. “Why have we never heard about this?” Márquez said at last.


“Because the Erialyichi control what little information is allowed to pass from one system to another,” Enuzai said bitterly. “*Everything* flows through them. Do you believe for a single moment they would allow anything detrimental to their monopoly to be broadcast to the other worlds?” He sighed heavily, and shook his head. “Besides, we could never *prove* it was their doing, not beyond the shadow of a doubt. But we know.” He gazed off into the distance, lost in some distant memory. “Those of us left...we know.”


The Gendarmerie commandant regarded him carefully. “If what you say is true, why did they allow you to come here? Why not simply intern you, or…” He left the thought unfinished.


Enuzai gave them a sad, bitter smile. “Because they believe we are no longer a threat, General. They *broke* us, as a warning to the other worlds, though it was never stated outright. Perhaps...the message was even more effective, when coupled with their silence.”


Sabine stared at him in shock. “What did your people *do*, to warrant that kind of reprisal?”


“Something foolish,” he said softly, “so foolish that in retrospect, it is difficult to understand how we ever convinced ourselves it would *work*.” He shook his head once more. “Like yourselves, we were at their mercy. We could not duplicate their FTL drive, so instead we decided upon a different approach. At first we considered building Generation ships, or perhaps vessels employing some form of Cryogenic suspension, but in the end we decided to send out automated probes instead. Over the many years of trading with the Erialyichi, we had managed to compile a list of the other inhabited worlds. It was far from complete, to be certain, but it was enough for our purpose. We sent the probes to those other systems, for a single goal...to build a coalition strong enough to oppose them. If we could gather together enough worlds, we could freeze out their markets, and coerce them into sharing their technology.” He grimaced at that. “Obviously...we failed.”


Astrid raised a speculative eyebrow. “A project of that magnitude...it would be the work of decades.”


“In fact, we projected it would take several of your *centuries*,” Enuzai replied. “We accepted the price easily enough. My species is longer lived than most, so planning a venture of such scope was not alien to us.” 


“What went wrong?” Márquez asked. “Did one of the other worlds betray you to the Erialyichi?”


“We suspect so,” Enuzai said softly, “though we can not say for certain. In hindsight, we should have realized that *someone* would reject our proposal, and use it to curry favor with the Erialyichi. But at the time we thought...we *believed*...the other species would be just as eager as we were to fight against the Erialyichi dominance of our worlds.” The faraway look appeared in his eyes once again. “How naive we were. Naive...and foolish.”


“There’s no *way* you could have known…” Sabine began, only to be cut off by Enuzai’s hot retort. 


“Of *course* we should have known!” he said angrily, “for they held the one advantage we could not overcome. *Time*. We needed time to coordinate with the other systems, since none were willing to strike out on their own. Which meant two-way communication between those same worlds...at *sub*-light speeds. Once they learned of our plans, whether through betrayal or the interception of our probes, *they* could react far more quickly than we could.” He closed his eyes, and said quietly, “And in the end...our fate was sealed.”


“What did they do?” the General asked. “Planetary bombardment? An invasion?”


“Nothing so crude, or overt,” Enuzai said sadly. “No, the Erialyichi, in true plutocrat tradition, believe in maximum profit for minimum investment. They simply engineered a plague, and unleashed it on my homeworld.”


“Dear *God*…” Astrid whispered.


General Márquez’s face was as stern and rigid as if it had been carved from granite. “And yet, knowing all this, knowing what the Erialyichi are capable of, you’ve placed *my* world firmly in their sights. Endangered *my* people, the men and women I am sworn to protect...all so you can avenge yourself on them.” He glared furiously at the alien. “Give me just *one* good reason why I shouldn’t simply hand you over to them.”


Enuzai glared defiantly back at him. “Because they don’t *want* me, General. I am nothing to them. And it was not *I* that endangered your world...it was *that*.” He pointed at the object, still hovering above its stand. “Had you kept its existence hidden from the Erialyichi, while you worked to learn its secrets, it is possible they would have never learned the truth. They are not by nature inquisitive, merely opportunists of the highest order.” His voice grew cold, and still. “But instead you decided to make its presence known, and it is *that* choice which has made you a target. Even if you sell it to them, they will always wonder if you held some back. And no matter how much you try to belay their fears, they will never, *ever*, believe you.”


The general’s teeth slowly ground against one another, as he tried to deny that simple truth, knowing full well that he could not.


“*Sophoi*,” Astrid said gently, doing her level best to change the subject and hopefully defuse some the tension in the room, “you said that you have made the study of the Erialyichi’s FTL drive your life’s work. What can you tell us about the object? How can we examine it? We have tried numerous means to obtain a sample, and all have failed.”


It took a moment for the alien to refocus his thoughts, as he considered the question. “While I was on Waineexaa, I learned of an engineer who had been involved in a project to improve their engine efficiency. He was most preeminent in his field at that time, which is why I assume the Erialyichi granted him any access at all. I spent *years* combing the libraries and archives, searching for some record of what he had learned. Finally, I managed to track down one of his descendants, who had inherited the engineer’s journal. It was maddingly cryptic, but after careful study I managed to tease out one scrap of data, though I am unsure if it will be of any use to you.”


“At this point, *anything* would be an improvement,” Sabine said wearily. “What did you learn?”


“That somehow, *antimatter* was involved,” Enuzai informed them. “I do not know how it was used, only that it was.” He looked at the two scientists curiously. “Does this help?”


Astrid and Sabine gaped at him, their eyes wide. “Antimatter? But *how*…?” Astrid began, only to have her daughter grab her arm.


“...if we suspended a sample in a modified Penning Trap, we could use it as a scalpel!” Sabine exclaimed. “Though we would have to conduct the procedure in vacuum.”


“Yes, yes, of *course*,” her mother nodded vigorously. “By creating an extruded magnetic field, that *should* give us the ability to safely interact with the object, though we will need to conduct the procedure using remotes. There will be no ‘Tickling the Dragon’s Tail’ *here*.”


The conversation quickly escalated to higher level quantum mechanics, forcing General Márquez to whistle for attention. “Doctors...does this mean you *can* move forward with your investigation?”


“...I *believe* so,” Astrid said at last, “though we will not know for certain until we make the attempt.”


“Then *do* it,” he ordered. “Take the object back to Shackleton, and figure out a way to make it work.” He turned to face Enuzai. “I want you to go with them. For better or worse, it appears we are now in this mess together.”


The Anaban bobbed his head. “I will offer what assistance I can.”


“And the Erialyichi?” Sabine asked. “What do you intend to do about *them?*”


“I suspect the Prime Minister will need to practice her diplomatic skills,” he replied after a moment.


“I doubt diplomacy will deter them, General,” Enuzai said quietly, “not with what is at stake.”

b2idgb,4,2019-03-18,Did you hate your first “real” jobs &amp; how long did it take you to leave?,revolutions96,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b2idgb/did_you_hate_your_first_real_jobs_how_long_did_it/,"This is my story/ rant if you want details: 
I graduated from college last May and will have been with my current company for a year also in May. 

My goal is to leave at or just around the year mark which would be the end of May. My lease on my apartment also renews in June and I don’t want to sign another lease. This job was supposed to be a temporary thing until I could find a position closer to home or in the field I wanted to be in. When I took this job in May I knew that there were several positions coming open later in the year at different companies, so this job was just a means to support myself while I waited to apply. Well wouldnt you know the jobs I really wanted and was told I would be a great fit for I didn’t get hired for. 

I have been actively job searching since November and have been on several interviews but nothing has worked out. I’ve applied to who knows how many jobs at this point. There were 2 positions I was told I was a great fit for and did a good job in my interviews but they went with internal canidates instead. 

I gets harder and harder to come to work everyday. It’s not just work that I’m unhappy with.  I hate the area that I’m living in and how isolated I feel. I hate that my job makes me so stressed sometimes I can’t sleep.

I’m incredibly tempted to just put in my resignation but I feel like that’s not an option at this point. This is my first real job post college and I don’t think it will look good to quit (I have had several internships and worked every summer before this, so not actually my first job). I also don’t want to be a burden on my parents becuase quiting would mean giving up my income and moving back with them. My parents have also been counting on me as a backup income because my dad is facing a pay cut and my mom is also looking to change jobs. So on top of everything else I also get stressed about money becuase I’m not just supporting myself sometimes. 

I want to go back to grad school but I just feel like it’s not an option financially at this point. And even if I did apply and get in I wouldnt be able to start immediately and quit my job. 

I’ve recently send an email to one of my old supervisors from one of my internships hoping she may be willing to find a place for me. I’ve also been considering starting the process of applying for a teaching certificate and teaching Science or Ag. I know I would enjoy teaching more than my current desk job, but I also understand that teaching can be super stressful and the pay isn’t always that great. 

I’m just ready to be out of this job. The past year has been one of the most emotionally draining of my life. I understand hating your first job out of college is normal and most of
My older friends from college that graduated a year ahead of me ended up changing jobs after a year.

I know this is a lot but I just needed a rant to help me get through this week. I’m starting to feel trapped in this job

b2izi0,5,2019-03-18,About to head into my senior year with no experience in a Comp Sci field; what should my priorities be this summer?,uberpandas88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b2izi0/about_to_head_into_my_senior_year_with_no/," For those who don't care about the following big wall of text, you can skip to the last paragraph where my most important couple of points are made. 

Also, TL;DR at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To start with, I guess I should explain my thought process over the last couple years in college. In my freshman year of college, I had convinced myself that I was going to be going into pre-med so I loaded myself with biology and chemistry courses. I did quite well with pre-med, maintaining a 3.9 after my freshman year even after taking organic chemistry.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my brother, who is the same age as me, was at the same college and was also aspiring to be pre-med. But let me tell you, this man was INTO it. He lived, breathed, and slept medicine. He was subscribed to medical pages on reddit, would watch videos of surgeries for fun, and was set to get his EMT license that summer to volunteer at the fire department. After taking a long look at myself, I realized that that life was not for me and I did not want it as badly. I knew I was only in pre-med for the money and did not actively want to pursue a career in medicine because I cared about helping others.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my only passions is video games and computers. I had always loved technology from a young age so I figured computer science was a great fit for me. I saw that it had a lot of math and kinda just brushed it off even though I have always been unbelievably bad at math. I made the change my fall semester sophomore year and haven't looked back since.

&amp;#x200B;

While this major hasn't been particularly easy for me, I can say with confidence that I do love programming and like knowing how computers work. This isn't going to be a thread where I regret my life decisions over my chosen major in college and ask if there's anything I can do to find my true passion in life.

&amp;#x200B;

When I changed my major, I just assumed there were so many CS jobs needed in America combined with the fact that I go to a pretty prestigious university (top 30), I would just be offered jobs right out of college and top tech giants like google and amazon would come to me begging on their hands and knees just for a chance to have me. The farther I get along, the more I realize that is not the case at all with CS and it is just as difficult to get a job in this field as it is with any other.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my late entry into the game, I have had to work really really quickly to get through my major on time. Because of my unfortunate middle class placement on the economic ladder (too well off to get financial aid, too poor to actually pay for college) and the limited lifespan of a GI bill split between 3 kids all going to college at the same time, I can't possibly stay at school any longer than the 4 years allotted to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with this is that my school has a pretty small CS department and is notorious for offering classes necessary to graduate only during specific semesters. I've also always been on the slower side when it comes to learning and I tend to get overwhelmed by classes and workloads very easily. Luckily I came to school with lots of AP credits so I have the liberty of being able to take 12 credit semesters but because of the difficulty of most computer science classes, I can only take 2 of them per semester or else my GPA will definitely dip even more than it already has. Because of this, I've designed my courseloads for every semester meticulously, making sure to take certain classes as prerequisites exactly when they are offered because if I wait even one semester without taking an absolutely necessary class, that puts me another year behind the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I'm telling y'all all this is, because of all these factors, I have to take 2 summer classes so I can graduate on time: Software Development (traditionally the most difficult programming class offered at a lower level) and Linear Algebra (which I don't necessarily have to take over the summer but I would like to so that I don't overload myself with STEM classes in the fall; as I said earlier, I'm REALLY bad at math and would rather take this without the stress of other classes). Luckily I can take them both online so I can still hold a job but this finally brings me to another issue: I couldn't find an internship this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like I haven't been trying: I've been applying to internships ever since December. Because of my financial situation, I couldn't apply to any big companies out of state or far from home so I could only apply to places nearby. I live in a pretty small city most recently voted one of the worst metropolitan areas for tech graduates so this does not help my cause. Last summer, I worked for the not so well known marine engine subsidiary of a very well known European car company in a town 45 minutes away from mine. It was honestly horrible. It was a business related internship in the purchasing department and I absolutely hated it because of how slow paced and boring it was. Luckily, it taught me two things: I really hate business, and I do enjoy programming a lot. I know this because I spent my free time in the summer, working on the one computer science related aspect of my resume. Its a fantasy football draft program that utilizes RNG and the PyQt Python GUI module to organize and optimize the draft process for my friend's fantasy league. I had a ton of fun working on it and it was the only thing that made the summer bearable.

&amp;#x200B;

I took that job because everyone around me told me that it would be a great company to have on my resume, and, similarly to my earlier line of thinking regarding computer science, just having the company name on my resume would bring big tech companies crawling to my feet despite this job not having anything to do with programming in any capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a dumb college sophomore I believed them and now I have no experience in CS to speak of besides the aforementioned project. Because of this lack of experience, I was not able to land a internship for this summer. I feel dumb for not looking harder for a CS job last summer because I feel like that awful 40-hr a week internship was a total waste of time and now I essentially have nothing to show for it because its not like one personal project will get me any internship offers.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far past my ranting, I applaud and thank you. So I come to you fellow redditors. After browsing this sub for a while, I realized that I was way off track of where I should be at this point in my college career. I've been slacking off and not taking advantage of my time in college to make myself a better prospect for jobs after I graduate. For instance, I know Python, C, C++, and Pascal but I don't really have any experience. Like I don't have any web servers built and I haven't used any frameworks or databases or anything that would make a company stop and say ""Wow that guy knows a lot of cool programming acronyms and definitely knows what he's talking about""

&amp;#x200B;

I've joined my school's CS club to try and find more computer science peers and maybe some networking opportunities. I'm participating in a hackathon next week that I already have some ideas for. It's not like I'm going to win, but I'm thinking I may as well try and make a project so I can add it to my resume/GitHub.

&amp;#x200B;

This summer, my plan of action is this: 

* I'm going to grind incredibly hard. I'm going to take my software dev and linear algebra classes over the summer and all the while start grinding LeetCode, Hackerrank, and the like. 
* In my free time, I'm going to be working my summer beach lifeguarding job from high school so I can at least have some money (I still have a lot of good buddies there from home so it should be a fun time)
*  and I'm going to be working on developing my own projects and really working hard to get my resume to the place where it should be so I can start applying to bigger companies in the upcoming fall with actual experience and hard work to show for it. 

I guess my question is: **Should I really not be going for an internship my junior year of college and instead just grind out coding for all hours of the day so I can have something CS related on my resume? Or should I go for a safe internship with nothing related to CS because ""hey, at least its an internship"".** 

&amp;#x200B;

I really would love some advice regarding this and if I am indeed heading in the right direction. Also, If y'all could suggest anything for me to do as a first project for the summer to get the ball rolling, that would be much obliged. I'm thinking of starting out by writing a Python program for a Tetris clone but I'm wondering if that is just going to be seen as elementary and not something that would be interesting on a resume. I would really appreciate some replies.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Computer Science junior a little behind on the game (has to take summer classes) and has no CS internships lined up because I have no experience in the field. I'm trying to decide whether I should get a relaxing 25 hr a week job and focus on grinding LeetCode, making projects, and studying for my summer classes so I can improve my resume with regards to computer science or should I take the first internship i can get with no relation to CS just so I can have any sort of internship"

I have only had ONE in-person interview for a  software developer job that I did not get, but I am getting interviews  which is a good sign, right?

I've  researched the company and it looks like a established (it is a paid  internship, so they're not just trying to squeeze free labor out of a  college student) startup that builds tools to manage and keep data clean  across multiple sources (databases) .

Do you have any tips for this interview, or for phone interviews in particular?

I want to study UI/UX design now and of course I know that I need something new lined up first before I leave. I don't really want to get a job in IT similar to this one but then again I feel like IT is all I know.Should I try something more office related like working in insurance?? I'm just drained from the heavy lifting, cabling and most of all the  IT office relocations I do and I have another one coming up soon. Please give me some tips, advice, recommendation, etc."

I wanted to know if you had similar experiences on your way to getting a full-time offer from a good company. I'd like to list down my experiences so far:
 
 * Doing an internship this summer at a good tech company (not sure how I got it but I'm happy I did), but no previous tech internship experience.
 * Working at the college android development team.
 * Have a semester-long software development project with a community organization.
 * Side projects: Plenty of Java and Mobile projects.
 * Teaching assistant at my university

I wanted to plan out a roadmap for the next year, so that I'm more prepared to get a full-time offer from a really good place. I want to work for a Big N and it doesn't hurt to try I'm guessing. I'm hoping to do some more teaching assistant stuff, as well as work on an interesting project this summer for my internship. I have two weeks of Spring Break free, and I was hoping to learn some TensorFlow/Keras and do a small side project. Any ideas on that? Is it doable with my current experience?  

Also liked to mention that I would be interested in going to conferences and/or job fairs next year too. I'm applying to Tapia and will at least get my uni to sponsor me.

As for interview prep, I'm doing weekly interviews on pramp, and when summer is closer, I can do more rigorous interview prep. 

Please let me know what else I can do in order to put myself ahead and make the best choices to be a suitable candidate at a good place. Any advice would be appreciated!

I'd love advice on how to get engaged in the quantum information and more specifically the quantum computing field. I plan on going to college to get a degree in physics and perhaps an undergraduate in computer science, but should I do it the other way around and focus on computer science? How vital is it to graduate with a PhD/ Is a masters degree sufficient? I know Google, IBM and Microsoft offer internships in this field. How vigorously should I reach for those internships while in school? I have heard that this is a promising field, but I want to hear first hand what career opportunities are there regarding quantum information?

There is lots of information to unpack and as a high schooler who doesn't yet understand what I should prioritize as I reach for my ideal career I would appreciate help and guidance, regardless of whether or not you are actually engaged in quantum information careers."

Somehow my predecessor (the previous intern) managed to convince the administration to shell out a big chunk of money (big for me) for a new server, with training. Unfortunately, he got a new job before setting everything up. 

Now, this seems to be the perfect time  to get some hands on experience through the training program and eventually get a server 2019 cert. I spoke to the guy and it's a bit informal. What should I ask about to get the maximum bang for the buck? 

Obviously I need to learn about AD DS and domains.

I want to learn more about Roaming Profiles/Mandatory Profiles/UE-V/Folder Redirection. We have a few computer labs and I'm wondering if using mandatory profiles for student logins can be used in place of paid software such as Deep Freeze. Roaming profiles for teachers. 

However, I heard that Roaming Profiles and Mandatory Profiles are being depreciated by Microsoft and a combination of User Experience Virtualization and Folder Redirection is the new standard. Are there any good resources other than Microsoft's website, like youtube videos?

Do cloud storage services like google drive and dropbox play nicely with domain accounts, UE-V and folder redirection?

&amp;#x200B;

As you can tell, I know only a little more than buzzwords and names. It's a big opportunity to set up everything right though, we're moving from Win7 to Win10, so I might as well give it the whole nine yards. If anyone can point me towards resources for setting up a shared computer environment (computer labs for students), I'll be in your debt. I'm just trying to learn.

Thanks!

Edit: I just want to know the words so I can ask the trainer intelligently and learn how to set up and manage the server."

First, as a freshman I don’t know much if anything about electrical engineering, the only class that I have taken that’s for electrical engineering is digital circuits, so I was wondering what the companies expect freshman to know already. 

Second, I was looking at GE since I talked to them out our university STEM fair,  and they have a opening for avionics interns, however the description it says electrical engineers (and others) are “accepted” too. But my question is would this internship in avionics benefit me as an electrical engineer?

Third, on the GE website it says to apply in the fall, but the internship is still listed on their website, so I was wondering if it’s getting late to apply for internships (not just at GE, but any place)? 

Lastly, as a freshman or any year intern is it better to be with a larger company, or a smaller local company?

so i decided to go home and reinstall windows 10 on the newly acquired SSD.

So i got home booted up my laptop, grabbed my USB stick and tried formatting it because it needs to be empty to be made into a recovery tool.

little did i know i accidentally clicked on the wrong station letter.

so in a matter of seconds i see my Hard drive go from 800 gb full, to 1TB free.

i literally went full panic mode because 4 years of downloadable movies are on there.

so i started thinking what i could do, and then it hit me.

you can literally recover data from your hard drive if its been quickformatted or not been overwritten with new data.

for those reading this im still waiting till the recovery process is done.

This is my first professional job out of college. I am also getting a masters in health administration online degree at that hospital.

I have an interview lined up. She actually works in the same building that I work in. However I don’t want to tell my boss until I have an offer on the table. I’m unsure if I should wear what I typically wear at work (button up/dress pants) or if I should wear a suit. If I wear a suit then everyone in my office will know somethings up. 

Any advice?

Second question 

If I’m offered the position (I won’t be getting paid at the internship), do you think there’s possibly a way to do both? I work 40 hours a week however I’m not busy all 40 hours. How can I navigate and talk my boss into letting me do the summer internship and come back? "

Don’t mean to sound superficial as I understand there are plenty of fulfilling jobs out there outside of the top SV companies but I want to set my sights high and was hoping to get a realistic gauge of my chances to potentially land a job there once i graduate in December.

Background

URM (African American) 

BS in math from average state school (gpa: 3.85) 

    —&gt; I got into a target CS school (cal poly SLO) for engineering out of high school but wasn’t career focused at the time and was dumb enough to not visit the campus or consider the school. Things came pretty easy to me back then (I got 5’s in calculus 1 and 2 when I was 14 and 15) but I took it for granted and never applied myself. Just trying to make the most of my situation now. I don’t mean to brag at all, I know no one gives a shit about what you did in secondary school, but only give that information so you can get a slight understanding of my quantitative abilities 

internships: nothing special, one QC internship at a small startup 

projects: one or two, nothing noteworthy but will improve on this over summer 

For now , I’m taking Harvard CS50 and as many relevant MOOC’s as possible, while tackling leetcode and CTCI everyday. I’m taking only online classes this semester so I’ve been spending about 8 hours a day learning and working at my interview skills in hopes of being best prepared come fall. I don’t have much coding experience but have become pretty  decent at leetcode easy-medium just from practice and the books I’ve been studying off of . I have plenty of friends at all the top companies so I can definitely get referrals come time. 

I really appreciate your time and any potential guidance/tips! I’m new to this sub so I apologize in advance if any of this causes you to face palm

b2q98l,2,2019-03-18,Combination of imposter syndrome/fear/depression/anxiety -- I could really use some advice.,ughsighughsigh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b2q98l/combination_of_imposter/,"Hi! Thanks for reading this post. I will try to keep it as not vent-y/rant-y as possible, but I have gotten to the point where I type in keywords and symptoms into this subreddit looking for similar stories to mine. I've found a few, and am so thankful for the patience and advice others have given to similar situations, but I wanted to try my luck at posting.

TLDR: I am on what others in my company have called ""the worst project at the company."" It has pushed me further into existing feelings of depression/anxiety/imposter syndrome/fear.

I graduated May 2018 from a state school with a B.S. in compsci. I spent a lot of time in the labs studying and helping others; I really enjoyed what I was studying. I was about as on top of my game as I could be my junior year up until I attended the Grace Hopper Women in Computing Conference in 2016. I consider that a huge turning point for my self-confidence. All I could remember was feeling absolutely defeated every day, attending sessions and networking at the job fair made me feel... indescribably stupid.

That summer I took an internship at a boutique software consulting firm, and had a really great time! I got to work with a number of tech stacks and interface with a ton of awesome people. I really liked the idea of moving around to a few different projects throughout the year because I was so unsure of what I wanted to do with my career.

My senior year, I, again, attended the Grace Hopper Conference thinking that having some experience under my belt would enable me to more confidently represent myself amongst people from all the greatest technology companies in the country. Once again, I spent a lot of time in the halls of the conference center, just hiding from all the fanfare.

I accepted a fulltime offer to the consulting company I interned with because 1) it was small, and I thought I would thrive better under a company with &gt;1000 people and 2) I thought consulting would be the best way to get access to different types of engineers, projects, resources, etc.

And for my first few months while waiting to be assigned to a client project, I spent time doing company programming assignments and internal projects. However at the beginning of January, I got assigned to, what I think, is a nightmare project. Creating basically a button panel in Java Swing to run a bunch of configuration scripts for proprietary software. Our company has been unable to get anyone from our company willing to work on this project, and I didn't really have a choice because I'm so new (I expected to do some grunt work, but...)

The worst part, to me, is that I haven't coded anything yet, and development isn't slated to begin until end of April/May. I sit all day and occasionally do some work in Excel that my PM doesn't have time to do. I've been told by other senior engineers in my company that they'd quit if they were in this situation, which honestly sent me spiraling.

I really don't wanna stay at my current company if I'm gonna be stuck on this project, but I feel like I deserve this project for being too stupid. I'm trying to sort out this mix of imposter syndrome/fear/depression/anxiety:

* I just moved to the city I'm in, I don't have a social life, and not really any hobbies. I basically live to work and work makes me feel awful, so I just don't really see the point in anything right now.
* I have some moments where I think I can turn it around, start doing some leetcode and studying fundamentals again, maybe start applying to other places, but I can't even finish an easy question sometimes. I am paralyzed with fear when I can't finish a simple problem. I get really anxious that I'm gonna have to stay in this job forever because I can never complete what my peers can so easily.
* I've shut out all my friends who are also SWEs, my situation is so embarrassing, I can't bring myself to talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it.
* My mom is sending me links to networking events and coding groups, but the idea of going there and not being able to code a single intelligent function is terrifying. When she tries to give me a pep talk, I shut down.
* I feel like I have to start at the beginning of my education and re-learn fundamentals because ever since my confidence dropped junior year, I feel like I can't remember a single thing I learned in my DSA course. But the idea of doing this is so embarrassing, I just avoid re-opening all the books, resources, and old programming assignments.
* I know I am capable of programming, but I feel so inexperienced (partly my own fears' fault), and I feel like I fooled everyone (in school and at work) into thinking I'm adept. Whenever I get a burst of inspiration, I start looking stuff up to start coding but then I fall apart.

I know a lot of my fears are not realistic, but I can't stop feeling this way. It bubbled under the surface for so long while I was a student, but I had coursework to do that let me ignore it. I can't shake any of these feelings, I cry nearly everyday at work from being so anxious. I think I want to go to therapy.

This is the advice I need: I feel so scared to go back to CS basics, but I think I have to. How do I approach this? Am I stupid? Are these feelings normal? Should I find another job?"
b2qb20,1,2019-03-18,Negotiating Internship Extension (Moving from 26-30 hours a week to full time + full time dev work),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b2qb20/negotiating_internship_extension_moving_from_2630/,"Due to me graduating in the summer and not the spring, my work can only extend my internship until I finish my summer semester. After that, they'll then have me in for a review in August in which they'll determine whether they want me as a full time contractor (I'm aware of the differences in being a contractor and FTE.  Getting laid off isn't a huge concern for me at this job and I have decent reason to believe that that I can't really go into)

I'm currently being paid $15/hr, and my supervisor/VP of the department mentioned that I could possibly get a raise. We're meeting to discuss that this week.  I wanted to know how I could leverage this

Currently I work 26-30 hours a week, and am given a task a week. I've heard good things from my managers and supervisor that the devs have said to them, and have also gone above and beyond in some ways like doing some massive improvements on our database performance as well as refactoring some over complicated code.  It's not a whole lot, but definitely more than what was expected out of an intern at this company.

When my extension starts, I'll be taking on 40/hr a week and be given a full developer sprint, just with intern tasks (fix broken tests, write tests, bug fixing... small things just more frequently).  

I looked at glassdoor and noticed the lowest paid software developer was at around $55000 a year, which is roughly $28-30/hr I'd say? I was thinking of maybe negotiating $22/hr, which would be a very nice raise but I don't think it would oversell my achievements.  

Any insight?"

I need some advice for my career path.

&amp;#x200B;

1: Does it worth to have internships before you guarantee(I am not doing a guarantee degree since my poor academic performance )?

2: How should i improve my self from here? I have a fair amount experience what's stopping me from getting a job and make some money?

3:What\`s the best time for finding tech related internship?

4:How much advantage you have with coop????!!! seeing all my friends who have less experience than me getting all the interviews pissed me off.

April 17, 2036 - 6 Days To Mars

""She is an expert in growing things in places they weren't meant to be grown."" I snapped awake. I looked first at the display. It was 6 AM. I rubbed my eyes and slowly turned to find the attendant stooped over next to me, whispering. I wasn't sure if I was actually awake or if this was a dream.

""What are you talking about?"" I whispered back in reply, still wiping the sleep from my eyes. Then I looked over at my wife. She was still asleep, as was my son. The attendant tapped me on the shoulder. ""Your Mother-In-Law. You knew she was a chemist when she was young. It is time you knew more about her, and her role in the fight for human survival.""

I sat my chair up from the flat, sleeping position. ""Her role?"" I replied loudly. The attendant place his finger over his mouth to shush me. ""Come with me."" He motioned for me to follow. I stood up from my chair and walked with him to the window. We gazed out into space for a moment, then he faced me, and continued. ""Many years ago, when you wife's mother was in college in Germany, a large meteorite was discovered near her hometown of Stuttgart. It landed in a farmer's field, but it was kept under wraps. The German government seized the meteorite and moved it to a secret location. The public never knew of its existence.""

I shook my and shrugged ""So what?"" The attendant moved closer and tilted his head to show me his words were important. ""Your mother-in-law was doing an internship for the German department of agriculture. She was stationed in the same building that they moved the meteorite to. The government was worried that the rock could be dangerously radioactive, but they wanted to study it."" He paused. ""Who better to do this dangerous work than an eager intern?""

Again I shook my head. I still didn't see the point of the story. ""What does all this have to do with the fight for human survival? "" I asked. He continued ""You mother-in-law was tasked with measuring the chemical composition of the meteorite. For months she ran tests on the rock as ordered. Then one day, a man appeared who she had never seen. Her boss called her into an office and her next job was explained. The man was an astronomer from the United States named Roy Tucker. He and his colleagues had just made a discovery."" The attendant paused again. ""They made a terrifying discovery."" My head dropped and I muttered what I knew was the name of this discovery. ""Apophis."" The attendant nodded slowly in confirmation.

I stood silently for a moment, looking out the window at the stars. Then I started again. ""I still don't understand the connection. I mean, a chemist couldn't have done anything to stop Apophis."" Again the attendant placed his hand on my shoulder. He spoke slowly. ""No, son. A chemist could not stop the asteroid. But, a chemist was indeed needed to save the human race."" I looked up at him, waiting for the rest of the story.

""Tucker shared his discovery with NASA. They ran programs on Apophis' orbit through our solar system. They ran thousands of simulations. One month later, a call was made to the President of the United States. They told the President that an asteroid would hit Earth, on April 13, 2036. The President asked NASA if they could be wrong. He asked, ""what was the percent likeliness that there could be a mistake."" They simply answered, ""Zero, Mr. President. Zero Percent. This asteroid, Apophis, will strike the Earth. It will mean the end of all life. There is nothing we can do to stop it.""

I shuddered as I imagined how it must have felt to receive that phone call. The burden it must have been to keep the information from the public in an attempt to salvage our humanity in Earth's remaining years.

I snapped out it after a few moments. I still didn't have the answer to my question. I felt a bit annoyed. I wanted him to get to the point. ""What did my mother-in-law, a chemist, have to do with the fate of the human race?""

He smiled, gently. ""After all denial had faded, the governments of the largest nations gathered together to devise a plan to ensure the survival of the humans. Earth would be destroyed. We needed to find a new home. It wasn't long before we decided on Mars. It had the best climate. The best chance for water."" He paused again. ""It was our best chance for survival."" I nodded in acceptance. ""We believed that we could create oxygen forever. We believed we could produce water forever. We did not know what we would do for food. We knew we had to be able to grow our own food or we would starve. But, how could we possibly test growing food on the red planet? Well, that is where your mother-in-law comes in."" I raised my head when he said my name. ""Travis, the meteorite your mother-in-law was studying in Germany was from Mars."" My eyes grew wide as my attention focused. ""She ground pieces of that Martian rock into a soil and figured out a way to grow food on it. It was thought to be impossible, but she did it.""

I stepped back. I was baffled. ""That's,...it's....."" The attendant finished my comment. ""It's Amazing!"" I nodded. ""Yes, it's amazing."" He smiled back. ""It's also how they got you a ticket on this rocket."" He paused, trying to gauge my emotions. ""Not only was your mother-in-law smart enough to grow food on Martian soil, but she was smart enough to negotiate 2 tickets to the red planet as a reward for her efforts. She was the first confirmed passenger. Followed shortly of course by her good friend and college roommate. An exchange student from Japan. You might have heard of her. Her name was Etsuko.

My wife and son woke up just then. We ate good food and watched some movies like the other days. They fell asleep by 9:00 PM.

I waited up until 10 PM. I grabbed the Etch-a-Sketch from under my seat. But, 10:00 came and went and nothing appeared on the toy. I watched the display as the clock advanced to 10:01, then 10:02. I wondered if the messages were finished. Maybe the device is broken. I have so many more questions.

Tears welled in my eyes as I recalled the amazing gift given by my Mother-In-Law. She had the most valuable item on the planet, and she gave it to us. She saved us. The tears flowed quickly now.

Frustrated, I clutched the toy, brought it up to my lips and whispered, as if someone was listening, ""Why didn't you come with us? There was room! Why did you choose to stay on Earth, and die?""

I lowered the Etch-a-Sketch to my lap and wiped my eyes. Just then, the white dials started their familiar, fast movement. Within a few seconds, a new message was drafted. The tears reappeared as I read the triplicate note.

b2rcko,1,2019-03-18,Administrative internship interview help,TheAce5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b2rcko/administrative_internship_interview_help/,"I work at a teaching hospital doing research for specific department. This is my first professional job out of college. I am also getting a masters in health administration online degree at that hospital. I felt that I needed to get experience in administration so I applied for a summer internship at my own hospital. Which is only 20 hour a week position. 

I have an interview lined up. She actually works in the same building that I work in. However I don’t want to tell my boss until I have an offer on the table. I’m unsure if I should wear what I typically wear at work (button up/dress pants) or if I should wear a suit. If I wear a suit then everyone in my office will know somethings up. 

Any advice?

Second question 

If I’m offered the position (I won’t be getting paid at the internship), do you think there’s possibly a way to do both? I work 40 hours a week however I’m not busy all 40 hours. How can I navigate and talk my boss into letting me do the summer internship and come back? "
b2rgpd,5,2019-03-18,"About to transfer into university, after finishing up basics. Any suggestions for CS electives/remaining classes? Any essential/great classes that would be missed otherwise?",CSStudent500,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/b2rgpd/about_to_transfer_into_university_after_finishing/,"###Here's what will have been taken by transfer time:  
* Fundamentals of CS I (Language: Python)
* Fundamentals of CS II (Language: C++)
* Intro to Data Structures (Language: C++)
* Machine Language and Computer Organizaion (Language: Assembly)
 

###After that,  I have a few required classes:  


Course | Description
---|---
Computer Ethics | A study of the uses of computers and their effects on society. Text processing, spreadsheets, databases, and Web programming. Does not count for computer science credits toward a minor, or a BS or a BA in computer science. 
 Object Oriented Design and Implementation | The course covers object-oriented design principles and programming for students with prior programming experience. The topics include inheritance and polymorphism, object-oriented design process, UML diagrams, design patterns, exception handling and multithreading. Students will design and implement programs in Java.
Data Structures | This is a course covering classic data structures and the analysis of algorithms.
Computer Architecture | Use of fundamental hardware components. Topics include ALUs, single and multiple cycle datapath and control, RISC vs. CISC, pipelining, caches, I/O, virtual memory, and related performance issues. 
Software Engineering | The study of software design, implementation, and validation techniques through team projects. Structured analysis, programming style, and project documentation are emphasized in large software projects.
Operating Systems | This course covers the principles of operating systems, algorithms for CPU scheduling, memory management, cooperating sequential processes and device management. 
Project Course (Courses that fall under this category are specified in the table below) | One of the following courses:  Compiler Construction, Human Factors of Computer Systems, Computer System Security, Parallel Programming, or Software Engineering Project 

###Here's a table for the Project Course cell, with descriptions:


Course | Description
---|---
Compiler Construction| This course investigates theoretical and practical issues in the design and construction of modern compilers. Topics covered include lexical and syntactic analysis, syntax-directed translation, type checking, intermediate representation, code generation, and runtime systems. A major portion of the course involves implementing a compiler from scratch for a C-like programming language.
Human Factors of Computer Systems| Principles and methods in human factors and ergonomics applied to the design and use of computer systems. 
Software Engineering Project| Students undertake a software development project. They work in teams, developing requirements and designs which they will implement and test. 
Computer System Security | Course covers practical aspects of computer system security including managing and producing code for secure systems. Theory, such as cryptography, is introduced as needed. 
Parallel Programming |This course teaches practical aspects of parallel programming. The covered topics include multi-core processors and shared-memory programming, hardware accelerator programming, and distributed-memory machines and message-passing programming. The students will gain the knowledge and skills needed for developing parallel software by writing programs for a variety of parallel computers. 


From here, I have 4 electives to choose from, which are from this list (which can include the classes that pertain to the Project Course, meaning I could take, for example, compiler as PC, and parallel as an elective):  

*  Internet Software Development 
*  Embedded Computer Systems  
*  Theory of Automata
*  Undergraduate Research I/II
*  Computer Science Internship
*  Computer Networks
*  Introduction to Data Mining
*  Introduction to Database Systems 
*  Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
*  Introduction to Machine Learning 
*  Unix Systems Programming  
*  Survey of Computer Languages 
*  Introduction to Digital Multimedia 
* Introduction to Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
*  Practical Game Development 
*  Software Testing 
*  	Introduction to Graphical User Interfaces 
* Introduction to Recommender Systems 
*  Introduction to Green Computing 
*  Computer Graphics 
* Independent Study in Computer Science 



While the list is not too big, it's overwhelming, and I'm not sure which classes would be absolutely essential, or which ones would will broaden my horizons and help me extend my knowledge when I get into a working position.

For example, the internship class is very enticing, but I'm not sure if I shouldn't take that and try for summer internships instead, and free up a slot for extra classes. Would something like compiler construction or parallel programming be absolutely essential? Would taking a class on embedded systems help further understanding? Would taking theory of automata be beneficial?

Any thoughts on which classes have more weight/usefulness?

**edit** I didn't want to make a giant table of the lastly listed classes, so if you need a description, [here's the school's site for these classes.](https://cs.txstate.edu/academics/course_list/undergraduate/)

b2rnnw,0,2019-03-18,Is it worth attending Johns Hopkins MAIS if I will double my overall student debt?,kokomarro,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/b2rnnw/is_it_worth_attending_johns_hopkins_mais_if_i/,"Hey, all! So I was accepted to my top choice, the Johns Hopkins Nanjing Center MAIS. I want to do worth that has relevance to China and hopefully work with the government as an analyst one day. It seems like many students also get jobs as consultants at banks afterwards. I'll come out with a great understanding of Mandarin Chinese, China, and international politics/ economics with amazing teachers. It is a program that I didn't think I would get into. However, it seems I am only receiving two fellowships that total $27k for the first year, which is almost exactly 50% of the yearly expenses to attend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know if I will qualify for any more federal loans since I have a lot of transfer credits from undergraduate. Even though I only attended four years, I have enough credits essentially to have been there six years. I triple majored and went on a ton of funded study abroad programs to China, which required me to transfer back credit. In the eyes of FAFSA, I'm maxed out on credits for how much they'll fund, even though I didn't surpass their time-in-school limit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at starting salaries for consultants and becoming an analyst, which hover around $80k/yr. My fiancé has no student loan debt, but is looking to become a teacher. I am 23 and my undergraduate degree might not be able to help me get a well-paying job on my own. I currently have around $41k in student debt (mostly government loans) and I will need to go into at least $54k more loan debt (probably private loans) to get this degree. The connections, support for unpaid govt internships, and additional funding available at Hopkins really is making me think the investment may be worth it, but I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

No one else in my family has done graduate school and they're all saying it's a bad idea to take on further debt. What are y'all's opinions? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling really lost right now between excitement and anxiety of being able to go to such a school."

b2sknh,9,2019-03-18,I see no point in college,G_Singularity,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/b2sknh/i_see_no_point_in_college/,Hello everyone and thank you for your comments in advance reddit has really helped me recently. Anyway this is my fourth year of college I did three years at a community college and transfer to a four-year and approximately have 1 to 2 years left depending on my major. One year if I switch to economics. Or two years if I stay the course for physics. I’ve always wanted to be in entrepreneur and I thought college was just going to be a steppingstone to get me in the right direction. My passion for computers has increased over the years and programming but I’m still a novice. I’ve had a few internships for engineering and didn’t like them they seem to be nothing what I expected. I like Elon musk‘s approach to entrepreneurship where he started out developing websites such as X.com. and then branched into other fields such as electric cars and space. I hope to be as successful as that one day but I’m really lost when it comes to school should I buy the bullet and stay an extra year costing so much in tuition( I’m putting myself through college and very poor). Or should I come out in a year with economics degree. Either way I plan on going into software development after college for a few years and have been working on my programming abilities and I’ve started some github projects. Just want to see what you guys think or have previously been in this circumstance. thank you again
b2sres,15,2019-03-19,"I love programming, I hate being a developer.",Bravelungs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b2sres/i_love_programming_i_hate_being_a_developer/,"I’m very aware of how lucky I am. I got a good degree from a good school. I wasn’t the most passionate student in my program and I never measured up to the ‘super-genius’ types, but I earned solid A’s and B’s and I loved a lot of the coursework I did.

Learning to program felt like it was the culmination of my entire life’s experience up to that point. When I was younger I played with legoes. When I was in high school I would become so engrossed building redstone machines in Minecraft that I would miss meals. When I realized that I could apply the same skills: that unique sort of problem-solving and tinkering to bend machines to my will and make a good living, it felt like destiny. 

I got an internship my last Summer of college, and so when I graduated I had already lined up a cushy corporate development job that pays a six-figure salary and great benefits. Now after a year and a half of working there I have a fantastic, professional, supportive team, my boss is incredibly kind and a great leader, the work is low stress and I rarely if ever work more than 40 hours a week. I've heard horror stories from friends in the tech world (and posts here) about bosses smashing phones, calling their coworkers idiots, getting called in on days off and some straight-up abusive behavior that I can't imagine happening at my job. I know how lucky I am to be where I am today.

And despite it all that, I really just hate being a developer.

After a year and a half I still haven't developed any passion for what I'm doing. I'm perfectly capable of doing most of the work that gets assigned to me without needing much help but it all feels so soulless. Any creative satisfaction I got from coding was stomped out in my first few code reviews (which is totally fair, good coding standards and all, but still). I don't really care about what or how well my company is doing as long as me and my team don't get laid off, and I've never felt compelled to contribute anything except exactly what's asked of me. Other team members are introducing new frameworks, practices, and architectures but honestly I find it all so boring now. I feel like I'm stagnating but there's nothing in this company that I want to learn and there's nothing I really want to do here.

Has anyone else ever felt this way in their career? I'm considering leaving and trying to find work at a non-profit or something with the hope that I'll rediscover my love for programming if I'm doing for a better reason, but I'm afraid that it'll happen all over again and I'll just waste a bunch more of my time. I've also considered just going solo for a while but I don't have the marketing or business chops to make a living off of it, and I don't have any revolutionary ideas for products so I'd basically just be working on a portfolio while bleeding money and being without medical insurance. I'd do some stuff in my spare time, but I'm just so burned out by the end of the day that I can't bear to explore other options if it means having to look at more code. I can barely summon the effort to search for other jobs.

I'm sorry if I come off as whiny but I'm curious if anyone else in this sub has found themselves in this position and worked their way out of it. Is the grass really greener on the other side? Does the product you work on make that much of a difference? Or do I just not have the personality it takes to enjoy being a developer anywhere?"

I've been putting out a handful of applications a day and responses are coming in now.

My problem is, many of them are entry-level type jobs which I expect considering my experience. But, I am concerned about when I should bite when given an offer. So far, they're all better than I am currently making. 6 months ago I acquired an internship, and a week later was offered a second, better one that I had to turn down because I couldn't do both at the same time. It turns out my internship wasn't as rewarding as I had hoped, making me regret not taking the other one.

My wife went through a similar situation where she had to pick between offers, and I told her to take the one she wanted more and not make my mistake. She did and it turned out well for her.

Now I am paranoid about jumping aboard a bad situation, and then getting a better offer weeks later. I don't want to undersell myself, but I realize I am just starting out.

Do you kind folks have any advice about when to accept a job in this situation? When do you hold out for something better? Some of these employers are coming on hot and heavy, and it's somewhat unnerving to be rushed and pressured. But I don't want to turn down opportunities that may not come again."

The idea that this may be caused due to me being dumb, incompetent or lazy is just horrible, as these problems don’t have a solution.

And to make things worse, people think I’m intelligent, due to the fact that I read a lot and have an easy time discussing what I know, but the truth is that my grades and the hardship to get a job says otherwise.

This is causing a anxiety crisis in me as I think of the possibility of being a graduate that can’t find any job in my area. I cant sleep more than 4/5 hours per night as I keep thinking about this, I became a heavy smoker, and the situation just seems hopeless.

My parents can’t sustain me forever and I fear that I will never be able to be anything in life, and I just can’t give up. It seems that there is no solution to this problem.

However, I'm going to soon join a big software company full time upon graduation this summer and have been interacting with soon-to-be new grads in a group chat and everything they do and say just seem.. shady. Every time people ask questions that are extremely binary, people give various, often misguided answers. It just seems everyone is trying to misdirect the other so that they themselves can get an advantage. 

It's difficult to get into specifics without exposing too much, but my main question is: is that what it's like at big companies? I often hear that at big companies you have to kind of be a kiss-ass and a ""snake"" to climb the ranks as performance is more difficult to assess.

I'm doing chemical engineering in Melbourne and what I can tell from the courses club/society and my seniors is that the market for chemical engineering (at least in Melbourne) is pretty small and that a lot of graduates do end up unemployed.

I am not interested in working on site. For now, I have my eyes set on consulting (though I've heard that some chem eng graduates go on to work in financial consulting and IT).

I was wondering which coding language would be good to improve my employability and help me stand out when I start applying for internships and eventually a job.

I have taken a class in my first year in javascript and I am decently proficient in Matlab. I have read this forum a bit and from what I can tell, VBA and Python are popular languages to learn.

I just wanted to ask the engineers and IT guys here for their thoughts.

Thanks in advance :)"

-CLRS

These courses are extremely difficult and challenging. The material in the books is written in a very complex way (not saying that this is bad of course, but makes it quite hard to grasp things).

Would something like GeeksForGeeks, even though inferior, still be a viable path for improving knowledge in that particular domain, and then after that would something like Hackkerank, Leetcode be a good option for testing your previously gained knowledge?

Details:

I have a workbook where each sheet is a list of countries where a product is available.  I have to mark each of the countries on another workbook that has all the countries and products listed in a larger table.  It incredibly redundant and I've been given the task because that's what interns are for right.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My idea is to use COUNTIF to compare the two lists of countries (table below) and get a new column where it states 'true' or 'false' if the country is in both columns. The problem I am facing right now is that the partial list countries has a number code afterwards as well. I haven't been able to figure out how to ""count"" with  the criteria being the content from a cell and furthermore how to have a wildcard in as well. I tried =COUNTIF(A6; ""\*""&amp;D6&amp;""\*"") but even =COUNTIF(A6;D6) has not worked for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I figure this out I was thinking I could make a conditional formatting on the larger table that would mark where the CountIF from the other workbook was 'True"". 

This first table is the first product with the two lists of countries, first column the ""full"" list of countries the second is the individual ""product"" country list. 

(couldn't figure out how to use the ExcelToReddit properly so the example is very small)



|Full List of countries|Product 1 countries |
|:-|:-|
|Albania (AL)|Albania (AL) 4626|
|Algeria (DZ)|Algeria (DZ) 4534|

Any essential/great classes that would be missed otherwise?",CSStudent500,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b2zhqw/xpost_from_rcsmajors_about_to_transfer_into/,"###Here's what will have been taken by transfer time:  
* Fundamentals of CS I (Language: Python)
* Fundamentals of CS II (Language: C++)
* Intro to Data Structures (Language: C++)
* Machine Language and Computer Organizaion (Language: Assembly)
 

###After that,  I have a few required classes:  


Course | Description
---|---
Computer Ethics | A study of the uses of computers and their effects on society. Text processing, spreadsheets, databases, and Web programming. Does not count for computer science credits toward a minor, or a BS or a BA in computer science. 
 Object Oriented Design and Implementation | The course covers object-oriented design principles and programming for students with prior programming experience. The topics include inheritance and polymorphism, object-oriented design process, UML diagrams, design patterns, exception handling and multithreading. Students will design and implement programs in Java.
Data Structures | This is a course covering classic data structures and the analysis of algorithms.
Computer Architecture | Use of fundamental hardware components. Topics include ALUs, single and multiple cycle datapath and control, RISC vs. CISC, pipelining, caches, I/O, virtual memory, and related performance issues. 
Software Engineering | The study of software design, implementation, and validation techniques through team projects. Structured analysis, programming style, and project documentation are emphasized in large software projects.
Operating Systems | This course covers the principles of operating systems, algorithms for CPU scheduling, memory management, cooperating sequential processes and device management. 
Project Course (Courses that fall under this category are specified in the table below) | One of the following courses:  Compiler Construction, Human Factors of Computer Systems, Computer System Security, Parallel Programming, or Software Engineering Project 

###Here's a table for the Project Course cell, with descriptions:


Course | Description
---|---
Compiler Construction| This course investigates theoretical and practical issues in the design and construction of modern compilers. Topics covered include lexical and syntactic analysis, syntax-directed translation, type checking, intermediate representation, code generation, and runtime systems. A major portion of the course involves implementing a compiler from scratch for a C-like programming language.
Human Factors of Computer Systems| Principles and methods in human factors and ergonomics applied to the design and use of computer systems. 
Software Engineering Project| Students undertake a software development project. They work in teams, developing requirements and designs which they will implement and test. 
Computer System Security | Course covers practical aspects of computer system security including managing and producing code for secure systems. Theory, such as cryptography, is introduced as needed. 
Parallel Programming |This course teaches practical aspects of parallel programming. The covered topics include multi-core processors and shared-memory programming, hardware accelerator programming, and distributed-memory machines and message-passing programming. The students will gain the knowledge and skills needed for developing parallel software by writing programs for a variety of parallel computers. 


From here, I have 4 electives to choose from, which are from this list (which can include the classes that pertain to the Project Course, meaning I could take, for example, compiler as PC, and parallel as an elective):  

*  Internet Software Development 
*  Embedded Computer Systems  
*  Theory of Automata
*  Undergraduate Research I/II
*  Computer Science Internship
*  Computer Networks
*  Introduction to Data Mining
*  Introduction to Database Systems 
*  Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
*  Introduction to Machine Learning 
*  Unix Systems Programming  
*  Survey of Computer Languages 
*  Introduction to Digital Multimedia 
* Introduction to Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
*  Practical Game Development 
*  Software Testing 
*  	Introduction to Graphical User Interfaces 
* Introduction to Recommender Systems 
*  Introduction to Green Computing 
*  Computer Graphics 
* Independent Study in Computer Science 



While the list is not too big, it's overwhelming, and I'm not sure which classes would be absolutely essential, or which ones would will broaden my horizons and help me extend my knowledge when I get into a working position.

For example, the internship class is very enticing, but I'm not sure if I shouldn't take that and try for summer internships instead, and free up a slot for extra classes. Would something like compiler construction or parallel programming be absolutely essential? Would taking a class on embedded systems help further understanding? Would taking theory of automata be beneficial?

Any thoughts on which classes have more weight/usefulness?

So now that the experience has concluded for me, I'd like to share my stats and results in the hopes that they'll be helpful for others. Obviously there's no way to completely predict which programs you'll be accepted to, but this can at least be a starting point. I'm also happy to share my thoughts and experiences interviewing at these various programs for anyone who's interested!

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

* B.S. double major in Neuroscience and Molecular Genetics from an R1 state school
* GPA: 3.99
* GRE: 166Q/167V/4.5AW. Did not take the subject test.
* Demographics: Female, American citizen, not a minority
* Research interests: Neurodegenerative diseases, especially from a translational perspective
* Research experience: 4 years during undergrad. Completed an Honors Thesis and had a first-author manuscript in prep. Published 3 literature reviews including one as first author. Summer research internship in Switzerland. After graduation spent 1 year as a post-bac researcher at the NIH.
* Awards: Goldwater Scholar, Astronaut Scholar, ThinkSwiss fellow, a few others from my university
* Misc: Lots of extracurricular stuff including Editor-in-Chief of an international undergrad research journal, and starting my own science blog (though to be honest I don't think this stuff mattered much for my applications).
* Application: Put a lot of effort into my SOP's including several rounds of edits with various faculty mentors. Strong rec letters . Did not contact any POI's beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Applications**

* Stanford Neuroscience
* UCSD Biomedical Sciences
* UCSD Neuroscience
* UNC Chapel Hill BBSP
* MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences
* Harvard Neuroscience
* UCSF Biomedical Science
* Scripps Research Institute
* NIH/Johns Hopkins joint program
* U Penn Neuroscience
* Boston U Neuroscience

&amp;#x200B;

**Results**

* *Rejected without interview:* Harvard, MIT, Scripps. Harvard and MIT were reaches for me, so not that surprising. I think the Scripps rejection was probably because I didn't take the Biology subject test, which their website says is ""viewed very favorably."" Might also have been a fit issue.
* *Rejected after interview:* UCSF. This one caught me a bit off-guard, as I felt like I had a pretty strong interview.
* *Offered an interview, which I declined:* Boston U, NIH/Hopkins. I already had 6 interviews lined up by this point and these were lower on my preference list, so I decided to decline.
* *Interviewed and waitlisted:* Stanford. I decided to accept another offer while I was on the waitlist so it's impossible to know whether I would have gotten accepted in the end.
* *Interviewed and accepted:* UCSD (neuroscience and BMS), UNC Chapel Hill, U Penn.
* *Attending:* UCSD Biomedical Sciences

&amp;#x200B;

**Reflection**

Overall I'm very happy with how things turned out. UCSD was initially my #2 choice after Harvard, and now that I've visited the school I feel very confident that it's the perfect fit for me, in terms of research, program culture, and location. Although I only ended up with four acceptances (a lot of my friends were accepted everywhere they applied), I don't regret aiming high. To be honest, I expected to get in more places than I did, since I feel that my application is pretty strong overall. Word to the wise: If a faculty tells you that you're definitely going to get accepted to schools like Harvard/Stanford/etc, don't take them at their word. These programs have gotten much more difficult to get into in the past decades, especially for neuro. No one's a guaranteed in. Definitely throw in a ""safety school"" or two.

If I could do it over again, I think that I might have applied to more Biomedical Sciences umbrella programs and fewer Neuroscience programs. Because my research is disease-oriented, I often fit in better with BMS than with neuro programs, which tend to focus more on the cognitive/behavioral aspects. Also BMS programs tend to be a bit less competitive to get into.

I will also note that geographical location was a major consideration for me in choosing a program. My fiance works in the biotech industry and I'm planning to do the same after grad school, so I really wanted a program that was located in a major biotech hub. I also love being outside, so weather is important for my happiness as well. Luckily San Diego checks both of those boxes nicely.

That's about all I have to say! Happy to clarify anything or answer questions about these programs."

\- Because I want to go into creative writing, I'm of course pretty gifted in general writing. Therefore, my supplemental essays were very likely of good quality, with most being about my interactions with the clubs and activities I'm involved in and my future aspirations as a writer.

\- My commonapp essay was about the concept of the ""first draft"" both as it relates to creative writing -- a purposefully shitty word-vomit that I had to learn that it was okay to write in order to work towards something greater -- and my ""first draft"" of my life, which would be my high school career, and how I plan to build on it and improve going into college.

**Interviews**

\- I did not complete any interviews

**Letters of rec**

\- AP Lang teacher: she's known to write really great letters, and I excelled in her class

\- AP Lit teacher: I'm currently doing very well in her class, and she is familiar with my writing and helped me write my commonapp essay. 

\- Head counselor: not my regular school counselor, but I got very close with her through leading the LGBT+ Alliance and she's supported me through many personal issues before.

\- 10th grade social studies teacher: this one was more of an extra, but this is another teacher I've gotten very close with who promised she had nothing but good things to say about me.

To any school that took them, I submitted the writing supplement and my creative writing portfolio, which consists of my strongest short story (which has been reviewed by many, many teachers and peers, including a couple of creative writing professors) and a couple of my favorite poetry works. For NYU I submitted my screenwriting portfolio, which is the beginning of a television show pilot I wrote at NYU over the summer. For USC I submitted their own screenwriting portfolio, which was a lot of prompts and autobiographical essays that I feel I did very well on.

Chance me? My Barnard decision comes out on Friday and I'm anxious!"
b30yql,9,2019-03-19,I have to wonder if it is too late for me,Kal947,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/b30yql/i_have_to_wonder_if_it_is_too_late_for_me/,"I'm 24 and I honestly have to wonder if its too late to make the life I want for myself. I say this because I've made so many mistakes with myself and education. I didn't get good grades in high school and landed at community college. Even there, I made mistakes. I'm scared my major I chose is going to be useless. I'm having lots of trouble finding a job in my field because I either can't reach it, don't have enough experience, or it requires local travel when I don't have a car, or something else getting in my way. I just feel it is too late for me in this sense. A huge part of me wants to give up on life for a bunch of reasons but this is one of the biggest things. Every effort I make here feels pretty futile and I don't know where to go from here except suicide.

I also suffer from addiction problems(not drugs) and it messes with my mind. I screwed up an internship because of it. Lack of concentration, memory problems, makes my social anxiety even worse, kills your motivation.  I can't fight it too well. Would it even matter if I did at this point when its ruined so much of my life? I was good in school and everything before I fell into that addiction when I was about 12. I really have suffered a lot from then to now in many ways but I put up with most of it because I was told I had to with nothing keeping me going. Most of my problems are from my mistakes and I can admit that, but I also feel that they aren't fixable either and I've really lost my fight or my will to keep fighting."

I'm the author of the [current stickied post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/9o3l7f/international_admissions_financial_aid_and_merit/). I have been continuing 
my mission to make reliable, easy-to-parse data about college admissions available to high-schoolers, parents, and counselors. To that end, I have had my team compile a list of summer programs offered by universities and other institutions. 

This list contains almost every summer program offered by colleges listed in the top 35 of the 2019 U.S. News &amp; World Report National Universities rankings, plus dozens of other STEM, business, and arts programs. It's sortable by program start and end date, as well as application deadline.

I'm about 24. I'm about to graduate from college with a B.S in Network Administration and Information Security. It isn't a top school or anything but still accredited. Peirce College is the name of it. I got my associates in 2016 from community college and am finally finishing my bachelors in May. I've had two internships but it didn't end well in one and may not be able to include it on my resume. I live close to Philadelphia in the suburbs. I don't currently have a car.

I see most tech support/helpdesk jobs on Indeed that say 1-2 years of experience and I rarely see anything that says entry level in my area. I get rejected for these jobs too when I find them. If that isn't the case then I will see something that I'm qualified for but I can't reach it. 

Someone also suggested going out of my field of study. I do know some SQL and my dad has 30 years at a large company where he does SQL analyst work. I do wonder if they might cut me a break. I just honestly want a job to support myself and don't really care so much about being in IT. I like it but I wouldn't mind doing something else as long as it allows me to support myself and eventually a family of my own one day. What would you do if you were in my situation?"

b320kg,1,2019-03-19,"The company I'm at has no management. Is it worth staying at to try to improve from the bottom up, or should I GTFO?",myfuckingjobman,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b320kg/the_company_im_at_has_no_management_is_it_worth/,"Going to be skewing the details a little bit for anonymity, but basically im in a position where I need more outside voices on this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I studied music in school and had no tangible idea of what to do next. Because of this I tried to land a handful of internships in arts/music business and administration so I had a chance of finding stable work. Because of good connections I built with professors, I was able to accomplish this pretty easily. My last internship was with a small but fairly well-known independent creative agency, where I was an office intern doing some typical mundane intern stuff, in addition to some more real-world experience with promotion and marketing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 3 years later to now and Ive been working full time here for about \~2 yrs. There are the typical 'millennial office' pros to the job that give it an appeal: Lax office environment, trendy offices – pretty classic stuff for a creative company in a big city in 2019. In general, it has been a good opportunity for me to learn about the industry and gain some skills in marketing and design. Even though the pay isn't amazing, having a consistent paycheck is a blessing.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the organization and management is a total disaster and im starting to look at all this from an ethical angle to see if its worth staying at. Since starting full-time, nobody on staff has given me an official job title, description of my job, or anything outlining expectations. Everything was discussed with the finance guy in a phone call along with a quick follow-up email. I'd gathered that this place has a pretty lax office culture by then, so the informality wasn't really a shock to me, but I was at least expecting my marketing manager (different guy) to have a conversation with me about this stuff moving forward. But no, nothin. Via conversations with other co-workers, it sounds like im not alone in that.

&amp;#x200B;

My manager is TERRIBLE with communicating. He doesn't have a background in management and it shows: theres no central project management system for anything we are working on, no way to track the progress of our projects, and since my role isn't defined, I dont have a clear idea of what is expected of me. Any time I ask for guidance or clarification, I am made to feel like im naive or unmotivated. Whenever I schedule a meeting with my manager to talk about any project, he will start it off with ""well, let me know if you have any questions for me"" and have no actual input other than what Im able to pull out of him with probing questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Im at a point now where im pretty fed up. Over the past year, I have tried to get my manager to adopt some sort of project management system that the whole team uses so we stay on the same page. Ive brought many solutions to the table, and he typically will react with subdued enthusiasm, but never do anything to support the adaptation, which is frustrating because it ultimately lands on him to adapt. For the last few years I just accepted it as part of working with someone perhaps a little more old-fashioned and not strategically-minded, but at this point it feels like my boss is just gaslighting me by convincing me that everything is organized in his head and that I need to just go with the flow of what is already set in place (which is nothing).

&amp;#x200B;

My fear is that this behavior is not gonna stop and im just gonna be taken advantage of and not credited for my work. Recently my attitude has kind of shifted towards a ' if you're gonna strike out, strike-out swinging' mentality where im really gonna push forward to make this system work, even if it means butting heads with or totally bypassing my manager. It just feels like ive been handed a good opportunity by being in a company like this, so despite the terrible management, I need to lean into the 'informal' management style and just push forward. Am I insane for wanting to do this, or should I just get the fuck out?"

b32e8e,459,2019-03-19,"I quit my job without another one lined up, here is my experience.",contains_language,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b32e8e/i_quit_my_job_without_another_one_lined_up_here/,"First, let me give you a little bit of background.



 


I have been in the industry for ~7 years, graduated from decent school in 2011.  I had one internship in college that lead to a full time position in my hometown at a large company.  Low pay but low responsibility, I worked at that position for about 3 years where I started doing front end development work.  





After that, I got a DevOps job in a different city, a big move for me.  It was contract and lasted for 10 months until I jumped ship.  It was taxing with long hours and a long commute.  I went immediately to a new position as a front end developer for a smaller company.  Worked with React building a SaaS web application for 2.5 years.  





My significant other got a dream position back in my home city which has an okay tech scene.  At this point I am nearing 30 years old, and am looking to be closer to my family and slow the pace of my life down a bit.   Problem is, I don't have a job lined up.  






Financially at this point, we are fine.  My significant other makes enough money for the both of us to live very comfortably, and I have enough money put away to where I could live for a few years without any trouble. This is a very important thing to note, as I didn't feel pressure to find another job quickly to pay bills.  I could get also health benefits through her job.






What ended up happening is I quit my job around November without anything lined up, enjoyed the holidays, went on a couple of long trips/vacations to other countries, then started to apply to positions near the beginning of February.  I was pretty casual about the process.  I did no leetcode grind, but I wasn't applying to FANG companies or anything like that.  Since then I have received 4 job offers, and as of last week, I landed a dream position doing web development, 100% remote.  I am stoked.







I guess I wanted to write this to give a different perspective.  The common consensus is you should not quit your job unless you have another one lined up.  For me it was the exact opposite.  The break I took really allowed me to do a complete mental refresh.  I was getting burned out, and desperately needed the break.  I actually found myself doing side coding projects for fun, something I had not done... ever?  






Thanks for reading!




EDIT:  Thank you for the responses, if anyone has any questions feel free to ask/DM me and I will be happy to offer what help I can.






EDIT2: I understand that this can come across as a bit of a humblebrag, and a bit disconected from those who are in troubling financial situations.  That is totally fair.  




Another reason I made this post was because of the how nervous and anxious I felt before quitting and jumping into the unknown realm of unemployment.  The anxiety was pervasive to all parts of my life.  I wanted to help those who are in a similar situation with similar feelings as I had a few months ago with a real life example that ended well, that's all.  I wish you all the best!"

So with the pricing right know, i will lose like 600-800 EUR when i sell my PC..

So, does anyone have any recommendations on how to make use and fun for my PC? Things like what to do with my PC would also help a lot!

b34ji1,87,2019-03-19,"There is no ""Right"" Major , PSA",deeznuts80081,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b34ji1/there_is_no_right_major_psa/,"Okay, so... There is no ""right"" major. If you want to talk about majors in terms of traditional starting salaries for just a bachelor's degree-yes, then STEM/Business will always win out in the end. If you're going to college for the humanities &amp; social sciences, then you still can come out ahead if you network, get internships, and be willing to move -and a high GPA.

Getting a job in 2019 is about who you know, not what you know. Even if you get a degree in Art History I'm sure somewhere, some company will hire you with your degree just because you have a degree. I know engineering majors and computer science majors working in fields having nothing to do with their degree in non technical roles, and humanities majors in fields that had NOTHING to do with why they were in college.

With this said, if you get the BA or BS with ZERO connections (regardless of your major) then your degree is useless. Get the connections. Regardless of your major. If you happen to live in a bad area of the country (US) chances are it'll be harder regardless of major. 

It's probably not a good idea to major in Art History or Philosophy, etc. IF YOUR GOAL IS INCOME. But you should do something that interests you that pays the bills that you don't hate. 

There's no right major. However, ""passions"" change over time. Pick a degree that you think will enable you to have the kind of lifestyle you want to have-income wise, job flexibility wise, or upward potential. If it happens to be STEM, great. If it happens to be a  ""softer degree,"" that's also great.

But don't freaking cripple your future and choose an inexpensive college and don't go out of state or a private college if you can't afford it! That's the bigger mistake than probably the initial degree. Even if you have an engineering degree but 150k of debt that's not justifiable just like it's not justifiable to have a humanities degree and 150k of debt. 

Choose wisely. Take on loans wisely. Research your career field. IF you do not know what you want out of an education-TAKE YOUR TIME. Your education is on YOUR time frame (not someone else's).

Anyone have any suggestions for recent grads or future students? Just having a talk with someone who has their head up their ass delusional about colleges. What would you have done differently in your education? Where are you now in your job search/employment? 

Oh, and one more thing-STAY CLEAR Of FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS.

  
I'm a graduate of a BS in IT and it worked out for me. Just wanted to do a PSA and to have anyone else chime in on how their education worked for them."

It not only serves as a ""database"" for you but also helps avoid that awkward call from HR that goes something like ""what position did I apply for?"".

&amp;#x200B;

It went something like this:

With my old resume, I had over 20 applications sent out with no responses besides the generic ""we've decided to move on with another applicant"".

Post r/resumes, I am proud to say that I have sent out 10 applications and got interviews from 4 of those companies! 2 of those companies didn't call me for a second interview, while one gave me a phone interview and then an in-person interview. Lastly, one company gave me a phone, virtual, and in-person interview and finally an offer!

To anyone lacking any motivation, please don't quit. Make some changes to not only your resume, but yourself.

The most important advice I got from one person on this sub was make sure to list everything you are familiar with. Never hold back. I used to keep some things off of my resume due to me being afraid of ""not being good enough"" but that person said some words that stuck with me. ""You'll always be learning and getting better, put it on there and allow them to decide how good you are."" This obviously doesn't mean lie on your resume, that will hold you back more than push you forward but you get the idea.

**First, my background:**

CPA, worked in public accounting for 1 year before transitioning into audit transformation and analytics where I was the PM for an analytics platform deployed nationally. After doing that I moved into Strategy consulting for 1.5 years and now heading into the MBA.

Outside work, I coded a mobile app that is active on the app stores and has a paid subscription base. I have also developed websites and understand programming syntax really well along with SQL, Python, Tableau, Qlik, HTML, Java.

**My questions:**

1. Given my business undergrad and off-beat programming interests, am I well positioned for a PM role at Google, FB, etc.?
2. What are key skills (what languages, etc.) these companies look for in candidates and how can I prepare myself better over the summer before I start my first year in Fall 2019?
3. How highly valued are non-PM roles at FAANG - think Google Strategy?

The classes for my major never really got more interesting and moreover, I'm currently working an internship made for a mechanical engineer and it's just not as exciting as I hoped.

When I was a sophomore I came across Computer Science, no experience to the subject prior, and took an entry level class. Loved it. Decided to take more classes and added a computer science minor to my degree, so I'll be graduating with that now as well.

Still, I'm mates with a couple programming team guys at my University and it's easy to tell that they're on a whole other level. I'm taking classes and practicing code on my own, but I won't be close to their level of competence in the field by the time I graduate.

If I could go back to my first year, I would definitely choose CS as my major. Now it's too late to switch majors, avoid the student loans, and a couple year setback. Still, the CS classes were much more interesting, fun, and CS can apply to almost anything I want to do, which encourages me to work towards a job in that field.

My dream job is along the lines of Robotics R&amp;D, but if I can't make that work I'd like to do another form of CS. Any advice? Anyone who graduated college with a degree they weren't passionate about and made the switch to CS?"

So right now we're working on a small scale project and it feels kind of underwhelming - there's no best practices, style guidelines, and little standard workflow. It's basically just do whatever you want. On top of that, we're using a framework I haven't used and is slowly losing popularity - Angular.

Maybe it's just me overthinking and panicking, but as I get closer and closer to graduating (in 1.5 years), I find myself getting anxious and stressed every night thinking if I'll be able to find a job that pays well and is in demand. Cost of living seems to be going up and just the thought of owning a house, vehicle, paying for insurance and bills makes me feel really stressed about the adult life and how I'll self-sustain myself... :(  I'm currently in a double degree program (BBA at Laurier and BMath at UW) and I've had lots of course experience in marketing, SCM, finance, accounting, strategic management, HR and on the math side, Statistics, optimization (intro), R, SQL, Python. I've had co-op internships as a QA, a Business Analyst, a Research Analyst, and as a Financial Analyst.


My issue is that I know with my degrees, it's wise to do something like actuarial science, fin-tech but I'm really no good at theoretical math nor see myself killing myself through those ActSci exams. Furthermore, when I see myself graduating, I just hope to have disposable income to finally pay loans off, travel (something I've been longing to do all my life, but never had the money) and other leisure things, but obviously you need money for these experiences. So I'm stuck deciding whether my risk adverse self should just settle as an accountant/CPA (but NOT do Public because I'd kill myself). I'm pretty decent in the Accounting courses, like Tax and all, but man can it get stale af. Some people suggested I look into data science roles, but everything I read online says you need further schooling as a masters and PhD in which I definitely know I don't have high enough grades for. My interests? If money didn't mean anything, I really enjoyed my marketing courses and case studies/write-ups because I was good at it and enjoyed working with products, consumer buying behaviour and all. It's just, I've read some posts and looked at glassdoor for marketing jobs and the pay seems lower than what I got paid on co-op which kind of makes me feel like my degrees were waste. I also like Supply Chain Management, however only a few aspects. I feel like this area is kind of uncertain in terms of jobs in GTA and not as abundant as the CPA/accounting route. So I'm stuck. Do anyone have advice on where or what I should look into? I've messaged countless people on linkedin on different jobs and experiences and get so many different inputs and perspectives but I still feel really uncertain on what to do. Most will say go into tech/data related stuff bc of the whole movement to AI, but I don't know how employable I will be in that sense :/


TL;DR: Could anyone who has experience in the following areas please share their opinions on their jobs, why they chose the career path, any regrets, and if possible starting salaries? Most imoprtantly, do you love what you do or did you do it for the trade off of the salary? 

* Marketing Analyst type roles
* Supply Chain Management (Pepsi, Whirlpool, Manufacturing...etc)
* Data Science 
* Accountants/CPA (both industry and Public experience)

I did not finish the application so I just left it alone but kept some semi-done paragraphs and filled out all my personal info in there(since it's pretty easy filling that stuff out) thinking that it'll get trashed after the application cycle is over.

Seems like I was wrong. Three months go by and I get a flurry of messages saying that my unfinished application was made public. Being a sysadmin and regular person informed about software, I knew that this University couldn't have employed a trash software that makes each application link public. Turns out I was wrong. The pals who sent me messages uncovered a really easy trick to finding each and every application, which included every student's phone number, emails, parent's phone numbers/emails, and importantly, **home addresses**. It also included every applicant's academic performance and transcript.

So being the dicks people at my school tend to be (this public school is top ranked, so it has the tendency to exhibit a toxic school culture) these guys decide to change my GPA on my public online application (I couldn't edit my application but these guys figured out how to do so) and **send it to over 300 students across the district with all my personal information/parent's information.** Not only has my reputation been ruined, but months after the incident I'm bullied, harassed, and mocked for having a horrible GPA that these guys edited to say I had. Then I come to find out they even **downloaded all 1500 student online applications (which included all their personal information).**

Employing the trash software this University decided to use for their online application, they also had results on whether you got in or not at the top of every public online application, meaning if you went to the public link of an application where the hardworking student got in, you could deny the acceptance yourself. Obviously since I had an unfinished application I got rejected, but for all the hard working students out there, these dicks could deny their acceptances. Well clearly these dicks did deny a lot of accepted kids, but to take it a step further, they decided to only **deny students that were hispanic or black.**

After the incident settles, I file a 20 page report to the police officer in charge at the University. \*sidenote: He says my well crafted report is the best he's ever seen\*. I want to file some report to the police so these students find out how harshly these students have affected my mental health, but find out that the police only take matters where the hack is currently going on, basically I couldn't file a report with the local PD because the hack **already** took place.

But here's the worst part of all: The school administrator's response. They tell me to give them all my documents and evidence I had (from experience I know they do this so that they can see where I, THE VICTIM may be wrong, painting me as a suspect... kinda f'd up, I know). I gave them the evidence and they literally meet with 2 kids. One is the main hacker who doxxed me and they told him: \*\*paraphrased\*\*: ""Don't worry, we'll take care of this, don't do it again. It's the University online application's fault of not being secure enough"".

Then this guy has the **audacity** to message me saying that the administrator was ""chill"".

10 months has passed and the DA's office hasn't taken any action at all. The police officer at the university says a detective is taking care of it, and I find out that the detective is just waiting for the DA. I have received an email saying that the DA didn't file any charges.

This amount of bullying, mocking, harassment has taken me over the edge. Surely, I have publications, achievements, awards, hobbies, interests, and some understanding of human behavior. And yes, my grades aren't a straight 4.0, but these guys don't have to harass me daily on this shit. My parents have been extremely supportive, I feel that everyone else's feeling that absolutely nothing has transpired and everything is fine truly disgusts me.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do in regards to convicting the students who targeted and doxxed me? What about the administration?

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

b38c35,1,2019-03-20,"Thinking About Starting a Company While in College, Need Advice",ChiefBrass,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/b38c35/thinking_about_starting_a_company_while_in/,"A junior ""Mech E"" here, I'm working on a product which employs a combination of AI, intensive data collection, mathematical modeling, structural modeling, and business acumen. I know this is extremely vague and more details would probably help but please bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I discussed this idea with one of my professors (let's call him Dr. LL).

Dr. LL advised that I do two things:

1. ""Read as many research papers as you can""
2. ""Make a smaller scale version of the product, treat it as a school project ""

Dr. LL didn't necessarily say it was a bad idea but for whatever the reason I could tell he was not as enthused as I was; even though his thesis was on a related topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the issues I'm having:

1. If I start off small, there's the issue of bringing other students onto the team. By doing this I'm essentially exposing my idea to individuals that may not in the end want to help or may end up *taking the idea for themselves* (this makes me very apprehensive and I'm not at all sure how I'd prevent this from happening).
2. If things get tough (which they will since we're just undergrad students), I'd imagine many ""dropping off"" to other things after a while (internships etc.) leaving me back at square one. I'd like to avoid a revolving door of people in and out to minimize premature exposure but that's a variable that can't really be controlled.
3. As students, none of us would really know whats going on so we'd be all just trying to figure it out which is great and all but I feel like time is important, the sooner it's complete better.

Given the above concerns, part of me feels that I should just go ahead and jump into it all by starting the company, hiring people that are paid/invested in actually seeing this through and who may have experience in the field(s) needed to get this thing off the ground. This means many other issues like gathering funding, sourcing and attracting talent, etc. All of this would need to be done following the completion of a small scale version anyway so it can't be avoided.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also thinking that this may just be too much for me to tackle and that I should just give up. After all not all ideas are attainable.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone started their own company, maybe tried and failed? Are you currently working on your own idea/company?**Any thoughts or advice on this situation would be appreciated, even if it's ""negative"". Be harsh on me!**

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I want to start a company while in college, but I'm unsure when/how I should add people to the team, and if I should start small and then upscale to a full product or jump right to the startup phase."

Afterwards the people from the company added me on linked in and one of the managers sent me an email welcoming me to the team and sent me a list of things to study for my job.

Fast forward to now, a month later. My internship isn’t supposed to start a month from now but I have sent two different emails a month ago asking about a written offer or a firm start date and still have no reply. I haven’t searched for other internships very much considering I thought this one was pretty legit. At this point I’m not sure what to do.

b3cuae,2,2019-03-20,"Internship Offer, Please Help...",paleweeks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b3cuae/internship_offer_please_help/,"Hi everyone; I have a dilemma that I could use advice on.

\-----

tl;dr received offer from very small startup where I'd be the only developer, not sure if I should take that or gamble on getting a summer internship at a more established place at this point in the semester

\-----

So I'm a philosophy major at a prestigious school, minoring in computer science. I've been looking for software engineering/development summer internships because I'm hoping to go into tech after I graduate. Recently, I received an offer from an infant startup (very small, 5 people total) looking for a full-stack web developer. I've set up my own website and worked front-end on a full web app, so I'm familiar with the basics, but only the basics. The prospect of working at a place where I am essentially solely responsible for the final project scares me - I'm sure I'd learn a lot, but also, there'd be no guidance. (Also, I doubt I would work at this startup after graduation.)

On the other hand, I'm currently interviewing with several other companies, all of which are known to have fairly decent intern programs. I've made it to onsite for a few of them. However, this year, I haven't practiced for technical interviews nearly as much as I would have liked to, and I'm not sure I could swing any of the onsites. I'm still applying, but obviously we're hitting the end of the season for summer internships, and I would much rather have some internship rather than none. So do I accept this guaranteed offer, or keep gambling for an internship that would probably be a better fit for me? In short, I'm torn, and I would love to hear advice from people who have been in the field. Thanks so much.

I graduated from a state university at the end of 2017 with a near 4.0 GPA in Computer Engineering but with no internships. I got an offer immediately after from someone my dad knew at a pretty small non tech company as a Jr. Software Dev paying about 48k in SoFlo.  I took the offer at the time because I thought the experience would be worth it seeing as I didn't have any. I basically deal with everything from front end to the database and I learned C#/ASP.NET/SQL Server all through this job. Most of the work feels like CRUD/bug fixes and it feels a little outdated compared to the stuff I was doing in university with C++/Python/Angular/etc. I enjoyed the assignments and projects I was doing in university. I've been at this job for 1.5 years now and I don't feel like I'm learning as much anymore and it feels rather boring.

At this point, I don't know how to properly progress with my career. I want to try and get into a bigger company, preferably one that is actually in the tech industry.

b3g7ah,2,2019-03-20,How to transition from being away from school (almost a year) to job?,thehanghoul,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b3g7ah/how_to_transition_from_being_away_from_school/,"Hello. I graduated in the spring of 2018 with a degree in MIS (management Information Systems) from a local school in Colorado. I had no internships there. However, I did graduate at 20 years old (2 years early). 

Right after school, after taking some time off to travel, and be with family, I feel like I hit a road block for jobs. 

I’ve been applying to jobs pretty intensely. Most of them are for IT, or for business analyst roles. However, of the offers I had, I only got back IT support roles (I’m looking for more database or analyst roles). While I’m not necessarily against them, I would like to have different roles. Also, regarding location, I live about 20 miles from the city (30 no traffic, an 1 hour or longer without). I am not looking forward to that commute. 

I guess my biggest concerns is I’m still hung up on school for some reason. I didn’t feel like I got the most out of it, professionally, socially, or really anything. I do miss the community of university, and ideally would like to go to grad school. To add to the stress, my family recently moved away, so I’m just stuck here trying to apply by myself. I’m at my home for unreasonable amounts of time. 

I understand to a certain degree that I have to make sacrifices. It’s just hard to gain traction now. I miss my family, and my former sense of stability. I am working part time as a TA (at night only), but that’s about it. 

So my basic questions are: 

1. To those who have struggled transitioning from university to job, how’d you make it through? 

2. What am I doing wrong in terms of mentality applying to jobs, and is there a better way to get the jobs I want

3. Should I lower my standards and apply for IT support roles? 

4. Should I just study for grad school, while trying to get a full time job as well?

All in all, I miss the university community, and learning, while maintaining a schedule. But I am also afraid of the daily grind of a full time job. 

Thank you for listening!"

Do I have to submit FAFSA/CSS every year do they evaluate how much I get each year, for example if I get 30K and paid the rest now next year our assets/savings are low compared to previous year as we paid that amount. Would I get more (assuming that our total income same but assets and savings are down)
2. Is that aid limited to 4 years or as long as I study at that school for that degree (read 5th year). If I go and take an internship for say 1 year, what happens 5th year would they give me same aid (assuming all remains the same)
3. Do they adjust aid if there are unforeseen circumstances (parents losing job/got sick and can't work etc)

b3ggov,5,2019-03-20,Tiger Mom,lilylithiumion,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/b3ggov/tiger_mom/,"Hi. I am not really sure how Reddit works because I legit just made this account, but I kind of need a safe space to talk about my parental issues that I need to vent off my chest because they've been making a lot of my other friends both online and IRL very uncomfortable.

So, a bit of background about me, I am 18, Chinese-American female on hopes of obtaining a Business degree and studying Pre-Pharmacy, and I live in one of the wealthiest counties in America. I attend UMD, and I am a member of a Panhellenic sorority there (which my mother already strongly opposes and only pays for all my fees because I say it is one of the few things I enjoy in college). I grew up having both of them (but mainly my mother 90% of the time) physically abuse me and bruise me whenever I would do something like roll my eyes or talk back (like if she kept going on and on about something that could be said in 5 words, I'd get pissed off and talk back and curse at her).

I think my mother is a big sociopath. Like, she ONLY talks to other Chinese parents, and guess what they talk about. They ONLY talk about GPA, their kids' achievements, and ways to schedule high school classes here to optimize for the best GPA to be #1 in the school even though colleges don't really give a shit if you are #1 or like, still top 5% or even lower (we have a weight system where regular classes give your weighted GPA a 4.0, honors is a 4.5, and GT or AP gives it a 5.0 weight boost), and ways to boost SAT/AP scores. The thing is, her small toxic ""friend"" circle all pressure their kids like crazy so she pressures our family like crazy too. I have a younger brother in the 8th grade. He JUST did insanely well, like, he is going to the NATIONAL math counts competition. But guess what, it hasn't been 3 days or so after the competition and he just wants a break to play video games, but nope, I hear my mom yelling at him, that no one else plays games and that all kids are studying math all the time. So she makes him study math more.

She presumes that the rest of the world is like, her friend circle and their kids, whom are all Chinese of course and high achieving in the 2nd wealthiest county in the USA.

My mom and I had a big ass argument a couple of days ago. She was asking me if I have decided my double major and my minor yet. I told her honestly that I JUST applied to the business school &lt;1 week ago and worked my ass off for the application, and that I just want to obtain a business degree WHILE taking pre-pharmacy classes at UMD (which is ALREADY a load of work because I also want time to have a social life and do other clubs and honor societies or leave time for an internship). This bitch yells at me for not having chosen a minor yet. She then proceeds to say that MOST people do a double major at UMD and it is pathetic if I only have one major without a minor. There are no minors that I would enjoy that can fit my schedule. I would do a science/chem minor if THEY EVEN OFFERED IT. But they don't offer many science minors besides stuff like Ocean Science. And then she's like ""Why can't you be a statistics minor? I thought you liked math."" But for fucks sake, why can't she sit her ass in one of the UMD chemistry course or a general UMD class lecture and realize that most of these classes are huge weed outs and that the university isn't even easy. She thinks every business class or just, most classes in general at UMD, are a joke because a lot of her other friends' kids all go to Ivy League or prestigious upper tier schools like Cal Tech and Stanford. She thinks it's a lot easier than my high school, but it isn't. Most people take 4-5 classes, and getting a single B in one of them drops your GPA to like a 3.7 or lower. She thinks I can just add minors and majors like it is nothing and still expect me to have a social life or even get fucking sleep.

She doesn't understand how stressed I am already and I keep trying to explain to her, but she never listens. She just calls me close minded when she should fucking evaluate herself. I was crying and she then yelled at me and said that crying is for the weak and people who are stupid/etc.

I just want you guys to realize and be aware of how toxic Asian culture can be. I honestly don't know what to do. I want to legally emancipate myself and my brother once I am older, but, a lot of Chinese traditions require you to be super close to your family (like think about the mom from Crazy Rich Asians on steroids and then that would be my mother). I hate my mother. I don't have any sympathy for her. She is a horrible human being, and I am sickened by the physical, emotional, and mental abuse she's put upon me and currently upon my brother right now. I wish I could call the police on her. I just don't know what to do because she pays for everything I do, so I can't just have her arrested otherwise I'd have to make money and pay for everything myself and I don't have a job, and I'd be so unstable financially and everything. She makes my life more and more miserable and I just feel like I am spiraling into more depression from this. And, it's to the point where I just am not proud of being Chinese. I am not proud of my abusive culture. I hardly hang out with other people with similar background and only really have mostly white friends because I want to evade my culture due to my background of abuse, and I just don't know what to do or how to cope.

 [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b2pot2/i_found_a_foggy_bridge_that_leads_to_a_sinister/)

_I'm sitting on a couch, in a house, in a town that's hidden by a foggy bridge. I'm staring at a tv, wafting for cheesy music to play and Mr. Spooks or Mr. Skoops to come on stage. I'm crossing my fingers Lucy announces a Nathan Roland as the contestant to Hell's Penthouse._

A little explaining.

Three days ago my friend Sam got captured by the shows dog catchers. I'm not really sure if that's what they're called, but they wear uniforms for dog catchers and drive the same style van; so that's what I'm calling them. The next night she appeared on Hell's Penthouse and was punished with her body being invaded by cockroaches.

That night the camera actually showed a view of the audience, which looked to be past contestants. From the corner, I'm sure I saw a glimpse of Malory and Jeremy; now with cartoonish smiles. I saw who looked to be Mr. Spooks but was apparently a cruel twin. Where Mr. Spooks was comical, Mr. Skoops was sadistic. Not as sadistic as Lucy.

After Sam was captured, I discovered the fog helped hide you, that the dog catchers were attracted to sound. I learned the town did *not* like people from the other side of the bridge. If caught, you'd be killed for your sins in a horrifying way.

All this new knowledge helped me when I finally drove home yesterday morning. When I pulled up to my apartment building and saw a car that wasn't mine in my spot. The car that belonged to boyfriend's red headed, big breasted colleague; he told me she was just an intern.

Surely enough, there they were, curled up on the bed I bought when I got the keys to the apartment. I'd given him a key to visit on his days off, but the apartment was in my name. The fact he'd have the nerve to bring someone to a place he didn't even live to have sex with? Oh no, he wasn't going to get away with it that easily.

Angrily I pulled her out of my bed by her hair, dragged her from my bedroom, and tossed her out the front door. It felt so good to slam it behind her. Then my anger turned on him, who was right behind me. He dropped to his knees begging that I understand how sorry he was. Begging that I believe he never meant to hurt me. Guys must seriously have a handbook full of bullshit excuses for every event.

Enough was enough, but I feigned calm and smiled at him. He slowly stood and embraced me, leaning in to kiss me but I turned enough that the kiss hit my cheek. That didn't seem to make him happy.

""Sweetie, I just don't think this is the best time for us. I want my key back and I want you out. I'll bring you your stuff after work."" I told him as I held out my hand. As if he'd actually be able to give me my key when all he had was a blanket wrapped around his waist. ""Oh, and you can give your whore her stuff back when I drop off yours. Though I genuinely hope you're decent enough to not have her at your place when I'm there.""

""Babe! Common! Don't be childish! She's just some bimbo intern and it meant nothing! Just believe me and let's go to bed! I'm exhausted."" He pouted at me.

""I don't doubt for a second that you're exhausted. You seemed to be giving her everything a tiny blue pill can give you."" I smirked at him, hoping the insult to his manhood would sting. ""But there is one way you can make it up to me. Come for a drive with me, we can talk it out on the road. The weather is beautiful.""

He protested for about ten minutes but finally gave in. It pays to have everyone know you're a weirdo that prefers driving to drinking. Soon we were taking a slow drive along a familiar road. He pleaded with me that I should give him another chance, threw out profanities and insults to my thought process, and complained that we'd been in the car forever.

Finally we reached the bridge. It was covered in fog, just as I'd hoped.

I drove along while he asked how I could see anything, but just ignored him. Nothing he said was important to me. The only thing that was, was my theory being right. When we got to the other end, his mouth went agape. I shared a secret laugh with myself and pulled over to give myself enough space to reverse if I needed to. Now was the time.

""Let's go for a walk, it feels so nice out. We can pretend we're an old-fashioned family."" I began unbuckling my seatbelt and he followed suit. He got out of the car, shut his door, and started to walk around to my side. Typical sleezebag to fake chivalry when they're in the dog house. Just when he was in front of my car I blared my horn, causing him to stumble backwards and land on his butt.

From a distance I saw a garage open, but instead of a van emerging it was what appeared to be a tow truck. It pulled out of the driveway and sped toward us, backward.

""Shit! Let me in! That truck is outta control! It's gonna hit me!"" He was scrambling to get up and punching the hood of my car. Good, bastard deserved it.

The tow truck got closer and suddenly the hook shot at his head, missed, and landed onto the blacktop. A creak like noise echoed as the hook coiled into the truck, giving him enough time to get to his feet and try to run back to the passenger side. The hook shot out again, latching into his leg and pulling him stomach first to the ground. I slowly pushed the pedal and drove reverse until the fog was enough to cover I was there, but also enough to see what was going on.

I'm not gonna lie, the sound of his screams as he was dragged across the blacktop, back to the house, was music to my ears. He tried to pull himself away by pushing himself up with his fists and attempting to crawl, but eventually fell and his face dragged. When he tried to lift again, his face was covered in rocks and pieces of flesh was hanging off of it. 

If my theory was right, he'd be on the show tonight.

So here I am, sitting on the edge of the couch, smiling from ear to ear as the tv flicks on and cheesy music erupts from the speakers. The camera pans in to Mr. Spooks and his comical tux.

""Good evening loyal viewers! Who's up for another rousing game of *Hell's Penthouse*!"" Cheers from off camera. ""But we're not here to see me, are we?"" I could barely stop myself from shouting *no* at the tv. ""No, we're here to see our contestants be tortured for their sins! Now let's give a round of applause to our dazzling host Lucy Pfeiffer!"" Now I was clapping along with the audience off camera.

Lucy walked on stage, but today her long blond hair was in a bun and her gown was tighter than I normally saw it.

""Thank you, Mr. Spooks! So glad to be here with all you wonderful viewers and listeners!"" Mr. Spooks did his comical bow and hopped off stage. The camera followed him then went back to Lucy, who was smiling directly into the camera. It wasn't her normal smile, it was if she *knew* I was watching. ""Oh my, do we have a fantastic show boiling for you tonight! And I don't say boiling lightly! Boys!"" She held out the word boys like a song, and two dog catchers walked on stage pulling a rope that was connected to a tub.

When they got to center stage they dropped the ropes and walked away, the camera panned in on the tub. It was full of water that was bubbling. Mr. Spooks moonwalked on stage, maneuvered around the tub, and handed a file to Lucy over his head. Lucy took it and glanced at it before tossing it to the side. Mr. Spooks scurried to grab it and hopped out of camera view.

""So, our file tonight is really of no importance. Tonight our contestant is a duzy. Tonight we have a contestant that hurt one of our faithful viewers."" Was she talking about *me*? Was my theory *right*? ""Our contestant tonight is a Nathan Roland!"" She winked at the camera and I choked on my cheering.

The dog catchers once again walked on stage with ropes, this time connected to a mangled up Nathan. It was a wonder he was still alive after being dragged across the blacktop of the town. This was justice being served. This was vengeance.

""It's not nice to cheat on our viewers, Nathan. No sir, it isn't. We respect our viewers, as long as long as they respect us. You did a very nasty thing cheating on our wonderful viewer, then lying to her and gaslighting her. I have a beautiful punishment for your sin. We'll learn more about that, after a word from our sponsors!"" The tv went black as Lucy smacked Nathan's face.

I couldn't believe it! I was right about everything! About the rules, about the noise, about the show! And I was a respected viewer! Things just couldn't get better for me! Well, until the tv flicked back on. The camera panned in on Lucy and Nathan, she was petting what used to be his cheek and wipping the blood off her hand onto his hair.

""Welcome back to our show! Before break we learned this despicable human being is a liar and cheat to one of our viewers. Now let's see his punishment unfold!"" The camera panned back on to the tub, and the boiling water the boiling water that filled it, then panned out to show Mr. Spooks and Mr. Skoops wrapping a cord that was hanging from the ceiling around Nathan's waste. ""Now it's time to show you what it's like to boil in Hell.""

The cord was raised, tugging Nathan up with it until his stomach hit the stage lights. A screamed broke through my speakers and the camera panned back in on his face. There, in his open screaming mouth, were broken teeth and holes where teeth used to be. The camera panned back on Lucy who began clapping a beat. The audience off camera followed it. Even I was following it. With each clap Nathan dropped just a little more until he was barely dangling over the tub of boiling water.

""Now here's the question! Do we slowly lower him in, or do I have Mr. Skoops cut the cord so he drops in?"" The audience screamed out different ideas for what to happen. Cutting the cord, slow boiling, I wanted the cord cut. I wanted to see him thrash in the water.

They could read my mind, there's no other explanation to Mr. Spooks handing Mr. Skoops a pair of gardening sheers and Mr. Skoops slashing the cord just above Nathan's stomach. The splash was amazing, it almost soaked Lucy. The camera panned back in on the tub as Nathan thrashed and tried to get free, the water was turning red. From the burns or from the wounds he already had, it didn't matter. Soon the thrashing began to slow and Nathan's head slowly sank under water.

When the bubbles finished, the tv went black. Justice was served and I was smiling ear to ear.

I need to find more people to bring with me. This is getting fun."

With that being done I will graduate Dec 2019. And begin looking for full time work thereafter.

I'm only getting an Associate's degree in LAN Systems: Network Administrator. In my area of Texas (central and south) there are several jobs that require just an associates. Most internships are requiring you to be in a bachelor program. I plan on continuing to a bachelor's, but that's going to be at least a year off. I need to get into a job. I've been out of work for 3 years and it's rough. I'm ready to work again.

I'm doing the job fair this spring at my school. Handing out my resume and networking with people. I'm just curious if my plan is a good idea? Do I need an internship? Or taking the SQL class better option?

I have a bachelors in chemistry and a minor in computer science.  I have been job searching for awhile, but it's clear that more schooling would be very helpful as well as help get an internship.  I love school, so I'm not upset by this.   I can't decide which would be more beneficial though.  A bachelors would be easier, but since I'm going back to school anyway should I just go for the masters?  Does it even matter? I think they will both take about the same amount of time at this point.  Thanks!"

b3jxrk,1,2019-03-20,Please help me! First (paid) job questions.,awkward-bot,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b3jxrk/please_help_me_first_paid_job_questions/,"Please help me.

Background:

I am and IT student and I am close to graduating but I don't have work experience. I started looking for internships last month to try and gain experience. I also started applying to other jobs because dad lost his job and I will need to start paying the bills. I just received an email from a recruiter for a PT computer lab job at a school and they wanted to interview me. Which made me realize I didn't know anything regarding jobs, interviews, and taxes.

Please help me answer some questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. How do I reply to the email???
2. The job pays $14/hour and the application asked to give a salary range I expect. I didn't know what to expect so I just put that it is negotiable. What do I do if they ask me about this question during the interview?
3. I will have to start supporting my family and I am worried because what if the pay for this job is not enough to support my family? I am already thinking about taking on two part time jobs. Am I overreacting?
4. How does salary negotiations work? Am I suppose to ask them what they want to pay me and just accept it or do I have to give them a range? Do they usually stick to the listed salary or do they try to lower it?
5. Am I suppose to ask about compensations and benefits during the interview? The job listing doesn't mention anything about compensation and benefits. I don't even have a good idea what compensation and benefits are and what to expect.
6. I have severe anxiety when it comes to driving, my dad said that he is willing to drive to to work if I get accepted for the job. What should I say when they ask me if I have reliable transportation? Should I just tell them yes?
7. Is it weird to ask them about their dress code during the interview? Or ask them about what they expect from me if I was hired? Can I ask them about the work environment?
8. If I was hired, and someone else wanted to interview and hire me or I found an internship, what happens?
9. What if I was hired and I didn't like the job? Or I wasn't good at it?"

Thank you all in advance!


Intended major: Looking at International Relations/Affairs but not entirely sure. Hoping to do a double major or minor in something like econ/business.

**Stats**:

- ACT: 32 on my most recent practice (27 M, 35 S, 32 E, 32 R) but shooting for a 34. Taking early April ACT and if I don't hit my target or close then I will take it again in June.


- SAT: Still waiting on scores from in school test but would be surprised if it was better than my ACT as I'm doing tutoring for the ACT and did not do any prep for the SAT


- GPA: 3.99 UW, 4.08 W


- AP: None offered 9/10. Currently in Environmental Science. Will be in AP Stat/Lit next year as that is all that will be available to me due to budget cuts. Am on the most rigorous course load possible for our classes offered.

        
- Class rank: 5 in 50ish. 1-4 are there because running starts counts towards weighted GPA (I may do running start part time next year but I'm not entirely sure).

      
**EC's**:

- Student Senate: Class secretary Freshmen year, class secretary sophomore, head of the ~35 person body this year (planning large scale events, communicating with staff, going to staff meetings, etc)

- MUN: Head Delegate since sophomore year and will continue through next year (run all meetings, coach all new and experienced delegates, communicate with staff, work on logistics, edit large numbers of papers leading up to conferences).

- Quakerism (religion): Go to 4 retreats each year and have been a clerk for all of them (essentially the youth leader that organizes the activities during the retreats, communicates with adults and runs worship groups).

- Environmental Education Club: Go on hikes, currently planning all school/all day event, will likely be club president next year.

- Wilderness summer camp: Work as an assistant instructor with groups of ten 6-12 year olds for 40 hrs a week (2 weeks summer before freshmen year, 3 weeks summer before sophomore year).

- Internship at the Port of Seattle for summer going into junior year (6 or 7 weeks working full time). Worked in an office setting, worked with interns from other departments on projects that we presented to staff, attended various day trips/job conferences.

- Did rock climbing 5hrs a week freshmen year on a 'team' (only did one competition that year, our team places 4th)


            
**Honors**:
- Our MUN team won Best Large School Delegation two years in a row at the largest local conference.

- Individually have won Best Position Paper twice and outstanding (best) delegate once.

- Freshmen/Sophomore Student of the Year past two years.

- Published in yearly creative writing anthology from our Writers in the Schools program.

- NHS


                     
**Looking for**:

- Liberal Arts
- Merit Aid
- Likely small (haven't toured anywhere large but am pretty set on being somewhere with around 2-3k students)
- Access to internships (this is a large reason that I am looking at East Coast schools given that I'm interested in International Relations/Affairs)
- Not too hot (can handle cold)
- More liberal student body but not too set on it (liberal Seattle bubble has to burst someday lol)
- Collaborative learning environment
- Access to professors
- Am open to schools not on the west/east coast, my extended family is in all the midwest so could maybe figure out a way to tour colleges in that area.

b3kwvk,377,2019-03-20,How to leverage your ADHD to succeed in school (as promised!),betacarotene4,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b3kwvk/how_to_leverage_your_adhd_to_succeed_in_school_as/,"Hey everyone, just posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b3dahu/got_into_grad_school/) and am returning with the promised advice about using your ADHD quirks to succeed in school! Warning: this will be incredibly long!!

&amp;#x200B;

FIRST: read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/) \- specifically the whole bit about forgiving/appreciating past you and doing favors for future you. this is applicable to academics as well!

&amp;#x200B;

*IN TERMS OF LEVERAGING ADHD:*

1. **Don’t hate yourself for procrastinating - take advantage of the procrastinator’s adrenaline.** I used to get really annoyed at myself for procrastinating, but then I came to appreciate how amazingly I could do an assignment when I started it the night it was due. I decided to do a little experiment when applying to internships: cover letters usually take me about 4-5 hours, but I didn't have enough free time to spend that long on them before deadlines. I waited until a night when 2 of them were due at midnight, and I started writing them at 10 PM. Riding on the adrenaline (and stress) high of having a close deadline, I easily finished both before 12. Then I wrote 2 more before 2 AM because I was still in such a motivated and adrenaline-filled mindset! This isn’t always applicable - I wouldn’t recommend this for studying or huge assignments, but the point is that IT IS (sometimes) OKAY TO PROCRASTINATE! I can’t tell you how many times I would sit down a week before a deadline and TRY to work on a project but couldn’t get anything out of my brain. If your brain only lets you focus the day before something is due, then so be it. Just make sure you have free time and a good study environment on that day to make the most of your procrastination adrenaline!
2. **Utilize distraction when studying to learn fun facts.** Give yourself time to be distracted. Those distracted wikipedia or google searches help you discover fun facts that enable you to better remember information. For one class, I had to memorize James C. Scott’s findings about peasant resistance, but I couldn't connect his name and his work for the life of me no matter how many times I quizzed myself. But you know what helped me remember? When I found out on his wikipedia page that he used to have a sheep farm in Connecticut. Now I remember him because I associate his findings with a fun fact about sheep farming. Also, make up stories in your head to remember key facts. For example, I imagined sheep peasants rising up against elite sheep. Make sense? Nope. Help me remember the actual info? Absolutely!
3. **Take advantage of academic accommodations.** My school lets me have access to class notes (taken by someone else, really great to clarify bits of material that I miss when I zone out), extended time on exams, and (my favorite) stopwatch breaks during exams, which means that I can take breaks during exams, stretch my legs or whatever for as long as I want, and they’ll time it and add that time back onto my exam at the end. This is great because when I get overwhelmed, I can take breaks without worrying about losing exam time. It can be hard to advocate for yourself, but do it for future you! You’ll be so grateful to have accommodations to help you out.

*GENERAL ADVICE:*

1. **When you’re taking notes, paraphrase everything the teacher says.** When you’re reading textbooks, paraphrase all of the notes you take. This improves your learning 500000%. Further, if you’re taking hand-written notes and you’re a visual learner, use arrows and colors and circles - mind-map style! If you’re writing typed notes, it can be easier to just mindlessly copy down what’s on your professor’s PPT slides, but don’t fall into this trap cus you won’t retain any of the information. When I’m typing notes, I write paragraph style - I turn each slide’s info into a paragraph (albeit poorly-written) because if I do bullet-point notes, it’s way too easy to get distracted and write what the prof says verbatim.
2. **Join class facebook groups and make friends in your classes.** Suggest reading groups so that a group of x students split up the readings for the whole semester - then, you’ll only have to do one but still have access to notes on all of them. This is super super helpful for me. Also, having friends in your classes = having people to check your notes with to make sure you understood everything. If people see you in class, they won’t think you’re a bum if you ask for their notes and explain why you want them - they’ll understand you want to double check the material and make sure you didn’t miss any! Also, good for study groups if you’re into that kinda thing - I hate studying in a group so not my cup of tea, but might be helpful for some!
3. **To-do lists.** Keep two of these. One will be a longer one, split into sections titled “need-to-do” and “want-to-do.” This is so that you keep an eye on things you have coming up in the future and keep track of ongoing tasks. The other will be a daily to-do list with MAXIMUM two tasks. This is so you don’t get overwhelmed by trying to do everything on your other list in one day and end up giving up - instead, you will choose the very top one or two priorities of your day and ALWAYS get those done, eventually working your way down your longer to-do list.
4. **Clean your room.** ALWAYS clean your room or apartment. You will feel better if you wake up every morning to a clean apartment. You will be more productive when you study if you work at a clean desk. I try to do a mini (30 second) tidy of my apartment most days, which prevents it from getting super bad. Sometimes it does get super bad, but then I just do a deep clean and start over. I always feel WAY better, and way more capable of doing constructive work and being a productive human, when I’m living in a clean apartment.
5. **Make friends with your teachers. MAKE SURE THEY KNOW YOU ARE TRYING.** In high school, teachers can usually tell if you’re struggling with course material. In college, professors might already know you have ADHD through your school’s office of students with disabilities, but it can be a bit more difficult to demonstrate how hard you’re trying when you’re in super big classes. But, it can be as easy as going to office hours (say you want to clarify a few concepts, note you have ADHD so sometimes you struggle to grasp certain aspects of the lectures) and making sure they know your name. This is important for two reasons: they’ll be more accommodating if they know you and know you’re a hard worker (I also feel WAY more comfortable asking a professor for an extension or specific advice once I already have some sort of relationship with them), and they’ll write you better letters of recommendation if you need them for scholarships or grad school.

**Fuck the standard learning style**. If you’re anything like me, you can’t learn much from lectures. Sitting down and listening to someone speak for an hour and a half isn’t the most conducive to learning. I sometimes leave a lecture not even knowing what we talked about. AND THAT’S OK. If it doesn’t work for you, it doesn’t work for you. If you need to skip class and go to the library for the same length of time instead, do it. If you want to go to class, record the lecture, then study it at home in increments, do it. If you do better work on the last day before a deadline but feel pressured by others to get started early, even if you know that won’t work for you? Don’t! Don’t expect what works for most other people (ie going to class and taking notes then somehow just knowing the material, or studying by reading through the notes once) to work for you!

The first interview was at a restaurant/bar where we just hung out and not much technical stuff was discussed. they wanted to see if i was a culture fit, overall. Everyone did honestly seem like people i could get along with and i think they thought i was a dank ass dude as well...

&amp;#x200B;

the second interview was over the phone and was more technical, i guess, but they basically checked out my github and  said 'looks good'. then i was hired! 

&amp;#x200B;

I am honestly pumped as hell (and nervous). its basically a dream come true.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think i am under qualified. I fully intend to go in there and learn as much as possible. However, i do not have any sysadmin knowledge, penetration testing, no certs, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

i took classes along the lines of oop, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and that was essentially the peak of it. I am looking at the requirements of standard jobs in security and i truly do not meet any of the requirements or literally know what some of it even means. I want to do well and the work seems really interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working on side projects and everything(flask, android, simple API stuff), but it seems like those are a caveat to cyber-security. Thus, I am very very scared.

Please guys,

What can i do to alleviate my anxiety

b3mj89,3,2019-03-21,The struggle of finding an internship,asleader12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b3mj89/the_struggle_of_finding_an_internship/,"So as the title states I have been on the grind of finding an internship. Abit of background info, I am currently a junior studying electrical engineering. I have a decent GPA of 3.3. Now, as a typical engineering student I feel like I wont find a job post graduation without an internship. I have applied to about 30 positions and the ones I heard from had your typical rejection. I have yet to have an in-person interview and I am honestly loosing hope. I don't think I am not qualified as I honestly love to learn things outside of the classroom. Anyway, I have a few questions and hopefully you might be able to help me.

1. Any advice?
2. How important is a cover letter and should I have one for an intern position?
3. How important is a LinkedIn account, I have one but never really used it.
4. What can I do to increase my chances of getting an interview?

Thanks in advance. "

I have been lucky enough to find and secure a summer internship from July until September, working as a Hedge Fund analyst, predominately in the short book focusing on themes such as profitless prosperity. 

How could I help prepare myself going into this internship, I am part of my Student run hedge fund society where we learn the basics of valuations DCFs and comps etc... But I fear this is not enough.

In addition to this and I realise it is a hard question to answer would getting my level 1 CFA be manageable along side a full time university course?

So I had a crush on this guy, we’ll call him Lee, for like 2 years. A BIG FAT CRUSH.  All my friends knew about it and it was like a joke that it would never happen. In fact I dated his BEST FRIEND (not knowing they were best friends) and was certain it would never happen. Well last August it did. Lee asked me to go out with him one night we did, we got along really well and decided to hangout again. We took things slow and didn’t rush into anything but eventually started dating. 

We were literally the same person, same ideas, same personalities, same sense of humor, same anxieties. It was strange meeting someone who was exactly like me but it made us get along so well and I loved that. We never really fought and everything just felt right all the time. 

Come January I got arrested (as mentioned in previous posts) and had to decline an internship I received. Lee thought I declined the internship because of him and that put a lot of pressure on us. He didn’t care that I got arrested because he got arrested this summer. 


One night we almost broke up and I convinced him to try to work on things instead of just throwing them away and he agreed. Everything was fine we’d hangout and face time, I slept over his house, we went to his friends concert. Literally NOTHING was wrong. 


Two weeks later he broke up with me. He apologized over and over again, and he even apologized again over text the next morning. I understood where he was coming from but I was so frustrated because he never acted like anything was wrong. We never fought or anything. He hated opening up and talking about his emotions and I gave him space with that. I just feel so empty now. 

I thought I’d be over it by now but I’m not. I deleted all the pictures and texts and everything but he is still stuck in my mind. All I want to do is call him and ask him how he is but I can’t. I’ve tried hanging out with other guys, hooking up with other guys, focusing on myself, hanging out with my friends, spending time with family. NOTHING WORKS. I just need help because I feel like I’ll never love someone the way I love him again. "
b3qdko,12,2019-03-21,Does anyone feel underappreciated at work? - 7 Months of Low Standards,MichaelOlan,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/b3qdko/does_anyone_feel_underappreciated_at_work_7/,"For the past 7 months, I have been working in a position that to my personal
standards is sub-par. I don’t get paid what I’d like, I don’t have the hours I desire, the latitude for innovative action, the presence as an important entity, nor the feeling of mutual respect of those in higher management, that says, “We want and value your input.”

For 7 months I’ve lived in constant dissonance, knowing in my heart of hearts that I should look for something more suited to my skill set, my passions, and my personal value. However, every time I begin to move forward with this, I find that I have become complacent. I find that as important as the “desire to move on” was in the moment I felt it, so to is the desire to feel comfortable, to feel immersed in familiarity. 

My situation does not match my standards for myself when I’m in a heightened state, however it matches my standards when I allow it to drag me down to a lower state.

For the past 7 months I’ve applied, I’ve searched and I’ve inquired about other positions and possibilities that would match my desired self. Some things I’ve moved on, others I have not. During this time I’ve spoken to many of my friends, who too have issues with the places and the people in which and with whom they work. 

And as it has been 7 months, I’ve had much time to contemplate and ruminate on the structures set in place for college students and graduates. I’ve also had much time to contemplate and ruminate on those things that hold people back, and have found that it is these things that are the most important to address in a society growing and in ever building demand.


When I first finished college, I thought that it would be easy to find a job. I said, “I’ll just apply at a hospital, or do an internship abroad.” Surely, these things are easy and feasible right? Well yes and no. What I didn’t know was that in order to be ready for these positions, not only would I need more experience in the work force and better accreditation, but I would also need more confidence. You see as it turns out, our standards for ourselves and our lives can at times be at odds with how much we value ourselves. This in psychology is called cognitive dissonance. It’s when your thoughts, experiences, and behaviors are at odds with one another.

When our values for ourselves do not meet our standards for ourselves, then our standard of living is tarnished. In other words… one’s value for oneself is directly correlated to one’s context and behavior thus leaving the individual in a place in dissonance with his standard. This, if you ask me, is a cyclical problem. 

By having low value for ourselves, we choose those climates that are below our standards. As we choose those climates that are below our standards, we are then valued by others based upon those climates.


We all know it all too well. It’s all a part of that creeping voice that reminds us, “You
are not good enough”, and that other creeping voice that says, “You are the master of the universe and everything should bend to you.” Unfortunately, we find that the latter voice is nearly always wrong, as others are often times in control, which forces us to default to the prior voice as our source of strength. Not a very strong source if you ask me…


At this point you’re probably thinking, “Oh gosh did I read all of this for some
pontificating nightmare?” Well that depends on you. The question that all of this potentially sophistic ranting leads to is simply this, “Do our workplaces leave our employees feeling valued, so as to match their personal standards for employment?”

A rewarding company is a rewarded company. Companies that take their employees on retreats, throw parties, give them raises, or accolades for good work, typically have a higher retention rate, as well as beneficial PR from ex-employees about the culture of that company. Mind you, these are not supplemental treatments for perceived self-value, or job satisfaction. Nothing can take the place of the real thing.

However, they do act as a morale booster of sorts. These are reminders that your company's owner, or boss, has been where you are now, working his or her way up, and remembers what it feels like at the base of the rung.


 Unfortunately, many companies, much like that which I work at currently, base themselves on what I refer to as the “Crumbling Base” or the “Replaceable Cog” Method. Simply put, although those at the bottom of the latter run the day to day and keep the company afloat, they are expendable, replaceable, capable of being washed away without a trace and replaced by a doppelganger reminiscent of the previous employee when he started. Remember him? The guy who showed up every day with a smile for
everyone, a compliment or two, and a great energy to feed off of? 

What happened to him you might ask? Well he got burnt out. And by becoming burnt out he reengaged with his self-value, and found something that met his newly replenished standards.

He does not have a kind word for his previous employment, and unfortunately they do not care. 

You see it doesn’t matter whether you look at a business through 6 lenses or a million. What matters is that the lenses are clear, and that the value of an employee is constantly reemphasized. At the end of the day what sounds better? A
cog that breaks only to be replaced with one of the same material and shelf life, or a different cog that operates more efficiently, and for a longer period of time?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 3rd year CS student at a pretty highly-regarded public university in the US. My GPA is about 3.85, I've had 2 internships with a small local company (acquired through connections of friends) and I've had a part-time programming job for the past 2 years at my university. I have a couple of small side projects related to programming. I also participate in campus activities outside of classes.

&amp;#x200B;

This Fall I was applying for summer internships at larger companies like Google, Microsoft, etc., and various banking and financial institutions. My application got rejected or ghosted by most of them but I got the typical ""coding challenge"" from about 5. I passed all of them and got rejected from **every company except for one**.

&amp;#x200B;

It's pretty typical of my CS classmates at my university to be getting offers from companies I was rejected from (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Intel, etc.) despite the fact that I have a higher GPA (average is around 3.2) and more on-the-job experience than most other 3rd-year students.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just wondering - is there something I'm missing? Is there something I'm not doing that I should be?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated.

edit: thank for all the advice. also idk why my comments all got downvoted, because they were in the same spirit as this post which got upvoted lol"

I'm a 4th year computer engineering student who's minoring in philosophy. I wanted to turn the minor into a major, but my school doesn't allow people within the faculty of engineering to declare a second major. I went back and forth through 5 different advisors, and the only real option for doing a major in philosophy would be to complete my degree, and begin a new major that would require 60 additional credits, and none of my minor or extra classes would count. 

I'm really conflicted over what I should do. I want to learn more about philosophy, and be able to justify my most fundamental beliefs. I've also considered doing a double minor in economics and philosophy, because I would like to be able to understand the economy. If I pursued this though, I feel like I wouldn't be properly educated in either field. 

I'm also conflicted because I feel bad when people ask me why I'm bothering to take these extra classes in philosophy, they look down on me because I'm 24, and will be doing undergrad potentially till i'm 26/27. 

I also would like to eventually complete a masters in computer science after all of this, and I would probably be almost 30 when I am done all of this. Perhaps I would consider a PhD afterwards, but I'm not sure where I'll be in such a long time from now. 

If I completed my current degree by 2020 of next year, I'd have to deal with certain conflicts and probably would not be able to complete my minor, but I would be able to begin a philosophy degree where only 36 of the credits are required to be from my major, allowing me to potentially attain a minor in economics as well. This would take 3 years, and I'd be 27. By this time, I could have completed a masters degree. 


I'm paralyzed by choices and it's giving me a lot of anxiety. I feel like time is just escaping me and I'm growing older and by putting so much of myself into school, i'm not enjoying my youth enough. On the other hand, I a very big fear of missing out on opportunities to become educated on things that are very important to me. 

Financially, I have enough money from summer internships to keep me going without debt for at least 2-3 years. I'm just unsure about what I should be doing, and I'm looking for advice from people who have made similar decisions before. "

But I was disappointed as I feel it does not do justice to the hype. In my opinion the makers have made a low effort film by taking too much cinematic liberty. I want to know if the following is true..

1. Did Ajith Doval really decide to use a prototype drone built by an Intern for such a strategically significant operation ?
2. Do the natural caves on the LoC really exist that is used by the terrorists still not guarded by the Indian Army, if such a thing exist, isn't it a major embarassment and failure on our side ?
3. Idris the terrorist who is shown in the film as the handler of the Uri terror attack, who is the real life counterpart of this character ?
4. Are there any accounts that the Indian commandos crossed the LoC on foot and came back on foot after the surgical strike ?
5. And most importantly did Modi really consult his cabinet members, like it is shown in the film that Parrikar and Rajnath Singh were consulted before striking Pakistan ?

I feel atleast the filmakers could have shown some creativity in filming the surgical strike scenes. The most anticipated part of the film was a missed opportunity to take the film to next level.."

I would appreciate insight from people who have actually experienced the M.S. program in computer science.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Goals**

\----------

In undergrad I focused on security; However, I realized that my passion for it wasn't really there. I've always been interested in data and statistics which made me want to try something in ML/AI/Big Data. I've started some side projects, but I want to get a master's degree to really solidify my foundation (also because many ML related jobs prefer an M.S.).

\_\_\_\_\_

**UCD**

\-------

* **Recognition:** UC is a more renowned name globally than CSU
* **Institution:** Better for research (not sure if this matters to me)
* **Transportation:** Commute is a 10 minute drive and no trouble parking (could even bike)
* **Housing:** I have a very cheap potential living arrangement (currently living in Davis with my brother and my rent is next to nothing)
* **Other:** Stress from living with brother (I don't have to live with him, but then this negates some of the ""cheap living"" advantage of UCD).

\_\_\_\_\_

**SJSU**

\-------

* **Recognition:** SJSU is closer to Silicon Valley and well-known locally so perhaps it doesn't matter that CSU is less prestigious than UC
* **Institution:** Potentially more industry connections and/or better internship opportunities (proximity to Silicon Valley)
* **Transportation:** Commute would likely be a nightmare. 30-60 minutes? Add another 15-30 minutes to find parking from what I've read.
* **Housing:** Living arrangements would likely be very expensive or much less nice for the same price. This isn't my primary concern, but it is still a factor.
* **Other:** Girlfriend lives in Fremont (close to San Jose) so I would really love to live near her instead of doing the long-distance thing for another 2 years.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Questions**

\----------------

1. Thesis, Project, or Exam option? I know this will vary person to person, but what did you choose? Happy with the decision? Regrets?
2. What courses did you find most and least useful? Or put another way, which courses would you recommend I consider taking? Particularly for someone interested in ML/AI/Data.
3. What advice do you have for incoming M.S. students to get the most out of your time pursuing the degree at UCD? For example, people to talk to, services to use, clubs to join, etc."

Is U of T better than NoNameCommunityCollege? Maybe. But think about all the things commonly echoed on this sub that CS students sacrifice:

&amp;#x200B;

* Mental Health
* Tuition 
* Time (delayed graduation)
* Social Life
* GPA
* Potential early work experience/research opportunities

&amp;#x200B;

For all of the above you get the stunning opportunity to declare that you are a CS major, and that you can use a few extra CS courses to fulfill your degree requirements. If you think that these privileges are universally the most important factors contributing to all the desirable traits of a good job, you are just wrong. Almost all of the people I know that worked at Google/FB/Big Co. are well-rounded, well-informed, and know how to distribute their time to things that are low effort, high reward. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I'd even doubt that the brand recognition of ""U of T CS"" has a significant impact on employability at top tech companies. Looking at the intern spreadsheets for top-paying companies, U of T rarely makes the Top 25 of intern school distributions, despite the prestige. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make POSt, and that at your first failure you should transfer away. This sub just tends to talk about non-optimal, 1-track + narrow-world view ways to reach career success. The type of posts I see here truly are ""all eggs in one basket"" in nature and it's really unfortunate, because though this sub may represent a minority, it has very high visibility to impressionable, young high school students.

This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I’m have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics: 

https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note: 

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an  \[type of engineer\]  in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below. 

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]? 

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company. 

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy! 

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name

2. Position Name

3. Contact Name

4. Contact Email

5. Contact LinkedIn

6. Date of Last Contact

7. Job Source

8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey. "

b3uyta,2,2019-03-21,Seeking advice on applying to jobs I'm overqualified for. Should I leave anything off my resume?,steamwhistler,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/b3uyta/seeking_advice_on_applying_to_jobs_im/,"Lost my last full-time gig about 9 months ago and ever since I've been struggling to land on my feet. I'm working part-time at a place right now, but I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread and I just got rejected by a place where I was interviewing and I thought I was a strong candidate. Here's a little history:

Between 2006-2015 I was in university (on and off) and working in retail and customer service jobs. The main big stores I worked at no longer exist so I can't go back there. I finally finished a BA in English in 2015 and then immediately started a 1-year post-grad certificate in new media/journalism. Finished that and landed a great internship at a big news organization, and then went on to work there part-time as a web reporter and video producer for almost a year. I also worked PT at a small marketing company as a videographer. (Had a super chill boss and loved it there, but now they don't have enough work to take me back.) Then I got lured away by a full-time, big-money government job where I worked for 10 months doing video production and other creative/social media work, but I got fired from there because they ran out of video work for me to do and I wasn't good at the other shit.

So that brings us to now, basically. I was striking out on jobs for several months, but now I work part-time at a local TV station as a writer. I want to pick up another part-time job, and I'm feeling the itch to work in retail again just to have something stable and simple again where I'm not always afraid I'm not good enough. But of course, if a better opportunity comes along I'd take it, and I don't see how I can very well hide that from prospective employers. I have an issue with being compulsively honest too. At the same time, if I did land a second part-time job right now I probably wouldn't be too busy looking for something else -- I'd just hold on to what I have until my life settles down a bit. (Currently moving, have sick family, etc.)

Anyway, I'd appreciate any advice on how to approach this. Like, what to say in a covering letter? What to leave on and off my resume? How honest should I be?"

b3w52j,1,2019-03-21,How to comfort/be there for my boyfriend’s friend (22F) who got let go from TWO jobs today?,kebcyx,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b3w52j/how_to_comfortbe_there_for_my_boyfriends_friend/,"My boyfriend has asked if I’ll call his friend (22F) to check on her as she was let go both of her jobs today (he’s at work and can’t do it himself). One was a career starting internship in her field and the other was a food service job that paid the bills. This girl’s been working all hours of the day these past months to pay off her overdraft and build up enough money to move out of home (rough home life - her dad hit her a couple of weeks before she moved out, I don’t know how “regular” or not that is, but it sounds like it was the last straw). She finally moved out within these past two weeks but now she’s lost her jobs and I imagine is very sad and stressed again. 

I’ve met this girl twice but the second time we got along brilliantly, had lots of chats, she later text my boyfriend saying how much she liked me and we should hang out again soon, last night he hung out with her and she said she’d like us to come see her new place soon and she’s cook us some food... so she likes me and I think we get along well. When my boyfriend asked me if I’d speak to her (since he can’t for a few hours until he gets off work) I asked him to make sure she was okay with me having her phone number (multiple times!) but he’s insisting she’ll be fine with it and there’s no point in him texting to ask first because she doesn’t reply to text messages anyway. I’m pretty sure she WILL be fine with me having her number and calling her. 

My boyfriend said he’s not worried about her hurting herself or anything like that, he just doesn’t want her to be sad and said I’m good at making people happy. (Id argue that it’s totally fine to be sad at a time like this but there you go.)

I’m more looking for advice on what to say to this girl. I’ve never been in her position and I don’t want to patronise her with attempts at comfort that she doesn’t want. She must surely be incredibly stressed (I’d be worried about paying rent etc) so I just want advice on what might be appropriate to say. 

Any advice appreciated! "

Finally, I’m having a hard time deciding on UIUC or Brown for CS. Rankings aside, what do you guys think? I’m from Chicago to give some background info. Thanks!

Only issue is that I haven't been able to get an internship and I've been applying for 2 summers now. I've gotten my resume and cover letter reviewed multiple times but nothing. This year and last year I was applying for summer intern positions but so far no luck, only got one interview and it didn't work out. Last year I have up and just got a tech support job. This year is the same but I'm still applying to any position I find but I'm noticing I'm having trouble getting myself to apply lately (would be applying a job a day now I'm lucky if I apply once a week). Anyone has any advice on staying motivated because I really want an internship before I graduate just to make the job hunting after I graduate easier.

I’m a 2nd year engineering student currently working and finishing off my second internship experience (electrical).  I really count this internship as my first real experience with engineering as my first internship was more of a QA/validation role.  

At this internship I’ve been doing design, design reviews, validating concepts, and a lot of embedded programming, which was all new to me (platforms, tools, environment).  It has been a really great experience and I have really appreciated it and learned a lot.  I think I’ve been performing well enough (no official review from my manager yet), but there is one thing I’ve noticed about myself that isn’t a technical know-how issue but more of a personality thing.

I’ve done mistakes as all interns do, but I aways feel extremely guilty and start feeling bad about these.  I guess it might be imposter syndrome but every time I make one (soldering a new chip on a board and the board stops working, over-engineering a problem when I realized I wasn’t connected to the right pin after a week, feeling like it’s taking me too long to program a driver for a certain chip, etc.), I just can’t seem to shake it off and I just finish work feeling off.  

I’m looking for some advice on how to stop beating myself up for these.  What do you guys do and how do you guys handle mistakes?"

I plan to go back to school for a Master’s. I’m considering part-time online programs, including Stanford, Berkeley and USC. That being said, I plan to leave my job soon and at most schools, I would have to wait until next September (2020) before even formally matriculating, but I could start taking classes beforehand. Should I even bother waiting? Or should I find a program that I can start sooner?

Also, am I likely to find a job in SWE while doing the Master’s part time? Or do companies only hire once you graduate? In order to make this transition financially feasible, I would need some income after around a year of unemployment. Perhaps I could string together internships and freelancing.

I'm a student near DC who extremely recently applied for an internship with the embassy of Country A. They quickly responded and scheduled an interview with me. My position in the embassy would be working on education and culture. This is from the job description:

&gt;General Office work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Establishing and activating relationships between Country A and the USA and Canada in the fields of education and culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;Researching the possibilities of drafting bilateral agreements between US schools, institutions and governmental agencies and Country A.

I know that following FARA is an important thing, but the requirements on who must register isn't quite clear. I noted in one source that an exemption exists for embassy staff, but another source said the exemption isn't valid for people in PR or US citizens.

Obviously I don't want to overstep the bounds of the law, and I could ask DOJ or the embassy but my curiosity is like a kid who can't sleep on Christmas Eve but much more serious than said kid.

I'm currently interning at a large biotech company as a 4th year biotechnology major. The clinical trial study that I was intending to work on for my 6 month program unfortunately failed its phase II trials, and so I had the opportunity to explore different projects within my department and find places for improvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always enjoyed programming in Python &amp; Java (1 semester each  in college) and have completed the front-end certificate in FCC, so I decided to go ahead and take over a project dedicated to automating the data entry process for chemists. I've implemented a Flask-based web app for data upload &amp; visualization, and I'm also implementing a RESTful API for data retrieval and filtering.

I've really enjoyed my project and want to continue to work in the biotech industry, albeit it in a data science/SWE capacity. Does anyone have any advice about how to best leverage my work and education experience for future positions, or any resources through which I could prepare for higher education in CS? I have pretty bad imposter syndrome about programming without a significant education in CS, and want to make sure I'm setting myself for success.

This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I’m have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey."

b40c7z,8,2019-03-21,[WI] Landlord gave away my security deposit to another tenant and is refusing to pay it back,Source619,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b40c7z/wi_landlord_gave_away_my_security_deposit_to/,"I’m not really sure what to do since I’ve never had any issues in the past, please forgive me if something I say doesn’t make sense or is redundant.


I have rented out a 3 bedroom apartment with one of my friends, the unit is $1350 a month, of which I have paid $900 and my friend $450 due to landlord requiring the deposit be paid in full before we can move in and I was able to afford it at the time unlike him.


 We are considered as seperate tenants even though we live in one unit, which means each of us is responsible for the rent separately.


 After some time the landlord found the third roommate. He was constantly having issues with rent due to being a heroin addict, but it didn’t really affect me, and he did pay his part of other bills (ex. electricity) relatively on time.


Eventually he was looking for a cheaper place to stay even though he was still on the lease.


I haven’t really thought much about him moving, I was up to my neck with work as I going to college full time as well as working night shifts at my internship. I assumed that they would make him pay for his security deposit like they made us and I would just get my $900 back when it’s time to move. Wasn’t in the urgent need of cash anyway.


Well apparently he went and talked to the landlord behind my back and he happily used $450 of my money to cover his unpaid rent so that he could move out early.


Now my lease is ending and the landlord tells me that I should have charged him for the deposit. He never said anything like that before, and it was my first time renting an apartment so I really didn’t know any better. Now he tells me to talk to the roommate and try to get him to pay me, when I messaged him he instantly blocked my number and facebook. When I told that to the landlord he said that me and my friend should split the cost between us??? He also left several holes in the doors in his room, he used to get pretty violent when he didn’t get his fix. Now I’m also wondering if me and my friend are going to get charged for it on top of all that.


Thank you for reading, any advice on what to do will really help!"

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey."

I would be working in machine learning related areas.
The professor is pretty unresponsive however, so I started looking up the requirements for J1 visa. I know that I have to apply for an Expedited Appointment since it's less than 60 days before the internship is supposed to start. I have an appointment letter from the professor but that's about it for now. I read that I need the original SEVIS generated DS-2019 form signed by the sponsor. I wanted to know whether an electronic format of the same document would work or would I need an actual hard copy sent over from the States. Is the same true for the DS-7002 form?"

On top of working on my masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, I work \~33 hours a week as an in home behavioral tech for children on the spectrum. I can easily manage school and my job, and thats not the problem.  
The problem is practicum. My university only allows us to start practicum in the summer semester at 10 hrs/week, and then bump it up to 20 hrs/week for the following fall and spring semester, and then ultimatley graduate. If we do not have a practicum site confirmed by May 24th, we have to wait another year to re-apply for the pre-approved list of sites the university allows us to do our practicum at. (Additionally, my practicum advisor will not give me the contact information of any of the other approved sites to at least reach out to show my interest until I hear if I have been approved or denied from one site I recently interviewed at on April 1st, so I'm very anxious) As if thats not daunting enough, I've been dealing with some kind of hard decisions to make.  
I recently turned 26, and as such am off my parents healthcare. I was denied for Medicaid, but my job offers great healthcare, but only if you're working 30+ hours a week. I really want to take up my company's healthcare, but obviously would need to stay at more than 30 hours a week. I've heard from so many people that working anything over 25 hours a week with practicum and practicum supervisory meetings are hell, and I'm honestly feeling so overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I'm sure I would have no issue doing the 33 hours a week at my job and the 10 hours a week at my practicum site for summer, but once fall semester rolls around I'm not sure how I'd be able to do 53 hours a week not including travel time for both. I'm worried my own mental health will suffer because of it - something I have struggled with since I was young. I take medication and see someone for it, but that doesn't mean its all ok 100% of the time.  


I have considered taking time off to work full time (likely at a different job that pays a little bit more... would need to look into options and such to see if thats even feasible) to save up so in the future I can do my internship without needing to work so much, but then my loan repayments would kick in, and I have well over $100,000 worth of debt. So in that sense, I'm scared I'd end up taking time off in an attempt to save up, but then be bulldozed by student loan payments and end up not saving up much at all and just screwing myself over. 

I just feel very hopeless right now, and at this point, I'm regretting even going to graduate school. It seems like theres no way to win.   


I'm basically at my wits end and have no clue what to do. Does anyone have any success stories of being in similar situations to mine, or any ideas for what they think I should do? Seriously, anything would help.. I've been trying to consider all my options, but I'm falling flat. "
b4ajrg,12,2019-03-22,How does your resume look? Resume Anatomy 101 Lesson 1: Preface &amp; Structure,livewire042,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/b4ajrg/how_does_your_resume_look_resume_anatomy_101/,"# Hello Job Seekers! 

In an effort to help you become more efficient with your job search materials, I'm going to start posting on r/Resume more to better serve the audience as a whole rather than individual comments. I've included links to helpful articles and references from my own resume to help you understand better. 

Before I get into it further, here my 8 Tips and Understandings about resumes:

1. **THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING OR EDITING A RESUME IS TO CONSULT THE JOB DESCRIPTION, BAR NONE.**  
I cannot stress this enough because so many people are trying to create or fix a resume without even knowing what they want to do. Before you even start creating or fixing your resume, look for the jobs you are qualified for and could see yourself doing, then get to understand the **type of candidate** the company is looking for. Job descriptions are relatively similar for positions and it is very easy to take 3-4 job descriptions to find similarities you can keep on your document. **The best results are found by tailoring your resume to each specific job description.**
2. **Don't compare your experience to anyone else.**  
I see this constantly on Reddit and among the job seekers I help. People will always diminish their credibility, experience, and accomplishments. We as humans have the [tendency to look for what's wrong and not what's right](https://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2016/12/21/how-to-train-your-brain-to-go-positive-instead-of-negative/?nowelcome=&amp;utm_source=LINKEDIN_COMPANY&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=Recirc%20Test&amp;utm_content=1742490948&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesMainLI#6e204bcb5a58). Focus on how you can shape your experience **to the best of your ability** and don't tell yourself you have no experience or relevant skills. You have all the skills you need to get a position you deserve; you just need to **convey** that to employers. I promise that you have potential, even when you don't see it right away.
3. **A Resume is a brochure, not a biography.**  
The goal of your document is to get brought in for an interview. It is very common for job seekers to list every single detail of their professional life, yet, they find no success with their documents. Brevity is your best friend with resumes. You need to give selling points and not lengthy walls of text that will probably never be read by a human. You need to focus on the **impact** and *value* that you brought to your positions, not *what* you did in them. List outcomes, awards, and demonstrate why you are the best candidate for the position you're applying for. The interview is where you'll go a little deeper on your positions, including your responsibilities &amp; duties.
4. **Documents that are easier to read, get more attention.**  
The [average time spent looking at a resume is around 6 seconds](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/scanning-resumes/). If the person can depict the good parts of your document faster and easier, you are more likely to be picked as a quality candidate.
5. **Quality is better than quantity.**   
You are better off having the important things on your resume rather than *everything* on your resume. If you're applying for a job as a sales manager, the reader isn't going to care that you have a bartender's license or some other qualification that isn't relevant to the position you are applying for. Yes, it's good to show achievement on your document, but not at the expense of space and ease of reading.
6. **Colors, Fonts, and Shading isn't a necessity.**  
The truth is... some people take it way too far when it comes to these items. You don't need bright colors, multiple fonts, and cool designs to make your resume great. Black and white is perfectly fine. As a resume writer, I will only add two different colors other than black. Blue and grey. Blue helps highlight words without being too bright; grey shades well without too much differentiation from the normal. That's it.
7. **Students can break the rules.**  
As a student, you should always use your school work as the experience you have. Your work history should still be on your document, but it is generally far less important if you have a lot of relevant coursework. However, once students aren't students anymore, schoolwork becomes less of  a focus.^(\*There are exceptions\*)
8. **Resume's are one page**  
If you are a C-level executive or senior-level professional, then you get a pass. Anything longer than one page is most likely unread. Remember points 3-5... this is why they are one page!  


It seems that most of the resumes suffer from the same misconceptions, the goal of this post is to address one of the main things I see wrong with so many documents... the structure. Below is how you should construct your document and some information to guide you in creating these sections. 

# The Cherry on Top

It's no surprise that the name goes on top. However, I commonly see people undervaluing the size of their names on the document. The font should be between 20-30 in size. Your name should be something the reader remembers and if your name is too small, they will have a hard time deciphering it from the text that stands out. This is one of the only areas I use the grey shading on a document, so the name and the contact information is easily accessible visually.

**Branding Statements**

You can elect to use a branding statement under your name &amp; contact information. Using a branding statement will help you stand out, but it's important that you follow a few rules of thumb so you don't look silly with a branding statement.

* Use statements like ""Award-winning Marketing Professional"" or ""Top Sales Leader"" if it has been proven in your document and/or through actual awards. It goes without question that putting something like ""Award-Winning"" without proof makes you look dishonest.
* You can keep it simple by simply putting what jobs you've done and are applying to... such as ""Project Manager"" or IT Professional""
* Or... you can spice it up and add qualities about yourself that will be resonated in your document. Here are [mine](https://imgur.com/a/xWJLhDU) as an example. You'll notice the last one is subtly humorous, but I've demonstrated exactly what I mean in a different section of my resume. Even though it's aimed at making someone chuckle a bit, I still provide proof which will add personality and understanding to me as a candidate.

# Why I like Summaries and Hate Objectives

Every document should begin with a preview of the candidate. However, 10 years ago every resume had an [objective statement](https://www.themuse.com/advice/7-things-to-remove-from-your-resume-asap) that told the employer redundant information...

*To obtain a position with your company to do the job I'm applying for...* **BORING!**

This has continued into a lot of resumes I look at, but I can tell you it's largely outdated. So what should you do instead? **Use a summary of your qualifications.**

Why a summary instead of an objective?

* Summaries allow the reader to quickly understand your background and what you have to offer
* Summaries are easier to read than a paragraph
* Summaries get straight to the point with less words and more direction

Using a summary will allow you to give a preview of your experience. Given that the average reading length of a document is around 6 seconds, a preview will help you last longer than that.

# Professionals...Skills. Students... Education.

Under the summary is where professionals and students should be different. Students should continue with their education, while working professionals should put their skills under the summary of experience.  


**Student Education Section**

Newly graduated or current students looking for internships and

 entry level positions with no previous experience should focus on three areas of their school work: Degree being pursued/attained, GPA/Academic Achievements, and Projects &amp; Relative Coursework. Here are guidelines for the education section:

* List your awards under your degree. If  you have multiple awards (e.g. Dean's List) list the semesters or quantity of awards; whichever is more brief.
* List your accomplishments under your degree as well. If you performed greatly and have tangible success from doing so, list it! (Example below)
* List big projects and relevant coursework that will show some relevancy towards the jobs you're applying for. Give a brief description with some keywords that are relevant to the job description. If you have a copy of your project, it's not uncommon to put them on a google drive and use them as a portfolio to demonstrate your understanding.
* List the courses you have taken that are relevant to the position you are applying to. 

Now, student internship resumes tend to break the rules of traditional resumes, but it largely depends on the type of positions you are looking to apply for.

* Internships are *usually* not subjected [ATS](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/what-is-an-applicant-tracking-system/) software, so you have a lot more freedom when writing your document. Generally intern applications are read in full, this includes cover letters and resumes. However, it depends on the company. (I plan on doing an internship series as well, so stay tuned)
* Internships are largely focused on school involvement, your coursework, and the direction of your education, meaning, what you plan on doing after you graduate. Your work experience that isn't directly related to the internship is important, but takes a back seat to your school work. It's on your document to show that you've worked somewhere and if you have concurrent jobs with your schooling, it is a testament to show that you can work and learn at the same time.
* It is generally okay to not have a ""skills section"" for a student internship resume because most internships don't have many relevant keywords for an internship. Focus on making your document clear in both the direction you're looking to go with your future and the accomplishments that make you a great candidate.

Here is an [example](https://imgur.com/YjsP5Yv) of how an education section can look. Keep in mind, you don't have to compare my format to yours, focus on how the content is showcased and worded. That's the takeaway for this example.   


**Professional Skills Section**

Under your summary a working professional should have their skills section. I see a lot of questions on Reddit asking if skills are important to put on your document, what to put for skills, and how many should you have. Here are my guidelines for a skills section:

* Skills are important because:
   * They say more with less words
   * They separate your document from being a gigantic wall of text
   * They are easy to read
   * They allow you to put more keywords for [ATS scans](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/)
* Skills should be *relevant to the job description*. If they're looking for someone who has used Adobe Photoshop, this is the perfect opportunity for you to list it in your skills section.
* Skills should not be generic. It is far too common to have [empty cliches](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/10-words-ruin-resume) and [overused words](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/words-to-avoid-and-include-on-a-resume) on your resume. I've seen far too many ""detail-oriented"" professionals that make simple errors on their document. Set yourself up for success and don't shoot your own foot.
* You should aim for 10-15 skills that are approximately 1-2 words each. You don't need sentences or explanations, that's what your work experience section is for.

# The Meat &amp; Potatoes.... Your Experience

The experience section is by far the hardest part of creating a resume. Many people still use a [C.V.](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/what-is-a-cv) style for descriptions which tell a list of your responsibilities and duties. You must understand what a resume truly is... **a document to sell yourself** and not a list of what duties you had. So how do you do that? Use the C.A.R. method. If you want to learn more about the C.A.R. method, you can read [this](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-accomplishments-examples/) article which also provides examples of how to demonstrate your value and achievement in the construction of your sentences. Here are my guidelines for your experience section:

* Answer at least two of these questions when you are constructing your experience section:
   * *How did you contribute to the success of your role? department? company?*
   * *What were the actions you took to get this success?*
   * *What were the tangible outcomes from your success?*
* Use action language to demonstrate responsibility. [This](https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome) is my bible for using verbs on resumes, I have this on my screen every time I write because it allows me to differentiate between verbs and imply a lot of responsibility in the work experience section. Remember the Golden Rule: **duties tell; accomplishments sell!**
* **DO NOT USE VERBS MORE THAN ONE TIME ON YOUR DOCUMENT UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!** I'm sorry for yelling, but this is so common on resumes... ""responsible for"", ""Managed"", ""helped"", ""duties include"". These make me cringe harder than the entire [Scott's Tots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%27s_Tots) episode of The Office.
* Don't use verbs that devalue your involvement. Even if you had a small part in a large part of a project or function, you still played a part. Speak to the part you were tasked with and why it was integral to the success of the operation. Here are a list of my [bugaboos](http://66.media.tumblr.com/bf84eed2c5813f1ae273c88297adcc7f/tumblr_n0pnnaZjxI1qen41vo3_250.gif)^(for your reference :)) to name a few...
   * Assisted
   * Helped
   * Aided
   * Contributed
   * Supported
* You do not have to use a separate section for awards and using your awards will help you emphasize the result of your actions towards a certain position. In my opinion, awards being used in your descriptions is more impactful than having them listed because you can show how you brought value to the position. A list of them gives no context, and thus, makes them less valuable.
* You do not need +10 bullet points for your position... use 2-4 per position.
* Use 3-4 of your positions in descending chronological order. If you have a lot of positions, there are methods that you can use to highlight positions without showing a gap in your experience. (This will be covered in another lesson).
* Each bullet point should be no longer than **two** lines. You should focus on brevity... if they are longer than two lines, they're probably something that a reader will avoid reading.
* Re-read your sentences to ensure they make sense... please.

# Professionals End with Education; Students End with Volunteerism

Education is important, but when you have enough experience in your field, it is not nearly as important as your positions. Once you've had two positions or two years worth of experience, you should move education to the bottom because it's just a check of the box item at that point. Working professionals can remove projects, dean's list, student involvement, and relevant coursework. Stick to your type of degree, year you graduated, and GPA if it's above a 3.0 (personally I wouldn't put your GPA unless it's above 3.5, it's a largely debated topic).

Students should list any volunteer or extracurricular work that isn't relevant to your degree or the position that you're looking to get. It's completely okay if you don't have any, but some students don't know exactly where to put this type of information.

Working professionals, this is a largely debated topic as well, but I don't believe volunteerism helps your resume very much. The only exceptions are:

* If the company you are looking to work for has a history with working with the organization you volunteered for
* If you had a significant role with this organization that held responsibility beyond simply volunteering.

You should not list volunteer positions that are political or controversial in any way. It can automatically dismiss you from positions if the company has a specific stance on these topics or would prefer that their employees kept that kind of information in their personal life.

# Final Notes

Resumes aren't easy, but they can be fun. If there's one thing I want you to take away from this, it's that your experience is your own. Every single person has good parts about their experience, even when feel like you haven't done much. One of my favorite positions I like to reference was a position at Starbucks because it taught me how to deal with customers and I largely contribute my innate ability to provide amazing customer service. Look for the good in what you have done and convey these points with clarity and brevity. When writing think ""get to the point"" because that's exactly what the readers are thinking too.

There are exceptions to most things on resumes. These are guidelines, not necessarily rules. You should be focused on delivering the information as best as possible. It's more important for resumes to make sense and be easily read than anything else. The only law of resumes is to not use first-person language. You should never address the reader directly, that is the point of a cover letter.

Finally, I hope everyone took something from this. Feel free to continue the thread below and I will address your questions and concerns. I'm going to do my very best to make this subreddit more interactive but I feel that addressing everyone will help clear up a lot of misconceptions and repeated mistakes I see all of the time. This stuff isn't easy, but it's my mission to help *you* understand how to write a resume and, more importantly, for *you* to recognize your full potential as job seekers and humans. Thank you!"

I have 1 year worth of civil engineering internship work experience and it isn't something I want to do for the future. Solving problems/programming are a passion I want to pursue for a career after taking much thought into this. 

I have a few questions though,

Is contributing to open source software and a small portfolio of thorough projects enough for me to eventually find a job as an non CS engineering grad?

As it stands now I have about 20-30 hours per week to afford to spend on learning software and have been doing so for the past month.

I've just started reading through the elements of computing systems after completing the YDKJS series and plan to learn further about algorithms/data structures afterwards. I also have bought CtCI but I'm afraid that companies won't even get me to the interview stage when they see I'm from a non CS background.  

I know 1 year of self teaching, 20-30 hours per week is no where close enough to what CS grads go through in their curriculum but what can I do to further develop my skills to eventually land a job after graduation.

Would there happen to be anything like that for teaching coding?  

&amp;#x200B;

I had a few really great internships, last one being a top company.  This past December I graduated with my CS degree.  I've also never left the US before and really want to, as I have about 4 months free before starting my full time job at my last company. 

&amp;#x200B;

The perfect scenario would be something like one month long teaching gigs in different parts of the world, where I would pay for my airfare and then make enough to afford some type of housing / food. I want to be able to meet people and experience the culture through working there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on how can I use my cs degree / work experience for a long term (3 month-ish) abroad experience? Thank you!

So my IT team was fairly small. Only me and another guy for basic help desk support, an infrastructure guy and another guy helping underwriters and analysts. Anyway, we get a call during a very busy time and the other help desk guy, ""Steve"", didn't have time to deal with it so he sends me. 

I go downstairs to help ""Sarah"", who is part of the admin team, with something basic about Excel. 

Sarah: ""hey, so I'm trying to input telephone numbers into cells but every time I click another cell it would try and add that cell to the one I just finished with."" 

Me: ""Ahh, okay no problem, it's actually a common problem and a simple fix so don't feel bad. Just add an apostrophe before the ""+"" symbol and it'll cancel it out""

Sarah:  ""how old are you? Like 20?""

Me: ""....yeah"" 

Sarah: ""Well, I've been doing this for the last 10 years; I don't take advice from interns""

Me: ""...okay?"" 


So I left and went back upstairs to my desk. Steve asks me ""hey how'd it go with Sarah"" 

Me: ""she doesn't take advice from interns supposedly"" 

Steve: ""hahaha...oh wait you're serious"" 

We kind of shrugged it off and laughed about it amongst one another.

Go about my day and I end up crossing paths with Sarah.

Sarah: ""Hey! I wanted to apologize earlier, I was a little stressed and unfairly snapped at you""

Me: ""Thanks for your apology but I don't really care for it. I'm obviously in the IT department because I know a little about something. Anyway, if you ever have any other help desk questions don't call my desk."" 

Then I walked off. 

Came back from winter break the same year and found out she was fired 🤷🏽‍♂️"

Now im a 3rd year in college and i dont even remember my last two years, college is boring, gen ed sucks, and my friends at my current college are just a few hs friends that came with me along for the ride.

But generally I know im at that time when everyone tries to figure themselves out, so my old friends go out with their school friends and such, and we dont hang out while school is on. But i miss the days where everyday was a mix of school and being with friends. Now its really just me focusing on my career path of course, but i just feel so lonely.

At 20 ive realized how fast time goes by, and i cant be a kid forever. Im actually quite pleased with my multiple internships and more to come but as we grow older we just spend less time with people, and im trying to deal with it and i will, but its just hard for me

Ive been browsing askreddit, and how to use my alone time to learn investing, design, and more. I have quite a lot of free time.

Ive been in my state all my life, and traveled to my home country to visit fam but always wanted to go to another state, maybe go to disneyworld, with friends. But I have noone to go with.

I wish i had someone, a best friend, a brother, maybe i wish i had a girlfriend. I dont have anyone close im with. But boy it gets pretty rough being lonely when you have the most fun being with people. Its true when they say a part of one lives when theyre with other people, ive been feeling less like my self lately.

TLDR;
Any advice for an extroverted college guy who feels lonely?"

So I’ve been pretty stubborn my whole life. Grew up hella poor and considered myself smart so I worked my ass off and made it into Texas A&amp;M University. I’ve learned that it’s an accomplishment to make it into college. But a completely different type of beast to conquer, and finish. I had my tuition paid through a program called “Aggie Assurance”. In which the school vows to do there best to pool together scholarships to pay a students tuition if their family income is below 60k. I had no idea what I was doing I would sleep at the library for straight stretch’s of 3-4 days. Just studying engineering hyped up on caffeine pills.  I would cry in the stalls for hours and had a bad habit of pulling out my hair. I had always been a little suicidal since I was 15 but I was getting way worse. And I would freak out from the pressure and my lack of preparedness for tests from procrastinating, that sometimes I would skip important finals altogether. I had to take out loans because when I got up there I had no idea that Aggie assurance wouldn’t pay for everything. So I had to take out 5k in loans to finish out my freshman year. I couldn’t start my sophomore year due to lack of money so that summer I started a summer internship program where I had the potential make enough to finish my next year. It was called Southwestern Advantage we’d wake up at 5:44 am race to the cold shower and start knocking on doors at 7:00am all the way to 9-10:30 pm. I was a door to door salesman selling educational products. This program took all the way in Michigan but I live in Texas. It was incredibly difficult and I finished with 400$ due to me not managing my finances correctly and for the last 2 weeks I just let my depression and anxiety get the best of me and would just lay in the grass all day . So now I’m back in my home town in Texas which originally was like my worst nightmare. Which is one of the reasons I tried so hard in college. Ever since the summer where I was pushed so far and went through so much I’ve gone into a depression way worse than anything I’ve had before. I can’t get over how I just gave up when everything was on the line. I let the fear get to me. My family held me up to such a high standard and thought I was amazing that I made it into that school considering where we came from and I lagged in the grass and did jack shit. I immediately got back from the summer and started a waiter job. I would only work and sleep and was in a deep depression for 3 months. Which started to affect my family. I eventually got a 2nd job in order to force myself to get out of bed at 8am instead of my 5:30pm shift. And have been working 2 jobs for about 4 months. About 1/3 of money goes to help my family. I’ve currently got my loans paid off (which was 7,000$) by the end due to interest.  And am going to apply to the sister A&amp;M here in Texarkana for next year. It’s just  I feel like I’ve gotten real fucked up in the head. I’ve slept with 2 prostitutes, started self harm (I just burned my shoulder with hot metal once. I liked it because I’ve grown real apathetic and it’s nice to feel something), since my 2 year girlfriend broke up with me after the summer due to (me being different and having to deal with too much mental stuff) I’ve slept with 5 girls in the span of 7 months. And  I spent New Years with a noose around my neck. What scares me is how easy it would be to commit suicide now. It just feel like it’d be so easy I think I’ve had the belt around my neck hanging the doorknob about 5-6 times? Last time in years I was closest. I’ve had mental breakdowns at work, and am anxiety attack when I got high one time (I get high all the time. And  I had only taken one hit off the bong) I usually smoke way more than that. Worst anxiety attack I ever had. Was legit scared I was gonna die. Sorry I don’t have anyone to talk to this about I used to have a better help therapist but it cost too much. Anyways I feel fucked up in the head but I want to get better. It’s so hard for me to push myself to get on my college shit and just take care of stuff I know I should be doing to advance so I don’t stay in this super tiring two job routine forever. I know I just need ti get up and do it. But everything just feels so hard. Thank you. And I really am sorry about the way too long message"

Idk it just sucks to feel this way... and the colleges i am waiting on that i love so much are Gt, Vassar, UPenn, Cornell, Columbia. Oh and i didnt get a columbia interview so that seems hopeless.

It should be noted I was accepted to the James Scholar Honors College at UIUC. I am a resident of California. Here are the pros and cons I see for either:

**UIUC**

Pros:

* Prestige/ranking for CS program
* Opportunities for research (though I haven't heard much about this from friends there)
* CS and Math: two of my favorite subjects at once
* Aggressive recruitment (good for internships)

Cons:

* Weather/location (cold, far from home)
* Not CS in College of Engineering (not sure if there's much difference between doing CS through LAS vs CoE)
* Very expensive and no aid (55k/yr)

**UCSB**

Pros:

* College of Creative Studies (closer interactions with professors, smaller program in general)
* More research focused
* Great weather and close to home
* Relatively good price (\~$30k for me)

Cons:

* NoT vErY pReStIgIoUs NaMe in comparison to UIUC, ranked fairly low by most ranking charts (Niche, USNWR)
* Not sure if the prevalence of Greek Life/parties on campus is perfect for me (then again, I've heard things about decrease in parties)
* Recruitment is not as big (?, got this from questionable sources)

What do you guys think? I will most likely pursue a master's degree in the end, and I really want to have a solid baseline for AI right out of undergrad. That said, I am not 100% certain on a master's degree as this would depend on my family's financial situation in 4 years."

So I am trying to figure out my next move. 

To sum it up a bit, UMass CS has a amazing Machine Learning Program and I am more than happy to take some of that grad classes as an undergrad. Also 14k schalorship made my COA down to 40k compare to UIUC's 59k.(Admitted to Mathematics rather than CS is a concern too, I am not sure if they will let me transfer to CS) 

But UIUC on the other hand has more prestige in my country which is good for my future career if i don't get the H1B visa. Tho with that being said, getting a Google/Amazon/Facebook intern during my OPT time in the U.S. as an UMass grad would definitely compensate that. 

Any thoughts guys? I am struggling to decide. Especially when not knowing how the peers&amp;professors at UMass CS program will be like.

What can I do to make myself grow?",frustratedPotatoFace,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/b4ho6g/hitting_a_wall_with_my_job_hitting_a_wall_in_this/,"I apologize in advance for the oncoming rant. After my bachelor's, I switched over from biochemistry to bioinformatics. I made the switch for a lot of reasons, but partially because I wanted to tackle problems in biology with a new set of skills, like those in computer science, which are still relatively new and offer a lot of potential.  

So I went into bioinformatics with my Master's, and I am working an internship, and although I feel like I have gotten much better at programming and bioinformatics than before, I feel like a dunce more than ever. 

I have been assigned to work on a pretty complex pipeline processing data, and I am completely lost right now, since I did not write most of the code that I am currently working in. But my co workers and supervisor are too busy to help me, and I mostly feel like a dead weight. I try to read the papers pertinent to the scientific topics we cater to, but they are very physics and tech heavy, which are fields that I am not as familiar with. I want to improve at my job, but continuously feel like every step I make forward makes me take two steps backward. 

I feel burnt out and yet barely accomplish anything substantial during the day. I get that I am in the unenviable position of a ""biologist who just learned to code"" and am a 5th wheel in the company, but it took me a lot of effort to get to this job. I didn't feel comfortable doing a PhD yet so I decided to first work in the industry and acquire the skills/knowledge to make a decision afterwards. But my contract ends at the end of spring, and I feel less confident than ever in making a game plan for after this position. I was kind of hoping to stay with the company, but I have a pretty strong suspicion that they are not really that keen to keep me on. 

So I have started the arduous process of looking into new job positions, but given how intense the competition is where I am currently am, I am really finding it difficult to find positions that fit my profile. I only have a couple of months left, and although I have taken a few classes here and there online, I am not sure what else I could do to become a better bioinformatician, or even if I want to keep working as one. 

Like I said before, I'm sorry for ranting. But I am not a confident person and this job has made me really feel bad about what I want to do in science. Any advice would be super appreciated."

The thing is, the requirements seem so high and advanced. I feel like I'm a fast learner and a great listener, but I'm only competent in programming in Java and C. I'm willing to learn new languages and/or concepts, but some requirements are so oddly specific that I'd have to focus on getting one particular internship to even try to meet these requirements. I thought internships were learning experiences? I'm almost embarrassed to apply because I'm so far away from the application requirements.

 What do you guys suggest I do? Would it be wise to focus on school and forget internships? Should I pick one internship and strive to meet those requirements? How important are internships when applying for jobs after graduation?"

1) A paid internship at the company I am now.
2) An internship abroad (They would pay for house, car + well salary)

I applied for both because the hiring process for the two options was just started and neither option was 100% sure.

I'm in the last part of the process for both internships but If I get into the internship abroad, I would accept it.

The thing is... the hiring process of the first option is almost over and I would get an offer before I'm sure I got the internship abroad.

What should I do?

I am currently a junior getting my B.S. in Computer Science and concurrently work at a a large company as an intern until I graduate. I am thinking about jobs and what I should be looking for when I graduate and I found that I truly enjoy iOS development over a lot of the other technologies I have been exposed to over time. I have down web development, back end databases, and touched numerous technologies and languages. 

My question is, what can I do to become an expert in the field of iOS development? I thoroughly enjoyed the few labs I have been doing in my intro to iOS class in college and crave to do more. The department at work I am in currently does not have any iOS related needs from me and pushing that would be a bit illogical. I know the higher level answer to this is to make your own apps but I do not have very solid ideas and I would like to know the ins and outs of Xcode and well as swift. I want to really know data structures and just become a great Swift programmer. 

Please let me know of any resources, projects, or topics I should cover. 

I also want to know how I can prepare and position myself so that when it is time to apply for jobs and specifically iOS dev jobs how I can be specifically be prepared for that.

**Problem:** 

I need a reasonable CS job in 1 month.

**Info:** 

I am just about to finish 3rd year. I have this summer off because my school is not offering courses that will help me graduate. I don't have prior work experience, though I have a moderate number of projects (academic and personal). 

I have a resume, but next to zero skill w.r.t. technical questions (like leetCode quesions), a shit gpa (70%), and only a moderate base in programming skill. I am great at creative problem solving (have a patent that is part of a nascent and auspicious company - have little equity)

I am in a Co-op program, though I want to work this summer, so I'd like to find a internship asap. I'm 25, so the clock is ticking, I am thinking about not doing the Co-op program to skip a mandatory 16 months of work terms. I don't want to delay graduation, I don't want to get stuck at a shit job due to my GPA. (Is this flawed reasoning?)

I am looking for full-stack developer position, is it reasonable for me to actually find one this fast? (based in Vancouver BC)

**Solution:**???

Is a solution something like: 1) send out resumes 2) work on personal projects 3) work on interviewing skills 4) network??? 

Is there a magic to it? (I have never got a CS job before and have worried about this a great deal)

b4m8ym,2,2019-03-23,Unsure about Unpaid Internship at Unlaunched Startup (could lead to a job?),shjff0404,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b4m8ym/unsure_about_unpaid_internship_at_unlaunched/,"I got offered an unpaid internship at a startup by the founder whom I got to know through tutoring his kid. However, I'm  unsure whether this is a legitimate opportunity worth getting involved with, or not.

**Offer:**  
Unpaid internship. After the launch (in a couple months, trying to find investors), would lead to ""part time or full time.""

**Job Description:**  
Data collecting, product testing, maybe email marketing, maybe operations. Basically a generalist I guess. It sounds like there could be a LOT of flexibility depending on my interest, and probably need.

**Concerns:**

1. He's a self-described serial entrepreneur. But he comes from the finance world so he's started advising groups and whatnot, but no ... startups? Does that make sense? And he says he already has one that's paying for itself (can't tell if that means breaking even or profits), but I can't find anything about it online.  
So **unverified, or unverifiable, history of entrepreneurship**.
2. I know that generally ""unpaid internships"" are illegal. If anyone does work to benefit the company they need to get paid. If I take this on, the job description sounds like I should be getting paid.  
Plus, there isn't anyone to learn from which is what interning is about. If I'm figuring things out on my own that's an employee. So I take **problems with both ""unpaid"" and ""internship""**.
3. I don't know how long I'll have to wait until funding then converting to part/full time. Maybe it'll only be a couple months like he said but there's no guarantee. Also, what if I get hired but the offer is too low to accept? I'll have worked free for months with no job at the end. Does that mean I have to discuss my future possible salary *now,* before accepting the internship? **A solid job in the near future is not guaranteed**.
4. Originally I wanted to join a mid-size startup that's in growth stage. I have no special skills (a.k.a. not a software engineer) but that's all the more reasons so I can learn a lot and fast. I'm afraid that if I do this, **couple years later I won't have much to show for** in terms of both specialized skill/career and company recognition (90% of startups fail, after all).

Here are a few reasons why I'm considering it.

* One is that he says there are engineering teams for each company. They may be small but if there's a team I feel like it must be legit. I've also briefly met 2 non-engineers working for him, so that shows there are *real* people working on these (even if they're young &amp; inexperienced).
* He doesn't seem like he's fiscally struggling. He's been regularly paying me for tutoring. His finance side could be floating all of his startups BUT maybe his prior startup really is ""paying for itself"" and his other ventures are working out as well. Obviously he's doing something right even if it weren't his startups.
* I'm interested in startups which is why he gave me this offer in the first place when he found out. It could be a great experience if it goes well. I'm also a grad looking for jobs so just any work that could add to my resume is nice.

&amp;#x200B;

**Options**

I could take it and maybe get a good reference and a line on my resume out of it, while still applying to other things. But in that case, I'd be doing work for free.  
I could take it and wait to get converted to FT and become an early employee of a new startup. In that case I want a guaranteed FT with fair compensation, which I don't know what is. But I don't have enough information to make a comfortable decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to have a meeting with him next week to discuss more about what I'd be doing, and would like to have some answers by then. Am I worrying myself too much? Or is everything a total red flag? I've no idea.   
I appreciate any advice or insight."

I've been accepted into both of these colleges for electrical engineering, and am really torn between the two. I got a $15,000/year scholarship from UMN, so the costs are pretty much equal. The main pros of Minnesota for me would be the weather(I like the cold) and that it's not in California(I've lived here nearly my whole life and would like to spice it up a bit). However, UCLA is better rankings wise, and I got invited to the Fast Track program, which claims to give access to internships and research opportunities as early as freshman and sophomore year, which is really important to me. I haven't visited either campus, although I plan to. I also don't know much about the social life at either college, which is also important.

I transferred to a top 25 CS school from a community college last semester  -- prior to this I had a ~3.7ish GPA at the community college. 

Unfortunately, my new school doesn't count any of my transferred community college credits towards my GPA and last semester some pretty significant health issues resurfaced for me. I was unable to medically withdraw for financial reasons and had to power through the best I could. As a result I wound up with a 2.7, which I don't feel is indicative of my motivation or abilities. I have three semesters left at my new school at most, so I'm starting to feel like I might be screwed when it comes to jobs. 

I should hopefully be able to get it up to a 3.5 in that timeframe, but I'm also exceedingly nervous about finding internships this summer. My GPA here will probably be back up to a 2.9-3.2 by the end of this semester at most. Would it be wrong to include the community college classes in my cumulative GPA when job applications ask? Should I apply to internships anyways and just explain the situation with the transferring and the health issues?

b4ph0g,0,2019-03-23,American thinking of getting a masters degree in Germany!,Mellenoma,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/b4ph0g/american_thinking_of_getting_a_masters_degree_in/,"Hallo!

As my title says, I am an American that has been researching going to further schooling in Germany and I just had a few questions someone may be able to answer.

Some background: no I am not one of those Americans who is doing this to ""find myself"", nor am I going in blind. My family is German (grandparents immigrated). I have been exposed to the language and have visited several times. I've been at a crossroads of what I'd like to do and thought going to school in Germany sounded like a great experience.

I currently have a bachelors of science in finance and information systems and was looking at finance/banking specific programs. I've been looking mostly in Munich and Frankfurt, but am open to most cities (not a huge fan of Berlin...its cool and a neat melting pot, but I think I'd rather be in another city...probably since I was pickpocketed within 30 seconds of arriving at my hotel haha).

Some questions I had were:

Do schools typically have any sort of financial aid for international students? I know tuition is not nearly as high as in America, but it would still be rather hard for me to afford for an extended period.

I have a decent grasp on understanding the language and plan on taking more classes, but for those with experience, do non-german speakers have a hard time ""fitting in"" while attempting to learn?

How hard is it for international students to find internships or jobs?

And for those that want to be extra helpful, any advice on where to live and what to look for specifically?

Thank you so much in advance. I have been thinking about this for a while and so close to just doing it!

b4r568,27,2019-03-23,Advice from an incoming medical student! (10 Tips),djsbaseball2014,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b4r568/advice_from_an_incoming_medical_student_10_tips/,"So i know alot of you are nervous about school and pre-med and figuring out where to start so i thought i would kind of give a comprehensive guide to being a pre-medical student and what things you should be doing. This is more of a list of tips than anything so feel free to ask any other questions.

1.) GPA ABOVE ALL ELSE!!!! Medical schools will review your application holistically, however, a lot of schools screen applications before they even review them based off GPA and MCAT thresholds so its better to be above that then anything else. SO GPA first, its easier to add extracurriculars after you have gotten good grades than it is to fix your GPA after a bad year or few quarters.

2.) Find things you are passionate about, pre-medical clubs and organizations are very beneficial because you can meet like-minded individuals who share common interests but also pursue clubs that you have a genuine interest in. For me that is cooking and thats why i started Highlander Chefs. Like ill mention later, these interests and passions are what set you apart from the all the cookie cutter applicants. If you are passionate about it, admissions committees will be passionate about it. 

3.) Dont worry about anyone else but yourself!! Who cares if little Timmy got an internship with a cardiologist and you are only volunteering at a hospital. You both have two different paths towards medicine. Focus on your journey and trust everything will line up in the future.

4.) Dont rush into research. Find a professor whose research you are interested in and talk with them. They are more than willing to meet with you and discuss what you need to do to get into their lab. Remember tho GPA first!!!

5.) If you find your GPA tanking or you just cant get those A's in classes, review your study habits. Seek out students who have been doing well and see what they are doing. Nobody is gunna bite your head off if you ask to study with them. FYI groups of 4 or more students usually DO NOT WORK!!! Stick to smaller groups and make sure you all understand the material.

6.) Do stuff over summer!! Whether its volunteering, taking a class, shadowing, research. Keep busy!! Pad that resume! Do things you cant do during the year over summer. Research programs, SHPEP, shadow, work etc. Literally anything. 

7.) Make sure you are completing all your pre-requisite courses! YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A SCIENCE MAJOR TO BE PRE-MED. As long as you complete the pre-reqs. (1 year of bio w/lab, 1 year gen chem w/lab, 1 year ochem w/lab, 1 year physics w/lab, 1 quarter of biochem, 1 quarter psychology, 1 quarter sociology, 1 year of math including 1 quarter of stats.)

8.) Quality over Quantity. I dont care if you are in 600 clubs, if you only have 2 months of involvement in them, thats not impressive. Like i said in point #2, find clubs you genuinely have a passion for and get involved in a leadership role!! (snowboarding, cooking, swimming, video games, oragami club etc.) Those things show that you actually have hobbies outside of being a pre-med student. And make you unique :)

9.) Figure out the application timeline for medical school and plan accordingly. Application opens in June and if you want to get into medical school right after you graduate, YOU HAVE TO APPLY BY JUNE OF YOUR 3rd YEAR!! That means all your extracurriculars, MCAT and pre-reqs need to be done by then. Me personally, i will be taking a year off in between undergrad and medical school. Meaning i will apply June of my 4th year instead.

10.) Stay persistent but realistic. There are tons of things you can do if your GPA is not up to par, Special Masters Programs (SMP), Post-Baccalaureate programs, regular masters programs, PhD, etc can be options for you after you graduate. IT IS OK TO TAKE A GAP YEAR OR YEARS!! The average age of medical students is gradually increasing!! Its about 24 years old now! This is a process not a sprint. Apply when you are 100% confident that you have the best application and representation of yourself. You do not want to have to waste the money and time having to reapply again. If this situation arises, figure out what went wrong the first time you applied and then fix it for your next cycle.

As a rule of thumb, most MD schools have a GPA range thats usually above a 3.5+ in which you are considered competitive for those schools. DO schools are slightly lower at around a 3.3+. Do not quote me on these numbers as admissions is highly variable.

P.S.- If you are interested in UCR's medical school please go read their mission statement. THEY LOVE COMMUNITY SERVICE!!

Your goal should be to develop a story through your application and tailor it to the schools mission statement. This shows them why you are a perfect fit for their institution.

And finally, please remember your WHY MEDICINE?!?! You will be asked this question so many time over and over again and if you cant think of a good answer, those hard classes and times when your motivation is low will be difficult to overcome. Remember why you started this journey in the first place and just keep pushing through! It is difficult but well worth it!Thank you all and i hope this helped a little bit. Feel free to message me with your specific questions"

I have 73 transfer credits, 3.9 GPA, and currently 21 credits, 2.2 GPA at Tech. I messed up myself so no excuse for that (tbh I think I did pretty well in the first few months, but after that I just felt super empty, almost no friends, started skipping classes and spent all day in the dorm doing nothing..)  
 I have zero experience as well (work part-time as tutor, server, building monitor for a couple years in total but it doesn't count anyway, right?).   
I think I can do much better next year and improve my GPA. However, because of financial situation I really need to graduate on Spring 2020 and get a job, unless I go to grads school (which is almost impossible with my current GPA, even if I can improve it next year).   
If I try to get an intern this summer then it will be pretty hard to graduate ""on time"" (It will be around 16\~18 credits per semester for Fall 19 and Spring 20).  And also with my crappy GPA I won't be able to find a good intern (not about company or salary, but maybe unrelated field or not my interest area etc..). Also I am a permanent resident so it adds some difficulty getting an internship.  
If I take classes this summer then my life would be a little bit easier, I have a chance to improve my GPA a little bit in summer (and fall) and have some proof that I can actually do OK at Tech when going to fall (and spring) career fair. But then I would still have no experience at all, and I know it's important as well.  
So what should I do now?   
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"

* I'm a relatively sharp, reasonably good looking and outgoing person. In terms of people skills, I do think I'm at least above average. I'm mostly concerned with sharpening my practical skills in such a way that can be demonstrated to prospective employers.
* I did not attend any internships during my time in school. Long story short, I was imprudent and only went for the most competitive ones with the best pay. Despite a few near successes, I did not succeed in landing these prestigious and exclusive internships.
* I graduated university with a GPA of 3.1 within the Computer Science major.
* I live in the continental United States, but am willing to take employment anywhere the opportunity presents itself, with the caveat that it pays competitively with the industry standard for junior level positions, and it is also within the United States. \[*EDIT: That is not to say that I am unwilling to take a job that pays a bit less, but it would have to be in a state with a lower cost of living. I'm just not looking for a job in San Francisco that pays $40,000*\]

What helped all of you get off to a decent start? Are there any tricks that make the job search easier? I'm optimistic, because I really do believe that I'm a competent and capable engineer, but I have a couple colleagues who graduated ahead of me (whom I considered to be better developers, and had pristine GPAs) who still have not found employment.

I have a 4.0 GPA at my school, but I feel that they don't teach the stuff that matters. I have dabbled in some minor side projects and have been applying to jobs. I have an interview coming up in 3 weeks and am very nervous about it. I really want to take that first step into my career but I'm afraid of not knowing enough for the interview, or getting the job and becoming a liability. 

I guess my question would be, is there any way to validate my knowledge or overcome this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

b4tqvt,1,2019-03-24,Split between internship choices,RobijnDM,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/b4tqvt/split_between_internship_choices/,"Soo i'm pretty much split right now and having trouble figuring out what to do, so figured i'd get some opinions and insight from you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently halfway through a Computer Engineering Major (not in the US btw) and about 10 months in my first internship at a small software development shop, we mostly work on enterprise systems for other companies using JavaEE, while also having our own product in the health industry (which is one of the projects I mostly work on). Now, it's a fairly small company, with some pretty large projects and has been spread thin due to a recent wave of people leaving for other jobs. Nowadays most projects only have 1 to 2 developers on it, myself as an intern being basically alone (only have a senior giving support when needed, but not actually working on the project) in 2 of these projects. Most that have left are due to complaints of management really not caring about their devs and low wages.

&amp;#x200B;

Now recently I was invited for an internship/undergraduate research position after talking to a friend that's in a masters program on a institution in the same city I live in, and talking to a professor that is leading a R&amp;D project in this institution for a large national oil company. The project is mostly related to infoSec, as it involves running a very heavy computational model in a supercomputer, for which the company wants to secure  as much as possible as it handles very sensitive business data, so most of the work would be with code obfuscation/securing containers/vm to run it. The pay would be mostly the same (Would love my meal allowance, which is nice, but money really isn't the point right now, mostly interessed in developing the best skills for a good career path).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I really like InfoSec, and always wanted to get in the field, but I feel like there are no entry-level positions (Or mostly only as a SOC analyst or helpdesk, which are mostly Ops oriented, not really my thing, always enjoyed writing code) but at the same time i'm sick of writing basic CRUD web apps in freaking Java, working on mostly the same things while also dealing with shitty management. I feel like this could be a really good opportunity to study and get some research experience in case I want to do a masters, but am scared that all this low-level OS security / Assembly experience will be a waste, while I could be further increasing my Development skills or even studying other Development areas (DevOps or even Data Science).

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions for someone who just kinda loves everything related to CS and can't seem to be able to choose on what to focus ?

What should I do?,NotitiaAnalyticum,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b4v4y5/being_underpaid_compared_to_a_less_experienced/,"I have recently been told by a colleague (who joined the company this calendar year), that she is earning almost 15% more than me. Now, when I started I was not in much of a position to negotiate and was quite flatly told there was no budget to go higher on it. At this point I had a MSc but only a couple of internships to my name, my colleague had an MSc and one year of work experience in a similar company. So to an extent I understand why she would be earning more than me, although I do think the increase is somewhat shocking given she didn't negotiate her deal. After a year, I was given a 3% increase. I am trying to figure out what to do in this situation, as I feel I am not being fairly compensated for my work. I have been there two years now and am the longest serving member of the team (aside from my boss) by almost 2 years... I take a very active role in teaching new members of the team (which occurs a lot due to some very high turnover of staff, for varying reasons.. none to my knowledge due to any issues with the company or compensation). Yet I'm being paid significantly less than a colleague with a year less experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I approached my boss about this on Friday, who has said that I will be getting the usual increase (I am pretty sure it's just an inflation based increase) and that they have a separate pot of money for promotions but that they don't think they can tap into that as it would not be a promotion (I have been turned down for this recently). They said they are going to ask to find out if there is anything they can do about it as they know it's not much of a motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

Like many I was accepted into UCSD for Math-CS rather than CS, which was my first choice. I was initially attracted to here because of the location, campus, and potential for research, and after taking a look at the program and the courses I would take (as well as the precautions that people have told me about), it seems like something I would be interested in.

I wanted to know if there are any current Math-CS students who are involved in research and/or internships related to CS (or even not, just anything that you may have done). And some other general questions:

* What's the process of getting involved with research? I've read about REAL and Faculty Research but couldn't see more on when and how it happens.
* What sorts of opportunities are available to Math-CS students? Are you allowed take part in [research](https://cse.ucsd.edu/faculty-research) at the CSE department even if you aren't a CSE student?

I know how annoying incoming freshman sound, and I'm only asking because I couldn't find any definitive answers online or throughout the forum. Thank you for your help."

I’m a foreign student currently studying in the US and I’ll be graduating at the end of this year, so I’m exploring options for what’s next.

I’ve been offered OPT jobs at some of the places I’ve interned in, but I’m really hesitating to commit to these jobs. I asked several managers at my internships if they would be willing to sponsor a work visa after my OPT visa time runes out, but some said no, while others gave very non-committal answers.

I’ve also spoken to some immigrant employees and their family members at the companies  I’ve interned, and surprisingly many of them regret sticking it out this long in the US. They seem to lead uncertain lives (holding no assets like a house), which is something that I would prefer to avoid. I got the impression that they are only remaining here because they don’t want to waste the overhead cost they’ve already invested in the US for years. Some even bluntly suggested to try out Europe, Canada, Aus, etc.

I’m looking to hear some thoughts. Should I commit harder to my OTP offers and hope a work visa sponsor appears down the road ? Would a better alternative be to pursue masters in another country that doesn’t cost much, like Germany ? 

I’m open to anywhere and would also be willing to invest time to pick up a new language. 

Thanks for your time

 Something I should note is that the CC I go to is particularly awful in terms of it's CS classes. Very awful. I'd say I'm learning basically nothing, so I'm just following UCLA's online homeworks/projects for the equivalent classes to hopefully make up for it.

I’ve really disliked my EE courses so far (still sophomore level, currently in 201 and 270 but completed 207) and none of the engineering clubs/EPICS teams I’ve joined at Purdue have really clicked with me. I’ve talked to my parents and they said that it doesn’t matter how long it takes for me to get a degree so long as I get one, but switching another major is a huge decision. 
And yet, I still want to do it. CS has always been on the table since all of my friends are in either CS or engineering, and I’ve really enjoyed the basic engineering coding I’ve done for classes in the past (MATLAB, C and python), and that was because those classes were “easy” (CS159, ENGR132, PHYS172, ECE264 before I had to drop it due to schedule issues) and I really understood and could teach the material to my peers. I’m concerned about how going into CS would be, as how hard it is and if I could succeed in it. 
I only have a broad understanding of what CS majors do, and CGT was also a consideration, but I would really want to do something for UX design, and end up working for a media/gaming company in some fashion—on projects, systems, anything. I have a more successful background and interest in art and math courses, but I really value coding and debugging as a skill and would think a CS or CGT degree would be more appealing than CompE or EE.
I could use life advice, and any insights on your experiences in school and the field. Thank you so much, any bit helps!"

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished up my last quarter at UCSD and wanted to write a small reflection on my experience. I hope people can take something positive away from my story :) 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting into UCSD I was excited, but also a little scared. I had heard that it is really boring and people are depressed. I also wasn't sure about what I wanted to major in and felt like I could rush through school by taking many (4-5) classes each quarter. This wasn't the best decision. It seemed all my time went towards studying and worrying. However, I also really connected with some of my suite mates and laid down the foundation for great friendships. For fun I remember walking around campus a lot. I would find cool little, secret spots that were rarely visited and I'd go to the beach as well. Overall, I made it too hard on myself. I wish I took 3 classes and focused on friendships and enjoying myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned my lesson the next year, but the difference was that I had a ton of work to do! First year you can get away with chilling, second year is a bit different. Things picked up a lot for me. I made the effort to keep in touch with old friends and try to go out to eat or do something fun every once in awhile. This was also the year I found out what I wanted to major in, Math-CS ! I was really unsure if I could swing this major, because I was never good at Calc. However, I took linear algebra with Harel and proofs just came naturally to me! This gave me the confidence I needed to go for it :) 

&amp;#x200B;

My third year, like many students ,I lived off campus. I had learned to manage my time  second year and classes that were hard seemed a bit less hard because I had my shit together. This was the year of partying. I lived with some really cool people who were down to have a good time. We threw parties with like 40 people in our tiny apartment. It was much need. I noticed that with my increased social life my grades only got better. My mind knew that there was a time for work and a time for play. However, I started to feel the pressure of needing to get my first internship, which sadly didn't happen this year.

&amp;#x200B;

My fourth year was a lot more relaxed socially. We still went to parties and threw them, but it was slightly more chill. I finished all my upper div math classes this year, but still had some GEs to complete. This ended up working in my advantage as I got my first internship this year! I was really happy. I also had some other big, positive life events happening around this time so it was all smiles :)

&amp;#x200B;

Now in my fifth year, I've finished my GEs, studied for the dreaded coding interview, accepted a full time offer and am looking forward to life ahead. I'll definitely miss UCSD, but I can feel that it's time to go. My overall lesson was to take it easy when you can, focus on developing lasting friendships, and don't let other people define your experience for you. I'm really grateful for my experience. It was really hard at times, but that's how you know it's worth doing."

I just accepted a position at the Lawrence Livermore lab in their computational lab, and I was really excited about it, but I was just wondering what kind of opportunities are available in this field after the internship is wrapped up? Obviously if I do ok they could extend me an offer, but I was curious what the wider world offers. Are there a lot of jobs in HPC/scientific computing? How do they compare to other dev positions in terms of stress and work-life balance, salary, etc.? I worry that my experience as a developer is a bit stunted because of my mechanical background, I often find I’m either going back to review rudimentary things or just don’t even know how to proceed (although my PI and lab director don’t ever seem upset by my pace, or at least don’t tell me when I ask what I could use improvement in).

I’m also curious what other kinds of dev positions would be open to someone with my kind of background (not that I’m looking, I’m just at a point where, after this internship, I might have an easier time redefining my trajectory). By the end of my grad program, the mechanical part will have been in renewable energy (), so some fluids for windmills and wave/hydro, and a lot of solid state chemistry/quantum mechanics around semiconductors for solar power, then a handful of mathematical analysis classes in ME for controls and PDEs, that’s about half my grad program. About a quarter of my credits were in computation through applied math: scientific computing, data science, machine learning, and HPC/optimization. The last quarter of my credits are in my research project, which was technically in the CS department (but the software has an ME application).

My research project was in augmenting a template library for tensor calculus to implement GPUs and then optimization and characterization of the library’s performance.

Thank you, any insight is much appreciated!"

b50kbv,0,2019-03-24,CASP-003 - Failed :(,Thomas__Covenant,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/b50kbv/casp003_failed/,"Background:

* 8 years IA experience, current ISSO position
* 11 years overall IT experience, starting from intern Help Desk
* Degree in Computer Engineering Technology

&amp;#x200B;

After dodging it for so many years, it finally caught up with me and my current company required me to take the CASP/CISSP. I opted for the CASP, as it seemed more technical, so I purchased a voucher with CompTIA's official study guide (accessible only by the site [skillpipe.com](https://skillpipe.com)), read it cover to cover, and even purchased and studied Pass4Sure's testing engine. I still failed.

&amp;#x200B;

The real kick in the teeth is I don't even know why. The print out at the end that states what you answered incorrectly is vague, at best. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason I've avoided taking these types of exams is because I think they're trash. I think the answer they want is obtuse and/or not applicable to the real world. There's the right answer, and then what actually happens. Also, there's some answers I think are completely wrong. There's one question in particular I don't agree with on the Pass4Sure exam and go figure, I got that exact question on the exam. I have no idea what the actual answer is. I know what I think the answer is, but the test engine says otherwise, and there's no way to know what is or isn't the correct answer.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm kind of at a loss at the moment. There is no ""study more"" because I don't know what else to study. Re-read the book? Ok, then what? I don't even know what to study because I don't know what I did/didn't get right. "
b50pml,5,2019-03-24,IT Resume,N7Valiant,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/b50pml/it_resume/,"[https://imgur.com/0VAtM6f](https://imgur.com/0VAtM6f)

&amp;#x200B;

This is my current resume and what I've been using to apply in general.  My career goal is to get into Systems / Server Administration (working with servers in particular).  My work has been with a Managed Services Provider, whom it is commonly said that 1 year of experience working with one is equivalent to 3 years of working in-house IT, and I feel that is true.  Hence my resume is tailored to demonstrate as much of the higher level technical work that I've done, although I feel as though my resume isn't making it past ATS or HR due to lack of experience, or possibly bad formatting.

&amp;#x200B;

The template was recommended by an Engineer, and it appears to be a Help Desk template from Monster.com

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/JGw9ToI](https://imgur.com/JGw9ToI)

[https://imgur.com/sSXh9dK](https://imgur.com/sSXh9dK)

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I was using previously.  Might be easier to read by ATS, but there was a lot of empty space and the work description was too wordy.  Because my internship is significantly less technical, I opted to leave it out.

&amp;#x200B;

My general approach right now is pointing me towards having 2 resumes.  1 for YOLO applications to higher level positions, as a problem right now is that there are no junior roles where I live.  1 for the more realistic applications towards entry-level roles like Help Desk or Desktop Support which would include my work history interning and 7 years of retail (to emphasize customer service experience).

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm not sure is if I should include some home projects.  I purchased my own domain name (let's say, [johndoe.net](https://johndoe.net)), setup my email to use that custom domain (so [jdoe@johndoe.net](mailto:jdoe@johndoe.net)), added a Wordpress blog (so [www.johndoe.net](https://www.johndoe.net)), and added an SSL certificate to secure it (so [https://www.johndoe.net](https://www.johndoe.net)).  These are all things that are above what you would expect a Help Desk Technician who only has 1 year of experience in IT to do, but my subtle use of it in the resume (the email and website) seems to go entirely unnoticed by HR, which made me wonder if I should create a new section to emphasize it."

**Part 1)** I'm pretty fresh out of college and wanting to start down the crazy career path that is film making. I'm basically living the age-old story of ""moving from the midwest to be discovered in Los Angeles"". I know I'm a dime a dozen, but of course I like to believe my ideas are special. The good news is that I'm not starting this process completely cold - I've interned in Los Angeles a few summers ago and have friends and contacts currently there. However, that's about where the positives end because I have no idea where to go from there. Coming fresh out my internship everything seemed crystal clear but now that I'm no longer riding that ""high"" and instead have settled into adulthood, I've been too scared to make the jump. 

I've been working, saving money, waiting for my SO to finish college aaaand that's about it.  I've made a few changes to a script that's now on draft 4 and talked my way into one film shoot as a PA, which would totally be an okay amount of progress if it had been 1 month since graduation and not 8...From time to time I'll feel guilty about accomplishing nothing and then spend an hour researching apartments in California before fear of the unknown makes me give up and another month passes. This cycle needs to stop. 

I've been on my own before, but nothing like moving across the country. I don't know how to seek out and judge apartments that aren't school housing. I don't know how to estimate utilities into my meager Starbucks salary (it's at least work I can bank on having from day one of the move). I barely know how to budget. I don't know how to physically get me and my things to California. I'm terrible at networking. I don't know how to cold call (for housing, jobs, or anything). There are so many things that scare me about moving, but I'm sick of letting it get the best of me. 

Please help me figure out where to start. 

I'm sick of the same generic advice everyone gives me - Network by going to events and talking to people (no shit, thanks for that), be prepared for high prices (awesome, but how do I prepare and what can I expect to afford), find lots of roommates (okay but how and how to avoid weirdos), seemingly obvious stuff like that. 

**Part 2)** I may have found the ideal additional roommate (and a resulting deadline forcing me to act) but the more I think about things the more I worry about the logistics. My SO and I have been planning on moving together from the start, but the possibility of only two people affording rent for a decent place seemed slim to none. Last month, I found out one of my long-term friends (as in elementary school) just accepted a job in California. Everything seemed too perfect - she starts in June so I'll need to move with her, I know her incredibly well so we get along swimmingly, she doesn't mind my pets,  - until I learned the job is in Irvine. At first I figured commuting would be fine as I honestly don't mind driving or traffic. 

We've been slowly making progress for the move (as in researching places, I've still been too scared to reach out for lease info), but today she said we can't keep being wishy-washy and start making decisions. Long story short, 10 minutes of ""serious"" research and I have myself terrified of the commute. I was thinking an hour with traffic (not ideal in the slightest, but totally manageable)....it's looking more like easily over an hour each way (used my internship as an estimate since it was in Studio City) from the city more northern than Irvine. I can't commit to a drive like that, can I? I don't want to burn myself or eat through gas when my money is already so limited. I know I need to compromise as someone starting my career, but is this too far? 

Additionally, I don't know what would be better. Everything but the commute is perfect. I know her, we could afford rent, and it forces me to not just talk about moving anymore. If I let this pass by just because of the drive, where do I go from there? I'm back to having no clue where to start and zero leads.

As mentioned in the title, I just have a couple of questions about the application. First, how much weight is given to the written components (SOP, Goals, etc.)? Second, does coming from a unknown state school negatively impact your chances of admission? The program is ABET accredited but still a liberal arts college and unknown. I applied on February 28 (with confirmation on 3/1) and can't shake the feeling that I'm going to declined even after reading some posts about acceptance chances and how many folks they still have to make a decision for. 

Also, inline with those questions, could you perhaps give a look over my application information and let me know what you think and what I should change if I get declined?

Academic Goals: Continue learning; masters degree

Professional Goals: software developer

Academics: B.S. from unknown state school with majors (1) applied mathematics (3.7), (2) philosophy (3.85), and (3) computer science (3.636). Cumulative GPA is 3.7. I'll graduate this May.

Professional Experience: 1 year business systems analyst at medium sized hospital network, 4 years as general it intern at same place, 3 years tutoring math and cs, and some stuff I didn't mention in the application.  

Projects: nothing too fancy beyond school projects

Other: I've taken all the prereqs for the program during the CS major and received A's in them. My written components were generic and/or weak.

Sorry for the long post. Please, let me know what you think in regards to my potential for admission and what I should change if I get declined this term.

Thank you!"

I've got a solid internship as a quant analyst (and my only internship so far) in a large bank. Afterwards I've got one more year to study.

So, I have a couple of questions:

If I decided against doing a doctorate, would it still be worth going for internships to see if I can hit something more prestigious, or should I just shoot for a grad job? Getting interviews was pretty hard as I come from a non-target UK uni and hadn't got any relevant experience beforehand so I feel like I might do better.

Would I be disadvantaged by applying for internships in this situation? It seems like it might take some explanation for interviews.

The job is **very demanding (at least 60 hours per week typically)** with a **poor base salary of 40k, strange bonus structure** and **high turnover rates.** Are minimum wage state laws or any other compensation laws being broken at my job?

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Pay: Very low with a confusing structure and many delays.

The base pay is extremely low, but when anyone receives an offer with the company, the bonus structure is outlined by the CEO in a phone call as ranging from **+1-2 times (+40-80k) the base salary of 40k if they meet expectations or exceed expectations.** He convinces people that are ""high performers"" (high gpa students/ hard workers) to join due to a more enticing structure than typical high base, low bonus structure, and with the good company culture (if ignoring the disgustingly terrible work/life balance, poor compensation, and emotional outbursts by the CEO). **My highlights of the suspect payment scheme and possible illegality:**

1. **Low base pay and confusing incentive structure:** Salary is 40k base and overall payment is not straightforward  (EoY compensation typically amount to around 60-70k)
2. **Bonus structure amounts should amount to a majority of income but doesn't:** All employees, despite being extremely hard workers/high performers, never exceed expectations and most (80%) fail to meet expectations, resulting in a bonus of &lt;= 1x in all cases (""maximum"" bonus is 2x, all employees fall within 0-1x)
3. **Most of bonus payment is delayed and can be lost:** 75% of all bonuses are delayed, and split to be given at 6, 12, 24 month time points, leaving the company means losing these bonuses.
4. **Base pay will often be delayed if regular task isn't performed:** Compensation is delayed, sometimes for months, if timesheets are not submitted on time each month, despite being a small company
5. **Payment is irregular and unexpected:** Payment never arrives at a regular, preset time, and often times requires the employees to push to receive compensation
6. **There's an initial ""internship"" period:** Bonuses don't start until after a quarter with the company, meaning for 3 months as an intern, the only pay is base 40k
7. **Base pay stays the same regardless of years:** There is no annual raise in accordance with interest or performance
8. **Raises only occur with a promotion:** Infrequent promotions are the only way to increased base pay (by a lowly 5k for each promotion) and results in a substantial increase in responsibility/expectations (meaning typically receive less bonus)
9. **Discrete deductions from bonus potential when the CEO is upset with you:** $1000 is deducted from bonus potential when something unfavorable happens (decided on by CEO's discretion)
10. **Profit sharing but no employee knowledge of revenue:** Overall, bonuses are adjusted (can be decreased) as per CEO's discretion and the company's supposed ""profits"" (employees have no access to profit numbers)

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Most people there are highly competent, and would be able to find success just about anywhere. I just wanted to focus on the pay specifically, but there are other issues with the company such:

* High international employee rate
* Under-the-rug nepotism
* Long working hours
* Forced resignation due to underhanded tactics (CEO has never fired an employee)
* CEO's Machiavellian-esc way of managing
* Emphasis on growth/learning (IMO as a manipulation tactic to make employees take on more responsibility and be complacent)

What I think the process should be is: 

- Use a web interface to input data (the inputted sequence) 

- Display that inputted data on the frontend

- Process the inputted sequence on the backend(?) based on some predefined rules

- Spit out some kind of response which is then displayed back again on the frontend for the user to see.

- also looking to later add the ability to save processed sequences and reprint/display them again in the future (this would mean using some sort of database to store the information right?)

I have built some React components before on an internship and worked with python, js, react, and a bit of graphql. 

While I have some experience working with individual parts of a system, this is my first time trying to put something together from scratch.

Just wanted to know if there are certain frameworks/devtools/librarys/structures I might want to look into for this kind of project.

My thoughts are to use React on the front end and build using components to handle inputs and display processed sequences. I'd probably go with python to handle the processing logic so that would me passing the frontend input to the backend right? I've never really had to do fullstack stuff before so not completely sure how to string those two pieces together.

In terms of the actual functionality, I would be using this locally but would like it to be a web application for practicing web development. Using localhost would be fine in this case right? Or would I still need to find hosting if I want to used a db?

If this isn't the right place to ask, I'll gladly take this down. I looked through the faq and couldn't find anything that covers something like this."

For the past week and a half, I've been spending countless hours and losing sleep over my decision between two schools. I would be very grateful if the people of this sub could help me out a bit.

I recently graduated with my bachelor's this past December. While my background has me equipped to start out my career as a research assistant in the social sciences/think tank/government/etc, I am doing a career switch by choosing to obtain a master's degree in human-computer interaction. I was fortunate enough to get admitted into two programs: University of Washington's Human-Centered Design and Engineering and Indiana University's Human-Computer Interaction/Design. However, both schools have their pros and cons.

**Indiana University**:

The school offered me a $5,000 fellowship along with a TAship. Thanks to one of my parents' professional background, I will also receive in-state tuition at this school. With the financial support of my parents and the money I'd make from a summer internship, I'd at most be paying $10,000 out of pocket for my education and at minimum $2,000. In addition, I have connections with this university due to my previous research experience, the organizations I was a part of, and whatnot. So I'd most likely be able to land a research assistantship at IU and also partake in a project of my own since IU's HCI/d program doesn't really have faculty with research interests that align with mine. The pitfalls are that IU's program, while still a great program, is not as well-regarded as UW's. While I can take electives to customize my education, the core curriculum doesn't exactly match my career goals as well as UW does.  In addition, the IU degree doesn't have as much brand power.

**University of Washington**

This school is basically the inverse of IU. Given that UW's HCDE program is the #3 program in my field, the degree has a lot of brand power. The school is in the heart of one of the biggest tech hubs in the US. The courses within the program are extremely interesting to me. There are professors that have research interests that align more with mine. However, a huge issue is that the UW program is primarily made up of part-time students who are already working full-time jobs, a lot of them already at top companies like Microsoft and Google. Therefore, I do not know what the career prospects for someone like me (with little professional experience and basically straight out of undergrad) would be. The M.S. program does not provide any funding, so I am responsible for financing the $43,000-$50,000 degree. I thought that an RAship or TAship would be a great way to finance this degree, but apparently those positions are primarily reserved for PhD students (I'm still going to contact professors and apply anyway, though). Basically, I don't know if the degree for someone with little work experience is worth the financial investment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm realizing a little too late that what I thought I'd get out of an MS program is what a person gets out of from a PhD program (research assistantships, attending conferences, developing my own research, etc). But I don't know if I'm up for the 4-6 year investment a PhD entails, so I suppose it's the wiser option to go for an MS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I emailed the graduate adviser for UW last week to get more clarity about my concerns, but didn't get a response yet, so I'll give them a call tomorrow morning. In the mean time, I would love to hear advice from you all about my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."

b54cqe,4,2019-03-24,Got a first internship as a quant analyst now (junior-senior year). Not sure if I want to stay or try and move to tech. Is it worth looking at doing another internship post graduation to shoot for somewhere more prestigious and keep my options open?,becomedisciplined,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/b54cqe/got_a_first_internship_as_a_quant_analyst_now/,"crossposting from /r/quant as this sub is more active. 

Basically title. I've got a solid internship as a quant analyst (and my only internship so far) in a big (good but non BB european bank). Afterwards I've got one more year to study. Thinking about potentially going for a phd after this too, which would mean I'd have to go for internships.

So, I have a couple of questions:

If I decided against doing a doctorate, would it still be worth going for internships to see if I can hit something more prestigious, or should I just shoot for a grad job? Getting interviews was pretty hard as I come from a non-target UK uni and hadn't got any relevant experience beforehand so I feel like I might do better.

Would I be disadvantaged by applying for internships in this situation? It seems like it might take some explanation for interviews."

**This is it.**

You’ve spent a lot of time and effort, and dealt with loads of stress to get to this point. Once you receive that fat envelope of acceptance or confetti-filled computer screen, you’ll feel so accomplished. You’ll realize that you’ve done something amazing.

But you’re not quite done. There are a couple of other things to consider once you receive your acceptances. You might have to choose between schools. There might be people who want to weigh in on your decision. Just remember **this is your choice.**

This part of the process shouldn’t be stressful though. While it’s normal to feel worried about one of the biggest decisions you’ve ever made, I’ve found that life usually works out the way it’s supposed to. It might not seem that way at first, but I promise you’ll learn more from the challenges you overcome than the straightforward paths you follow.

So, take your acceptances, look at yourself, and take a deep breath.

&amp;#x200B;

**Making a Choice**

Now comes the fun part — deciding which school to commit to. This is something no one can decide for you. You have to go with what feels right for you.

If you’re having a hard time, here are a few tricks you can use to help you decide:

1. **Visit.**  If you can, visit the campuses and talk to kids. Maybe sit in on a philosophy class. Or meet a biology professor. Definitely, do the **Bench Test.** Sit in the space. Put your phone away and simply sit on a bench in the middle of campus, like on the quad or at the student center, and absorb the vibe for about half an hour. Eavesdrop. Maybe get a book out on your lap, so you don’t look weird. Can you see yourself walking around and going to class there? Do you like the conversations you’re hearing and do you want to be a part of them?
2. **Pros and Cons.** Make an oversized list of pros and cons on paper for each school. Like make it poster sized. Put the name of the school at the top and then list all the pros and cons that you can think of for each school. Consider aspects like finances, culture, vibe, departments, honors, social, academics, geography, weather, surrounding area, and distance from home. Put it on your wall and leave it there for a few days so you can look it over and add and subtract from it as you absorb the thoughts. Hang out with these lists for a few days and add to them as you think of something. When one has more cons than pros take it down. My opinion: I don’t think anyone should be taking on debt if you have the option of attending college without it. Also, if you are considering debt, a“rule” of thumb I’ve heard is not to take on more total debt for all four years than your potential first year salary. 
3. **Do the 10/10/10 test**. Ask yourself: “How will I feel about my decision in 10 hours? 10 weeks? 10 years?”
4. **Tell a Few.** Make a choice. Tell your parents and maybe a few friends, and sleep on it. What’s your gut feeling? Does it feel right? If so, go for it. If not, rethink.
5. **Coin Toss.** Try the coin toss trick. Assign a side of the coin to a school and toss it. That’s your school. Tell your parents and a couple of friends. Then sleep on it. How do you feel?

&amp;#x200B;

**Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about your choice.**

Sometimes, others will try to make you feel bad about your choice. All you need to worry about is that you’re going to a school that best serves you. Wear that college t-shirt proudly! Slap those stickers on your laptop. Be proud of your achievements, because believe me, going to college is a huge achievement. Be excited for the future and this new path you’ve found for yourself.

Most of all, don’t accept the words of anyone who tries to denigrate your college choice. It’s rude and, frankly, none of their business. As in most things, my advice is **“You do you.”**

Here’s a story I love from Neil Pasricha’s *The Happiness Equation* adapted by my son, Joseph. It’s all about Buddha’s philosophy concerning the value we give to other people’s words.

Buddha spent a lot of his time wandering around and teaching folks about how to live a good life. One day he was going about his business, sitting under the Bodhi tree, spreading his ideas when another Brahman, let's call him Fred, got all up in Buddha's face and said, ""Hey, man, who said your ideas are right? You’re not as smart as you think you are.""

Buddha sat silently and smiled at Fred, only making Fred's cheeks grow red with rage. Fred spoke up again, ""Hey! I'm talking to you! Stop smiling at me, freak.""

Buddha kept smiling and then replied, ""Do you ever have guests at your house?""

""Yeah, of course,"" Fred answered.

Buddha then asked, “And when you have guests, do you give them snacks, maybe some chips and dip?”

Fred replied, “Of course! I'm not about being a bad host.”

Then Buddha chuckled wisely, “Well, if your guest says they don't want some chips, like they're not hungry or something, then to whom do those chips belong?”

“Uhhhh, weird question,” Fred retorted. “But I guess me.”

""Well,” Buddha said, still smiling, ""just as your guest didn't accept those chips, I'm not accepting your hateful words, and so those words are yours and not mine.""

”Whoa,"" Fred said, “Mind. Blown.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Dealing with Parents**

In the past, I’ve had kids ask me about what to do when they and their parents really disagree about the decision.  My advice: communicate.  Do your research, make a presentation that covers all the concerns your parents may have — future career options, cost and financial aid, internships, professors, class size, distance from home. Think about what they are worried about and then try to address those worries with your research. Ask them to give you some time and then present your research to them. Listen to them respectfully and ask them to do the same. Repeat their concerns back to them, so they know you are listening and understand.

&amp;#x200B;

**You deserve it — Dealing with Imposter Syndrome**

Sometimes kids will come onto our subreddit who’ve had great success with their applications. They’ve been accepted to the schools they’d always imagined they attend and that they’ve worked so hard to be accepted to. Yet, to them, it still doesn’t feel right. They wonder why they were accepted over others. This is called Imposter Syndrome, and it can really fuck with your brain if you let it. Remember though: it’s just a feeling. Here’s the deal: You are good enough. You are worthy of getting into a ton of schools. I can tell that by reading what you just wrote in a few words. Colleges, especially highly selective colleges, spend a lot of time and resources evaluating applications. They don’t screw up. If they feel like you can handle the work — you can. Look, there will always be people who have stronger this and better that. That’s never going away. Those colleges took you because you are you. That’s what they wanted. Congrats on your amazing acceptances! You are gonna kill it in college.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if it isn’t working out so far?**

I know some of you aren’t worried about making a choice yet because you’re still worried about where/if you’ll get in. If you are looking at no good choices because acceptances or finances didn’t go your way, you do have options. You can apply to some of the many amazing colleges that are still accepting apps (see my post [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b6x123/colleges_are_looking_for_you_these_colleges_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app), you can take a gap year, or you can attend community college for a year.  And if you find yourself juggling a waitlist or two, here’s [the link to that post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b3jmum/waitlisted_i_get_it_its_a_bummer_but_theres_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  Finally, if you find yourself feeling so overwhelmed and depressed that you are considering harming yourself, please look at this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b0dihr/for_those_of_you_feeling_hopeless_and_overwhelmed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) .

# tl;dr

* Acceptance is a stellar accomplishment. Be proud of yourself!
* If you’re struggling to decide between a few schools, visit them all if you can. Make a pros and cons list. Tell a very select few people which school you’ve chosen, and then sleep on it to see how you feel.
* Don’t accept the words of those busybodies who think they have the right to be rude about your college choice. Be like the Buddha, and let those words roll off you.
* Imposter syndrome is when you feel like you don’t deserve the successes you’ve earned. It is a feeling and it can be hard to shake. Don’t let it mess with you. You are worthy.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago I was laid off form a nonprofit management job. I'd been doing that sort of work for just over a decade. I couldn't find other work, so I decided to make a career change into web development and programming. For that, I enrolled in a community college Associate of Science program, the programming and web development course. There, I've taken classes in:

* C++ (introductory level)
* Java (introductory level, though I've been supplementing that with the New Boston YouTube videos)
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript
* Visual Basic and .NET
* [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET)
* C#
* Database design/SQL (using Oracle APEX and MySQL)
* System analysis/design
* A class on hardware/networking

And now I'm doing an internship for a small tech company, but what I'm doing doesn't seem to be related to programming at all; I'm hoping I'll start doing some of that. The people are very nice, but I don't really think there's a job opportunity at the company after the internship.

I've started looking at job postings online (I'm in a major northeastern city with many, many universities and such), and I'm really worried and discouraged. I've literally come across nothing that I'm qualified for. I mean, I have learned a lot during my past year or so of schooling, but it doesn't seem to align with what employers are looking for (lots of full stack, year of experience with Apache, Ruby on Rails, etc.), but nothing that seems to be sort of entry level-ish where any of the above comes into play.

I know the advice is take time, do side projects, and that's good advice for someone who is younger, in college, maybe living with family, but it isn't realistic for someone like me, whose unemployment ran out months ago and who has had to deal with regular responsibilities, these classes, and try to somehow pull in some money. Now my savings are gone, but I'm not sure there's a new employment prospect on the horizon.

Is there something I'm missing? Did I just waste the past year and a half? I'm a bit panicked, so any advice would be helpful and appreciated."

1. **PF Debate (6 Years)**  \- On and off for 6 years since I attend a travel team and can't always  find a partner. When I got into high school I immediately joined the  Debate club and started going to tournaments. Nowadays I'm trying to  scrape enough money for the club to go to tournaments like Berkeley and  Stanford.
2. **LaunchX Entrepreneurship Company (2 Years)**  \- We've applied to be an LLC this year for one of my company's where I  am named a founder. The other company is still working on an app  program, and another one that I head personally is working on a retro  RPG that we'll release on Steam by next fall. Currently 3000+ downloads  on our first app.
3. **Writer for an online youth business magazine** (redacted) that gets 18k+ views monthly **(2 years)**. It's actively releasing articles on a seasonal basis, and I write about all geopolitical economic affairs.
4. **Science Fair Projects (5 years)**  \- So this is actually kinda a main focus that I've really been trying  to go far in. I've been doing econ/psychology projects in Behavioral and  Social Sciences for the past 3 years and its tied into the research in  my internship. I'm trying to make intel this year.
5. **Piano (11 years)** Lol classic Asian Male MCAT California Lv10
6. **Economics Competitions** in Toshiba ExploraVision **(2 years)** (I know it's not necessarily econ), National EconChallenge, Conrad Spirit of Innovation, LaunchX
7. **Published Author**  for a story book a couple friends and I did in our volunteering in  rural China about microfinancing in poverty.  This is a pretty recent  development, I am listed as a primary contributor/secondary author.  I also write random short stories and hailmary them to writing competitions.

***Awards*** thus far

1. PVSA Goldx1
2. 2nd Place State Science Fair Award in Behavioral and Social Sciences
3. 1st Place (My city) Psychological Association Science Fair Committee Award for an Econ Project

8. Assorted Medals at Local Debate tournaments and city science fair
9. County Supervisor Award for Asian Americans in Economics

**Summer Programs**

1. Last Summer (Volunteer Work, NSLC, Lots of economics research)
2. This Summer (Selective Entrepreneurship Program GATSVI w/ Merit Scholarship)
3. Next  Summer Applying to (YYGS, LaunchX, TASP, NSLI-Y, Georgetown Business  &amp; Leadership, Wharton Business Leaders)

**SATS**

* First Sitting (1540) (Not retaking)
* World History Test (780)
* Math 2 (800)
* PSAT 1510 (Onwards to NMSQT Later)
* Taking Bio Subject Test in late 2nd Semester

**Intended Major:** Econ/Business, My School is Public and Mediocre

**College Location:** On Either Coasts, urban/rural is fine

**Financial Aid:** None, I'm 300k+ and don't qualify for need-based

**School Size:** Any school above 1000 students is fine

**Social Atmosphere:** No hard party schools.  Everywhere else is fine.

**Climate:**  Send me somewhere that snows

**Demographics:** Asian Male Cali

My  School has always been one of those overly white mediocre public  schools that do manage to send people to ivies every year.

Got all my testing out of the way so I'm going to focus more time on trying to make ISEF/do more research/focus on company.

I'm thinking my major is one of the majors out there which actually is dependent on university prestige, so maybe I should aim more for  highly competitive unis.

Thank you for reverse-chancing me in advance!"

Last semester I took my first Actuarial class, and my god was it hard, got in the bottom 1/3 of the class. I also got more involved in learning where the field is going and its going to be revolved around more aspects I don't like than I knew. It's a lot of excel work, coding/programming, and more human interaction than I thought. These got me thinking if I really want to be an actuary. Do I want to spend all my 20's trying to study for exams for a career I may not enjoy? I was hoping to get an internship in the field for this summer to try it out, but I'm a sophomore with no exams passed so I didn't work out. I'm currently studying for my first exam after failing it once and have been struggling to find the motivation, and I've definitely forgotten so much and need to relearn a lot of the material. This lack of motivation particularly disturbs me because if I can muster it now, what will it be like when I have a full time job?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm trying to force it to work, but if I change majors (to a similar line of work, but not actuarial) I'll feel like I'm quitting just because it got hard. I'm also worried about the pay cut I'll probably take by changing fields, and how hard it'll be trying to snag an internship next fall without having one this year and having just entered a new field. I'm really lost, what do I do? "

I just started my first job. Internship but basically being rushed into senior role. I like that. But can this potentially hurt me? Green as Green, I'm a C# programmer.

The job is VB.Net mostly and some older vb. I can use vb I guess. 

However, every day more SQL can be spotted. I'm going to be taking over a soon to be retired programmers shoes and apps.

He's only one who codes in VB there. Some of these SQL statements are 50+ lines of subquerries and ten joins. That's fine but the aliases/col names are crazy.. F0006 for a customer ID number? Then f0110 for a table name??

My question now that there is some context.. Is this typical? Is SQL of this caliber usually this common in a c#/web service developers world?

If I drop the ball and my internship only last the three months.. Can that hurt me? Will I likely find a job I'm the future far easier now?

Mainly because my boss is very toxic and cruel. Every morning I wake up 1 hour earlier than I have to, with my heart racing because I feel like i’m going to get shit on again today. 

I’ve had other jobs, with much better bosses, so it’s hard for me to just take her shit every day. I’ve got ADHD and constantly feel belittled by her about it. Like sometimes I don’t make eye contact because that’s how I think but she screams that it’s fuckin stupid of me. One time I was trying to use the copier and she was genuinely pissed that I had no idea how to use it yet... “Sorry i’ve never had to” was what I said. She was furious like it was my fault. She constantly gets upset that I don’t know to do things that she’s never told me to do. Instead of just telling me what to do, she yells that I don’t already do it.

On top of all of this, i’m at a company I now hate, in the tax department. Everyone here seems depressed and it makes me depressed. I usually have so much energy and this just feels like it’s extinguishing the fire within me! 

Some people suggest I should go see HR about changing departments, but i’m not sure how to go about that. I’m also only an intern and started 2 months ago. I just really think the anxiety is already not worth it at this point.

They then told me that everyone they interview who is A+ certified does the same thing, since the certification is way too broad and doesn't teach you anything specific.  Luckily they liked some things about me and agreed to give me an unpaid internship as a solutions consultant.  I've been doing that about a month now and the A+ really isn't helping me.

So this is partly a success and partly a struggle story. I’m a 20 year old student and even with my attention/organization problems I’ve done well enough in school and internships to land a very prestigious internship in an “elite” office environment. 

As an intern I have to juggle a lot of tasks at once and have a very consistent workflow, something I’ve historically had problems with. I’ve had a lot of little screw ups and my anxiety has gotten the better of me at times when I’ve felt overwhelmed, but I feel I’m finally getting the hang of it.

My office is nice but I also know they’ve noticed the times I’ve messed up. I have about two months left to really leave a good impression before leaving to secure a recommendation/good reference, but I know I’ve already developed a reputation for being hard working but scatterbrained.

I want to continue this internship with some added responsibilities in the summer, and I know that I will only continue to get better and grow in the role. As of now I’m set to end in May. I mentioned it to a couple superiors and they seemed open but non committed the idea.

I’ve never let my ADHD limit me and Ive never told any employer I have it. However, I’d want to tell my superior about how it just takes me a long time to master some organizational things—longer than others, and if given the chance I can really grow in the role. I’d really like to stick to this internship rather than moving to something new (again) because I just want the chance to really become proficient in a set of skills rather than always jumping to the next step, as we often are guided to when we’re young. Is there a good way to talk about this with my superior? "
b5dob4,5,2019-03-25,How do I convince myself I wont regret continuing or dropping out of college?,Midnite024,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b5dob4/how_do_i_convince_myself_i_wont_regret_continuing/,"I apologize if this isn't the right place for this (tl;dr at the bottom).

So, I’m 26 and I’ve been in college for 6 years (3 years CC for basic LA degree, 2 more CC years taking math/sciences after I changed to my major) and I’m in my second semester at a university in a very specific science major. Its been a field I’ve always wanted to pursue since I was 5, but to get a job in the field, you must either have a lot of internships, or a master’s degree.

Since the fall, all the stuff we’re learning is extremely interesting and I love combining the calculus and physics to get the answers to stuff I’ve been reading about for nearly 2 decades. But while I like learning it, I can’t study it correctly. I constantly have the lowest grades in my class of 24 (there’s only 42 total undergrads in the dept) and they all ask questions about detailed stuff, while I don’t know what/how to ask the questions I have. Im still passing, but everyone else does research, interships, honors college, etc while Im struggling with just classes getting C's and B's.

Also, I transferred as a Junior, so I only had 1 summer/year to apply for internships, and I didn’t get any. I don’t know any of the professors well enough to ask for letters, and my GPA is probably the lowest of all the applicants they got. I also definitely don’t have the grades or brains (or time) to go to grad school.

**So, my question: How do/did you convince yourself dropping out/staying is the right choice when its obvious it wont work out.** I commute to school, still live with my parents, and been paying for school out of pocket after working overnight grocery for 7 years until last August (quit to focus on school). I've gained 20lbs since then, lost health insurance, and just less happiness from no income (wasn't happy beforehand either). My brothers say to drop out and work in the kitchen they work ($32k/year dishwasher), my parents say to stay in school because “I've got to believe in myself” (although I’m pretty sure they’re saying this to keep me at home).

I know I probably won’t be getting a job in this field, but I still love learning it and hearing about the jobs in the field gives me that slight hope/optimism; being in school is keeping me from getting an income, but there’s that tiny chance it could slightly improve my income. All I want right now is to move out on my own, and focus on my own health/life, instead of the school/work/sleep for the last 8 years. I don’t even know/talk to anyone outside my 2 siblings and parents the last 8 years. I have no problem getting 2-3 jobs at a warehouse + cashier + pizza delivery or something basic, but I’ve regretted most everything in my life, and I’m trying to think if this would just be the final straw in that regard. If I complete my final year (If I pass those classes), Ill lose a full year of income and a year to socialize/make friends. I’m already a decade behind everyone my age in life, I'm not getting any happier and I can’t afford to lose any more time in life.

tl;dr : Im finishing Junior year and I know I will probably never land a job in the field but still love attending class and learning the material, how do I convince myself I wont regret either dropping out with a year left, or possibly wasting a year of my life?"

I chose a tech-company. They sold stuff and fixed computers. It was a very small company with my boss (owner of the company), a co-worker who was the boss when the owner was out and an apprentice. Then there was me, who did some computer-stuff in his free time, but i wasn't a professional. The company was also in a smaller town and very cheap to go to. We had fixed prices for everything instead of getting paid by the hour. It was like 5€ to identify the problem, then we would call the customer, tell him what's up, ask if we should fix the problem and tell him how much it would be. Usually, 10€ for simpler stuff and 25€ for more complex and time-consuming stuff.

Okay, so, one day, i think it was my last week, this man walks into the shop. My boss and co-workers were all pretty busy, so they asked me to help this guy. He was an older gentlemen. I walked up to him and asked if i can help him. He tells me he bought a computer at our place a month ago or so and he had problems with it now. He explained me that it was some issues with the graphics, but only in the browser, i think he also said it was only one specific browser, i don't remember any more.

Anyway, this is a very vague description of the problem, so i told him we could look into it. I also remembered that we had a small discussion a few days prior in the company about how there's no warranty on the software on the computers we sell. So, of course, i told him that looking into the problems would be 5€. Before i could even go on and explain the whole situation, he said ""I'm not going to pay, i bought this computer at your place just a few weeks ago"".I tried to explain to him that I understood that but that i can't identify if the problem is software-related or hardware-related and that, if it is hardware related, he doesn't have to pay.

He wouldn't understand and would get more and more angry and raise his voice. I'm not good with people, but i know how to stay professional, so i stayed calm and tried to explain the whole situation again. I even told him that i could ask my boss very quick if he gets the diagnosis for free, as i didn't know how the company handles this kind of stuff because i was just an intern.

at this point, the guy wouldn't even listen to me any more, demanded we fixed it for free, no matter what, shouted at me that he would go somewhere else to fix his computer, stops being a customer and he would tell everyone how horrible we are and not to buy at our place. he walked out of the door and i stood there very confused, just slowly realizing what just had happened while i walk into the back of the shop, into the workshop where my boss and co-workers saw everything through the security cam. they asked me what happened, i explained the whole situation and they laughed it off, with my boss telling me that he can search for another company fixing their stuff as cheap as we did and that i didn't do anything wrong.

well, i recently discovered that this shop closed a few years ago with the owner only giving support to important, bigger customers, and now is completely closed. Sometimes i ask myself if it might have been my fault and that this guy successfully convinced everybody not to go to this company.  


TL;DR older gentlemen shouts at kid because he didn't wanna pay 5€"

b5elnc,2,2019-03-25,I’m finishing my 2nd year as an MSE undergrad and I need some career advice!,chrisbcurie,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/b5elnc/im_finishing_my_2nd_year_as_an_mse_undergrad_and/,"Hello r/AskEngineers! As you can probably tell by the title, I am currently an undergrad student majoring in Materials Science &amp;amp;amp; Engineering, and I am finishing up my second year. I have heard that the summer following sophomore year is the best time to start getting involved in internships/co-ops, and I have applied to 40+ materials positions since September. Unfortunately, I only received a single interview from Rolls-Royce, and zero offers. I have a 4.0 GPA, am enrolled in a few different societies/clubs, and am heavily involved in research with my school’s MSE department.

So, I feel as if I’m doing a lot of the right things, but I’m not running in to a lot of success. So, I’m turning here for advice. As a couple of questions:

1) What am I missing? What do I need to do to improve my chances at obtaining that first internship/co-op in an MSE-related position?

2) I’m planning my schedule for the upcoming Fall semester. Are there any courses outside of my major that might prove advantageous towards landing me an internship offer? 

3) Are there any special skills that I should try to develop to improve myself as a job-candidate? If so, what skills come to mind? 

4) Am I pursuing the right path? Would a change of major help me receive more offers? 

Also, just any general advice for an undergraduate MSE major would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks y’all! "

My first year in computer science learning basic object oriented C++, introductory web development, and a little bit about digital systems I got easy A's and thought CS was so much fun and interesting.


However, my sophomore year came and when I took a C++ data structures course I quickly realized I had no idea how to actually code. I understood the concepts about linked lists, hash tables, red black trees, heap sorts, merge sorts, etc. pretty well. But when it came time to actually code those abstract data types and the applications to use them I was hopelessly lost. Most of the time I didn't know where to even begin and would spend many hours trying to figure out how to create these abstract data types.


As the course continued my confidence with my coding ability almost completely disappeared and my enjoyment for coding was replaced with anxiety, stress, and uncertainty. I got a poor grade in the course but decided to retake it in hopes that next time would be better. It wasn't. I now feel like I can't learn how to code and I'm absolutely terrified of applying to any internships in fear that I will make a fool of myself.


I still really want to do coding but I don't want to end up as the guy working as a developer who has no idea how to actually code. How can I teach myself how to code well enough to be confident in my abilities and find enjoyment in coding again?"

I've got two internship offers, both offers from big companies. Company A has me potentially working on an app with 10 million+ installs (team matching won't happen until I long after I accept), while Company B has me on an app with 1 million+ (Company B's app isn't a core part of their business, but still essential nonetheless).

If I go with Company A, it'll be harder for me to make meaningful changes to the app (implementing real features), but Company B's app has nowhere near the same amount of reach.  

To add a twist... I've already accepted an offer from Company B, not knowing about Company A.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I stick with Company B and settle with making impactful changes to a smaller population, or renege with Company B and go to Company A, where I'd potentially land on the right team and be impacting more people, but my impact would be less?

EDIT: For context, Company A is Big N. Company B's app team is only like 3/4 engineers for Android."

b5gurd,48,2019-03-25,What's a better major/what's the difference/how do I pick etc. between X at School A and Y at School B?,visvya,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b5gurd/whats_a_better_majorwhats_the_differencehow_do_i/,"As the cycle draws to a close, I've been getting a lot of questions about this topic. If you’re a junior, working through these questions can help you find schools worth applying to.

The most important factor in choosing a school is cost, but a school that doesn't fit your needs is a waste of any money and time. 

Here are a bunch of things to consider that have nothing to do with rankings (and why you shouldn't withdraw apps/decline acceptances too early): 

1. **Consider your career goals.** Are you looking to enter a profession with a protected title after you graduate? This means the profession is overseen by some kind of licensing committee with admission requirements, and often that you have to take a test of your knowledge. Examples include architects, actuaries, accountants, and more.

 Your major, even if you think it’s very close to what you want to do, may *not* prepare you for admission to a protected profession. For example, most Economics majors will not prepare you for admission to the CPA exam. Most degrees, even some STEM degrees like Math, will not admit you to the patent bar (to be a patent lawyer). You should not attend an engineering program that is not ABET accredited.

 For whatever field(s) you’re considering, ask a working professional or run a google search for important licenses/certifications to prepare for. 

2. **Consider your academic goals.** Do you want to double, minor, study abroad, graduate early? These goals are more or less feasible depending on the pedagogy of your school, the number of units for your major, and the number of GE requirements expected. 

 Even if your school advertises a lot of study abroad options, for example, you may not get more than “college credit” for participating. In other words, you may not be able to take classes that “count” toward graduation while abroad.

3. **Look at each curriculum.** Do this by googling “school” + “major” + “requirements”. Major names are highly variable and do not necessarily indicate what you’ll learn. Look at your curriculums side by side and decide which one works better for you. Also look at how many units the major is; a year of study is ~30 semester units.

 For example, UC Davis’s Cognitive Science has a computational option (~82 semester units) that requires the important pre-software engineering classes, while USC’s Cognitive Science (~45 semester units) is psych-based and has no computational option but is much easier to double or graduate early with.

 Some majors sound great until you look at the curriculum and realize how light they are in the subject you want to study. Northeastern’s “Graphic and Information Design and Mathematics, BS” is absurdly light in Math, for example.  UCSD justified the [introduction](http://triton.news/2018/09/ucsd-launches-new-data-analytics-major/) of Data Analytics, B.S. by pointing to the demand for data scientists. However, it only requires 9 classes related to data, all of which are from the Poli Sci department, and no programming, so it is unlikely to prepare you for a Data Science internship (comparatively, UCSD's Data Science, B.S. is much heavier in computation and far more units - ~76 vs ~42 semester units).

 Just because a school is ""good at X subject"" does not mean your major program will satisfy your needs or wants. 

4. **Talk to students or department advising** about how easy it is to enroll in classes that you are not required to take. If it’s easy, it’s okay if you’re not satisfied with your required curriculum. It’s usually pretty easy to get into intro/GE classes and major classes. After that, though, depending on the school you may not even get into the classes required for your minor. This might affect you if, for example, you are an English major who wants to take the pre-med requirements.

 Some schools also set caps on the number of semesters you are allowed to spend enrolled or the number of credits you are allowed to complete before you are kicked out, degree or no degree. 

 **Also ask** about how easy it is to switch majors both within your college or out of it. Switching majors is very, very common, so ask even if you're dead set on the major you applied with.  

5. **Look at the course titles and numbers.** Are there a lot of electives in different fields? Are there are a lot of required classes with your major department's abbreviation (i.e., BIOE 101 instead of EE 101 and BIO 101 for a bioengineering major)? These generally indicate a more robust major department (a good thing).  

6. **Check for pre-established grading guidelines** by your school or major department. For example, Berkeley’s EECS department [expects](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad) a 2.8-3.3 in lower divs and a 3.0-3.5 in upper divs. UC Davis’s econ department grades on a bell curve and [expects](https://theaggie.org/2017/05/07/the-grading-curve-redefining-the-standard/) a 2.7 average in all classes (Thus, the average grade in a Berkeley EECS class is expected to be higher than the average grade in a Davis Econ class).

7. **Quarter or semester system?** These systems make a BIG difference in your college experience. What works better for you? There are plenty of pro/con lists out there on the web. 

8. **If you have grad school goals**, how easy it is to find a research position and anything else you might need to prepare for applications? For pre-meds, for example:

* Does it have a medical center? Can I walk to it? If not, is there free transport, and how long does it take to get there? 
* What programs exist at the medical center for undergrads?
* When do students normally start working in research labs? Are they usually paid to work?
* Are there lots of volunteer opportunities nearby? Are they easy to get to? Is there relatively low competition for these opportunities (either few premeds around, or a really big city)?
* Is there a strong pre-health/pre-grad community? Is there a Pre-medical Committee that writes letters (consider the pros/cons of such committees)? "

I would like advice on everything - what I should say in interview to explain the gaps, how can I frame my resume to help this matter, and what should I be doing each day to get another job.  I currently an unemployed with savings, and have full time to study and apply for getting a new job, willing to do whatever it takes to get a decent gig.

I graduated in the midwest (US) from a top 25 program which is very well known in the region.   I overall did okay during university getting a mediocre GPA (3.0) but doing a lot of engineering extracurriculars, also always did well on every programming project (I'm mediocre, not talented, but not bad).  During college, I completed two internships but neither transitioned into a full time job.  First one was unpaid as well as being very far away from school, meaning I had to leave it once school was back in session, my family could no longer pay for me to be there.  The second one was located closeby but was only 13/hr and very time consuming during one of my hardest semesters in school, I simply could not do both, and had to choose one or the other, and chose schooling.  Then after graduating, I have had 2 full time jobs.  The first full time job I had to leave after about 10 months due a family emergency, which lasted about 9 months (ultimately resulting in multiple deaths in the family).  The second job was a contract to hire opportunity in which I was not getting to do development, and was a horrible culture fit.  It had low pay and was also a very toxic and mean office culture (without going into detail, it was actual things they could easily get fired for).  My mental health was suffering and I was already considering to leave after the contract as I could not take it anymore.  Then there also happened to be another family emergency (drastic injury which may have resulted in disability) which had come up, when combined with this, I was not thinking clearly and I decided it was time to leave.

Thus I have had a total of 4 different development gigs since college.  Two internships and now two full time jobs.  The internships did not work out logistically and I was wanting to continue finishing college (probably was young and dumb for not staying at the 2nd internship admittedly, as I could have stayed at 13/hr and gotten a very cheap apartment in the hood).  The first full time job I had no choice but to leave, and the second I chose not to be hired on after the contract due to the nature of the job (as well as horribly unlucky timing with another very serious family injury, in which they may be permanently disabled now, a complete shock).  However, I cannot just say all this in an interview as it is pretty depressing, personal and difficult to explain the leaves, so it looks very, very bad, even though it is the truth.

All of this makes my resume look horrible, as I have 2 years of experience out of college, which should be a good thing, but over 4 different jobs spread out over 5 years.  Each tenure was only between 4-10 months, so it looks like I am a job hopper.  Contrary to what it may seem, I have taken each job seriously and been recognized as a strong performer at each of them, staying late as well as working weekends, going above and beyond what was expected.  Like I said, I'm not the most talented developer, but certainly not the worst (struggle with OOP concept questions and tricky design pattern questions, but decent at DSA and hacking things together using google or stack overflow).

All I want to do is find a real development job where I can stay for a long time at least 3-5 years, where I am a good cultural fit (heads down coding shop where we work hard) and get to do actual development work on a real team, but it seems like this goal is further and further out of reach.  So I have taken up the following strategy each day in order to desperately try to find something which is a reasonable fit:

* Wake up 8AM each day (like a real job).  Get ready and dress well just like a regular job, also if any interviews come I will be ready.
* First hour of the day I check email and any new job postings in my target region (Midwest or South US).  I have carefully refined searches for each state in this region and have been spam applying to any jobs available (I still slightly customize my resume for keywords, but no cover letter).  Have YouTube videos regarding tech concepts running in background during this time.
* Spend first 2 hours drinking coffee and practicing on Leetcode and/or HackerRank.
* Spend next 2 hours coding on a personal project (related to algorithms, but in C# instead of Java so I have port it over), put changes on GitHub
* Spend 2 hours on studying OOP concept questions/Design pattern concept questions.  ""Interface vs Abstract class"" type of questions.
* Spend 2 hours on second personal project (which is related to the OOP concepts + Design Patterns), put changes on Github.
* Spend last hour going over any new job postings, while watching YouTube videos in the background over tech concepts/language specifics

This totals about 10 hours of job hunt work.  After about 3 weeks of this strategy, I'm going to transition the personal projects away from being related to algorithms and interview style questions, and more into Udemy tutorials covering the specific tech stacks I am job hunting in.  These apps from the Udemy tutorial courses I will customize into more advanced personal projects to show that I am actively coding in these frameworks.  (Still likely do the 2 hours of DSA and 2 hours of OOP concept questions, but then 2 hours on .NET Udemy course and 2 hours on Java Spring Udemy course)

Based on my current savings, I have at least 6 months here to find a job, 9 months at most (savings would be totally gone after 12).  After 9 months if the search went that long (really hope not), I would have to take a part time job and donate plasma in order to make rent, meaning a lot less time/energy for studying.  The alternative is I can take a part time job now and simply put less time towards the job hunt (maybe more like 6 hours of coding/studying in the morning and then go to a PT job doing delivery driving at night).  The second alternative is I can just donate plasma twice a week which means my savings will last about 1.5 years instead of 12 months, giving me over a year for the job hunt (considering this option but it makes me squeamish to know I'm selling my body to make rent, but the money/time spent is efficient as there is a donation center about 5 min drive from me).

Sorry for the wall of text and kind of depressing post, I am having a lot of anxiety right now over the job search and do not want another large gap on my resume.  Any further advice on what I should do to make sure I can get a job within 9 months.  Again, I am in the midwest and already have a degree, 2 years of experience.  Also open to relocation (even preferring it).  Not targeting big companies or anything prestigious, just something to make an honest buck.

b5jyvr,14,2019-03-25,Advice on how to start researching and choosing school?,hardcorefujoshi,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/b5jyvr/advice_on_how_to_start_researching_and_choosing/,"Hi everyone, just want to ask for some advice and recommendations.

I’m a college senior, Accounting &amp;amp; MIS major (so more on the business side). I want to go into database management/data mining route, so I’m looking to apply to Master Program for MIS/Data Science. I’m an international student in the US, so I’m mostly looking into school in the US as well.

I have tried looking into some schools near where I am right now, and I have some questions regarding how to prepare and continue searching:

1.  Which one should I take? GMAT/GRE? I came from a more business focused background so I’m leaning toward GMAT, but does it matter?

2. Location vs placement rate? I think if the school is in/near a big city then the chance getting internship/job should be better. But there are a few schools that are in a small town or rural area that have really good reputation. Also I’m in the East Coast so that has been my main focus so far.

3. Scholarship/Financial Aid. As mentioned, I’m an international student, so it’s hard to get student loan, and my family probably cannot afford all tuition. I had saved up some money from my current internship and planning to work next year so save up more (during my OPT period), but probably I can only cover my living expense for 2-2.5 years. How should I go approaching this topic? My GPA is 3.6, major GPA is around 3.75.

4. Length of programs. This is related to tuition cost and job placement. I’m thinking 2 years program may be better since I have time to do intenship in between the years. The coursework may be more manageable as well. However, the cost will be higher though. How do you weigh these?

I guess these are the 3 main questions for me. If anyone has any school/program recommendations, advice, or share what they have gone through with similar situations, I’d really appreciate it."

b5knnw,1,2019-03-25,"[Seeking Advice] After 2 years of wasted life with depression and anxiety, I'm finally moving towards a better life and I need some guidance on how to move forward and get started in IT.",CCNAyy,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/b5knnw/seeking_advice_after_2_years_of_wasted_life_with/,"I'll try to keep the background brief. For the past 8 or so years I have been in denial about my mental health problems, which led to the past 2 years of my life being wasted in my Father's basement, riddled with depression and anxiety and getting fat. I'd like to attribute it to childhood trauma and recent personal tragedies, but ultimately my problems all came from me. I finally found some help and have begun to turn my life around. I've gotten really into nutrition and fitness and have shed a ton of weight and I've finally got some semblance of confidence again. I feel like a changed person and I'm motivated to grow as a person, and my next step is to get a real job in IT.

As for my IT background, I have a 4-year B.S. degree in I.T. Management from a state public college where I graduated in spring 2017 (even made the dean's list the last 5 semesters). I have never had an internship, but I did work my freshman year as an assistant/help desk in my school's IT lab, but that would have been 2013-2014. Since graduation, I had no self confidence and never pursued a job in IT and I worked for various delivery apps for money.

My school's curriculum was focused on Cisco and Microsoft server, with some business courses too. I know my way around Cisco route,switch,telephony(cucm),net design, Microsoft Server 2012 R2, and Microsoft Excel and Word. I've taken CCNA/CCNP, MCSE, and MOS certification tests, but only passed a MOS Excel 2016 cert. I'm currently refreshing myself on the stuff I've learned, but I'm rusty after 2 years of wasting my life away. Outside of that, I know desktop PCs and windows 7 and 10 pretty well, I think I'm decently proficient at technical writing, and I'm damn good at using google for troubleshooting.

So now I'm trying to get into the IT field and I'm pretty lost. I haven't had a real interview in years and I'm really looking for some guidance on how to move forward. I have a ton of questions and it would really mean a lot of anybody helps me out.

Questions:

1. Should I be looking for beginner Help Desk jobs over junior sysadmin positions? I never passed any cisco certs and my skills are very rusty at the moment.

2. If it comes up in an interview, how should I talk about my 2 year gap from college till now where I worked delivery apps. Should I be honest about my situation or skirt around the topic?

3. What should I focus on studying in order to be ready for interview questions for a help desk or jr. sys admin position?

4. Ideally I would like to get a job as soon as possible, but should I be working towards some certifications first?

5. What kind of salary should I be looking for with my experience/history? I'll be looking for jobs in the Minneapolis area and glassdoor states that the average salary is $43-46k for beginner help desk, but most of the job listings I see say $15-17 an hour or ""competitive rates"". Is that $43-$46k figure including OT pay?

6. Is there any way I can punch up my resume to look more appealing? Other than my education, my two years have been spent on talentless work, and I feel like my skills are basic at best. I know my way around route/switch, microsoft server, powershell, cucm, etc. but I dont feel proficient with them and I dont want to lie about it on my resume (unless i should?).

7. What questions should I be asking in an interview? Should I be asking about salary, health insurance, 401k etc. in the first interview? In the past my anxiety and awkwardness devastated me when it came to asking them questions.

8. How should I dress to an interview? Dress shirt and pants? Suit and Tie?

9. For a help desk position, should you expect multiple interviews?"

b5l5wq,2,2019-03-26,Any advice on dealing with over protective ethnic parents.,softly_baked,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b5l5wq/any_advice_on_dealing_with_over_protective_ethnic/,"I [24F] live with my parents still. And since I was 18 and able to make money on my own I’ve been trying to move out of my house. First because my parents are very over protective to the point where I’ve developed destructive habits during my first few years of college (such as excessive drinking) because I felt like I missed out on so much growing up and I needed to catch up. Second I have absolutely no privacy where they will just take my phone and snoop through it, along with several other things like nitpicking what I wear how I style my hair how late I stay out (anything past 10pm is a no no) etc. 

After years of arguing and leaving the house, it’s always led to them dragging me back either physically or by  guilt tripping me saying how what I am doing is wrong and it’s very against our beliefs and I’m making my moms high blood pressure rise.  

I’m finally getting to move, but now I’m having problems with them telling me to wait and not to rush and to stay home a little longer. 

I’m in law school and I have to commute almost 2 hours every day for school. I did this for almost two semesters and it took a toll on my grades and they don’t seem to care. My schedule is so jam packed if I waited to move I would be waiting forever basically. This summer I have a 9-5 internship and I’m taking summer classes so I would be sitting in this commute and not getting home until 10pm. I would just be going home to sleep for a few hours then to wake up and sit in traffic again. 

Am I selfish for wanting to move out as soon as possible now that I have the opportunity to. I found a place in a safe neighborhood, and I have the finances to do all that I need to do. I currently pay my way through everything except rent, and I don’t even eat at home.

Also to note, my parents have a very old school mentality where they think a girl shouldn’t leave the house unless she is married. They think that all I want to do is party and sleep around, and no matter how much I try to sit down and talk it turns into a lecture about how I’m acting like a child and they treat me the way they do because they’re my parents and won’t ever stop being my parents. 

At this point I feel so exhausted about moving out with the added stress of law school I just don’t want to make a decision to disrespect my parents but I don’t want to just make an impulsive decision either. I’ve researched apartments for a long time and have seen many places in person. I found a place I love that is in my price range but now I feel like I’m being held back again. "

b5nosh,1,2019-03-26,Just need to rant about this tiny portion of my life rn... if you have advice... that would be cool.,his_royal_bratness,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/b5nosh/just_need_to_rant_about_this_tiny_portion_of_my/,"\[TL;DR: If you don't wanna read this, just encouragments or... anything, something... I just need some good words.\]

&amp;#x200B;

I wont give you a huge backstory, just know these things: one parent was a crack whore &amp; used me for kiddy porn, the other an alcoholic, ditched at 15, homeless until about 20, and has been through hell and back but my life is sort of together and I'm married (I'm a 32F, wife is 28F) Okay, you're all caught up.

&amp;#x200B;

The past few months have been hell. My birthday was in January, but I suffer from very bad Bi-Polar Type 1, so I am... struggling. I just quit my job because I got another (turns two weeks in and everything), but now they're saying it might only be part time, which gives me no benefits, which is why I left my other job (and the pay was... bad). In order to try and take care of my Bipolar/PTSD and diabetes, I go to a rundown govt funded facility where I make an appt for 9am and don't see anyone until noon, and they don't look at me like a patient or listen to my concerns, just tell me ""what I should take"" even if previous doctors said differently (and their shit worked). It's free, sure, but I have to miss an entire day of work becasue of it (I don't have my own car, wife and I share one, and the bus system is... bad here, it's really sad, it takes me 2 hours to get my my 15min car ride job). So, is it really free? Needless to say? Money situation is crap. 

&amp;#x200B;

But going back to my birthday, I usually don't do anything but maybe ask my wife to bake me a cake. But this year she was deadset on doing me something, which was sweet... and since I was stressed out, she told me she would take care of budgeting and the finances and everything... big mistake. She overdrafted our account by $200 and it was only thanks to me shuffling things around that we got out of the hole (and I also talked to our bank, who, very kindly took away the overdraft fees).  February I took hold again, that turned out fine... but...  


I got a very pathetic paycheck of $300 because my boss was out of town and didn't have any place to put me (I work directly under him), so I just... didn't have work. So that... blows. My wife, despite my constant warnings, just... is NOT money conscious whatsoever. She just... spends money. And not extravegantly, but... just beyond our means. Our sad means. She had a breakdown in January about her hating working so hard and never getting to do anything nice for herself. I ha been holding onto this job because while my boss is a scrooge, he was always understanding if I was having a ""bad brain day"" and needed to leave early or needed the day off.  And over the course of a year, I was getting better, not calling out, doing my thing... yeah. So I looked for a job, got one, but now they're switching thigs up and saying ""actually it might only be 20 hours aa week"", like............. fuck.  


We were $122 short for rents and stuff. I managed to switch things around by defering a payment so we'd have some money. But my wife's birthday is on April 8th. She's been excited all March. She wanted to go out to ""brunch"" with me like those ""cute girls"" do, and I'm like........ I wanna be able to do that for her, but I don't think I can. I managed to get my friends to most likely get together to throw her a surprise party that Sunday. I don't have a present for her... it really upsets me.  


Plus, our shared car started making noise, and I checked it, and it has an oil leak and the brake pads have hit the squealer on the front passanger side weel. Driver side isn;t looking too hot either. Gonna cost probably $125 for the parts, and then for the actual labor itself.... christ.  


And then, what prompted me to write this? I was super hungry, and we BARELY HAVE FOOD RIGHT NOW, but I had a can of tuna and some left over crackers was like, ""Sweet"". And two bites in.... SNAP! One of my teeth just... snapped in half. One of the back ones, so its not noteicable, but I can feel it. Looks black, so tooth decay, definitely. But I haven't see a dentist in 18 years so /shrug. I'll ry looking for a sliding scale dentist in the morning, I'm just...  


I'm just so exhausted, and scared, and stressing ALL THE TIME, and this stuff? This shit is MINOR in comparison to what she and I have been through before. But now that our lives aren't filled with CONSTANT crap, this stuff is way more terrifying than before.  


I have a phone interview in the morning for a nice laboratory job,  benefits and decent pay and all that great stuff, but even if I get the job, that might not be for a few weeks. I'm happy I have SOMETHING for work even if its part time, but... any advice? Ideas? Even condolences would be great, I'm just... I cried like three times today already and I'm sick of it. My bipolar low moods these past few days have been ""yeah I'm sick of working so hard, let's just die"". I haven't tried to kill myself in over a year (2018 around my birthday). It was my second psych hospital visit and I just... I just want to do better. I have been doing better. But I keep hitting walls and I'm glad so far I've managed to crawl over them, but... whew.  


This is the first time I've really talked about this stuff. I've been trying to find a therapist even if it's like... an intern or a university thing, so it feels a little better to have said something. I just... I love my wife so much, she's such a happy thing but I see her getting more and more depressed as time goes on, and I hate seeing her hopeless. I just want to do nice things for her... and I just want things to be a little bit easier. She works hard at both full time work and fill time school so she just ... yeah. Anyway...

\----------------------------------quora text-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Run away from UT Dallas…choose other options for the some reasons below:

* UT Dallas (School of Management) is completely money minded. They will create rules, or use existing rules to squeeze every penny out of your pocket. They have extra fees for everything - registering for orientation, late add, late drop, even applying for an OPT card.
* They use scare tactics to scare students from India about visa status and/or other things to force them to take extra classes or extra credits. There are many such cases where students were forced to take extra credits or courses, which all result in UTD making more money. They will never tell you that if you have an MBA or an advanced degree, you can transfer up to 9 credits. If you will find this out, they will make it extremely difficult for you to transfer courses.
* If you want an ‘American’ experience, DO NOT even think about coming to UTD - it is called UT Desis by the students.
* Going to the advising office, program director, or registrat’s office will be like people sending you to someone’s desk in a government office in India - basically, you are ON YOUR OWN at UTD with no one willing to help you.
* JSOM has lost some of their best teachers in last one year. People like Kelly Slaughter, Kashif Sayeed, Kutsal Dogan, Indranil Bhardan, Arthi Reddy, Austin Hensle are no longer with UTD.
* There are 2000 students in MIS and MSBA combined - forget about TA positions, even finding an on-campus job is a nightmare.
* UTD keeps raising the tuition every year - the out-of-state tuition is already close to 60k. They like to entice students by giving a 1-year scholarship, which is really a 2 semester scholarship. Getting the scholarship in the second year is not easy at all…it is just a way to entice people to join this rotten place.
* The teachers DO NOT have time to help..no one at UTD JSOM does. It is a rat race of just applying for internships and jobs. Every student applied for 1000+ jobs to get one with no support from the school. Actually, the school will make you PAY for 1 credit-hour (1600 USD) useless course in which they will build your resume..
* Employment opportunities after graduation are not good. UTD does not have a good brand in Dallas employers…everyone either uses their references or applies for 1000+ jobs to get one.

Look for an option where you will be treated like a human."
b5oyc1,2,2019-03-26,I finally got an idea for a personal project. Even though I will be developing this independently I would like to mimic the development cycle of the professional world as much as possible. Any tips on how to do this?,TheMrShadySlim,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/b5oyc1/i_finally_got_an_idea_for_a_personal_project_even/,"So after 3 interview rejections (one of which was technical), I figured that I should do another project to both improve my resume and improve my coding ability, which I have come to learn has decayed since spring last year (my fall semester was only theoretical classes, I programmed once towards the end of the year).

My two projects that I have on my resume are not that great. First of all they were school projects and not something I did out of my own personal volition.  I did work in teams, but we did not even use version control and our development was a total mess. We got the grades we needed but I dont feel better off after doing them. It has also been a while since I did these projects, so that also contributes to my currently rusty programming skills (late 2017). I made some mistakes during my university studies(like messing up and getting no internship offers) and now I got to fix them if I hope to get some sort of employment in a reasonable amount of time.

I'm doing the project in Java since I feel pretty weak in it and many jobs I am applying to want experience in Java. Simple enough. 

I thought I knew what object oriented programming entailed, but my mind went blank during those interview questions. So for this project I want to ensure that I develop this project using OOP to its fullest so I can fully learn the ins and outs of this methodology and become a better developer for it.

Likewise it seems like most workplaces now use agile development practices when pushing out products nowadays. I looked a little into scrum as that seems like the most popular. Even though it is oriented for a team environment, can I use agile practices in a solo project in order to become familiar with what employers want? 

So /r/learnprogramming, I guess what I am asking is for some direction on how to implement this project in a way that employers will be impressed. I would like to know where to look to learn proper OOP, version control, and agile development.

Every bit of advice is greatly appreciated!"

b5pbzh,1,2019-03-26,"(F, 29) Feeling lost in life and seeking insights",oregon008,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/b5pbzh/f_29_feeling_lost_in_life_and_seeking_insights/,"Hi, I am kind of confused about the way I am feeling and how to get better, so I am writing here to try and understand my thoughts and hopefully receive some advice or gain insights which I am unable to see. Thank you for reading, I appreciate it.

I was always a very happy person, and I think I still am deep inside, but something changed some years ago, but it is almost like I can't really pinpoint why I still feel the way I feel. - My life situation is not bad, probably easy compared to how other people have to go through life - I live in a European capital, I work (since 1 month) part time in a restaurant, I sometimes do some online teaching, I have a studio where I am painting, I graduated with a Masters from a good university, I have loving parents. Yet a part of me feels like: is this it? I feel like I was very interested in art and in doing coursework when I was at university, because I had a structure and I felt like I was going on this journey together with others. I had this feeling that new things and new discoveries were just around the corner, and I never had the feeling that I could predict what would happen in my life (a good feeling.) Then I got together with a guy in my last year at university who triggered in me a lot of insecurities and I became kind go angry at him, at life, at myself - I felt like I was not good enough as I was, I wanted to be like him (I know it sounds silly, but I genuinely believe I wanted to become him, as he was very social, outgoing, and everybody like him so much, I became jealous of the skills he had, and I even was angry that my past was not similar to his, and that people didn't act towards me exactly the way they did towards him) - I kind of distanced myself a bit from the people I used to hang out with at university, and it was like I became part of this bubble which was just me and him, and my anger and jealousy and my attempt to become him...then we graduated and we moved to home city, a different European capital, where I started receiving unemployment money, and he was looking for a job. I didn't realise it at the time, but here I started to isolate myself, didn't really see people and spent long days depressed, but I was fully functioning, going to internships and reading and listening to music, watching things and sometimes seeing my family - basically I didn't really realise I was depressed. Of course my relationship didn't go that well and he moved back to London and came to see me some weekends, but I think it was easier for him to not be so much around me, as I was always angry and irritated at him. After a year of this, of not really talking to anyone about how I felt, but spending many days feeling sad, but still fully functioning, I moved to Berlin, where I think things got a bit better, I slowly started to make friends, and my boyfriend also joined me, but after 1 year me and him split up, and I have been here 2 years now since we broke up. After we broke up I started developing a kind of social anxiety, because without him, it was like I couldn't hide behind him, and I started spending more time alone with other people, and it was becoming difficult to hide how I was feeling. Then I went to therapy for some months and I feel like I understood more what happened and I felt better, but now, even now, I still feel insecure when I talk to people and I cannot fully enjoy my time in the company of other people - I feel like I overcompensate when I am in the company of others, I smile too much because my face naturally droops down, and even though I have told a lot of people how I am feeling- confused about why I feel the way I feel, confused about why my face looks sad all the time - I still feel like I cannot be comfortable in myself. When I am alone, it is ok, but it is together with others that I feel 'different'. When people ask me if I like living in Berlin, in my head I do not think super positive, I feel a bit sad, like something is missing for me living in this city, and my answer always seems to come out 'yeah, it's a cheap city, I can afford to have free time here which I couldn't in London' and even if I am going to classes and learning about new things that interest me, it is like they don't mean so much, paradoxically - I don't know, I basically still feel a little bit like life has disappointed me, and sometimes I feel a bit of an anger about how my life turned out, and what happened in the past - I have spoken to another psychologist about this, but it doesn't seem to be something I am resolving - I basically just feel like I wish I could just feel better, and retort to my old, happy self - I feel really terrible when I think about how I cannot be joyful around people, and it really affects how I interact with others, and it leaves me feeling bad about myself - I am searching for something which can break this whole circle of circumstances? A part of me feels like life used to appear exciting and free and limitless, and now it seems a bit more mundane, like time is falling through my hands...well I find it hard to explain, and I sometimes don't really know what action I should take? I am working, I take music classes, I paint and I even have exhibitions - but somehow it doesn't make me amazingly happy, not the kind of happiness I took for granted and just was part of me when I was at university, when I felt like my life had a course, had things to follow and direction - I don't know, it just seemed easier.

Ok I think this is confusing enough, I really appreciate the time to read all of this, and I would be very grateful if anyone could share some of their thoughts, thanks a million x.

TLDR, I do not know why my joy is not how it used to be, I am searching for ways to get it back"

I graduated August of last year, and only had 2 short unimpressive internships (Windows Forms, QA). I got in as a contractor somewhere else for a few months after graduation, but I realized that I needed to be at a larger company with better mentorship. My entire team was remote and in different time zones, and it was literally a different job than indicated in the interview. Hence why I'm trying to avoid these sketch recruiters now.

I keep reading around here that the vast majority of developers are average and that getting a dev job doing CRUD work at a large non-tech company isn't insanely hard. For the life of me, I *cannot* seem to get hits on any actual companies! I've had my resume looked at here and by those in the industry, and I've made changes accordingly.

Is the whole ""there are average programmers, too"" notion a thing of the past? Does it not apply to entry-level roles? Is it only in the Midwest?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a first year ComSci student at a university in the UK, and recently realised that though I enjoy Computer Science, I also greatly enjoy artistic and creative pursuits, as graphic design was a hobby in the past. I chanced upon a video about [Microsoft's design language for the Hololens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIHPPtPBgHk), and realised I would really enjoy a career where I could work on something like that (interaction design, graphics, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's rather vague, but basically I find UI/UX design interesting, and also enjoy the logical aspects of Computer Science and programming, and building things in general and being creative.

I would like to pursue a career that has great potential for growth and success, as I intend to keep moving up in the industry (if possible, of course. There's a lot of talent out there which are aiming for the same things as me.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 main questions:

1. What are some ideas for areas I can pursue in my career? 
2. What can I do to explore these areas, and develop myself to be prepared to get internships and jobs in these areas?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, with my limited knowledge of the industry, I am considering these areas:

\- VR/AR (get to work on graphics technology, it's challenging and also seems like an area with a lot of growth)

\- App/website design (while it can be difficult, I feel that I would not be doing anything particularly special as a lot of people can do this)

\- Data Science (mathematical, but with data visualisation there's an aspect of design. Also, I admire the detective-like work of Data Scientists)

\- AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning (very mathematical, and does not really have an aspect of design)

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas or recommendations would be very much appreciated!"

I'm a Singaporean currently studying in the UK (undergraduate) and have got an offer for a 2-month summer internship in Munich this coming July and August. I'm now trying to find accommodation for that period and I'm not sure what the best option for me is.

I've been looking at [wg-gesucht.de](https://wg-gesucht.de) (seems to be recommended by many) but does anyone know how reliable that is? I notice that many people ask for deposits (Kautions), should I be wary of paying upfront before I actually see the room (I've seen various posts about scams on wg-gesucht)? As I'm currently studying in the UK, I won't be able to view the rooms in person until my internship actually starts. Would you recommend that I find an Airbnb for the first few weeks instead and then try to find a cheaper room from there? Or are there any other options you can recommend?

Thanks in advance!"

b5rdh5,215,2019-03-26,[OC] Gremlins - Growth 2,BigWuffle,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/b5rdh5/oc_gremlins_growth_2/,"Commander Orion clasped his hands behind his back, the readouts of the screen reflecting of his eyes as he watched each Pilot status turn from Amber ready to Launch green.


Truthfully, he didn’t believe in “The Project”, and would have been much more satisfied with a ship or two... or even some unmanned satellites... keeping watch over mankind’s first official planet based colony. However, eager to keep one of humanity’s first “Official” allies happy, they went with their utterly ridiculous scheme instead.


“Pilot One ready. Red reporting full power. Beginning synchronisation.”


“Pilot Two ready. Blue reporting full power. Beginning synchronisation.”


“Pilot Three ready. Green reporting...”


Orion impatiently tapped his fingers against his wrist, eyes flicking between readouts and the incoming orbital scans, clicking his tongue as the Reaver ships got closer and closer...
“Well ladies and gentleman... We’re about to discover if our taxes were well spent. Pilots, you are Go for launch.”


———————————


It would never be something he could fully become accustomed to. The “Bio-Conduit Gel” clung onto him tightly, pulsating with warmth, almost like being back in the womb. Skin tingling as electrical impulses danced around him, concentrating at the back of his skull, the conductive implant linking man, gel and... well. He still didn’t know how to class Red. Beast, Machine or Both?


*Pilot? We play now?*


And he would never get used to the voice coming from around him, from *in* his head.


“No playtime today Red. People are counting on us. Protect, yes?”


The pulsating of the gel quickened as connections between the pilot and his partner solidified, reaching a synchronisation point of 100%. A faint zap and...


*Yes Pilot One, I understand. Red ready to engage.*


His eyes glazed over as he found himself staring at the insides of Red’s containment unit, felt the cold steel under his... paws. Weaponry going through start up diagnostics. Out of the corner of Red’s eyes, he could pick up the terminals for Mechs Two through Four, bodies shuddering as connections were finalised, the more childlike minds of the grown weapons focusing with the aid of their Pilots.


Almost unbidden, anticipating his request, Red started stretching out his body, allowing his Pilot to map movements to signals, learning a whole new body. The Wolf derived mech shook himself out and felt the floor shudder under their feet before starting to rise, the blast doors above cracking open, allowing sunlight to fall upon his armoured shell for the first time. 


“Mic. check, everybody sound off. Red Wolf online.”


“Blue Bear online, signal clear.”


“Green Tiger online, weapons hot.”


“Yellow Hawk online, interceptors primed.”


“... Do I really have to say this? *Sigh* Black Badger, electronic warfare suite at 100%.”


Far too slowly for his liking, Pilot and Red emerged into the open air, watching the last of the colony buildings sink into their own blast door shielded recesses, leaving them with a fairly clear battlefield. The sky above them boiled as the first wave of Reaver ships tore through the atmosphere, just as Red leapt off the panel he had been conceived, designed and built on, grinding a paw into the rocky dirt below.


“This is Commander Orion. Permission to engage. Fire at Will.”


———————————


The battle was, unsurprisingly, brief. 


The Mechs, with the primal destructive temperments of a wild beast focused and refined through a trained military mind made them near untouchable. Moving too quickly, too unpredictably, too *organically* for the targeting computers on the Reaver vessels to lock on to kept injuries at a minimum. The Tetranoid based weaponry easily outclassed the Reaver’s hulls, and after some micro maintenance by the planet based Gremlins were fully capable of literally shredding the ships into so much scrap metal.


The pirates were confused and terrified as the animal sized war machines launched themselves at their ships. Red and Green leaping higher than anything made of metal had any right to, their organic musculature adjusting, repairing, strengthening as they fought. Blue, with his thicker armour, took the brunt of Reaver attacks, slamming its heavy forearms at any ship that got too close. Yellow dancesmd circles around the comparatively sluggish iron boxes occupying the airspace, missles finding every soft spot to embed in, exploding with enough force to crack or even blast off whole chunks of hull. And to add to the confusion, Black was flooding their communications with white noise and pouring every virus and malware program he had into whatever vulnerable system they could find.


It was a total, one sided, undeniable victory on the Gremlin’s part. 


Commander Orion rubbed his eyes as he tapped out of the after mission report, closing the video link to the smug Tetranoid Director mid sentence, and grabbed a whiskey bottle and glass. Planet Bob had successfully repelled an invading force in their first major engagement with no casualties. On the other hand, they just defeated a minor fleet of spaceships with *giant robot animals*.


Pouring himself a tall glass and swiftly slamming it back, the Commander sighed and almost reluctantly began heading to the barracks. Embarrassing as it may be, he had a team to congratulate.


———————————


*Red liked Playtime! Pilot come back soon? Play more?*


Richard rubbed the back of his head where the new, updated implant was installed, watching as a pair of the giant Tetranoid scientists started examining the metallic canine’s body for damages. The connection was quieter, as though coming from further away and he was informed that moving too far would sever the connection completely until he returned within range but was promised that “the next upgrade or two will solve that problem”.


“Sure Red, sure... I’ll come back when I’m able. For now just... be a good boy for the scientists, okay?”


*Yes! Red be good boy! Scientists fix!* 


Pasting a smile on his face, he backed out of the room, only allowing himself to sag when the doors shut in front of him. Red wasn’t “annoying” per say, but his never ending excitement had begun to wear at him a little. And now they were talking about making the connection more permanent?


Exiting the bunker quickly, Richard tried to keep himself to a low profile while making the trip back to the barracks, having to offer shaky grins or less than confident waves to his fellow inch high sentiments or the towering kaiju hauling materials to expand the construction sites. It was nice to be appreciated, but the last thing he wanted to be known for was driving a big metal mutt around.


An arm slung itself over his shoulders, the Pilot for Green rolling his eyes in his direction.


“Could always be worse man. Could have made us wear coloured Spandex.”


The man altered his trajectory towards the recently completed bar, and Richard found he didn’t have it in him to protest. A stiff drink sounded good right about now. Rather than risk the massive doors for the alien colonists, the pair slipped into one of several tube-like elevators on the side of the building, stepping out onto the counter inside.


A few tables over, right next to the dual counters for Gremlin and Alien bartenders say the other three Pilots, each of them occasionally reaching up to rub the shaved spot at the back of their skull. Following his gaze, Damien gave a short grunt.


“You hear they’re trying to figure out how to get communications between the five of us on these things? I don’t mind protecting planet Bob, but I’m starting to think the good Director sees us as his new lab rats...”


Pushing Richard into a chair, the green pilot slipped into the last, grabbing his drink with a thankful nod to the only woman of the group, raising it up half heartedly.


“Congratulations people... we’re officially a Saturday morning children’s show...”


The Drexi bartender let out a soft chirp before embarrassingly swivelling his ears away from their conversation, passing a large, full to the brim glass over their heads to the waiting patron.


“Dunno about you guys, but I gotta wonder who’s bright idea it was to have the truck sized glasses passed *over* our heads...”


The Pilot sporting the black patch on her shirt rested her chin on her hand, looking around the bar. Here the design was obviously alien based rather than Human, with the needs of the other stuck on as an afterthought instead of built into the design like most of the products being shipped out of the colony. Probably some entrepreneur who thought they could cash in on the alien populace around a more delicate world of Gremlin sized buildings.


“No real need for a human bar yet, the vineyards are still growing, Hopps takes time to ferment and there’s no way I’m touching the attempt at ‘whiskey’ a couple thousand light years from Scotland...”


A few muted “hear hears” and a raised glass or two agreed with her, the table quickly falling silent.


The seconds stretched out into minutes before the Blue pilot leaned back in his chair, wiggling his head a little from side to side.


“It was... I mean you have to admit... that was kinda cool. Just going out there and... you know... wham! Fucking shit up? If ten year old me could see me know...”


He quickly received an elbow to the gut from the Yellow pilot, shaking his head st the larger man’s childish Kung fu poses.


“For a fraction of the cost, we could have had turrets, ships, patrols... the Director is treating the colony’s safety as a game. At least we can take it seriously...”


—————————


In his office the four armed director switched back and forth between several screens, comparing and recording, nails clicking on the desk as he drummed his fingers urgently. A nervous habit he had picked up from one of the Gremlin interns he had overseen.


The Technorganic process worked. Not only worked, but worked *well*. Amazingly well.


For such tiny DNA strands, the Terran lifeforms were remarkably adaptive and responded readily to the process, unlike the 87% rejection his own planet’s species had shown. An answer to his people’s lack of military firepower was within his grasp...


But he would need more samples. More staff, more funding... and while the latter two would be simple to obtain after sending the footage of the battle back to his superiors, the former would require several delicate negotiations.


Swiftly he flicked his coms. Unit on, swiping past his more respectable contacts to the seedier underbelly. No one ever Rose this high in the Guild with all four hands clean after all.


_&gt; I have a Job for you. A simple pickup. Coordinates will follow.

b5rsdo,10,2019-03-26,Help! Choosing one employer over another - and more? No time!,AStarkAmongWolves,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/b5rsdo/help_choosing_one_employer_over_another_and_more/,"I have a problem I'd like help with. One, I would like to write an e-mail that is respectful, and does not jeopardize my college's relationship with the employers who post on their job posting board. Two, I would like help in making an important decision.

I'm currently an HR student in Toronto, and my college has a job posting board and a team of HR who liaisons between the students and the employers. This HR team is responsible not only for setting up interview times, but doing follow up with the employers and responsible for telling us whether we have been rejected, or whether we have been hired. They do so because they want to maintain professional ties with these employers, some of whom use their services year after year to take on interns, whether it is for a short time, or whether those interns go on to stay with them for the long term. Now I have a dilemma because of this. I had two employers who reached out to me via email directly (unusual, since most contact the college) who I have been in contact with, and have alerted the team of HR at the college that they are directly e-mailing me, for which they said is fine.

Now, here are my problems:

1. I did two interviews with a federal government agency (""A"") a couple of weeks ago, and only heard back from them today as the recruiter was out of the office. In the mean time, I still applied for another internship (because I did not want to lose out on opportunities while waiting on one) and this internship (""B"") pays more, however, it is not a government agency but it is still very credible, and both of the employers are in the financial fields. How do I choose between the two? I'm leaning towards B, but I'm farther along in the hiring process with A. However, B seems very keen on interviewing and meeting me.
2. ""A"" wants to continue to the next step - doing a reference check, and background check, and I have met most of the team already over a Skype meeting with them in my second interview. ""B"" is also very interested, and they realize my internship starts within one month and have asked me if I have other interviews lined up AFTER saying they would want to interview me quickly and meet me but their interview process is estimated to take 2-3 weeks long. I have not yet responded to their e-mail (it's only been half an hour), mainly because I do not know what to say. What if ""A"" does my background and reference check, and something negative is said in the references, and I lose that internship? Selfishly, I want to have ""B"" as an option in that case. I am not confident in my references - as they are a year old (I have been in school full-time) and I do not know them on a personal level, only professional, and you never know what can happen. I've heard of people being screwed out of internships and jobs due to bad references. I'm still fairly a ""new graduate""  and this is the only field related reference I have, the others are years old retail job references. Should I reply to ""B"", and tell them, yes, an employer is interested but it is unconfirmed and I am still interested in interviewing with them? And if so, how do I do this in a professional manner, while expressing I am interested but do not come across as ""interview me right this instant or else lose me to someone else!!!"" I do however, want to express to B that 2-3 weeks might be too long for me, and request an earlier audience if possible (since most have been hired for their internships already in the program, which is to start at the end of April and also because of A).  How do I do this appropriately?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I wrong to still pursue an interview with B, when A is so far along the process? What would you suggest in my shoes?

&amp;#x200B;

Other information: both jobs are located within walking distance of each other and would not affect my commute, the only difference is the pay ($2/hour difference). B would allow me extra money, just about enough to consider moving out for the length of my internship, and the possibility of reducing my transit commute significantly. The internship at B also states in their ad that they have growth opportunities (something I will ask in the interview, as well) but that is not guaranteed. However, there seems to be the same possibility at A because the recruiter I interviewed with, had been there for years and she started as an intern, as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to give as much information as I could to help you understand my dilemma, and help me better. Thank you so much if you take the time out to help me with this."

I know some people there and they say that those developers are generally paid higher. I've also heard that this could potentially restrict me when looking for employment down the line. I already work part-time as a developer but want more diversity on my resume and I can resume my current job after this internship is over.

Would anyone be interested in sharing their thoughts?"

Please help me if you can",createbetter2020,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/b5sab7/cant_tell_if_im_burned_out_bored_or_just_lost/,"Over the last few months I’ve started to feel a lack of ambition in my career. I’m 24 and have been working this job since the day I left college. I work for a fortune 10 company and was a part of a leadership program which was basically designed to give people tons of experience in tons of different areas, put them up for promotions and help them figure out what to do... only problem is I’m not at headquarters, I’m in a dated satellite office where things just don’t work that way. 

I work in finance, but only by the loosest definition of the term. When I was offered the job, they evaluated my skill set based on my internship and finance degree, implied a few more skills based on those and gave me a job doing database work, release testing support and all kinds of technical things I never thought I’d be doing. Usually I’d accept this as a challenge and tackle it head on but after 2 years of doing that I feel the most incompetent I’ve ever felt. My team is supportive but the subject matter experts keep everything from us so that we have to figure it out on our own. There’s no knowledge base outside of their heads since this project is 3 years old and architected by them. The worst part is, I’m stuck. I feel like if I leave this company I’m throwing away the supposed opportunity presented by my development program. But if I stay, I’ve been deemed “non-releasable” and have to stay here until they let me find a job elsewhere in the company. 

My role is all over the place - my peers have one job function and all the time in the world to learn it and get good at it. Since starting, I’ve absorbed 2 people’s roles (they have been doing lay offs in my organization every 3 months or so) on top of my own and have been given everything else that doesn’t fall specifically into the other people’s roles. I come in every day letting emails from my director dictate how my day will play out because the entire project is being guided by what he thinks is important that day. I do very fine work and bust my butt to get my work out, and still manage to do so better and faster than my peers. My director has come to trust me for quickly getting out work for his for presentations, and other things that impact him directly. This probably adds to the loose definition of my role. 

My boss Is the only reason I’ve been able to get through all this and he buffers me from my director a lot, as he’s as lost as I am. Only problem is he’s retiring next year. I thought this would be a good opportunity to get promoted, take his job and get away from the front lines a bit, but he’s made it very clear I’m not even in the running. He frequently apologizes to me citing that he wishes this was not my first experience in the workforce as it’s not representative of the company or his 20 years here, and makes it clear this is the worst job he’s ever had. 

I feel like if I leave, I’m going to end up in the same spot somewhere else and I’m terrified of that. My brain keeps telling me to do it and shake things up. I’ve always been creative and I keep thinking this could be an opportunity to turn my career from analytical to creative in nature but I’m sure I wouldn’t earn near as much as I am now with no previous professional experience in the field. 

This post is probably all over the place. That’s how my brain has felt for months. I’m hoping someone else has been in the same boat and can give me some guidance... 

Thank you in advance"
b5sf7b,4,2019-03-26,Need help in how I should approach solving this revenue prediction problem:,OtherwiseDoughnut,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/b5sf7b/need_help_in_how_i_should_approach_solving_this/,"I have a task at work (as an intern) by someone who isn't in data science. I'm still not sure if this is possible and so without bringing in much about my actual data, here's an analogy about the problem at hand:

I run an electrical company, and my clients who request an electrician are linked with someone who I send to go do their whatever (depending on the service). If they like the services, let's say they stay on a cycle of month-to-month where the same electrician comes and does the same service (for the sake of the example), and he's billed by the hour. My hypothesis is that as a service is done each month, the electricians get more efficient so they do the job faster and we get less money. Now I want to predict how much money will be brought in, per type of service that was done. The service starts at any time in the month, and then at the end of the month I total the amount we've made **so far** for that job, even though the job is still going and there isn't a specified end date. But looking at the numbers in the data, we can see that there's a bunch of variability. Numbers bull upwards and downwards, almost like stock prices.

Hopefully this analogy conveys my problem. Basically, I have total numbers every month for every service offered. If we break down each service, we have data points of each job and however many months they were over. So here's an example:

**JobID    |     Service Offered          |        Date Performed         |       Revenue      |        Estimate by Electrician**

1      |        Small electric Problem         |       04/15/18                 |             40                 |                    50

2        |      New Service Installation     |        04/18/18               |            1000                    |               900

1       |       Small electrical Problem       |      05/15/18               |               39                    |                 40

&amp;#x200B;

We can see above that there are two jobs, **JobID** 1 where it repeated the next month (and subsequently got less revenue because maybe he finished the job faster), and then **JobID** 2 where it was only one time. I need to make model that predicts the revenue for *new jobs* (without a dedicated JobID/history) based on their service and maybe other factors that would act as predictors. This seems like a hierarchical forecasting problem, but I created a diagram here showing that the hierarchy breaks down to each job becoming a new model, and if there are 9000 jobs it wouldn't make sense to have 9000 separate models, and it would't be able to predict new jobs. I was thinking about averaging the values per service type, but that wouldn't work because there's a lot of variability in the actual values of the data and if there are higher costing jobs they'd only be brought down by the average. Literally not sure how I should approach this, any advice would be appreciated.

b5sha7,40,2019-03-26,College of IST - Honest Discussion,Moosie234,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/b5sha7/college_of_ist_honest_discussion/,"Hey Penn Staters! I've seen a few threads about IST/SRA where I feel like I answer a few of the same questions. I've been out of college for two years now, and wanted to give an overview of my life experience in/post college!

High School: I only wanted to go to college for music production, took a ton of music classes. Took honors classes to skirt by with A's w/ minimal effort as opposed to the A/P route. Not the best at Math/Physics, ended up taking AP stats as the only math option that sounded good. Hit with reality that music management is unlikely to land me a nice job, decided to go with music as a hobby. Good choice! I had no idea what I wanted to do, but I started looking into ROTC options. Decided I wanted AFROTC. Low middle class, so def staying in state. Pitt and Penn State are only options, Pitt is too close, guess I'm going to PSU! I will probably need a major, decide to browse A-Z on the website, and Security Risk Analysis - Intelligence Analysis and Modeling sounded sweet (cool video online with the guy from the Wire which sold me) and would help me with AFROTC. Aight sick guess we doin this!

PSU: Lived on ROTC floor. Had a solid time. BOOM sequestration hits, all military ROTC programs getting hit, means less people go to field training (you need to stay in for 2 years giving it 100% before you know if they can take/want you). Get told despite being a great cadet, cyber security/ intelligence isn't a ""technical major"" (lol wut AF? ok then c ya). Decide to just pursue Intel. Around that time I joined a cool club called the Red Cell Analytics Lab, thought it was fun, did a whole project on the Missing Malaysian Airlines Flight (6 years later our Pilot Suicide Theory was correct). Knew I could get a job with an intel agency, sweet here we go!

SRA/IST isn't that difficult, classes are group projects, no weedout classes (or i wouldn't have survived) only had to take 2 stats classes. Needed to take 3 semesters of language. Took Hindi as it was new, was the only white kid, it was dope! It was some work, but the teacher focused on me and my pace, got an A all 3 semesters, regularly went to the indian fraternities, impress with hindi skills as a pasty white kid. Computer classes were cool-ish, I knew I didn't want to be in cyber so I didn't try as hard, still got A's, knew I wanted to be an intel dude. 

Started as an LA mid semester sophomore year. EZ job, get to know everybody in college and professors, nice beer money for 10 hours a week! Received a last minute internship for the summer (like during finals week) and lived in DC on an airmattress working for a small consulting firm. Didn't pay much, but hey it's work right? 

Jr Year. Went to bar school and turned 21, worked at a bar 20 hours a week, picked up more LA jobs, turning my work week to 40 hours, still getting A's, on the board of RCAL, life is good. Looking for internships, get boned by two 3 letter agencies, end up getting a job with a defense contractor after college. 

Real Life: Been working for a year and a half. I started, first thing they said was hey bud you're doing Cyber now. Lol ok just don't fire me and I will work my ass off. They pay a lot better than intel. Hate it for a few months, realize it was from my bad attitude, drank the corporate kool-aid, love it. Started doing really well, got promoted quickly, nice cash flow in a cool part of the world on the largest civil cyber project for the US GOV. 

TIPS: 
1. Don't rule out cyber, you're a digital native, so computers are really easy to learn! Plus there is an incredible job surplus (only field with that) that pay super well, can literally go anywhere in the world

2. The curriculum isn't that difficult, but learn to enjoy it! The professors are super awesome all around (never hated any of them), just please give it 100%, its still a fraction of what the engineering kids do lol. 

3. Get Active! Join clubs in both IST and the general college, there are many great options! Don't like them? Start your own with some friends. I was in PSUkulele as well and it was a nice break from work and school! Plus it looks great. Become an LA for good professor relationships and relevant experience (it looks great on resume's and you can make a difference for other younger kids)

4. Try to relax/ take time for yourself - you have unlimited time to eat healthy/ develop workout and healthy activities, and especially party (just don't be dumb cuz it will hurt your future for sure)

Thanks for reading, hope it helps somebody out there! HMU if you have questions!

TL;DR: I'm one of the few people that went to PSU specifically for IST. My college experience was drastically different than my engineer friends, who said I was dumb for not being one of them. Now I'm a cyber security test engineer, and they hate the fact that I haven't ""earned the title"". Either way making good money in the capital! Don't always listen to the advice on here, especially when it comes to unique majors!"

b5spoc,4,2019-03-26,Purdue vs Utah vs NUS (Singapore),NervousLong,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/b5spoc/purdue_vs_utah_vs_nus_singapore/,"I have applied to a handful of grad schools for computer science Ph.D. (AI as the interested research area) for the Fall 2019 intake and I got admissions from Purdue University, the University of Utah and National University of Singapore. I am struggling to make a decision since all three seems competitive. All Ph.D. offers are fully funded with,

Purdue - Teaching Assistantship (up to 4 years until RA funding is found)

Utah - Departmental Fellowship for 1 year

NUS - Scholarship (need to fo TA)

I have not contacted any professors beforehand and all three schools have faculties have that have research interests which are in line with mine. As of now, I'm thinking of accepting the Purdue's offer. This is my thinking process.

&amp;#x200B;

Though NUS is ranked top 10 for Computer Science (according to almost all ranking web sites), industry in the US is far better than Singapore. Hence, the exposure I'm getting in terms of internships will be better. Moreover, once I am done with the Ph.D., I have plans to join the industry. In that case, I'm thinking that a Ph.D. from a US school will open up many doors. (I know that school reputation is not the ONLY factor. But I believe it plays a crucial part as well.)

&amp;#x200B;

Purdue vs Utah: I considered rankings and looked at the faculty members to choose Purdue over Utah. Purdue seems to have a larger number of faculty doing research on a diverse set of topics related to AI.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing, my initial advisor (does not necessarily become final advisor) is a new professor. He has a good publication record, but if ultimately I am to become his Ph.D. student, I will be his first Ph.D. student. I have read in many forums there are pros and cons of becoming the first Ph.D. student of someone. Any thoughts regarding this are highly appreciated as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any comments regarding this :)"

b5tf0y,1,2019-03-26,Is it rude to turn down a turn down a potential job recommendation from a professor (in which there is mutual respect)? How should one go about doing so?,aidenmiller444,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b5tf0y/is_it_rude_to_turn_down_a_turn_down_a_potential/,"Hi,

​

I recently got an email from a finance professor of my mine (I'm a senior, and this is my last class). Basically, the email was one which my professor was asked to give recommendations for his top students for a 2 different potential job offers in financial analyst positions. I am currently planning on going back to grad school next year for my accounting masters, and have another internship position this summer (however that is not a full time job offer). Here is my main question.

​

While I genuinely appreciate the consideration and quite frankly would love to keep my options open regarding any potential positions down the line (in other words, It would be great to continue to be one of this said professors ""recommended"" students), I don't think I would consider either of these jobs as of right now because I would like to get my MSA, and these 2 particular firms are hoping to hire FULL TIME for this summer. I also don't particularly want to do both the full time job and the masters program, it would take like 3 times as long that way anyways.

​

Is it rude to basically say ""not interested"" to my professor? Is that like not a normal thing to do? Should I give them my resume, interview, and then tell them afterwords I'm not interested (not that its close to a given I'd get the job anyways). Is either decision perfectly reasonable, not rude at all, and I'm totally overthinking it? I genuinely don't know what's kind of an ""industry standard"" for how to go about this question.

​

Thanks for the help

b5tuvt,0,2019-03-26,Graduate 6 months sooner OR use extra time for algorithm prep?,legitimatecustard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b5tuvt/graduate_6_months_sooner_or_use_extra_time_for/,"Option 1. Take spring class (Operating Systems) now which will allow me to complete my degree by spring of 2020.

Option 2. Use extra time now to level up algorithm skills.

Currently I'm doing a full time 16 month internship which will end in August. The spring class would be pretty intense but it's only about 1 month long (April to June) and if my workplace doesn't let me work remotely they will probably let me take that time off.

If I go with Option 2, I will graduate in the fall of 2020 but will probably be able to land another internship next spring/summer before graduating and will hopefully be better prepared for interviews from the extra time. 

If I go with Option 1, I'll face a lot of inconveniences to make it happen but it would save time. 

What would you do? I'm a Canadian and my end goal is to work in the states."

b5u9ku,1,2019-03-26,Is there a website where engineering students can perform mock interviews on each other to improve their social and interpersonal skills?,americanmuscle1988,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/b5u9ku/is_there_a_website_where_engineering_students_can/,"I'll be graduating at the end of the year, so I've been looking for internships and jobs. I know how hard it can be to get any response back from companies, let alone a face-to-face interview. Once I do receive an interview, I don't want to blow it with poor responses or being awkward.

I was wondering if there was a website engineering students can visit to video chat with other engineering students and perform a mock interview. The goal of this would be to allow students to practice their responses to some standard interview questions, but more importantly to become more comfortable during the interview process.

Does this exist? I really would like to improve on my interpersonal and communication skills.

Thanks!"

This time I received an 808. The second time I took the test, I procrastinated and thought I had only a year after taking the 901 to pass the 902 and get certified (I scheduled the exam two days before the 1-year anniversary of my 901). I only had a couple days to study and was going on almost 24 hours of no sleep going into the exam in the morning since I work third shift. By the time I read that this was a misconception with the 1-year between exams, it was too late to reschedule.

&amp;#x200B;

This time I was able to study more using ProfessorMessor, examcompass, and my textbook from my hardware/software support class. I actually just had my first day of my IT internship today, too, so that actually helped me retain some information as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I passed my 901 and Sec+ the first time, and will be taking the Net+ in a couple months. Hopefully I can pass with my first attempt!"

b5vp7h,12,2019-03-26,Profile Review - 25 y/o White Male Canadian Biotech Engineer,BiotechMBA,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/b5vp7h/profile_review_25_yo_white_male_canadian_biotech/,"Hello! I hope to begin my MBA in Autumn 2020 and figure I may as well reach out and begin garnering an understanding of my best path forward.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Engineer with good experience and I think I have a good story but a low GPA.  What are my chances?

&amp;#x200B;

Gunning for good schools in Bay Area and NYC for personal reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* Work experience:
   * At time of matriculation I will have four years of experience working as a Process Engineer of different levels at a single Biotechnology company in the Bay Area.
   * I started at the company as a Process Engineering Intern immediately after graduation and burned through all my savings in an attempt to get a full-time offer, and therefore a more permanent foothold in the US and the industry itself.  I was offered a full-time position as a Process Engineer after two months.  Two years later I was promoted to Senior Process Engineer, this is a substantially more senior position than people my age typically hold as I effectively jumped past Process Engineer II/III/IV.  There is a chance I will be promoted again prior to matriculation.
   * I was the fifth engineer hired at the company when it was still a small startup.  Over the past few years I have been part of the three person engineering team who has brought a product through FDA approval and into commercialization.  This product could potentially be a billion dollar product.  This is my companies first commercial product - a biotech startup having a product approved by the FDA is the equivalent of an IPO at tech companies.  I have watched, and assisted in, our company growing from a small startup into a medium sized and successful biotech company.
   * My job duties have been everything involved with highly technical management of a third party production site producing complex medicines. This has included moving to the area for multiple months at a time.  I am part of the team that manages the business relationship with this third party.
   * For the two years leading up to matriculation I will have been spending about 20% of my time working for the corporate development team helping them develop pliable marketing and financial models.  This is a role that I have sought out and have excelled at.
   * I will have glowing letters of recommendation from my boss, who is a Senior Director in a technical role and a bit of a rising star in the industry, as well as the Executive Director of Corporate Development.  Both have told me that they will write whatever needs to be written.
* Extra curriculars:
   * Volunteering:
      * Hosted a weekly radio show in university and was involved with public radio outreach.
      * Editor at a small music blog during university, involved with event and financial planning.
      * Volunteer three hours a week in a Big Brother type program.  At time of matriculation I will have been volunteering for 2.5 years.
   * For hobbies I surf and ski extensively.
* Undergrad school/major:
   * Prestigious Canadian University
   * Major: Biochemical Engineering, GPA 2.9
      * I understand that my GPA is sub par.  I think I have a good story though.  I never took a bird course as I geared all my free electives towards courses that I thought would help me get into Biotech (for which I knew I would need to move to the US). This, in combination with an exchange semester I did, resulted in an absolutely crushing Senior year where I took the equivalent of seven courses both semesters and had a Capstone Project/Thesis Project both semesters.  My GPA had been in an upward trajectory until then.  I feel vindicated as when I was interviewed my future boss actually commented on the array and breadth of my pertinent course load.
* Other education/coursework:
   * My company sponsored me to attend a week long short course at MIT in biotechnology.
* Race/nationality:
   * White/Canadian Citizen.
   * I am on an H1B Visa but  my company is currently sponsoring me for a Green Card
* Sex:
   * Male

**Stats**

* GRE Score:
   * I anticipate around 168 quant and 165 verbal
* Undergrad GPA:
   * 2.9 (see above)

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
   * The healthcare system in this country is broken and I want to do what I can to ease the financial burden on families as well as the system itself.  The company I currently work for prides itself in providing affordable therapies but I feel like I can have more of a positive impact in a strategic role at an early stage company.  I would love to help bring life changing therapies to patients.  Therefore I am particularly interested in working in Business Strategy at small biotech companies.
   * I believe an MBA in combination with my technical skills would be valuable at early stage biotech startups where employees need to fill many roles.
* Target schools:
   * NYU, CBS, Haas, Tuck, Duke, Anderson, Rotman (University of Toronto) as a backup
   * Are these realistic? Could I apply to even higher ranked schools?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for any advice you can give!"
b5vpue,5,2019-03-26,Next stages for launching an App/Company ?,jb_hand_made,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/b5vpue/next_stages_for_launching_an_appcompany/,"Currently working on an iOS app/company (my ultimate goal is to have Microsoft acquire it), it's around \~60% done. I plan to launch a private beta in Q3 of this year, but after that what are my next steps?

Before launching this app (I own 100% of it btw), what actions must I take when it comes to:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Branding it, do I need a legal consultant to secure any IP?

\- How do I register my company?

\- Should I use the app as an MVP to attract investors?

\- What are the first steps when it comes to speaking/presenting myself to potential investors and what do they care about?

\- How do I create shares?

\- How do I begin marketing on a larger scale, creating video ads, etc?

\-  (Is there anything important I missed ?)

I'm pretty young (19 yrs old) and very technically inclined (have a fare amount of experience being a software engineering intern at large tech companies so I understand the fundamentals of how to scale a product from a development standpoint), but I really don't know much about the business side of making a company/app, any book recommendations, or resources, or any advice in general?"

I've been trying to find an internship since last September. Sent in 50+ apps, had two interviews that seemingly went well but resulted in rejections. Been to career fairs, even went to some places to apply in person. 
Summer is approaching and I can't but feel like a total failure when almost all my friends are excited about their summer internships, and I'm the odd one out who is still ""weighing my options"" (ie no one has hired me). I'm worried if I don't have direct experience before I graduate that I'm gonna really struggle to get a full time position. I'm really feeling so sad about everything career related and struggling to find motivation to keep applying. I feel like it's getting me no where and I'm starting to even wonder if I'm capable of pursuing an engineering career if I can't even get an internship. 
Please any advice, words of wisdom, insight, etc is much appreciated"
b5vyxz,13,2019-03-26,"Co-ops/Internships are more than experience, they're insurance.",AdviceGuyTemp,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/b5vyxz/coopsinternships_are_more_than_experience_theyre/,"This post is aimed at anyone who is on the fence about pursuing a work experience opportunity relative to their engineering field of choice. I'm going to explain my initial attitude, talk about hardships throughout my time in engineering school, and conclude with my current situation.

Tl;dr at the bottom.


**Intoduction**
I started my BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2013. I was one of two students who left my rural high school to go to the flagship university of my state; the only to pursue any type of engineering. I didn't know what I wanted to study when I chose that major. I had always liked tearing things apart to see how they work but never saw it as a frequent hobby. A teacher sacrificed his planning period to personally teach me AP calculus. Caring teachers made sure I didn't fall victim to the lowest common denominator. I chose engineering because I heard it was challenging and I owe the opportunity to do so to those who went above and beyond in their obligation to instruct me.



**Hardships**
That being said, I was not a star student. My study habits were atrocious, my homework scores anchored all my grades, and my English classes consistently resulted in a struggle-born C. By the conventional wisdom of the college dropouts in my family, I was destined to fail once my poor study habits caught up to me. During my 4th semester, once the structured, high-school-esque classes yielded to the application of physics, I was lost. No one wants to admit their criticisms are accurate and once the evidence began suggesting their predictions were, I panicked. Anxiety riddled attacks began happening multiple times a day, centered around anything and everything that my mind could foresee going poorly. I was given an antidepressant and sent on my way.

Up until this point, I was incredibly socially anxious. I didn't go to any events or career fairs because I was too afraid to talk to people. This was unbeknownst to me as I had never had a perspective without it. This anxiety free world was mine for the taking and in my 5th semester I did my mind was put on this Earth to do. **Sleep**. I slept 16 hours a day. I no longer cared about my grades at all. Attendance was a worthless formality and Exam scores were all that mattered. And like many hypotheses before, I was abruptly proven wrong when I failed 2 classes. This led me to scramble for a co-op. My goal was to avoid academic probation after the next semester where I would inevitably conduct the same experiment. I have no idea how I managed to convince a company to hire me for 8 months at my lowest mental state; but, through the experience I was able to quickly grab a part time internship with a local company when I returned to school. The next 4 semesters were plagued with more debt and fewer gained credits. I perpetually pushed my graduation date back each and every semester. 

The turning point came when it was revealed that my poor study habits were the result of a long overdue ADD diagnosis. After coming off the antidepressant and coming on to amphetamines, my understanding of the world immediately clicked. But it was too late. I was too far behind and was kicked out right when my mind came back. I was amazed how I perpetually avoided academic expulsion when I didn't care only to be greeted with it when I finally did. I completed 107 hours with a 2.8 GPA.



**Conclusion**
Thanks to my 2.5 years of manufacturing engineering experience, I have landed a job paying 100k per year plus benefits without a degree. Had I done nothing and graduated, I'd almost certainly be looking at much less. The education you get has application. If you can demonstrate you understand it and have experience to back it up, you can still achieve great employment even if the pursuit of a degree falls through. Although this is not an engineering position, it pays better than my supervisors at either of my previous companies. While I can't say that everyone is an ADD diagnosis away from success, I can say that experience is just as valuable as a completed education.



**TL;DR**: Smart guy, bad student, mechanical engineering, bad grades, anxiety, antidepressant, internship, anxiety actually ADD, expulsion. Success."

So right now I am in culinary school who is sending us out to work in real restaurants for free as sort of a co-op thing. I have applied to 4 restaurants and they're all really nice in their own way, but I want to get as many different perspectives as possible.

Restaurant A (30 covers) -  Super high class restaurant who only does like 20ish people a night. A lot of ingredients are either fermented, dehydrated, or foraged. I'm scared that the things I learn and do in this restaurant will be hard to translate later in other restaurants.

Restaurant B (60 covers) - Italian restaurant. It's ridiculously clean and organized. The food is pretty good (worse by a sliver compared to my list). However, the prep area is really small and it's right in front of a stove that's always on. So the kitchen is hot as hell.

Restaurant C (200 covers) - One of the best restaurants in the city. The only problem is that there was no stage/trial, hell there wasn't even a tour. I just spoke to the sous chef for 3 minutes, and suddenly he already wanted to make a schedule for me. I'm scared I'll be stuck in a corner picking herbs for 8 hours a day.

Restaurant D (60 covers) - Italian. Kind of a mess and very chaotic. The restaurant is old and things break down quite often. However, this is the only restaurant that pays ($80 a day).

When I first started my search, I was really thinking/hoping of working for restaurant C. However, the fact that they were willing to hire me after a 3 minute interview makes me really suspicious. Every restaurant is great in their own ways but also has major flaws. 

I need some advice on what I should be looking for when doing an internship with restaurants.

Thanks!"

I’m an engineering undergrad who been interviewing for a few internships during these past couple of months. I was interviewing with a company last month and one of the project managers, at the end of my interview, asked me who else I was considering for my summer 2019 internship. 

I’ve never been asked that before during an internship interview so I was kind of taken back and took a second to respond. I told them the other two companies I was considering and already had offers from. I don’t know, am I overthinking this? Has anyone else been asked this during an interview? I ultimately ended up getting an offer from them so I don’t think it played a huge factor but I still thought it was weird.

Any advice on how to respond to a question like that during a future interview would be greatly appreciated :)"

b5xyl7,59,2019-03-26,Giraffes are no longer my favorite animal.,AuthorJoJo,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b5xyl7/giraffes_are_no_longer_my_favorite_animal/," When I was a child my parents took me to a park where you could drive through and get really close to African wildlife. I remembered the monkeys that broke the car's antenna and the Giraffe who stuck it's head through the sunroof and ate some of the popcorn I had. I was inches away and pressed my tiny hand to it auburn fur, it's black eyes stared back at me.  


Growing up it's not like I was obsessed but I did learn a few fun facts. Like how a group of Giraffes is called a 'tower' and how they fight by swinging their heads like maces. I mean really does it get more metal than that? So if you were to ask me what my favorite animal was then I'd have to say Giraffes, that was before my visit to the Savannas. While growing up it's true I had a pension for Giraffes but I also had a great love for animals in general and wanted to study them.  


Through hard work and an obnoxious amount of pestering people I'm sure, I was accepted into an internship. This internship would allow me to travel with a small group of researchers to the Savannas to observe the wildlife like I did as a child but with more purpose. Most of this internship was fairly uneventful so I'll spare you all the dirty and boring work I had to do just to be able to stay out in that heat. It was miserable but getting to see so many of these majestic animals in their natural habitat made the venture worth it. Not to mention how good it'd look in my resume.  


A few nights into the trip I got a little antsy, we had rules restricting when we could leave our home base and who we could go with. On that particular night though everyone was asleep from a hard day's work, not me. I laid in my little cot watching the clear night sky above me. It was then that I first heard the groan. At first, I assumed it was one of the heavier set guys snoring but as it continued it was a little too consistent. The low reverberating mumbling, I hadn't expected to have the pleasure of hearing it. It was the low hum that Giraffes make to each other during the night hours.  


I lifted from my bed thinking a tower must have been pretty close for me to be able to hear it inside my tent. Unzipping the nylon fabric I looked around, I wasn't really afraid as from what I knew Giraffes were pretty peaceful animals. The tower was actually a pretty spread out group of Giraffes and only one was by the tree near our camp. It was the one making the humming noise, it was a quiet night for sure but it was odd how loud the Giraffes hum was. Reaching back inside the tent I pulled a thick and powerful flashlight out. They were heavy duty so we could see great distances across the plains of Africa at night. We had rules against keeping the flashlights on inside the tents as they might melt the fabric if left on one spot long enough. Giraffes and other wildlife out there have really good eyesight but we certainly did not.  


The beam of light guided me across the brown Savanna floor as I made my way to the lone Giraffe. I was worried it might be humming as some sort of distress call, it wasn't eating out of the tree it was by and I was concerned it had gotten hurt. Getting close enough and with the assistance of the flashlight, I could see small scrapes peppered around the Giraffes legs. They were fresh wounds, blood still glistening in the powerful light. I was upset that such a gentle creature was attacked but it wasn't surprising, not until I found the culprit laying at its feet.  


A lioness laid battered on the hard ground, there were no cuts on it but I could see several spots where the bone was broke and patches of flesh were caving in. Its head was a mess and barely recognizable like it had been hit by a bowling ball or, a mace. Stunned I scanned the lioness with the flashlight over and over and I saw that she was still breathing. The Giraffes breathing was much louder as it's snout peeked into my view. It was huffing air as it moved along the lioness taking in her scent as it trailed along, it was reminding me of another animal but at the time I couldn't put my finger on it.   


The Giraffe trotted around the lioness until it got to the head, there the Giraffe buckled its legs to lay on the ground like a resting camel. I stepped back a little at this point, I had never heard of behavior like that before so I was awestruck and curious to see what the Giraffe was doing. I thought of the tree above it and how Giraffes evolved to be able to reach previously unobtainable food. That's what we thought anyway, now I'm not so sure.  


There were a few more sharp exhales from the Giraffe and then it opened its mouth, it's long tongue wriggled taking in the night air. Its mouth kept opening wider and wider, I heard a click and stunned I watched as it's jaw unhinged. The lower portion of the jaw hung loose with the brown fur stretching and revealing the skin was thin and cloth-like. As the Giraffe brought it's head forward and place the jaw around the lioness' head I was at a complete loss for words and actions. More and more the lioness disappeared into its tunnel of a neck, I could watch the shape of the predator moving along the Giraffe's body which was undulating like a snake.  


Flashlight shaking hard in my hand, the beam dancing around the Giraffes deep dark eyes that paid the light no attention. It was only a matter of minutes until the lioness had vanished completely and lost its form from falling into the Giraffes' stomach. It didn't even pay me any mind as it brought itself back up to a standing position. The skin that was holding the two halves of its jaw together started to tighten bringing both pieces into one again with another unnerving click and a low hum. Then it walked over and grabbed a few leaves off the tree like it was something to wash the lioness down with.  


Too stunned, a state of complete bewilderment washed over me while I was attempting to comprehend what I had just seen. I didn't hear the soft trotting behind me or the soft wafts of breath that painted my neck with a speckling of saliva. The hard blow to the side of my head, however, was hard to miss. My body crumbled to the floor and my world became hard to grasp covered in a thick haze and a constant ringing. Any attempt to move my body yielded little results as if my brain wasn't able to send any signals out.  


My vision was coming back to me in waves as I could see brown stick thin legs standing by my head that lowered to the ground. There was a click one that was all too familiar and my vision of the night sky became blanketed by a thin sheet of pink. Hard teeth lifted my head like a shovel and I could feel a soft slime covered tongue feeling the groves of my face. Still struggling to move the Giraffe pressed on and my head reached into its throat.  
   

 It was tight and wet, I was being pressured from all sides, arms were violently shaking at my sides as I tried my best to even panic. The saliva that was covering my body started to burn away at my clothing. I thought about the burning sensation hard as my fingers did their best to navigate their way around the flashlight in my hand that I had somehow managed to hold on to. Angling it as best I could I pressed the face of the light to the surface of its throat.  


The hard metal pressed into my hip but that was a small price to pay, I was starting to lose consciousness and if a lion's claws weren't sharp enough to shred the Giraffes' insides than certainly nothing on me would have been, I needed another way and the flashlight was all I had. The smell of the Giraffes stomach was absolutely found, it stunk of soiled food and battery acid but the smell was being replaced by burnt flesh.   


I was moving along but I was able to keep the beam of the flashlight pressed onto one point in the Giraffes neck just long enough for it to seer. I remembered that when snakes having trouble swallowing their food they tend to regurgitate it so that became my plan. The Giraffe attempted to lift its head but with my weight, it was unable to and instead it rose up off its feet. I could feel the muscles relax around me and faster than I'd been swallowed, I was spat out.  


Covered it saliva and smelling like I might have come out the other end the Giraffe appeared to have lost interest in me, so there I laid. The initial blow and the burns it's interior acid left on my were enough to keep my body on the ground until sunrise and even then, only when my research team found me was I able to become mobile again. They picked me up and shuffled me into the tents and after lots of water and rest, I was back to stable consciousness.  


Nothing much was left of the experience, well other than a deep purple welt on my side which hid three broken ribs. I was sent back home the next day for proper medical treatment after having a long discussion with the lead researcher. I told him everything about what happened and while his face was plastered with confusion he didn't immediately write me off. I was told once I get better that he'd consider bringing me back on, maybe even paying me. I think that last bit was a joke.  


He did leave me with a bit of advice however, he told me to keep this to myself until I could help him research it further. It was unfounded and went against anything we'd studied on Giraffes up until that point and it'd look pretty damning if I made wild claims like that. I'm not worried about looking silly, I have the proof of that night all over my body, nothing near our base camp that night would have left a bruise like this and not have killed me.  


I don't much care for Giraffes anymore. Since then I've read loads of interesting stories about creatures and even just animals not behaving the way that was acceptable to us. The world is full of terrifying and bizarre oddities and nature can produce absolute monstrosities. I liked how gentle and kind Giraffes were supposed to be but now that I've seen what they're really like, what they really do. I've had to re-evaluate my opinions of them. I must say though, as of late I've been increasingly interested in snakes. "
b5y1ik,2,2019-03-26,Advice for Undergraduate in Computer Science,SillyCarpet0,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/b5y1ik/advice_for_undergraduate_in_computer_science/,"Hi,

I would to seek advice from anyone who is willing to read this about my situation. I am a year 1 computer science student in a university in Southeast Asia. Before this, I had entered a polytechnic(not sure about what this is called in other countries, you graduate with a diploma after 3 years here) and graduated with a GPA in Diploma in Information Technology of 3.90/4.00, with distinctions in multiple technical modules(Operating Systems, Object Oriented). Between the diploma and my degree admissions, there is a gap year of 2 years due to conscription in my country. Enough of my background, here comes the issue I would like to seek help with.

With my background from Diploma in Information Technology, I had admitted into a degree programme offering the Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science but have been struggling ever since(GPA 3.5/5.0 in first semester). While searching for summer internships, I realised a lot of companies do not care about academic results but instead focused more on portfolio and technical skills(practical skills and/or algorithms). This had left me in a dilemma regarding whether to focus on my academic results or skills that are testable.

To add to this, my experience in my current Computer Science course is terrible. We have to take up several electrical engineering related modules that are taught by our faculty professors(who doesn't specialise in electrical engineering). In our final year of our programme, we have to take up a joint module with computer engineering students to build a robot that navigates a maze.The robot is equipped with only a motion sensor and no hardware addition is allowed. We are organised into random teams of 8 people, 4 from each course and our academic performance for the module is ranked according to our performance in timing, with only 2 tries per group. This tries includes reattempts due to hardware failure.

Our mathematics are taught as 3 modules, Discrete Mathematics as 1 module, Linear Algebra + Statistics in another and lastly Calculus I + II and Series and Sequences. It also does not help that many professors who are good educators has left the university in order to join another much better university X. Quizzes, if any, questions often comes up to differentiate the elites, rather than just to test your knowledge. Practical project related modules, such as software engineering is a mess.

This university X is a much well known university with better reputation in Computing and offering a Bachelors of Science in Computing. This university X will be recruiting twice the number of students in computing as compared to my current university in the next cohort intake. My current university has also been trying to take over university X's position in ranking. My experience with my current university is so terrible and stressful that I have thought of switching courses to a lower reputation university that if offering a joint overseas degree.

Regarding practical experience, I enjoy building software products and I did not want to specialise mainly in Software Engineering as it seemed too specific. I have had 3 internships with different organisations mainly building geospatial or location data related applications, will be taking a similar position in a drone company in a position to solve

With that, these are questions that I have:

1. How important is academic results when looking for a full time job in Computer Science?

2. Do you think I should drop out to enter a better/worse university? (Either University X or the one offering a joint overseas degree) Reasons for doing so?

3. What do you think I should do?

4. Advice on my perspectives in general related to this topic."

I assumed I would have an internship at this point, but I literally have not heard anything back from about 50/60 of the companies I applied to. Not even a ""Sorry, this position is filled"" or rejection of any kind. Many of my friends with less experience and worse grades are getting offers or at the very least interviews.

b5zwr7,1,2019-03-27,Dying is the best thing I can do,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b5zwr7/dying_is_the_best_thing_i_can_do/,"I’ve been a fuck up since about the age of 9 (I’m turning 26 very soon, so this has been a thing for quite a while), and started having suicidal thoughts around that time. I’ve always been the “smart kid;” people always told me about the great things I would do (which is basically taunting me). I’m now 26, still in college (despite starting when I was 16), with a shit GPA and no internship, so my job prospects are bleak.

I’ve always been blessed with good friends. I’ve never sought out friends in my life, yet good people always seem to find me and care about me. I wish this good luck could have been given to someone more deserving. Maybe they just feel pity for me and I leech off of that.

My family isn’t perfect, but it’s more than a lot of people have. My mother and father are slightly idiosyncratic in ways that make them resent each other, but they’re able to be supportive despite their disputes. My older brother, funny enough, has huge admiration for me. He always wants to get into what I like and be like me when it comes to video games, music, comedy, etc. If I’m unable to bring myself to do the deed, it’s because of him; I couldn’t kill my brother’s idol.

I’ve never been in a romantic relationship. I would overwhelm anyone in that situation. No one else should have to shoulder my problems, and no one would want to anyway. Still, I long for such a relationship.

My lack of academic, professional, and romantic success weighs heavily on me. This is greatly exacerbated as my friends graduate and get married, while I remain at my parents’ house. They say they won’t drift away, but they do, and I can’t blame them. Their spouses and jobs are simply more important than my unpleasant self.

Most significantly, my psychological state is in complete disarray, despite years of treatment by quality psychologists and psychiatrists. I can’t sleep, I can’t stay awake, I can’t focus, I can’t face the day, I can’t do my homework, I can’t do what I’m supposed to do. This combined with my failures obviously leads to suicidal ideation.

Things go from bad to worse when going from my mental state to my emotional state. I am gradually becoming bitter and spiteful, even towards my friends. I hate that I’m incapable and they’re capable. I hate that I can’t find happiness and they can. It makes me want to give them my pain by hurting the one they care about: me. These are depraved thoughts that must be stopped through the most straightforward means: termination.

With access to industrial and laboratory supplies, I have access to quite the foolproof and painless suicide (obviously this sub won’t let me go into any more detail). It actually makes me feel relief to know I can die easily whenever I want. It takes the feeling of having to rush away.

I guess I made this post to let anyone who wants to plead their case for me not to go through with this. Say your piece if you would like. I’ll answer questions as best I can."

b60aqq,4,2019-03-27,Few Questions from a potential Boilermaker,SafeTheme,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/b60aqq/few_questions_from_a_potential_boilermaker/,"Hey guys,

I got accepted to Purdue EA for my second choice major (Cybersecurity in Polytechnic) and had a few questions which could help me decide if I will be attending Purdue next year. 

First, I want to explain my situation briefly. I am a California resident and have narrowed down my college choices to my state school and Purdue. I got in for Comp. Sci at the state school, and it's well known for CS, but I would probably have to commute to school and feel like I would miss out on the ""college experience"" and it would be like going to high school all over again. 

As for Purdue, I've heard nothing but great things, not only about the Cybersecurity program, but also about the school in general. Some pros of attending Purdue are that it's a well-recognized school, I would get a chance to live on my own and experience new things, and I would get a fresh start. 

Some cons, however, are that Purdue would cost a lot more, I’m still not sure how I would adjust to the weather and culture, and I’m still not sure how viable a degree in Cybersecurity would be. 

As for my questions: 1. For those already in the Cybersecurity program, how have you liked it so far? Some good and bad things about the program? Have you had a lot of internship and job opportunities? 

2. Is Cybersecurity too specialized of a major? Computer science is a broad major and people can often have more opportunities in different fields, but with a degree in Cybersecurity, you are more limited. I’ve read everything about the Cybersecurity program at Purdue and believe that it will still be a great option, but I just wanted to hear the opinions of those who are familiar with the program. 

3. How difficult is it to transfer into Computer Science? I’m sure many students every year try to transfer into Computer Science so it should be pretty hard, but is it really common for people to transfer into CS from other schools (like the Polytechnic Institute). 

4. For those from warm weather cities, how was the transition to Purdue?   

Any and all help is much appreciated!!"

As an athletic trainer, it is pretty rare to work at a place where the coaches respect your opinion and the team is full of genuinely good kids and athletes. 

I have been offered to work here full time. Instead of my working my normal 35ish hours a week, i will be teaching a class and be working in total about 50-60 hours a week. I would love to take the job but i am really scared i am going to burn out and not be able to perform to my best ability. My schedule right now is pretty light with me working from 11 to either 5 or on late days 9. And this new job would be from 7am, teaching a class during the day and about the same ending time frame. The pay is definitely much higher than the national average and i will get holidays off like other teachers except for when there are games. I don’t have a problem with working hard and long hours but i am afraid of being so burnt out that i end up getting depressed.

Any advice on how to address this?

b60huf,16,2019-03-27,Is it weird that I have no time as a first year student?

I'm looking to join more clubs but so far nothing has piqued my interest yet, either that or it doesn't fit in my schedule. 

I applied for subcom for CSESOC but I doubt I will be selected. Should I just focus on internships and personal projects rather than relying extracurricular activities for future job prospects? Or will they think I'm not well-rounded enough? 

Right now I am in NSA to improve my Japanese skills like the filthy weeb I am, CSESOC like any other comp sci student and Ice skating society due to personal interests. Game development society is a good bet but so far I have no time to attend their sessions."

b60ry7,2,2019-03-27,How to automatically load applicationContext for Spring unit testing?,henry12345_54321,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/b60ry7/how_to_automatically_load_applicationcontext_for/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am newbie at Spring and as intern have been asked to write a few unit test cases for  a Spring 3.2 application. Problem is that I am not able to run it because upon running the test case I get a null pointer exception from another method that this one relies on, which then further relies on some more classes including one that gets data from a database. I had a look at a prexisiting test and it seems that it tries to invoke an applicationContext from an applicationContext.xml file. I tried to do that with my test case but it didnt work :/ . Some or the other error keeps coming up. So was wondering, is there any way in Spring 3 to make it automatically detect whatever the test case needs and do the necessary setup so that all I need to do is click the 'run junit test' button and it runs. I would rather spend time on writing the tests instead.

Thanks! :)  


p.S. - using jdk 7 and intellij community edition"
b60vhs,2,2019-03-27,I'm at a loss for what to do with my life.,iAMA_throwaway-,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b60vhs/im_at_a_loss_for_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"Hey guys. I'm here to ask for advice, and maybe to vent a little bit. This will be a lot of exposition. The last 4 or so text blobs are what you really need to read, but I'm giving the backstory in case somebody can relate.

I'm 23 years old and I've always excelled. I was a great student in high school. I got good grades without really trying, had great friends, was well-liked by teachers, and graduated with honors. I went to college at my first (and only) choice, rooming with my best friend (nothing bad happened), in a major that I was both talented at and would make me good money (software/web/app development). I was at the top of my class, considered by peers and professors to be one of the best and brightest in the major with the potential to go on and  do or make something great.

2.5 years in, I dropped out. I was bored. I wasn't having fun. My grades were slipping because I wasn't interested, and I felt like I wasn't learning. I felt like I was ahead of my peers and wasting my time. I had a bad internship experience that soured me on the industry, and I just needed a change of pace.

I started working retail tech support to pay rent (I refused to live off of my parents for longer than I had to) and quickly went from part time to full time, and a year later, was promoted to a higher-level position. Since then, I've taken on an internship with my company, who's paying me extra to work in a corporate role for awhile, with the potential to move to a full time salaried spot later on.

I have a great life. I make decent money, and I have the potential to make a big leap out of retail. I met the woman of my dreams while in college, and we're engaged to be married. She makes twice what I do, and together we make a good living. We're financially stable/independent. I have everything I need, and most of the things that I want. I still have great friends, who I talk to, or play games with. I have great coworkers in my retail job, though the hours stink; but right now, on this internship, I have great coworkers, the hours are better, the pay is better, and I'm having more fun.

But... I'm not content. And I don't know what to do. I haven't found something that I really care about, something that I want to do with my life. Something that I can work on. I was talking to my fiancée earlier and she said, ""Well, if you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do?"" And my response was ""I basically do, and I have no idea."" It's the truth; I have tons of free time right now, to try new things, to pick up new skills to work towards a job that I want. But I'm not interested in anything, and I don't know how to get out of this rut. I want to find something akin to a dream job. Something that makes me want to work towards. Maybe something that makes me want to go back to school and actually finish my degree.

I just drop into this rut every once in awhile where I just feel like I'm lacking both drive and accomplishment in my life. I've watched most/all of my friends graduate and move onto fulfilling careers, in industries that they're excited to work in. I see people in my workplace writing code and I think, ""That could've been me."" But any time I try to go back and touch what used to interest me, it just feels like I have no interest, no drive to learn, no reason to continue.

I don't want to complain, and it feels petty as all Hell to write this out. I know how privileged I am. I know how fortunate I am, and how great I have it, but without any sort of drive, it's difficult for me to want to get up and live my life to the fullest.

Has anybody been in my shoes? Any thoughts, words of wisdom? Can anybody give any tips or advice to help me find something I'm passionate about?"

b62uv8,0,2019-03-27,Introduction of a general compulsory year of service,1r0ll,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/b62uv8/introduction_of_a_general_compulsory_year_of/,"I advocate for the introduction of a general compulsory year of service in Germany (i.e. not compulsory military service) between 6 and 12 months from the age of 16 and no later than 25 years for both men and women. Either for the Federal Armed Forces, Federal Border Guard, environmental protection, social facilities amongst others the elderly care, kindergartens, facilities for handicapped people, the rescue service or by committing to participate a longer time in the fire brigade, civil protection, or the water rescue. Refugees recognized in Germany would also be addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

I see the following **disadvantages**:

* Constitutional Law change with 2/3 majority necessary, in order to introduce this year of service as described.
* Justification of forced labor necessary and drastic cut in freedom rights.
* Time relatively short to train more profoundly.
* Does not solve all the problems of the German Armed Forces (lack of technology investments, structure) and nursing (underpayment of well-trained nursing staff).
* Costs (possibly more expenses for administration and payment of a small wage as well as permanent training as direct income).
* The corresponding administration and infrastructure would have to be rebuilt, since, for example, the Bundeswehr's district army replacement offices, which had previously taken over the recruiting, were abolished.

&amp;#x200B;

From my point of view, these would be the **advantages**:

* Mixing up society, all social milieus are affected equally and must work together, learn to interact with each other, consequently young people are torn out of their respective filter bubble in which they find themselves. This could increase social cohesion and civil courage in the long term.
* Furthermore, alleviating labor shortages in these areas. Some rural fire brigades can no longer move out because they can't get a team together; people doing community service are missing in the social sector since compulsory military service was suspended in 2011; fewer people opt for social professions because they never came into contact with them; possibility of recruiting regular soldiers for the German Armed Forces.
* Giving something back to society after 9 to 12 years of schooling and then vocational training or studies.
* Taking responsibility for society and gaining important experience for life.
* A lot of disorientation after school and choosing a career, therefore getting to know other areas, discovering possible interests (practical work, technology, armed forces, social services, nursing) that one would not have recognized might make sense.
* Alliance partners (NATO) expect each member state to contribute (actually 2% GDP) to military security, which Germany is often criticized to not meet.
* It would be 6-12 months corresponding to the classical Gap-Year and would be with a length of for example 9 months even well compatible with a Gap-Year (could be followed by an internship the usual traveling before starting training or studying).

&amp;#x200B;

**Further questions** about the implementation:

* Perhaps an EU-wide solution would be useful and necessary, and this would strengthen the sense of community not only at national level.
* The fairness would have to be preserved, which was not the case towards the end (2011) of compulsory military service in Germany, so avoiding the year of service should be very difficult.
* Consider whether there should be the possibility of paying a significant tax, e.g. 15% (possibly even progressively) on the respective income for 10 years from the start of employment. This possibility should appear relatively unattractive and not allow the wealthy to avoid the year of service.

&amp;#x200B;

**What other advantages and disadvantages do you see? Criticize the proposal and the arguments! How would you organize it? Are you pro or contra?**

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance and I am looking forward to a good discussion!"

I'm finishing my Junior year studying Informatics at Indiana University. It's not a traditional CS degree, and I actually just switched my major to it about a year and a half ago. Since then I've gotten more into coding and would like to go into some sort of software development role. 

The problem is this summer is my last chance to get an internship before graduating, and I feel as though it snuck up on me before I could get enough experience. In addition, I've lived more than 1000 miles from any family for several years and I'm going to be a new uncle soon, so I would like to be near them for the summer. This limits the companies that I can apply to.

IU offers an alternative capstone experience that can be taken during my senior year, but I'm wondering if it's going to be as valuable as a real internship. Should I just bite the bullet and apply all over in the hopes of landing something, or will I be ok after graduation as long as I put in the time to improve my skills?"
b63qj9,0,2019-03-27,Too early to consider academia?,yogurtthe2nd,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/b63qj9/too_early_to_consider_academia/,"I'm currently a sophomore doing a double major in electrical engineering and computer engineering. Recently, I've been thinking about pursuing a career in academia, specifically professorship. Admittedly, my primary motivation is that I've been told that I'm a good teacher, and I honestly do enjoy teaching others and seeing that ""spark"" when a concept finally clicks and everything makes sense to them. I don't have any research experience, but I'm willing to seek out undergraduate research opportunities to get a feel for it.

&amp;#x200B;

And speaking of research, I've done my research on the prospects of academia. I acknowledge that it's a serious commitment, and that getting a job in academia is never guaranteed, especially depending on the field. I know that there's a lot of competition among candidates in order to stand out from the rest, and it can be mentally taxing to keep up. I understand that I may not end up with a ""dream"" job with ideal conditions, and that it may take time before I secure a well-paid position.

&amp;#x200B;

And above all, I am aware that I'm still young in my college career. I still have two years left, and there's always a demand for electrical/computer engineers in industry. I'll be doing an internship at a notable company this summer, so I can definitely leverage that if I want to get a career in industry. Academia seems like a field that would really resonate well, with me, though. However, I don't want to be naive and set myself up for disappointment, either. Is it too early to be considering this career path?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: For those who say that it is too early, what sort of experience would you recommend for a student seeking to learn more about academia? At what point in your life did you ultimately decide to be an academic?"

The thing is, most data science/analytics internships have hefty requirements and I cannot learn or do enough to find something for this summer.

My knowledge base is basically dead-on for what they're doing. I've done research, internships, and hobby projects that gave me a huge amount of extremely relevant experience, so I think I could be a great asset.

I found another possible job, but if I quit I have to pay back a relocation fee I can't afford. Do I apply to jobs now and hope I get fired at the end of my probation, or just wait it out? 


Hi all, I'm a recent college graduate and would really like some advice,

I recently took a great job out of college for a big company after loving my internship experience with them. Been with the company since 08/2018. After accepting, I realized my actual job was nothing like my internship. I was the only one in my location, and had a rote data entry job that doesnt utilize any of my strengths, and I can go days without social interaction. This job is making me depressed, anxious and stressed. 

The problem is I moved across the country to accept this position and accepted a sign on bonus and relocation check that I currently can't pay back. (I have to repay in full if I resign within two years).

Two of my bosses have quit, I have minimal trainings and have been making a lot of mistakes the higher-ups are catching. So, they recently put me on a performance improvement plan where I can be terminated at anytime, but the plan ends in 6 weeks. I honestly felt happy, because being fired for non-misconduct means I don't have to pay them back money i already put towards student loans. 

I've found a few other jobs I'd love to apply to, and a friend on my rugby team has passed on my resume to his company (a dream job for me) and will set me up with an interview.  

If I'm offered another job now before I'm fired, I can't afford to pay back the relocation and I would have to turn them down. Is my only option to wait until I get fired to begin applying?

I worked for a moving company and as a bouncer in college (math/econ major), and wouldn't have a problem with going back to this during the job search. I just can't handle the isolation and monotomy of this current one. 

Thanks a lot for your help "

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah

Let me start from the beginning

I’m a fresh graduate with a high GPA And there’s a lot of companies I’m dreaming about working for, I’ve been applying for a month after my graduation but no one return my email

Last week one of my dream companies called me! They asked me for a job interview and I went today Questions were good and it was my major in college and what sort of courses I’ve taken and my internship and I’m doing fine until one of the interviewers pointed out something at my CV

It says that I did blah blah blah in “November 2019” while what I meant is “February 2019”

They asked me what’s the year are we in and how I could I do something in “November 2019”

My confidence crushed at that moment and everything after that was horrible including the question “why should we hire you?”

I don’t think they’ll call me again and I hate myself really How the hell could I make a mistake like that? And how could they trust me with their documents and work and all that? Even if a miracle happen and they calls me back I don’t think I’ll work for them

It’s embarrassing and I hate myself

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I screwed up my job interview with the company I've been dreaming about for a long time, ""how?"" you may ask

by writing the wrong month: instead of ""February 2019"" I wrote ""November 2019"""

Need advice,teardrop503,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b68t6d/not_sure_if_i_should_accept_this_offer_need_advice/,"A little bit of context. I will graduate in December this year so I have been actively looking for an internship to fill in the gap of summer.

Recently I got an offer from a large company that’s relatively close to where I live. The pay is good compares to other companies within the same area but problems are it'll be a year long and start date is before summer. If I accept it, I will have to do part time school and my graduation will be extended further.

Another thing is it’s not a software job. Job description does ask for knowledge of C++/Java/Python/SQL but from what I've seen after an onsite tour, it's a computer hardware related job for most part. I will have to do hardware rework, hardware testing, system imaging, and soldering components for most of the time. 

I want to continue to go to school full time and graduate soon so I’m thinking of declining the offer. On the other hand, my family and friends who know about this all want me to take it because it’s from a reputable company (top 50 in fortune 500) and also because I have no prior internship experience. Only job I had before this was an IT support job during my sophomore year.

I'm still applying around for a software internship atm. Most of the places are local and won’t call back for interviews until the beginning/middle of April.

So here are my questions:

1. Should I accept the offer and go to work for some time then later quit if I found a summer internship that fit me? Is that an ok thing to do? Would that leave me a bad reputation with the company?

2. Considering if you have no prior internship experience at all, would you take this chance and extend your graduation further out?"

b696te,2,2019-03-27,"My father is 65 and, including his 1.5 hour (RT) commute, works roughly 70 hours a week at the office and spends plenty of time on weekends working on his computer.",WouldLoveSomeAdvice8,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b696te/my_father_is_65_and_including_his_15_hour_rt/,"Ultimately, I'm looking for how to handle broaching the subject of asking him to step back a bit and live life. I'll elaborate (too much) on everything below.

I feel I need to give a small disclaimer in that I understand many people in the US need to work hours like this just to survive. While I think nobody should be subjected to 70-hour workweeks, I don't want this to be a debate about how much one should have to work. This is more about his age and health, and his seeming refusal to do anything that might make him have to work slightly fewer hours in the week.

My dad is a civil engineer who writes proposals to secure contracts for a firm that constructs railroad-related things. My little brother had an internship at the office years ago, and he said that everyone in the office thinks my father is crazy with the amount of time he works. My father has said he rewrites virtually every proposal that is submitted to him by his employees because ""they aren't right."" Now, since I was a kid, he has been getting up at about 4:30 to leave the house by 5:00 and catch the 5:15am train. On a ""normal"" day, he takes a 5:47pm train to get home at 6:30, which he misses roughly half the time, making him get home at 6:45. So the ideal situation, he's only out of the house 13.25 hours a day. About every other day, he calls my mother and says he's going to have to stay late, which usually means he'll get home at 9:30. So half the time, he's out of the house from 5:00AM-9:30PM. My mother told me he recently finished a project for which in a 2 week period he stayed late 8/10 workdays and worked basically all day both weekends. So he finished that project, and then his third day back at work, he's already staying late again for some new project.

He doesn't get bonuses for these projects. They're all part of his normal, salaried position. I believe his official workweek is supposed to be 8:00-5:30, 5 days a week, and the extra time he puts in is entirely of his own doing, just to get the job done

Now, if he wasn't the man I know to be my father, I'd probably assume something shady going on, like an affair or an addiction or something, but I'd be SHOCKED if anything like that was happening. Plus, I have verification from my brother that he did,  indeed, spend all of this time working about 8 years ago, so I assume it's still true today.

My father is fairly overweight and is starting to have orthopedic problems. He's ridden his bike to the train station pretty regularly for most of his life, but outside of that, he gets almost no exercise. I'd guess he spends 12ish hours every day sitting in front of a computer. He's lucky to not have any serious health issues, but his blood pressure and other medical numbers have in the last few years gotten worse.

I could go on with more details of his life, but anyone who is reading to this point probably gets the gist. He's a pretty obsessive worker. It is a huge point of contention between him and my mom, who recently mostly retired and only works 10ish hours a week at a place where she used to work. When I'm at their house at holidays and such, the 2-3 times per week call saying he'll be late is as laughable as it is frustrating. Every time, it's, ""This project is almost done. As soon as we finish this, there will be a break."" And there never is.

I'm just worried about him. I'm worried that if he ever does retire, he'll be in such a condition that he won't be able to enjoy it. He loves riding his bike, and he loves travelling, but he keeps complaining about ""stiffness"" getting worse and he limps sometimes. And I know anyone can drop dead at any time, and they won't know what they're missing at that point, but it seems a shame that someone who spent his whole life working obsessively for a giant company and getting next to no recognition won't get to enjoy something like retirement... even if that's taking a few months to travel the world and then going back to working, or volunteering. And I feel for my mother who also worked her whole life and now doesn't have anyone who lives at home except her husband, who is gone almost all the time, and when he is home, he passes out the minute he sits down. 

So if anyone has read to this point, I ask: how can I approach him? He gets really touchy about the subject. The biggest fights I've heard about him and my mother fighting have been about this. I am a musician and lead a really different, weird life of alternating working constantly and not having work, and I can't make any comparisons. My parents have been unbelievably supportive of me and paid my undergrad and more recently took on my loans from grad school so that I could pay them back with a better interest rate. I don't want to seem ungrateful at all, and although I don't think he'd take it that way, the few times I've made any comments about his work being too much, he has gotten really touchy. Has anyone else experienced something like this, either with a relative or friend? Is it appropriate for me to speak up?

TL;DR - My father just turned 65 and works roughly 70 hours a week, plus much of the weekend on his computer. He's starting to have orthopedic problems and is overweight. My parents' financial situation is not such that they him to be working, so he COULD retire, but he is showing no signs that that will ever happen, and it's putting a strain on his and my mom's relationship. Do you have any advice on how I can talk to him about this? I know peoples' work is often tied to their identity, and it clearly is in this case, but I know that he does, in theory, want to do things like travelling and other retirement-like activities. "

EDIT : Disguised*


I'm a Mechatronics final year student at one of the mediocre colleges here. My parents are middle class folks who have always supported and encouraged me for further studies. They always said  ""You study as much as you want without worrying about the financial aspects, we will take care of that"" but always in a passive aggressive way. 

So abiding by that single sentence, in my sophomore year I decide that I'll do a Master's and then a PhD. I made up my mind that I won't look for a job or anything since I'll be going for higher studies. Keeping that in mind I spent the next 2 years making sure that I have a "" research oriented"" academic profile. You know, writing research papers, book chapters, research internship in France and yada yada. Last November I gave my GRE and stuff and got a 320+ score so I also opted out of my campus placements (not that they were any good anyway 5-6 lpa max) 

Last month I got into University of Maryland and Colorado School of Mines, which again are mediocre colleges at best. When I told my dad he said that it wasn't good enough and doesn't have money to put me through Graduate school. I was appalled. I mean all my college life he told me to focus on studying further regardless of anything. I opted out of placements, didn't give GATE just so I could focus on GRE and stuff. Now he wanted me to take a drop after college and give GATE to which I said NO without hesitation. After lot of yelling and fighting he said that he'll take up a loan or something for 1 year of my Master's degree. 

I don't have the temperament for GATE I know this much. I have no job options since I opted out of on- campus placements. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have no options left. I feel like such a failure in life. My dad never missed a chance to point out that I couldn't get into IIT so all my college life I worked my ass off just so I could make him happy. To show him that I'm worth something. You know, like I was happy when I got I'm to CSM and UMD, I felt like I accomplished something. I thought he'd be happy but when I told him he's like ""it's not good enough, I expected something like Stanford or so"". And then I realized myself that no matter what I do, how much I work, I'll never get past the mediocre line, I'll never be good enough.

Now, I feel bad for him taking a loan for my education. I mean what's the point of going from one mediocre college to another mediocre college. And also, now I'm constantly worried about the ""what ifs"" and other things. What if I don't get a good job? What if I couldn't adjust to the American education system? What if I don't get a TA or RA-ship? What if I can't contribute to paying off the student loans? Is it worth spending 35 lakhs per annum for a Masters program? Earlier, I had everything laid out : I'll do a Master's from a good University and become a PhD student at the same University. Now, all my plans are ruined now since I have to worry about getting a good paying job. I am just so fed up of thinking the same thing over and over and over again for the last couple of weeks. And it's not like I can talk it out with my parents bc we don't talk much about how we feel.  I don't know what I should do, I don't know how should I feel. I'm just so scared of the unknown and the what ifs. I feel nothing more than a liability to my family.

b6aa0g,17,2019-03-27,"Why I am most likely going to turn down a T20 for a T200 (not a shitpost, and not for monetary reasons)",throwawayfsdfsdf,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b6aa0g/why_i_am_most_likely_going_to_turn_down_a_t20_for/,"I am going to be pretty general because I do not want to be recognized, but I have gotten into both a T20 and a T200 school. Yet, I am turning down the T20 school for the T200. You may be wondering why this is. It is not due to money (money is a VERY important thing to consider though, keep that in mind), and this is not a shitpost. This scenario may not apply to many of you guys at all, since I am interested in a relatively niche area, but the T200 school is just much better for my future career. I am sure this scenario does apply to some of you out there though, especially those who are interested in a relatively niche area like I am (I say relatively because it is still a very large area of study. It is projected to bring in over 950 billion dollars worldwide within the next 5 years. This area of study is just not that popular on A2C for whatever reason). Without being too specific, I will say that my area of interest lies in a particular part of agriculture. The T20 does not even come close to having the same amount of research opportunities or facilities related to my area of study. It is not even close. The T20 does not even have any facilities related to my area of study as far as my research has shown. At first, when I got the acceptance from the T20, I was certain that I was going there. Even now, I sometimes think to myself ""But wouldn't it be really impressive to go to the T20? Nobody cares about the T200 school, but the T20 is very well known. I mean c'mon, it's \*insert well known T20\*"". What I have realized is that prestige does nothing for me if I cannot even conduct much research in my area of study. It means nothing if I cannot take the same number of classes which are directly related to my area of interest. It means nothing if there are no facilities for me to gain experience with. It means nothing if the professors do not have as good of industry connections. If I went to the T20, I would graduate with pretty much no experience specifically related to my area of study (ignoring summer internships). That's just a terrible idea. Prestige is great and all, it is not great enough to make up for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is a pretty unique problem. The only reason I even applied to the T20 in the first place is because I applied there thinking I wanted to study engineering. I did not change my mind on what I wanted to study until a couple of weeks after I submitted the application. If you get anything out of this story, I would just say that you should remember to take non-ranked things into account. Think about what both schools offer you that cannot be directly linked to rankings. If you \*are\* going to care about prestige and rankings, start by looking at the rankings for your particular area of study. If the overall prestige of the school is great, but the program you are interested in is mediocre, then why would you choose the prestigious school?

b6ap4g,1,2019-03-27,Got an internship offer but not sure if I should accept it. Need advice,teardrop503,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/b6ap4g/got_an_internship_offer_but_not_sure_if_i_should/,"A little bit of context. I will graduate with a CS degree in December this year so I have been actively looking for an internship to fill in the gap of summer.

Recently I got an offer from a large company that’s relatively close to where I live. The pay is good compares to other companies within the same area but problems are it'll be a year long and start date is before summer. If I accept it, I will have to do part time school and my graduation will be extended further.

Another thing is I want a software job but this job is more hardware focus. Job description does ask for knowledge of C++/Java/Python/SQL but from what I've seen after an onsite tour, it's a computer hardware related job for most part. I will have to do hardware rework, hardware testing, system imaging, and soldering components for most of the time.

I want to continue to go to school full time and graduate soon so I’m thinking of declining the offer. On the other hand, my family and friends who know about this all want me to take it because it’s from a reputable company (top 50 in fortune 500) and also because I have no prior internship experience. Only job I had before this was an IT support job during my sophomore year.

I'm still applying around for a software internship atm. Most of the places are local and won’t call back for interviews until the beginning/middle of April.

So here are my questions:

1. Should I accept the offer and go to work for some time then later quit if I found a summer internship that fit me? Is that an ok thing to do? Would that leave me a bad reputation with the company?

2. Considering if you have no prior internship experience at all, would you take this chance and extend your graduation further out?

Anybody know anything about this position? It seems to be more of a IT position but its still amazon which I guess would look good on a resume. Would any of you guys take this position even as a software dev?

Also anybody interview for this position yet? Have a virtual interview for it but literally have no idea what to expect, literally no information about this position online.

In addition to this, the city I want to move to is 2,500 miles away from where I currently live and grew up. I knew I was in a shitty position far in advance and 9 months ago I came to this sub for advice on landing a job in the Pacific North West region and what kind of salary I should be looking for. I basically got told my one commenter to fuck off for thinking I could expect to get a job paying 55k with no experience or connections.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I did get genuinely good advice from others and after applying for a ton of jobs with no responses decided maybe I should try to look for jobs around Michigan to build up experience before trying for a job on the West coast. I can't even tell you how many companies rejected me and I've been feeling pretty hopeless after only receiving one very subpar offer (where I currently work) after applying for over a year for every position I could. I wrote cover letters for every single application and leveraged my high GPA and school extracurriculars as much as I could in the hopes someone would care about something other than internships.

&amp;#x200B;

I still applied for a few jobs in Seattle and luckily it only takes one! I just received an offer to work at an awesome company in downtown Seattle with a starting salary of $62,000 and a $5,000 bonus for relocation. I applied to the job in January with a pre-recorded video interview and online assessment (it was basically an IQ test from what I remember). I pretty much forgot about it until last week I received an email to set up a phone call with the hiring manager. I only had one phone call with her where we talked purely about my experience, my drive, and why I want to work there. I was never asked any technical questions and that was my only interaction before I received the offer. I worked hard to get myself through school and succeed without having summer internship experience and she saw that and decided to take a chance on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I really can't believe it, my dreams are actually coming true! This is the best outcome I could have hoped for. I hope this inspires those of you without jobs to KEEP APPLYING, even when it's hard as hell. You have no idea who may think you're a good fit for their company!

I just moved to USA (NW suburbs from Chicago, IL) from Europe and would like to know a little bit more about Computing Science work market in US.

Little info about me:

I graduated in University of Technology as Bachelor in Computing Science in Poland. It's been 2+ years after studies and I've been working full time as a Full-stack Java Developer - Java Spring Boot + AngularJS (1yr 5months) and Java Developer - Spring Boot (10months). While studying I had part-time jobs for 4months and 10months in some R&amp;D and SQL roles as an intern.

Beside work I also created e-commerce project in Wordpress PHP + jQuery + Docker for extra money which helped me learning unix and devops stuff.

Do you have any advices what should I learn about work market in US, mainly:  
\- how to prepare to interviews,   
\- how much salary should I expect,  
\- how long does it take to get a job,  
\- how to dress for interview.

Any other tips, differences between European and US market would be perfect. 

I also read posts that there are lots of applicants who had problems finding job because there are so much candidates and recruitment process is very long. In EU it looks like it is much easier and quicker to find IT job.

I've been looking for about three weeks in dice, indeed, glassdoor, linkedin, roberthalf, careerbuilder etc and got only one job offer finalised from R-company which scammed me till the end that office is near my location and they actually wanted me to relocate (which I didn't want and told them at start). I also had few technical interviews but probably failed because they ghosted me or I got a feedback that they need somebody more experienced.

I need tips for 2+ years exp java dev from europe to get into US market and find job asap"

Any advice?,2PacnotDead,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/b6d4ci/first_engineering_job_and_i_am_thinking_of/,Sorry if this is too long. So I got my first internship/ job this week since graduation last May. Only 3 of us currently work there and I am the only embedded software engineer. So there really isn’t anyone who can help me when I am stuck. My boss handed me a project that a previous worker had started but he left the company. Now I am trying to go through all his work and there isn’t any clear documentation. His code is not well commented and he used a bunch of libraries. The project is to send commands to a motor with a phone app using Bluetooth BLE. He made a custom board with a nRF52 micrcontroller chip that has the Bluetooth capability. It then sends the commands using UART to the motor which then sends data back to the micro controller which then displays is on an OLED display and also sends data back to the phone through Bluetooth. I have never used BLE so I am stuck with that and another problem I have is I don’t know what data is the motor sending back. I would have to know what data the motor sends back to properly use it correct? Also I don’t know what data is sent over through Bluetooth when a command is sent to the motor. There is no documentation on the motor. When I asked about it he said it’s just troubleshooting and testing that needs to be done to find what data gets sent. Is that true? I would have thought that I would need to know before hand. Anyways I’m just debating know whether to stay or not because he said first two weeks are unpaid and after that he’ll pay me around 18 if he decides to keep me. I took this job because it was the only thing I was able to find and I just really wanted some type of opportunity in my career.

b6e9h4,16,2019-03-28,I want to relocate across the country AND start in a new field without experience at almost 30 years old. All by the end of summer. Am I insane? How can this be done?,SalesToMarketing,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b6e9h4/i_want_to_relocate_across_the_country_and_start/," 

Maybe I’m going about this too hardcore. After this year’s winter, I refuse to live in Chicago another year.

I say this every year, but I’m especially deadset on it this time.

But what will make things much more complicated is that not only am I applying for jobs in warmer areas of the country, but they’re all marketing roles.

I’m in inside sales right now and I’m just not happy in this role. It’s not my company, it’s the job itself.

I’m sick of prospecting, dealing with unhappy customers, negotiating pricing, stress over hitting goal every month. I’ve never hit it in my current role, but I have in other roles.

I want to do something in marketing and I’m sure I can land something around here.

Personally, I want to be a copywriter. I’ve done a little bit of freelance work but nothing major.

I could probably land a job around here, but I’m not looking around here. I don’t want to be seen as a job hopper.

I’ve been in my role two years, and I don’t want to work at a company for just a few months. I want to be there a while.

That’s why I’m not applying locally. Maybe I’m shooting myself in the foot by handling it this way.

There’s not much advice out there regarding switching career AND location at the same time. Just one or the other.

Maybe an internship around here for a few months might be a good idea, but I’m almost 30 years old and most of them are for college students only.

I've only just started applying last month. 30 applications. Not even a phone interview. 

TLDR - Any advice for switching careers AND seeking relocation at the same time?"

b6gb8f,45,2019-03-28,I'm not sure how I can boost my chances of getting employment because I have no previous work experience and I'm not very young,TulaLuLaLeeey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b6gb8f/im_not_sure_how_i_can_boost_my_chances_of_getting/,"I'm currently finishing up my first year of my MSc in industrial engineering. I’m 25 and have 0 work experience. I make money by either tutoring people or freelance translation since I’m bilingual. I’m very worried for my future. School takes up a lot of my time, and because I really want to pursue it further (meaning, doing a PhD.) I don’t want to jeopardize my chances. I don’t particularly want to be a professor, but since I have experience with teaching, and frankly enjoy it I am fine if that happens to be my future. The reason I want to pursue a PhD is that I really enjoy academia. Most people think studying is hard, and boring; but I actually enjoy learning and figuring things out and although I agree that it’s hard, I find the work very rewarding and enjoyable. It's just that if I go for it right after my MSc, I'll be a 31 year old with a PhD and no job experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I still worry, because I keep thinking that I’m going to have no job experience at my age and that makes me un-hirable. (even if I want to get a job right away). It’s fine if your first job is at the age of 18, or 21. It’s a different story if you’re 26 and just starting that journey. What’s even scarier is that there seems to be no jobs for someone with my background that I like. I didn’t want to pursue math because it was too theoretical and I wanted something more practical, and the closest thing to math with practical application was IE. Now that I’m in it, IE seems like a lot of business or manufacturing, and to be honest I don’t think I have a future in either. Business isn’t bad, it’s just not what I had in mind. I wanted more of an analytical, hands-on, problem solving type of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been researching things for a while, and about two years ago came across Data Science. I’m not exaggerating when I say that every single person I know from my undergrad (those doing Math/Stats) and in my graduate studies is looking to be a data scientist. People don’t even know what it really is, but they want it because it truly seems like there’s nothing else you can be if you’re studying Math, statistics, IE. A Computer scientist can be anything s/he wants to from a web developer to a very cool AI engineer who’s programming autonomous cars. We sort of have no option, you’ll either get into project management and business side of things or you choose to work in factories and if you don’t like any of that, you can choose the vaguest path that isn’t really related to IE and be a data scientist. Just because we know statistics, business and optimization.

&amp;#x200B;

So for the past two years I’ve been taking data science courses here and there (data camp, coursera, edX, etc) and learning python. I got a job a while back as a data scientist just by finishing the data analytics track on data camp, but soon realized I was not ready and quit after only a month. (Also, my classes didn’t line up with work and I had to choose). I don’t want a job for the money, not yet, I want it because I don’t want to be behind everyone else. My plan is to stop watching videos, and start doing the things I’ve been reading/watching videos about. Build a portfolio, apply for at least internships for this summer and get at least a part time job as a data scientist/analyst. I only have 2 classes left to take for my 3rd semester, so I will for sure be able to work part time.

&amp;#x200B;

But then again, I’m worried that with the majority of people in the field doing the same thing that I won’t be able to do this. There are a lot of computer scientists going for this job as well, a lot of statisticians, and people who’ve paid for fancy degrees and bootcamps. (I can't pay for those things) I have done nothing to stand out, and don’t even have previous experience, and I’m not young enough to justify that in any way. It’s very scary when almost everyone you meet is fighting for the same thing you are, and you’re very aware of that. Instead of fueling me, this is discouraging to me. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, and I’ve been able to get jobs before and I can start at the bottom (which I’m willing to), it’s still really scary though.

So, I guess I have to ask the question: What should I do to stand out? Should I borrow money, and sign up for those bootcamps? Should I completely change gears and find something else to do? (like, web development) Should I stop focusing on getting a job and go for a PhD in the hopes that I might get a job as a professor?"

I've applied to atleast 50 internships in the past 2-3 months but so far I've only had one interview (insert bruh sound clip) which itself was a production line thing (rejected lol). My goal would be to get into a position related to IC design or design in general with a company like Intel orClearpath. In terms of experience I've had 2 two month long (very) informal internships related to HVAC, electronic door locks and safes. A lot of people I know have been struggling to find something as well. I've been thinking of doing some online courses related to AutoCAD and Altium but at the same time I've been thinking of focussing on learning basic dev skills as well like SQL etc. I've been reading about FPGAs and VHDL as well and it seems pretty interesting as well. Lemme know what yall think
p.s I can code in Coldfire assembly, C, C++ and Python (and Matlab if that counts)

*edit: Is there a way to gain experience and qualifications other than clubs?"

If I did this option I could also take some certificate programs afterwards to help beef up my resume if needed.

Along with doing side projects and possibly an internship would it be possible to land a Junior position? Is getting a Bachelor's degree the only option? There's a bunch of reasons why I wouldn't want to get a CS degree but that's not worth going into. "

I live in the Augusta, GA area and I've applied to well over 50 software development internships for the summer, including quite a few out-of-state. I've only gotten two callbacks.

I've read that breaking in to the software development industry is the most difficult thing about it, but once you're in, you're pretty much golden. My concern is that if I'm already having problems getting into it now, and I'm having to apply to summer internships states away from where I live, how much of a shot do I really have at finding a position immediately out of school? I own a house, and am a military veteran, and I use the housing allowance the G.I. Bill provides to pay for the mortgage. Once I'm out of school though, that goes away, so I pretty much have to come out the gate running.

My experiences are limited to what school has taught me, so language-wise, I'm only really familiar with C#, C++, some Java, SQL, and Python. Portfolio-wise, I only have the odds-and-ends stuff I've built with Python and C# on my spare time, but otherwise that's about it. I was hoping to develop my portfolio more by getting an entry level job while still in school, but right now I don't think that's a viable option.

Any tips on things I can do now to (a) get an internship for the summer, and (b) make myself much more marketable in general, especially once I graduate?

I'm sure this question pops up all the time, so I apologize if this has been asked before."

b6ilav,2,2019-03-28,About College...,Elizarah,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/b6ilav/about_college/,"This is gonna be a long rant but I need to get this off my chest.
Y'all I'm *pissed*. All my life, since I was a *toddler* my parents drilled into my head that college is the only way to getting around in life. The key to success. The only way to ensure you will not be on the streets (literally their words). They told me that if I didnt go to college, they would kick me out and I'll be homeless (So obviously any kid would be like, ""yeah of course I'll go to college, it sounds silly not to""). Fast forward to me being 18. In high school, everyone, every teacher is drilling university this and university that, ""you won't make it unless you go to a university"". So I get into uni. I find out the tuition is like $15k/year (I pick ""cheaper"" one). I'm thinking... fuck I'm 18. Where am I gonna get $15k a *year*? I ask my mom and she tells me I need to take out a loan. And I'm like... TF is a loan? (I was sheltered af, guys. I wasn't allowed to see friends except for once a month. I wasn't allowed to go to church with friends. I wasn't allowed to breathe with certain friends. My parents were strict af. I had just learned what S&amp;M meant and it was because of that song) so we go online. We do ""FAFSA"" (fuck fafsa..) and it's asking what my *mom* makes a year. Like.... why do you care? She's not paying for this. I am. We get a loan through Sallie Mae. Don't ever go through Sallie Mae. The loan is at *10* percent. I told my mom that sounds really high for a loan and she reassured me ""no no, that's the smallest percentage on a loan anyone can get"". And my blind, faithful-to-my-mother self believed her. 😠
So now I'm in my second year of college. Needing to do FAFSA (fuck fafsa..) And again keeps asking for my mom's damn earnings.. she already told me that she refuses to pay for my college cause it's too expensive. I'm 19, how the hell can *I* afford it? So we see some new loan options at like 3% and 4%. I'm pissed. 10% was not a low amount. I fuckin knew it was a high amount. Around my junior year, I asked her (now I'm at 50k/60k in debt cause the tuition kept rising every damn year I was there) if she had originally thought about paying for my college? She and my father (divorced which is why my mom is only around) drilled college into my head like a machine. They constantly told me it was the only way. And when you're a kid, who is not allowed to see people/friends except for once a month, you believe your parents. So I had to know. They've been talking up this college life since I was a toddler. Did they not *know* the price? Did they not *care* to save up? So you know what her response was? 😡 ""We had your whole college entirely in savings. But one day, your father took it to the Casino and lost all of it"" 😡😠 later in life she also added ""we didn't think you were going to be smart enough to get into college"" 😡 what. The fuck. It was already bad enough to blow it all at the casino but way to add insult to injury.
I tried making college cheap y'all. I got an apartment with my S.O and I was told we would be splitting the cost. Making it like $250/month to live there while living on campus was like $775/month. But then his dad told him he wasn't allowed to help me 🙂 thus making me pay $500/month. Plus WiFi. Plus bills. Plus groceries. Being more than $775/month. 🙄 (mini rant in bigger rant).
By time a graduated (5 years cause major changed) I got into $90k in debt. I also had to go to the hospital my sophomore/junior year and my mom said she paid it off, but to my surprise she didn't and she told me to pay it off so it's more like $93k in debt. And I'm 23. I'm a software engineer making $55k/year and about to get married. I had one internship when I was 22 and I used all the money I made to help pay for my tuition and I worked part time to help pay for groceries and trying to live. Over the summer if I didnt have an internship, I worked over night at Wal-Mart and at one point I had two jobs trying to save as much as I could. My mom was constantly kicking me out of her house over very petty things like my brother stole something of mine, I confronted him, he admitted it, I got kicked out (?). It was like that every other week. It was exhausting, which is why I got the apartment cause it was *supposed* to be cheaper than living on campus. Anyways... 
My rant is about how my parents brainwashed me to thinking this was the only way. It wasn't till I started my Software Engineering job (where I can talk to people more than once a month) where I learned that some people got to where they are at with certificates. CERTIFICATES? I was told for ever that certificates don't do anything for you. I'm so pissed guys!
I'm in $90k in debt. At 23 years old...
Oh, and to boot. I could have graduated high school a year early. My parents received that in the mail and didn't tell me because they didn't want me to leave yet 😐😑. They didn't want me going to a community college part time in high school, because it ""wouldn't do anything for me"". I kept telling them it would give me college credit and my high school had a deal where if you were in high school, you could go to this community college for free and get college credit. *for free and get college credit*. I'm looking back and I'm wondering ""Did they just hate me?"" They thought I wasn't smart enough to get into college. They blew my college savings for a *casino*. They told me college was the only way. They told me I wasn't allowed to see my friends except for once a month. 
I'm livid. I'm glad a big handful of you all knew college was a scam. But I had the lovely parents of keeping me away from everyone and brainwashing me to think it was the only way. *NOW* my mom says that the price was my fault. I didn't qualify for any scholarship and I couldn't get anyone to talk about any scholarship that I could qualify for. 
The cards were heavily not in my favor.
So here I am. At 23 years old. With $90k in debt. Yeah, you can call me stupid. But I bet you were allowed to talk to people more than I was. I bet you had someone to tell you there was another option out there. And I know several other college students in my boat. Fooled by our parents... Boomers. 
My fiancé was also screwed over like me. He was also told that college was the only way. His was even weirder though. His parents screamed and yelled at him, threw objects at him if he wanted to go into a tech field. They told him *insurance* was the only way. His dad is an insurance agent and makes about $100k/year. But it took him 10+ years to earn that. He had to start from scratch. FH (future husband) went to school for Marketing   so he could learn the ways of how to sell to people. Which, college didn't teach him that. They taught the *theory* of how to sell. So he graduated with $30k in debt. Apparently his dad said he would pay for half of FH's college. Lucky ducky. But when FH started insurance, he hated it. But he was told that he was yelled at when he told his parents he didn't want to continue the family business. It wasn't till I talked to his parents about how depressed he is about his job that they finally came to their senses. So he go a cert and now he's doing I.T. and he's much happier but with a degree that does him nothing. The kicker is that his parents brainwashed him to getting a degree. *Apparently* you don't even need a degree to do insurance, unlike what his father told him. They also didn't save any money for his college, either. So not only was he brainwashed, but going to college the entire time for insurance was for no reason. He could have started it when he graduated high school at 18. Learned he didn't like and start IT years ago.
So the next time you see someone complaining about their student debt. Maybe look at the parents who brainwashed their kids. Blew their college fund. And giving us a head start in the complete opposite direction."
b6imcm,2,2019-03-28,Need Advice,pkcurbstomp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b6imcm/need_advice/,"Hello, I'm a junior Computer Science major and I'm just feeling lost and depressed. 

I got a great opportunity last October - working on-campus with an atmospheric research lab. The problem is, everything I've contributed to the job comes out to nothing. The database I worked to design - a simpler method of storage turned out better all-around. The automated visualization script I contributed (which spits out static images based on data) - ""Oh we wanted something more like this"" \*shows a beautiful, interactive real-time webpage graph\*. My bosses (the professors leading the research) are not computer science, so I am without direction and mentorship in coding, which I feel I need as I have not yet had an internship. 

Wanting to be useful, I volunteered to do machine learning-based research, but I have virtually no experience in ML (my data sci class is going through some basic concepts now, but this type of research seems overwhelming to me). I know that a good programmer is able to learn things and adapt...but with my other schoolwork, and the fact that I'm not even interested in the research side of programming (as a career), I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

I'm hesitant to leave the job because it's a great opportunity, but every few weeks, I get incredibly depressed and doubtful of my ability to preform well in this field. I'm considering dropping the job and focusing on school until summer. It's most likely too late to land an internship, but if I can't do that, I was thinking about working on personal projects that I personally would find more motivating.

b6iskp,1,2019-03-28,Should I take this internship?,rozuhero,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b6iskp/should_i_take_this_internship/,"Hello guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I am somewhat torn about whether I should take this internship or not. I am 22F and got an offer to be an intern for a company to learn and develop for amazing gear. It would certainly help to better my coding skills, and they even offered to do my final thesis with them. However, this is in the summer vacation and 40 hours a week, meaning that after this semester ends (I am a master student) I would immediately begin working there.

&amp;#x200B;

The internship offers a nice opportunity to learn what I am interested in, and the people I will be working with are really kind. The only thing I am worried about is that I may overwork myself or work myself to the point of burnout if I accept the offer. It may sound selfish or spoiled, but I am thinking out of a perspective of self care, I am still very grateful I got such an offer in the first place. I do get a paid week off to go on vacation with my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Could someone please give me some advice on this? I feel like this time (before they are completely done with their student life) is crucial for preparation for entering the work field. And if I pass this up, I may not get such a chance again."

The school is partnered with a program that allows young people to pursue internships. I do plan on applying and interviewing for the few accounting/ book keeping or HR positions available. I also work part time in retail and am training for a supervisor position for when I turn 18. Is a 3 month internship and 2-3 years of retail supervisory experience enough to land me an entry level job in a professional field?

I also plan on taking a class on either Java or Python through the community college and becoming certified in it. The more I research Python the more I understand that companies treat it like a tool which is why I would like to become knowledgeable on the language. I'm hoping that learning either language will make me stand out against others.

I do plan on pursuing a bachelors degree in my field but not right out of high school. I am worried that just an associates degree wont be enough in such competitive fields. Do you guys have any advice? Is there anything you would do differently? I am trying to make the best with what I am offered.

Monitor and manage backups. Setup and manage WAPs in our Meraki system.

Would the above experience and training qualify me for a typical SysAdmin position? I'd prefer SysAdmin with a slant towards security, especially if they're willing to sponsor for a clearance. I'd like to get more involved with security, but I want more exposure before I start working down a specific path.

They said the internship stage only starts in early July. I said at the phone interview that I'd gladly accept it, only problem that it's a lot of time until then. They said get a temporary job unrelated to the field until then, eventually, which was exactly my thought. And they are going to call me at the end of June. Internship is great, because I have a totally different degree than CS, and wish to change my careers.

How do I know they will not forget about me until then?

Getting some time off the hunt for computer science related jobs and settle for something temporary would be a godsend for me. But I wouldn't want something to happen to cancel the whole thing. (that would be either them forgetting about me, or something else, anything.)  I am the type who constantly needs reassurance. I said yes at the end of the phone interview, I accept it. But that's it, I'll probably won't hear from then until end of June, if then.

&amp;#x200B;

Last thing I need is a few months passing working some random job, and not continuing the job hunt for programming during this time, that is, if I'll never hear from this company again.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Should i call them back once a month or so to ''remind'' them or for reassurance?

I would continue the job hunt, but I'm tired of being unemployed and I need some quick money. (as in in the few next days)

This past year I started a Master's program at a different school. The program does not require a thesis/research, but I decided that I wanted to do research anyways. Due to some personal reasons I delayed starting it a bit, but this upcoming quarter I'm gonna be starting research again at a new lab. I'd really like to do a great job at it this time, and would really like to co-author a publication (maybe even be first author on a publication if possible). The publications would really help if decided to go back for a PhD after going to industry for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, if you were pretty strong at research, how did you do it? What were the things that really made the difference between being an okay researcher to being a good/great one? What advice do you have for people like me who are looking to improve their research ability? And if you worked on a research project that you personally proposed, how did you do it? What are some common pitfalls that you noticed and how did you avoid them?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. If it matters, my specialty is in computer architecture/digital design, with a special interest in hardware accelerators and algorithm/architecture co-design."

b6kgnm,2,2019-03-28,Coffee chat culture in Germany?,r4utatientori,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/b6kgnm/coffee_chat_culture_in_germany/,"Edit: ok seems like this isn't common in Germany. Thanks for the feedback :)

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! I am moving to Germany in a few months to do an internship (hooray!). I'm having trouble figuring out if coffee chat culture exists in Germany (maybe I am not Googling the correct keywords), so I'll just ask on here. If it makes a difference, I'll be working in Cologne. Where I'm from in the USA, it's common to go on coffee chats for professional development/networking. I want to know if this exists in Germany, and if so, what is the proper etiquette?

The process I am accustomed to is as follows:

* first I'll search for people with interesting jobs in my city (e.g. ""data scientist"" near ""San Francisco""), and I'll find their LinkedIn profile.
* Then, I can usually guess their company email, so I'll email them like ""Hello, I saw on your LinkedIn profile that you are working as a data scientist in SF. I'm a student looking to break into this field and would love to hear your experiences. Would you be willing to have a chat over coffee sometime over the next few weeks? ..."" Usually around 10-20% of people will respond.
* Then I usually meet them at a cafe on the weekdays after work, like 5-6pm. Afterwards, the person might recommend 1-2 of his colleagues for me to contact, so the cycle continues

Does this process exist in Germany? Also, my level of German is not sufficient enough, so I'll probably be speaking in English, so would anyone be willing? I usually pitch myself as a student looking for guidance, so usually I get some good career/life advice, and occasionally they will recommend me for an opening in their company."
b6kn8o,1757,2019-03-28,Its not all about 0’s and 1’s,darrenalmo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/b6kn8o/its_not_all_about_0s_and_1s/,"Last week, I accepted an internship at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. Never in my life have I accomplished anything to this magnitude. It might sound like I’m bragging but after all I’ve gone through to get to this point, I’m just damn proud of myself. 

Its Important to note that I’ve always seen myself as way below par of what an engineering student was. I’ve always lacked the natural talent that many of my classmates have. In high school, I took no AP classes as my counselors strongly advised me not to. I had a very average gpa coming out of high school with very basic school and non challenging classes. I managed to get into NJIT, a very decent engineering school, through athletics. This meant the school only accepted me in order to have a better team, not through my academic merit. 

But once there, I quickly realized no one there believed in me. Professors started ignoring my requests to meet with them after classes due to hours of working on one problem that I just could not understand. I failed pre calc chemistry and ended my freshman year with a 2.8 gpa. I opted to withdraw from that school because there was just no professor willing to work with students at such a low level as myself. At that point I wanted to just quit. I thought that there was no hope for someone like me in this field. Thanks to my father, I was able to get back on my feet and give it another crack. 

Now I am at Hampton University where it is a very small engineering  (&lt;100 students) school. Here, I had the blessing of having an amazing professor for my digital electronics class. From the very first class he saw that I was slower than the rest of the kids but never looked down on me. This man really believed in me.

Rather than seeing me as hopeless, he drilled the fact that everyone starts at 0. He was the one that showed me that although we all may not be cut the same, we all have the ability within us to become something. He taught me that life isn’t just an easy elevator to success but rather it more of climbing a mountain. Some of us may be more equipped with fancy gear and whatnot which may lead to a quicker ascent but at the end of the day, we all have two feet that can get us to the top one way or another. Its all a matter of taking it one step at a time. We cant decide to just quit and turn around when our legs get tired. We must be relentless in our pursuit and have the belief in ourselves that we can get to the top. 

After finally realizing the strength of his words, I was able to stop comparing myself to my classmates and started understanding that I am on my own journey. Some journeys are more straight forward than others but there are also those that aren’t. This allowed me to see that engineers aren’t all clearcut geniuses. Engineers are those who are dedicated enough to see that although something ain’t right, there is always a way to make it right.

For those of you out there feeling like you dont belong or are inadequate, I say to you, you are much smarter than you think, you are more clever than you think, you are much much stronger than you think. One day you will find that its not all natural talent that will get you through. If you really have a passion for this, please please please dont ever give up because you hit more than a few road bumps and a flat tire. 

Just get out that car and keep walking till you get there. 

Edit: grammar

Edit: Thanks for the first gold friend! And thank you all for the kind words. I wanted to share my story because I felt that there were many out there like me who were passing on their true potential. I’m excited to see all the great things each and everyone of y’all are gonna accomplish in a few years time. 

Let these words always ring your in minds when you feel tired and broken: 

YOU GOT THIS

b6nzjp,623,2019-03-28,"One year ago, I thought about quitting CS and was told I would never fit in. Today, I finally received my first offer!",ZetaGundam20X,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b6nzjp/one_year_ago_i_thought_about_quitting_cs_and_was/,"Hi r/cscareerquestions,

About a year ago, I posted a link about failing in my courses and how I wasn't able to fit in CS  [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85m095/i\_have\_failed\_my\_intro\_to\_programming\_ii\_second/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/85m095/i_have_failed_my_intro_to_programming_ii_second/) 

After reading many of the comments both encouraging and discouraging (but regardless informative), I took a lot of that to heart and decided to turn my life around. I began learning Python again over the Summer to learn the core concepts of programming and ever since, I have improved in my classes and started to work on the lab assignments independently with help from great sources such as YouTube and StackOverflow. I have befriended many CS students which led me to be an active member of my Computer Science club. They have taught me a lot of valuable information such as knowing how to approach whiteboard problems as well as helping me understand important algorithms and data structures more deeply. I now also work at my University as a tutor teaching students in Math and Computer Science courses.  

As for the internship search, it took me more than 100 applications with a lot of trial and error and 7 months to eventually find a company that would accept me. The search ultimately taught me how to act professional in both behavioral and technical matters. 

Overall, I wish to thank the amazing community here for bringing me where I am at today. If I never heard from y'all's criticism, I would stay at the same place I was a year ago. As for the ones still looking for an internship, don't give up, don't give in, and never surrender. With every rejection, you are much closer to your goal than you were previously. I believe in you. 

I still have a long way to go, and I with this internship, I hope to learn new and exciting things that will further peak my interest into programming!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for everything.

I work on issues ranging from the standard ""why wont my mouse work"" to more moderately complex things such as sharepoint, a bit of software testing, and project management of various issues that take sometimes weeks to correct. As of right now this is my only technical experience besides a tiny side business of phone screen/PC repair.

My question is, will I be looked at adversely by employers because I never secured an internship, and instead opted for full-time employment over the summer? 
I worry that recruiters will see that it is a university role and assume it was the basic help desk on campus that helps students with basic issues, and I will be marked down. I also worry that the lack of internship will bar me from higher-tier companies.

If this will harm me, what can I do to better my chances, besides securing an internship of course (I need stable and steady income)

I absolutely love my program - our academic advisor helped me overcome mental health challenges I had last quarter, and I have a lot of great friends and professors who are like my family. My program is heavily focused on coursework; it's so demanding that a majority of students don't apply for teaching or research assistant jobs. My classes are fun and interesting, and I really learn a lot. The issue is... I can't study.

I feel so terrible because I feel like my professors will get the impression that I'm lazy. I'm not - I just have such a hard time getting down to business. I live in graduate apartments and we have a quiet, really nice study lounge that's only a few hundred feet away from me, but every time I know I have to do something, I feel like there's an invisible ball chain strapped to my ankle, keeping me in my apartment. When I DO start studying, I get lots of work done, but starting things is impossible for me. The past few quarters my grades haven't been so good, and if my grades continue to drop, I'll be kicked out of my program. I've been crying a lot over the past few days because I need to apply for internships and reach out to professors, but I feel like it's impossible. I see my grades and cry because I KNOW I can do so much better, but my mind is holding me back.

I love my program, but my university is awful. A ton of students in my program are constantly on drugs, but they keep it very low key. I've tried reaching out to my school's disability center and they've cancelled on me twice the day of my appointment. Psychiatry appointments take at least a month and a half to get. The assistant dean of the graduate division encouraged me to drop out of school (I don't want to because I've already taken out thousands of loans). All of the students outside my program openly say that they HATE our school. Suicides are extremely common but are hidden by the administration. 

The thing is, I WANT to be here. I love my work and I'm passionate about it, but a lot of my depression stems from my inability to do work, and my psychiatrist says I just need to buckle down and try harder. I just want her to validate me, and no one does. It's so frustrating. Sometimes I think about jumping off a building because I hate how my brain is constantly working against me. Does anyone else have these kind of experiences? It's so frustrating to me.

so basically I'm an intern for this small game company. Their main game isn't linear, you can just pick any level and play. Some Pareto Principle-ish thing goes on and most levels have around 2 thousand playthroughs while a couple have millions. They've kind of been half-blindly building hundreds of underplayed unprofitable levels in hopes one or two will take off and pay for everyone's lunch, but those have become harder and harder to come by and only one out of 240ish levels built in the last 6 months surpassed 100 thousand playthroughs, and only barely. I'm trying to do some basic data analysis and maybe find some more elusive patterns among the winners.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways thought the business model and backstory might be interesting. Now to my question:

    number of plays (bins)            frequency
    0                                    0
    1000                                 3
    2000                                 49       
    3000                                 47
    4000                                 35
    5000                                 30
    6000                                 18
    7000                                 13
    8000                                 5
    9000                                 11
    10000                                 4
    11000                                 2
    12000                                 2
    13000                                 1
    14000                                 0
    15000                                 4
    16000                                 5
    17000                                 2
    18000                                 2
    19000                                 1
    20000                                 0
                                          8

So I have some stats for all 240 levels. I created some bins and used the frequency() function to count how many levels there are in each bracket. What I need now is to sum up the #of plays for each bracket. For example, there are 3 levels with under 1000 plays. Let's say they have 400, 700 and 800 each. I need something like:

=if(plays&lt;1000, sum(plays)) and it would return 400+700+800 = 1900. How do I go about doing that?

&amp;#x200B;

Also if anyone has any recommendations on some study material for basic data analysis that'd be great. I'm currently eyeing some courses on coursera, anyone have any experience with those?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."

I posted here maybe 6/8 months ago in a full blown melt down freaking out about not getting an internship. I got a lot of great advice from you guys, and read tons of tips throughout the months that I feel really helped me become more confident, motivated, and organized. Fast forward to about a month and a half ago, and I had posted here again asking for advice because I was about to go completely out of my comfort zone to attend a campus career fair. I attended said career fair, and to my amazement got an interview with Starbucks for the following afternoon! Fast forwarding to now I’ve officially been offered and accepted a 10 week summer internship with Starbucks as an iOS developer working on their employee facing technologies! It might not be a big N company, but I know they’re one of the leaders in technology for their area of business. I’m being compensated pretty nicely, and am getting housing fully paid for, but most importantly I’m getting industry knowledge that six months ago I never thought I would get. 
Pretty much I’m writing this to say thank you for all of those who share your wealth of experience and knowledge on this sub!

&amp;#x200B;

I got rejected from Columbia, Cornell, and Berkeley for comp sci.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a 1550 SAT , like a 4.3 GPA, and multiple comp sci ecs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only got into 2 schools, UTD and A&amp;M, and A&amp;M gave me no fucking money.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom had to deal with breast cancer throughout senior year. She's almost done with treatment, but seeing her sometimes debilitated really took a toll on my psyche, especially when she asked me to do simple things like scratch her back or help her get up out of her chair. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never got enough sleep and was always stressed out.

&amp;#x200B;

I see people around me get in with ease, some going to U Chichago with no financial aid because there families can afford it, people recruited to Stanford for softball junior year, and cheats get into good schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I got rejected from UT Austin, a fucking state school.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm writing this from a place of privilege as a white middle-class guy. But then I realize my parents had to come from Romania and had to go through shit like my dad losing his job and going back to school at one point during my sophomore year of high school and working late and even on weekends sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I got rejected from internships and only got a job teaching kids to code most likely because the company was desperate as many people left over pay or something because they didn't offer me the job till like a month or so later. I got rejected from QT the day after I applied for fucks sake. I got rejected from an officer position from my school's comp sci club.

&amp;#x200B;

I probably didn't try enough, have enough accolades, etc.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was naive, stupid, and jealous and always will be.

At least I have a full ride to UTD.

**For my stats**, so far I have a 3.94 UW GPA and *4.065 W.* I took one honors class in algebra 2 sophomore year. For this junior year, I am taking AP Physics and Precalculus Honors. This is one reason for why I am stressing out so much. I feel the lack of high rigor classes are going to affect my chances into getting into a top college. The only upside is that these are targeted towards my interested major which is CompSci. Even then, I feel I missed a lot by not taking more rigorous classes. As for EC's, I did basketball up until JV where I got cut from Varsity. To fill up my time, I made projects on building certain things like my own PC and custom mod my friends car. I also got a job and continue basketball on an outside league. Later, I hope to get an internship that is CompSci/programming related. 

**Overall,** I don't know how to feel. I think that this will severely destroy my chances at getting into a top school. Should I be stressing out because my past decisions are seriously upsetting me? Thanks."

Then all feedback after the evaluation was negative, and I literally mean ALL, she didn't give me any positive feedback after my evaluation. I did not meet my growth plan, so she allowed me to resign in lieu of non-renwal. 


My question is, how do I go about getting a new job. All of the applications ask ""have you ever received a negative performance evaluation?"" and ""have you resigned in lieu of non-renwal?"".  My certification program says that they are planning to certify me, and I know now is the time to start applying.

I am looking to hire a summer intern to join us at Agile Space Propulsion in Durango, Colorado. We have a kickass test-stand, and you will help support test activities in this paid internship. Our main focus at the moment is to make hypergolic rocket engines for landing on the moon.

**Website:** AgileSpace.Pro

**Position:** 2019 Summer Internship Injector Water Flow Test and Development starting May 2019, for 8 weeks

**AGILE Mission Statement:** The mission of AGILE is to provide high-performance propulsion components and systems for space-based defense, satellites, and scientific exploration spacecraft.  

**Company Background:** Located in Durango, Colorado, AGILE is responding to the industry need for more versatile and better-performing propulsion systems that can be delivered in shorter schedules and lower cost than currently available from existing providers.  AGILE’s experienced propulsion design and test team solves this problem by rapidly developing advanced 3D printed flight thrusters in our state of the art test capabilities - producing qualified space engines in half the time, and for half the cost of comparable engines.

**Overview:** A key element of AGILE’s spacecraft engines are 3D printed injectors that can take advantage of the design space and materials currently available with additive manufacturing. These injectors require cold flow testing for quantitative and qualitative assessment, comparison of that data with hot-fire test data, and evaluation of processes and techniques to improve the features of the injectors.
The primary goals of the internship will be: 1) to learn the basic physics of water flow characterization of injectors, and correlation to hot-fire data, 2) to learn how to safely and efficiently operate AGILE’s water flow test facility, 3) to test, record and organize, and analyze the numerous injector designs being generated and printed at AGILE, and 4) to compare acquired cold flow data with hot-fire data that will be performed in concurrence.
A secondary goal of the internship will be to research and propose a method of additional processing of the injector internal passages to improve their flow characteristics and performance.

**Requirements:** U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident and have taken a fluid mechanics class. 

To Apply: Send an email to Lars@AgileSpace.Pro with a resume, cover letter, and additional document that will make you stand out as a candidate. This could be a portfolio (preferred) with pictures or drawings of past professional, academic, or personal projects that highlight your contributions, a letter of recommendation, or you can ask for a take-home interview question. Please get your application in by April 6th.

b6ucqk,1,2019-03-29,Which offer to take? A job offer between an already established startup or a very new startup?,cerealproof,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b6ucqk/which_offer_to_take_a_job_offer_between_an/," 

Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

**BACKGROUND:** I’m a graphic designer and illustrator in a motion graphic-based agency, but I’ve always been interested with UI/UX design ever since I finished my internship in a local startup. Back then, before I got into this agency, my thoughts that I would (ideally) learn about UI/UX design in my spare time. WELL, as everyone here know all too well, agency work is notoriously busy and life-sucking so I had a very little chance to learn outside work. I would mostly read articles and I only had done two :’) (very) basic UI exploration so far.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got two job offers:

**OFFER 01:** from an already established and growing Fintech company. My job desc would be as their graphic designer and would manage their digital and print campaigns and other brand collaterals. The salary is standard (but still better than my previous place), but from my conversation with the HR, they acknowledge my interest in UI and told me that there would sometimes be a job rotation in which I can work (and learn) with UI projects and usually, the employees get career trainings. And I got a lot of health benefits and other compensations.

&amp;#x200B;

**OFFER 02:** from a pretty new startup. They told me that they’re still building their team. They haven’t gone public yet. I went to a meeting with them and they offered me a job as their UI Designer. The salary that they offered is (way) better than OFFER 01. I would be placed in their Product Team with UX Designer, Front-end Developers, Graphic Designers and Product Managers. I can jump ahead and work as a UI Designer with a very limited experience in UI Design, but the challenge is, being a startup, they haven’t really set on their workflow and there isn’t a clear set of rules of overtime compensation and the health benefit is so-so.

I’ve been looking at articles from people who work at startups in their early phase and a lot of them pointed out about doing not one design job (they had to design for marketing as well as product) and that really got me thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or does anyone ever been in this type of situation? I would really appreciate your inputs"
b6uf42,27,2019-03-29,A College Freshman's Thoughts on Rejections,Coolstar07,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b6uf42/a_college_freshmans_thoughts_on_rejections/,"Been lurking in this sub ever since I finally got into college last year, and saw people getting pretty sad over the results of admission. It struck a chord in me, as I remembered how I felt back then, and I've decided to write this post to anyone still beat up about their college rejections to try and help them out.

So, I know that many people on this subreddit may have gotten into their dream colleges, but I'd wager that many more have ended up taking a hard L from their own dream colleges. For you guys, these may be the things you're thinking about:

""What was the point of my hard work?""

""My life is over, what do I have now?""

""I'll never be happy again.""

""I should've been more productive, maybe then I'd have gotten in""

These were the thoughts running through my mind after getting rejected by 5 colleges in a row, with my only acceptance being a safety school. Now, with a year of college under my belt, and a ton of Ls, I'm going to try and address them.

1 . ""What was the point of my hard work?""

I think that most people see that their work hasn't borne the fruit they desire and thus conclude that all the work was worthless. Yet, people seem to forget the other benefit of working hard, which is giving yourself a powerful work ethic that will last you a lifetime. Now that I'm already in college, I really have lost that powerful motivation to push myself to my limits. I've lost that energy that let me cram months of school into a day of studying, or write 500 word essays in hours. But while I may never reach that level again, that power still echoes within me. I've spent 4 years working for my future, and as a result, I think that I've become much more resilient to any amount of work college can throw at me. 

A final tomorrow that I've barely studied for? Well, I've been able to cram a year into my head in one night, what's a semester got on that?

A 750 word essay that I haven't started on? I've done 3 of those in a single day.

While these accounts may be exaggerated, I'm sure you all can recognize where I'm coming from. By pushing yourselves to the limit now, you ensure that any undertaking in your future will be met a work ethic that would've never came about if you hadn't tried.

&amp;#x200B;

2. ""My life is over, what do I have now?""

OK, so to be completely honest, after conversing with friends from colleges both better and worse than mine, I've come to the conclusion that, your college doesn't matter as much as you may think it does.

Of course, conditions apply, graduating from MIT or an Ivy gives you a powerful advantage that shouldn't be underestimated. But, unless you're graduating from a top 5 program with a good GPA, your college really doesn't matter once you've earned that degree. The main advantages of a better college are a better job network and a better shot at a good job through on-campus employment. Besides that, your college really doesn't make much of a difference. An employer knows that you were accepted into the college in the 12th grade, but they aren't hiring a teenager, are they? No, what they want to see is a 22 year old who's spent these four years not just grinding at a degree, but spending their free time on projects, internships, and other relevant skills. Your T20 college degree isn't going to mean squat if all you have to show for it is a pretty GPA.

So, if you haven't gotten into a great college, you really haven't lost too much. As long as you keep your grades up, and spend your free time wisely, you'll probably be on par with a graduate from the college that rejected you.

&amp;#x200B;

3. ""I'll never be happy again.""

Yeah I know how that feels. You probably feel unbearably sad, like you want to curl up into a ball and cry for a week. You can't imagine being happy in your future, and are worried that you'll always have regrets in the back of your head.

Don't worry, that fades away pretty soon. You won't be waking up every day thinking that you could've been in a better college. You'll honestly just get over it and be happy with your life. After all, you have to remember that college admissions are affected by so much chance, that it can sometimes just be a lottery. And once you spend time at college and realize for yourself how little of a difference your college rank makes, you'll forget this sadness that you're feeling right now. And you'll probably have a great time.

&amp;#x200B;

4. ""I should've been more productive, maybe then I'd have gotten in""

This was the one that hit me the hardest. I remembered every time my parents told me to play less video games, to get off the computer, to try and pick up an instrument just to have something to list as an extracurricular.

Well, here's my view on it. If you like just chilling around, and don't really care about doing anything extra just for college, I think it's fine that you didn't do too much. You shouldn't feel bad that you didn't force yourself to be productive just for the sake of getting into a better college. As long as you had fun doing whatever you were doing, you should rest easy knowing that you lived these four years on your own terms.

And to those of you who spent time on something you don't like just to make it into a college, but didn't end up where you wanted; now you're free. Stop doing whatever it is that you don't like, the rat race is over. Now that you're here, you can choose to do whatever you want, whether or not a college will care about it. Try a hobby without the consideration of productivity, and put those years of mindless work behind you. I spent 4 years at MUNs, and now that I'm in college, the words MUN put a shudder up my spine. Nothing against MUNners of course, it just wasn't for me, and I'm glad that I don't have to spend time on MUNing.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that this post was able to make people who feel terrible about their rejections feel a little bit better. I'm sure that at least some people may have the thoughts listed here running through their mind, and I made sure to say whatever I would have told myself back then. Anyone who cares enough to be on this subreddit are sure to end up as amazing people in the future, and these rejections are just going to be a small footnote in your lives. I'm not very good at ending these posts, so I guess I'm off to bed, it's 2:35 am rn and I've only got a few more days of spring break left. Peace.

A couple of days, the sysadmin decides to  restrain Internet access for people who don't need it,  and for some reason,he doesn't want to set a DHCP server, so we assign every user an IP address and manage them in an excel sheet (I know it sucks but there is nothing I can do).  A users calls and says that he have no connection, I look up for his IP address and it has no ping, so I go to his workstation to troubleshoot, I find out that he has messed up his IP settings, I think that he tried to change the IP we gave him  tried to use another IP that is allowed to access the Internet without us knowing, I figured it out because hi IP address was 169.x.x.x, and we had no DHCP server, I didn't say anything, I just put back the IP that he was supposed to have. 

I don't know why the sysadmin allows users to change their IP settings, or why he doesn't want to user a DHCP server, but what bothers me most is when people try to mess up with settings and only call you when everything stops working."

Reflections: As you can tell, I was rejected from all of my reaches. And yesterday, before I opened decisions, I realized how stupid all this was. It’s literally a game, with so many factors out of your control. A game that takes into account race, geography, location, parents, opportunities, etc. So many of these factors are out of your control.

I thought I would have a chance because I come from a low opportunity high school. I didn’t. They would rather accept kids who have had an arsenal of opportunities at their fingertips for years of their life. They didn’t care. But when I go in to my first year at Rochester or Miami or Rutgers, I am finally going to have the opportunities I need to flourish. And when I do, I am going to do so much with them. I’m going to do whatever it takes to succeed, and when I do, a stupid Ivy League college won’t be able to take my name and say they’re the reason why.

When I applied a few months ago, I had also applied on a whim for a job as a software developer at the company I’ve been working at as a teller/loan officer for 3 years. Shockingly, I got the job as a software developer and have been working at that position since Monday. The company pays for school, has great benefits, and somehow I’m working alongside people who already have bachelor degrees in computer science. But, it is a financial company, so the industry isn’t something I would want to stay in forever. I was speechless yesterday when NASA called about the internship, and I can’t even believe it’s real. I’m afraid if I turn this down now I will never get a similar opportunity. I have some very difficult decisions to make, so advice deciding between the 2 is appreciated. Also, wish me luck in asking a manager I’ve worked with for less than a week of a leave of absence (hopefully my prior performance at the company will count for something).

Edit: WOW this blew up. Thank you everyone for all the advice!! I know that NASA might seem like the obvious choice, but having college paid for at my current job is a pretty great perk.

Dear Kroger Representative,

I am writing to express my interest in the project engineer intern position at City, posted in LinkedIn. I am majoring in mechanical engineering, will earn my degree by end of June, and my background aligns well for this position’s job functions, qualifications, and previous experiences.

Balancing academics and extra-curricular have made me a strong candidate for this position. During high school, I enrolled as a full-time college student to finish my high school diploma early and acquire knowledge pertaining to my major. By the time I earned my diploma, I had also earned half of the required credits to earn my associate’s degree. In addition, I was recognized by the City Mayor and the local Rotary Club members in 2017 with an award titled as “Service Above Self” for my efforts in community involvement while as a high school student. Presently, I have maintained a cumulative GPA of 3.27/4.00 with over 850 hours of community services and will earn my two-year degree this spring to enroll in State College’s (XYZ) bachelor’s program for a mechanical engineering degree this upcoming fall.

In addition to my ability to balance academics and extra-curricular, I have work experiences in construction, SolidWorks, Microsoft Office Suite, and MATLAB that makes me a strong candidate. During to construction, I gained experience in submitting materials and completing projects that meet and/or exceed expectations that of the company and clients. In my academics, I applied competency in SolidWorks, Microsoft Office Suite, and MATLAB to my engineering projects.

Under tutelage of Kroger’s project and construction managers, and my background, this intern experience will benefit both Kroger and me. This will help me excel in my future as a mechanical engineer and in my academic work in XYZ’s bachelor’s program, especially in my senior project.

I am very much interested in interviewing for this opportunity and look forward to learning more about your requirements in detail. Please let me know if you have any questions and/or would like to discuss specifics about my background. You can reach me at either ###.###.#### or [myname@gmail.com](mailto:myname@gmail.com).

Thank you for reviewing my background in consideration for this internship.

I turned 20 two weeks ago, and im kinda lost.
See, i work in the media/television field and my dreamjob used to be cameraman. A year ago i finished school, and was pretty clueless on how to continue. So i thought it would be a good idea to do a bunch of internships throughout the year.
(it actually was a good idea, learned a lot!)

Within those internships, i worked on music videos, big movie productions and advertisements. The last company i was an intern at then decided to hire me for 3 months as Junior Producer.
Its pretty cool, i earned good money for a then 19 year old.
The job as a producer is more of a management thing, like you plan and hire everything for the production of whatever it is youre gonna produce. My three month employment ends in may. And once again i feel lost.

Its just, to become a producer i would need to study, which i can.
The possibilities are not the problem here, its me.
I dont love to work as a producer, nor do i hate it. Its just office work, with regular pay. So my two main options are to either study to become a producer, or go with my initial plan by doing an on-the-job-training to become a cameraguy.

Both decisions have big pros and cons to them. 
Cameraguys get shitty pay, but the job is cool and adventurous. 
Producers have a nice steady income, but its basically just office work, which i thought i would never end up doing.
My heart says i should go for the more exciting job, but my brain says i should think about the future and take the safe job with more career possibilities.

Both have very nice aspects, and aspects that suck.
Both paths would take 3 years to complete.
I dont know anymore, i dont want to sit in my office 10 years from now, and wonder what coulve been. I also dont want to beome a cameraman just to realize 10 years down the line that its just not enough money.

Its a very had decision for me.
Maybe you can give me some input."

So I'm super excited over the fact that I finally got IBM to pick up an application of mine for an application dev. specialist internship over the summer. I've made this year all about networking, and so far, it seems to be doing its job. I'd like to emphasize that I've already had several internship interviews and while none of them worked out, I'm fairly used to how tech interviews typically proceed. And since I know you're asking this in your head, the reason they didn't work out wasn't because I didn't show industry knowledge or the capacity to learn, they were just more interested in candidates that had more technical experience. The only experience I have is through what I learned in school.

IBM has already told me they aren't looking for me to be able to code the Internet, just be able to answer some basic programming questions about the experience I do have (Java, C++, and Python). I do have a small portfolio of work I've been working on over the past year as well to try and bolster my chances. 

I really, really want to land this internship. Does anyone have any advice about potential questions I could expect and learn about before the interview? Or if I don't know something they ask about, what would be the best way to approach those kinds of questions? "

I'm really in need of some career advice. If you could also critique my resume I would really appreciate it!

[https://imgur.com/a/pIdzi7v](https://imgur.com/a/pIdzi7v)

I graduated almost a year ago, and I left my internship about 8 months ago. The short and sweet explanation on the reasoning is depression. I've been a socially awkward guy my whole life but I've been working very hard on minimizing the awkwardness and trying to be as normal as possible. My interviews didn't go so well due to this and I fell into a depression and that's when I left my internship. I've gotten 4 interviews, 1 for very low salary, 1 from the company I worked at, and 2 contract to hire positions. I bombed the first 3 but I improved with each one and finally gave a normal interview on my last one, but it still wasn't enough. I remained untreated for a while but I've got it under control now and I'm really eager to get back to work. I worked really hard throughout college to get a decent GPA while working the entire time and I don't want it to go to waste.

I am located in Detroit, MI and I'd really like to work in automotive engineering.

\-My question now is am I un-hireable? If so, what should my next step be?

\-Should I do a masters? It would only take me 2 semesters I believe. Would this hide the gap?

\-I'm considering taking the FE exam just to demonstrate I haven't forgotten the engineering fundamentals. Is this a good idea or even practical?

\-I've seen advice on this subreddit saying that I have to be willing to relocate at this point. If I do, is there any way to make it back to automotive at some point?

\-I was contacted by a mass recruiting company for a software engineering position, I'm thinking to pursue it for financial reasons and because its better than nothing but will this hurt or help my chances of getting back into mechanical/automotive engineering?

\-I've started a data science/Python course recently to spend some of my time while unemployed productively. How else do I explain my employment gap?

\-Is my employment gap going to be considered from when I graduated, even though I stayed at my co-op position for a few months afterwards?

If you have any other general advice I would really appreciate it."

Reflection: 

This has been a really humbling and frustrating process for me.  I feel like I wasted my junior year by going through the IB diploma program.  My IB coordinator and counselor both said that schools are often more forgiving to kids in the IBDP. That was a complete lie, I feel like I would’ve been much better off by just taking  4 AP classes and 2 honors in comparison to me taking 6 IB classes and 1 honors level class (fun fact: my honors class was the hardest class on my schedule). If any rising juniors are reading this, don’t overload your schedule. Take classes that you’ll enjoy and actually have fun learning about. It’s not worth taking the hardest schedule possible at your school just to be mediocre. 

For me, I’ve seen a lot of kids from my school who are in the IBDP program get waitlisted or rejected from UNC-CH &amp; NCSU.  Both schools seemed to like kids who had higher UW/W GPA’s even if their class load was a lot easier than the latter of us IB students.  Being an average student in IB is a curse, since most of us get overlooked in the admissions process.

However, those who do very well in IB, often do reap the rewards as the best in our IB class have been quite successful with their application process. However, this would only pertain to the 10ish kids who balled, out of the 60 IBDP kids. Ironically , a lot of the kids who dropped out of the program early on are doing better than the kids who chose to stick it out. If you can succeed in IB,  go for it. However, if you’re just gonna be average, IT IS NOT worth the stress especially if you’re in the US (intl is definitely a different ball game).

Ironically, our school has so far had 2 Ivy League acceptances (from my knowledge). 1 girl is an IBDP admit who is ranked number 1 in our class, no EC’s but amazing academic achievements. However, the other girl doesn’t even fall into the T10 of our class, rather she took a challenging class with 1-2 honors and she worked on developing her personality and EC’s. In fact, she has beaten out a handful of our junior Marshall’s . Taking the most rigorous course load isn’t a guarantee that you’ll get into a T20. Take a courseload that you’re comfortable with and focus on following your passions. A lighter courseload can easily be balanced out with a high SAT/ACT score. At the end of the day, colleges aren’t going to care if you took 1-2 less AP/IB classes than your peers as long as you succeed in the classes that you chose to take . Work on developing your passions rather than taking the hardest available course load just because you think colleges will like it. College admissions is a wild game, and oftentimes, the stress is just not worth it in the long run.

Thanks for tuning into my Ted talk

Contrary to popular advise on reddit of not staying at a workplace for too long, I think I *might* have job hopped way too much. 

**Negatives:** 
- I had a 4yr gap between high school and starting uni. Out of which, I can't explain 2 years too well (was trying to move out, earn money on the side, in an abusive family) while other 2 were spent having own startup.

- After graduation from uni: I had numerous short stints because I wanted to pivot from finance to startup world.

- 4 months at a top bank in Project Mgmt role 

-&gt; 5 months internship at a well known startup that didn't convert to full role due to small scale of the startup 

-&gt; 8 months at another major startup in an operational role. Ultimately left since there was a leadership/strategy change and my department was under fire. 

**Positives:** In a way, I explained above why I had to leave each role. I spent 4-5 months between latest roles due to visa issues (I was in another country) + startups tend to be volatile. Additionally, I have strong references from all of the roles. 

However, out of my own sheer insecurity + some trauma of unemployment months, I find it is hard for me to spin it into a narrative/pitch for future, that I am very fixated on how I had such an unstable career/lifestyle so far (long hours, moving every few months etc) and have a what/if on my mind which is a big obstacle in thinking critically and carrying a strong pitch.

How would you go about it? **How should I narrate it all into a coherent, succinct manner without sounding like over-justifying much?**"

Hello,

I am a first year Master student in Computer Science.  
I have about 5 years of professional experiences in Software Engineering (Mostly front-end and little bit back-end)  
I quit the job and came to the university to become a Machine learning Engineer.  
I took AI and DB classes in the program, but I think it is not enough (To be honest I'm disappointed about the lectures a little bit...).

&amp;#x200B;

So, I decided to take online courses (from YouTube).

I took CS156 from Caltech channel ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A ). Now, I am taking CS229 from Stanford channel, ( https://www.youtube.com/view\_play\_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599 ) and math lectures from Khan Academy. (I was not good at math. but now I like math!!)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that until now I cannot get any summer intern position in ML or DL. I think the reason that I have no experience in machine learning and data science. Also, I have only limited knowledge of machine learning and cloud system. (I just know how to deploy websites on Google Compute Machine.)

So the question is…

&amp;#x200B;

**Do I have to find an internship position in Software Engineering? (I know this is also very difficult) Or it is better to study more through off-line lecturers and YouTube and attending hackathons?**

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"

I say mild because it’s tolerable and really just an uneasy feeling that I can only really describe as being detached from myself and reality in some ways. I often feel completely out of it, not realizing it until the brief episode is over when I realize I just did something without thinking about it at all. I realize this may be normal but I’m really not sure and I overthink a lot so I decided to talk about it here. 

First off I’ll also provide a little bit of background on myself. For about 9-10 years now. I’ve been struggling with a few different mental health problems. In the 4th, 5th, and 6th grades I had many manic (the best I can describe it) episodes where I would go completely crazy and become physically violent over very small things like being asked by my parents to do a simple task. During these episodes I would almost feel like I wasn’t myself or in control. I always told my parents that the devil was controlling me. In 6th grade I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (mostly OCD related anxiety but still anxiety nonetheless). The same year I was
diagnosed with ADHD and since then I have been taking medication. All of these things have definitely improved but I still definitely struggle with anxiety and ADHD. 

Lately, probably for the last 2 months or so specifically I’ve been noticing myself lose hold on reality. I’ll be doing something and lose hold on reality for a few minutes, then I’ll snap out of it and realize that I just did what I did completely on autopilot without thinking. I will experience this while driving, walking, doing things around these house, etc. 

Could this be depersonalization? I’ve done some research and what I’m experiencing is definitely not even close to the extremes that others with depersonalization experience. Like I said, I tend to overthink a lot and this could be just that. I do the same thing everyday for the most part (wake up, get ready for the day, go to school, go to my internship, go to practice, go home, sleep) so it could be very well just that. I’m so used to the same thing every day that I could be on autopilot, but it seems slightly more severe than that as of late. 

Thank you in advance. "

b72o43,1,2019-03-29,I am about to graduate high school. What career do you think would suit me best?,Throwaway35381,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b72o43/i_am_about_to_graduate_high_school_what_career_do/,"(Throwaway 'cause it's the American way (also personal info))

TL;DR below

My (18M) name is Throwaway35381, I am graduating from Public American High School soon, and I am unsure of what course I should take in life.

Until recently, I was seriously interested in studying law. I volunteer at a law related program for teens and last summer interned with a nonprofit that does pro bono legal work for the indigent. However, on the last day of the internship my adult coworkers each took turns complaining about being a lawyer and most said that they wished they had followed a different career path. I seriously began to reconsider my plans. A law degree is becoming less and less valuable as computers grow to do work paralegals and lawyers once did. Long hours and unexpected overtime seem like they wouldn't make for an enjoyable lifestyle.

On the other hand, I thought I would enjoy being an engineer of some sort (likely mechanical). I do well in general at a fairly rigorous school, so I believe I could handle the tough courses required. Such was my plan until now, and I have been accepted into University of State, a Top 50 engineering school.

However, as the time to commit to a college rapidly approaches, I have realized I am not sure if I want to study engineering. I feel as if it will become a typical office job--something I don't hate but still wouldn't do if I didn't make as much money. I really want to love my work and be in a field that would leave me fulfilled even at 30k a year. (Not a masochist though, money is great!)

I'm quite young and I'm sure there are others who have been in a similar situation or share my interests. I am very open to suggestions, and at this crucial point in my life when I can still easily change majors or even not attend college at all, I would like to know what careers you all think would suit me. My parents are supportive no matter what; by no means am I limited to engineering, law, or even a traditional ""career"".

My personality:

I am not very outgoing and relatively introverted (I don't need much human interaction to be happy), but people find me agreeable and humorous, I am very kind to others, and I am socially competent. I like to be around well-educated people, but I get along with just about anyone. I wish my life had more adventure in it. Exercising creativity (hence engineering) or completing challenges (hence law) are most important to me for a sense of fulfillment.

My skills/hobbies:

I speak English (native), Spanish and Italian (B2-level), and planning to learn several more (maybe Polish, Russian, or Hindi). I love language because it opens up the door to interaction with so many people I otherwise could have never met. I have a B2 certificate in Spanish, and will soon get one in Italian.

I am a better than average public speaker, but by no means impressive. I can write a good speech, but it's delivered with inappropriate...uh...pauses, uh, stuttering, and uh, lots of the word uh.

I am a very good writer, and when I was younger I used to always start the first chapter of a ""novel"" before losing focus, usually after a period of writer's block, then move on to a new idea the next time I picked up the quill (or keyboard). Since my life has gotten more busy that's fallen by the wayside (though I'd love to pick it back up at some point).

People find me humorous, and I enjoy making others laugh. I also am a good teacher/tutor, although I'm not sure I would feel fulfilled from teaching as a career.

I love studying history, no matter the period or place. I don't think I would want to get a history degree unless it were a prerequisite for something though--I don't need to pay 10k a year for knowledge easily accessible online.

I am in decent shape but by no means strong. Still, I'm not opposed to physical work at all. 20:10 eyesight (which is good not bad), decent hearing, not especially attractive. Will probably peak at 6'0"".

Thank you for reading this far and if anyone has a job they think I would enjoy, let me know below!

TL;DR

American HS senior, love language, history, and writing, but do well in math and science. Creativity and overcoming challenges make me fulfilled. Accepted into decent school, was planning on doing engineering. What do you think are good career options?

I'm worried about the possibility of not getting any experience before I graduate. I would like to begin preparing for the scenario where I'm not able to get an internship before graduation.

b74uuc,0,2019-03-29,How much does GPA actually matter for large companies?,IloveSoftware,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b74uuc/how_much_does_gpa_actually_matter_for_large/,"So I'm in a bit of an interesting situation. I'm a third year student studying a major in Computer Science and business(they are both part of my major). I was in a pure business major for my first two years and performed horrifically in school during those two years, nearly flunking out and failing a few classes. Partially because I was interning at a financial company(non technical role) through the summer and part time through school, and partially because I was having a very hard time financially and adjusting to living alone.

After transferring into my new major though, I have seen a notable improvement in my academic performance. I tend to do much better in computer science courses than in my business courses. I've also been very involved in a lot of extracurricular technical activities like hackathons and engineering clubs. Unfortunately my first two years have really dragged my GPA down to an abysmal level: 2.6.

I would like to intern at a large company, but I have heard some things that have made me extremely anxious about my chances, particularly due to my GPA. Posts like this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a1xqeo/verbal\_offer\_rescinded\_due\_to\_gpa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a1xqeo/verbal_offer_rescinded_due_to_gpa/)

Have really made me uncertain. I will have an internship under my belt by the time the next hiring cycle comes around in late August and I have referrals, but it won't matter if I'll be turned down in the end due to my GPA. I'd also be risking potentially turning down offers from other companies if I devote my energy into false hope, which I would like to avoid.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation to mine? Particularly with large well known companies like FB, Google, etc? I would really like some insight into this if possible..

Got lucky. Got an internship. Only one DotNet developer besides me, and he's retiring in four months. Unlikely someone else is joining. I'll be alone with not even my apps. 

All his code and legacy apps are pure VB or VB6. I'll be tasked to updated and maintain them. 

All of it.

Can VB hurt me? I have been told eventually we may require the apps to be re written in C#. That's distant future though.

It's an internship set to turn into a full time offer in a month or two. I'm doing well, I think. Pay is OK, don't care while I'm building the rest of my future.

I like the job. It's hard and challenging working with honestly, some poor code. A lot of it is copy pasta mostly the same. All win forms. But can it hurt me? Can I just spin it off as A. NET position in the future and lie, saying I'm best with C#?"
b75izf,2,2019-03-29,International student with an almost failing GPA (2.2),bumshakabum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b75izf/international_student_with_an_almost_failing_gpa/,"Hello,

**TL;DR** What should I spend most of my time working on as an international student with a crappy GPA in order to stand out for an internship, and eventually a job?

I am on an F-1 visa in the U.S. in my junior year of my Computer Science bachelor's degree. I was raised relatively pampered and have never had to work hard for survival, so I've slacked off throughout all of high school, and most of my college career so far. I was getting my shit together in my first semester, but it was so easy that I fell back into old bad habits and let the rest of my semesters go downhill until last semester. The reason why being pampered was so damaging was that I had never dealt with anything difficult so I just run away when anything gets difficult because I don't feel like there are real consequences, but there definitely are terrible consequences. I also struggled with some depression and anxiety for a while. Anyways, I'm just saying all this to sort of justify, rather, to give reasons to why my GPA is so low. And that being said, I am doing a lot better this semester and my GPA should go up a little bit.

The problem for me now is that I need to find an internship, and eventually a job. I have applied to about a dozen internships, which is not nearly as much as the amount that people usually post here, but I've written somewhat personalized cover letters for almost every one of them. I've gotten rejected by about half, and haven't heard anything back from the other half. I got one phone interview, which I don't think went that well because I am an awkward person and I was shy during the call.

The question is what should I be prioritizing? The options I have seem to be to grind LeetCode/HackerRank, contribute to open source software, work on my own project, work on interviewing skills, grow my network, or keep applying to internships, in addition to raising my GPA. I just don't know how much time to dedicate to each activity, and whether it's even worth it to apply to internships right now. I'm leaning on prioritizing working on my own project because I think that I lack programming skills.

Thank you for any response!"

I am a CS student in a MSc program at a US university.

I am going to graduate in December this year.

I have been offered two internships for this summer.

The first one is at Amazon AWS in Seattle as an SDE intern.

The second one is at a Startup on the larger side (around 200 employees) for an ML research position.

I'm very conflicted, Amazon offers better compensation by far and looks very good on a resume.

On the other hand I am really interested in the field of ML and the position at this startup would fit my interests very well.

I don't have yet many details about what I would do at AWS, are there any chances I will get to work on ML related projects?

What is the best move career-wise, considering that I would like to work as an ML engineer in the future?

Any advice or comments are welcome, Thanks."

&amp;#x200B;

While I am excited, I am also disappointed that it will add another semester onto my collegiate career. I recently transferred from a community college, so I'm pretty far behind in my sequenced computer science classes. Each CS class is essentially a pre-requisite to the next and I wasn't able to take any at my community college.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I should put my schooling on hold for this Summer position as a coding instructor for youth? Or should I push ahead on classes and get a better internship down the road? Do these teaching positions hold value for a computer science student's resume?

I have a bachelor of science in political science. Worthless degree, I know, spare me. I did an internship in human services, and in the process discovered that I have a passion for human services. I decided three years ago that I wanted to pursue that line of work.

Fast forward to now, and I work in human services! All thanks to my internship, because my supervisor gave me a glowing recommendation. I'm a provisionally licensed social worker now. I really enjoy what I do, despite the low pay. I majored in polisci because my end goal was to work for a non-profit, so I'm not too far off from my goal here. To make my job simple, I'm a youth advocate. I follow juvenile delinquents and their families through the court system. I offer them services to help them be successful in the community. When they fail to be successful in the community, I make referrals to send them to residential facilities.

I don't wanna dilly dally too much though. My supervisor recently told me that our IT technician is retiring. To be honest, I don't know how he had his job in the first place...he's a very nice man, but he's not that good at his job...he doesn't know the difference between a SIM card and an SD card. His usual tactic is to call our state-wide help desk to troubleshoot when it's his job to figure out our problems in-house. A lot of the workers in my office complained about him. But he's done at the end of March, and my supervisor told me that I'd be a good fit for his position.

I'm a young guy. My Dad is an engineer and I grew up around technology. I have a somewhat advanced understanding of computers, but I'm nowhere near an IT professional. I worked in a call center for a year and earned an IT certificate, but that's about it. Yet, for some reason, my boss is saying I should take over for the dude who is retiring...to be fair, every time my office needs to set up or move a work station, they call on me to do it instead of our in-house tech. I don't know if they think I was bragging when I said I used to work in tech support, but at this point, I'm pretty much the office IT guy when I don't have to handle my workload."

My parents and I had another thorough discussion about my pursuit of education as time for me to pack my stuff for the flight.

they finally understood my situation, gave some respect for my dream schools, caltech ,harvy mudd and reed, guess they final know its me going to college lol and offered me one last chance, my father called his college friends, found me a internship at local law firm, a volunteering at local animal shelter, passing out food at local food bank and some minor translation work for me to fill out that thicc EC on college app.

They also register me for a SAT prep class, and few ap exam prep class.

Also they told me the reason that they want me back to my home country wasnt that they cant afford the expense, in fact, my dad just got promoted to a COO of some major chemical industry company. They all lied to me and i haven't talked to my dad in 3 months before this. You can tell they are not quite a talker lol. 

The solo reason  was that im acting too anxious and they afraid that im not feels so good at a strange environment, and my gradpa is sick, even tho he is better now, but he still wants to see me.

Thx for all the support you guys gave me when i was low.

Btw for that one person think help out my grandpa to do some farm work is a nice EC, im still going to help me farm this summer."

***Berkeley Pros:***

1.Prestige.

2.Quality of Professors.

3.Location.

4.Pretty Urban Environment (Esp compared to SD)

5.I'm a uber history nerd and Berkeley has had some dank history.

***Berkeley Cons:***

1.Wouldn't have a guarantee of becoming a CS major, and graduating in 4 years would be a struggle.

2.I've heard the culture is toxic/cut throat.

3.If I'm spending all my time worried about whether I'll even get my classes how will I be able to compete and get research opportunities, internships, co-ops.

4.Classes are huge and I thrive in environments where I'm allowed to ask 16 questions every 4 seconds.

5.Will I feel like I'm 'lower' than EECS students?

&amp;#x200B;

***San Diego Pros:***

1.Far Away From Home. I know I'll grow more as a person the more independent I can be (I live in East San Fran Bay near)

2.Am in the College of Engineering so I've got the major that I want, and I can take MechEng and EE classes. I can get the CS classes I want.

3.Since SD is pretty good at getting everyone their courses and has a very structured 4 year course plan, I know I can graduate in 4 years and maybe at a 5th year there for a Masters.

4.Since I don't have to worry so much about all the classes I can explore what I want to do (Music, Sports, Engineering Clubs)

5.Class sizes are a bit smaller.

6.Far Away From Home. This is kinda important but also idk but also maybe but also idk help me i'm dying.

***San Diego Cons:***

1.The location is not Silicon Valley.

2.Its pretty much just a sub-urb.

3.Prestige isn't as high as berkeley.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before I'm really not sure what to choose. I've always dreamed of studying computer science and I know this sounds cliche but the whole concept of the Internet of Things, and using automation to do some really cool shit makes a lot of sense to me."

In my vocational school I was rather lazy, didn't pay attention to my teacher(He kind of stunk at his job anyways, he just talked about fortran and eating healthy..). So I would study PHP on my own while ignoring all the lectures about C# and ASP, completing my projects within 2 hours of when they were due. Despite my lack of effort I had no problem outperforming my classmates. So I know what I'm doing, and I'm good at it.

My last year there I had a Web Development Internship (Not much of an Internship, me and a classmate rebuilt the website on our own). So I did pretty good

Out of highschool I had issues getting a Full Time job developing so I took a lower position Configuring computers, later being promoted to the Soc at my company. I script when I can and when it makes my job easier. I'm turning 21 soon with a child on the way and I'm unsatisfied with my current position.

I can finish projects no problem when it's part of my job, but I get nowhere when it comes to developing in my free time. I like developing but have no clue on what projects to build, there's no software I need that I don't have. I can't find projects I'm motivated enough to stick to and it's interfering with my career.

I'm great at coding, better at that than anything else. But with no completed side projects and no official degree I have no clue on how to get a job in this field. I feel like I have all the tools but no idea what to do with them. I feel like my skills are rotting away because of my passivity.. I guess I'm asking if anyone else has similar experiences coding and how they got past them. I feel like a dusty book lol.

I would like to go to  a **""selective""** grad school preferably in the US when I finish undergrad (maybe right after, maybe not). Currently, I have no specific interest in a sub-field of CS but I am trying to learn about different sub-field as much as possible. (*I am intrigued by ""network science"" and also ""neural network""  and ""natural language processing"" stuff)*

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the limits of being an international and at a small liberal arts college, there are not a huge options of research ops that I can participate in. I have been trying and will try to work in research op at my school. Some of the research-ops are  pretty great. But they are usually offered during the summer. In the summers, I have to do some internships so there are some opportunity costs.

&amp;#x200B;

At my college, I have the option of doing independent study and work on a research project on my own (supervised by a prof). I was wondering if these independent research projects will count as ""research experience"" and how much positive effect they will have on my grad school admissions.

&amp;#x200B;

**I know this is very vague** but I appreciate any input from people who have gone/going through the process.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I currently have a 3.50/4.00 GPA and I am working hard to increase that by far and I will be doing a software engineer internship at a startup in the upcoming summer."

This year I have been trying I find extracurriculars that are related to my choice of career(mainly business, ok for economics) 
I posted earlier about related ecs towards business, and got great responses. Ranging from internships, startups, stocks, research, and     Others. 
The main thing I would like to point out are “spikes” which I read online to be one to two things that stand apart in your application heavily. I want to achieve a spike in the next three years of my high school. The problem is, how? Online, at prep scholar, it said that if you are leaning towards science, win an award in scientific research. If you were to pursue computer science, it would tell you to make an app that reaches the news. 
Now, as I want to pursue a degree in accounting/finance or business management, i don’t know how to create this spike. I can’t really make a huge business as that would be very hard and need my parent to help me out with paperwork m, etc which would be damn hard. I could make a nifty research paper, eg “the most effective way one could turn 1$ into $1000” The point is, I want to make an emphasis that I really enjoy business and I will do whatever it takes to get into my dream college, Wharton. 
Another thing, is it good for one to take additional classes at a community college? Eg, in the summer I would take 4-5 classes about business, and put it in my application. This would not only help my application, but help me understand business even more. Is taking business or any other classes related to your career path worth it? "

I am graduating this may with a B.S. in Molecular Biosciences with a 3.6X GPA. I was planning to apply to medical schools, but this year I held 2 jobs in hospitals and I realized that I do not like the direct patient environment in the hospital. A few years ago I had a job in editing \[Photoshop and Data entry (just basic stuff) and I enjoyed it\], So now I decided to look into programming (I know it is different but from what I searched I feel like the work lifestyle align with my personality (I like to work independently behind a screen, my social skills are fine though).

In my undergrad I had Calculus classes as well as engineering physics and I did well on those. So I am leaning toward doing a M.S. in computer science or SE (Georgia Tech/Texas Tech/K-state).

&amp;#x200B;

* My first question is, Will it be a possible to transit to the CS field with my background?
* Then, how is the admission to these masters for students with NON-CS degrees?
* Afterwards, how will my lack of work experience IN CS field affect my job search after the completion of the masters program? 
* Lastly, is there is a way I can start gathering experience right now with my B.S. in MB (like free internships, or entry level teaching jobs to start learning)?

I'm a 24-year-old who has been working in accounting for almost a year after getting an MBA. It's stable, secure, and comfortable. I went down this path mainly because of parental pressure and because I figured it was ""practical."" However, I don't like it. 

I want to do something interesting and creative. I want to make a difference. Most of all, I want a career I can be proud of. I just want to be happy. 

I felt this more than ever three years ago when I had an internship in radio. I felt passionate about what I was doing in a way that I've come to realize is really unique. 

**That brings us to today: I was accepted to another unpaid internship abroad (a 10-12 hour flight away from where I live) in the same field.**

My heart says to go, but my mind thinks, ""*at what cost?*"" 

Some thoughts:

* I've been saving a lot of money and really could make this work. But I wouldn't have a guaranteed job for when I get back. 
* Even if I were to get a job after my return, jobs in this field are much less lucrative than my current field.
* Many people have told me that there are radio jobs in my current city, and perhaps many people would be thrilled if I wanted to work for free here. In addition, here, my living expenses are much lower.
* Why settle for an unpaid internship instead of a paid position? Well paid radio jobs are very competitive, and I figure that I would have a better shot if I had more experience (which I'd garner through this internship). 

Some questions:

* Would I be crazy for ""derailing"" my career (as my parents put it)? True, I don't like what I do. But I could probably transition to other roles that I don't dislike as much using my MBA.
* If I wanted to return after and pursue a more traditional career, would employers care about this ""unpaid gap"" in a foreign country where I tried an internship in an unrelated field?
* Should I look for opportunities closer to home before considering going abroad, or should I look for those opportunities after? I might be able to extend my offer if I ask.
* Does it make more sense to just pursue radio as a hobby instead of as a career? 
* I have other interests as well that I would still enjoy more than accounting but would be more lucrative than radio. Should I consider this?

Thank you guys so much! I'm having such a hard time deciding.

TLDR; I have a great job but want to risk everything for an unpaid internship abroad. Am I crazy?"

For my concentration, I chose both power electronics and power systems to study. My only internship experience was a disaster since my supervisor never gave me any work and would tell me to go home when there was nothing really to do. The clubs I participated never worked on projects, we just most toured companies or did fundraisers. I have my EIT license and I took a course in the NEC code but it’s not enough to land a basic entry level job.

I’ve been applying since August 2018 and I’ve only been able to land 7 interviews. It’s been quite depressing seeing everyone I know start working and I’m just sitting at home applying. My passion for EE is not getting better since I’ve lost any motivation to work on any small projects (also I have no money to work on projects). One thing I’m proud of is finishing an online class for AutoCAD electric but companies want someone who’s experienced in it. 

I always thought that since I’m from California, an EE job shouldn’t be hard to find. For me, it’s been quite difficult. This shit is bringing me down more way more than it should. Just hearing people tell me I should’ve done [insert other major] instead makes me realize maybe I shouldn’t have majored in EE. 

It’s not like I graduated with awful grades. My cumulative GPA was a 3.21 (which isn’t great either). I’m the first one in my family to go to college so I didn’t have anyone to turn to (I know, not a good excuse). I don’t want to hear what I “should’ve” done, I want to get some feedback on what I “should” do. I’m going to start applying to other states, I was wondering if employers will pay for the flight or hotel or will that all be on me (super broke and in debt).

About a year ago, I started working as a low level warehouse associate. Somehow, I managed to talk my way out of the warehouse floor to the offices making spreadsheets and building tools. Lately I’ve been playing around with Python and MySQL to build a prototype app I’ve had in mind since I started.

The other night, the operations manager put in a request for me to become an “intern engineer.” No one here really knows too much about tech and I’m pretty sure I’ll have to do things by myself coordinating with others via email. 

I figure the drawback is I probably won’t have a mentor, but I’ll have full control over small projects going from the drawing board and designing what hardware we would need and how the software would communicate with it from the ground up.

I could apply to internships, but everything I’ve seen is summers only and this intern gig would be a long term thing until I finish school which probably means I have a promotion the day I graduate. They also work with my school schedule which is a huge perk.

The job is cool and the managers really like what I’ve done, but is this situation worth not having a mentor? I guess I’m asking for advice on how to proceed. I’m still very new to the office environment with all the politics so I have trouble navigating. I also have trouble with the big picture.

I was *extremely* fortunate to have been admitted to MIT, Yale, and Princeton to study CS. I never even imagined I would be admitted to any one of these schools. I am VERY torn and am looking for help/opinions/advice! Also just a warning: this post got kind of long.

&amp;#x200B;

What I like about MIT:  
 \- Very strong CS program  
 \- STEM-focused environment  
 \- UROPs  
 \- Potential for great internship opportunities  
 \- Choosing a dorm via REX and FYRE

What I dislike about MIT:  
 \- Reputation for being extremely stressful. Yale and Princeton are by no means easy, but I have heard that MIT’s course load can be particularly overwhelming.  
 \- Large department. I’m unsure if professors will be accessible. I’m also worried that if I’m below or far below average, I may not be able to take full advantage of MIT’s opportunities (my imposter syndrome is already so bad). 

&amp;#x200B;

What I like about Yale:  
 \- Residential college system  
 \- Smaller department (more accessible professors, smaller class sizes)  
 \- Campus vibe. Yale’s traditions and sense of community stand out to me.  
 \- Computer Science BS/MA in 4 Years  
 \- Could likely do research through the STARS program.

What I dislike about Yale:  
 \- Weaker CS Program. Though still good, I’ve heard that students have to be more active when seeking internships.  
 \- Humanities Focus. I am not super interested in subjects outside of STEM.

&amp;#x200B;

What I like about Princeton:  
 \- Strong CS program  
 \- Best price ($6k/year cheaper than MIT or Yale)  
 \- Could likely do research via the ReMatch program  
 \- Undergraduate focus

What I dislike about Princeton:  
 \- Eating Clubs. I’m not really interested in eating clubs but am worried that not participating would be socially detrimental.  
 \- Residential system. I have heard that residential colleges are not as tight-knit as the dorm communities at MIT or Yale.  
 \- Campus stereotype. Based on what I’ve heard, I sort of have the impression that Princeton has an elitist, clique-y environment (though I doubt this is true for most students)."

I don't know how valid my concerns are, but reading on here and on hackernews I get the perception that mainframes are not something I should be committing myself to as a career.  I'm concerned that in 10 more years there won't be any more mainframe jobs around and I'll have no relevant experience to ""mainstream"" computing.  

What are my options to get out of mainframes?  Every job opportunity I see that isn't for college students seems to want at least a few years of C/C++ or whatever language is relevant to the position which I don't have.  I've thought about maybe going back and getting an MS in CS and doing an internship or perhaps doing an online one like the GA Tech OMSCS and using that as a pivot out of mainframes but wanted to get some input off of here.

b7hdyi,0,2019-03-30,Does where you intern matter when applying to better companies?,rbb091020,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b7hdyi/does_where_you_intern_matter_when_applying_to/,"I got an internship this summer that I never planned on doing. I’m a second bachelors student in CS, so I only needed 4 semesters to finish the degree and I’m already halfway done. Going so quickly through the program, I didn’t think I would have time to get an internship, but my friend encouraged me to apply at his job, so I did and I got it. It was literally my only application. i liked vibe, the guys who interviewed me were super nice and fun. I didn’t ask too many questions, just thought it would look good on my resume. 

After doing a little research after the fact, I’m a little concerned that interning here is going to negatively impact my job prospects at bigger and better companies (I’m going for Big-N for sure, but any respectable company as well). It’s a small team of about 10-15, and they do business web applications. They’ve had some large clients like Boeing and the international airport in my city, but mostly mom and pop businesses. However, on Glassdoor and Salary.com, most of the reviews read something like “low pay, but great place to intern and learn.” or “great place to start, but they have massive turnaround because of low salary”. Basically, lots of people intern there but no one sticks around. 

It is pretty low pay compared to others in the DFW area ($16/hr), but I don’t really care about the pay. I don’t need the money and I just want to learn. I’m just afraid that future employers will see it as a negative that I interned at a place with such low pay. Like “why did you work there, is that the only place that would take you?” When that’s not the case at all. I’m near the top of my class, 3.8 GPA, and the best programmer among the peers that I work with including Lockheed interns. It was literally the only place I applied. 

TL:DR—will potential employers at highly desirable companies think less of me for interning at an “undesirable” company?"

From when I got into college I haven't stopped filling applications about summer CS related internships. I think the best is that the internship takes place somewhere in Europe (no visa, passport, etc.), so I mostly apply for Europe. The closest I ever been is an interview for Amazon but I didn't do well so I got rejected. Every other company small or big has rejected me. I have about 20 programming and I can't understand what else I need to do. I have change my CV about 30 times in order to make it as it is today. I think my CV's level is now good. My questions are:

1. Is there any chance for me now to land an internship for this summer?
2. Do I have to look only for big companies in order to cover my costs? Because they give better salaries or housing stipend in order to live without pay from your pocket.
3. If I don't land any internship. Can I visit London, for example, during the summer and try to get an internship face to face. Can it happen? Has anyone tried something like that or it seems crazy? Will it be easier at Silicon Valley for example?

I had a few good internships during my time at school and have done my best to incorporate my PR skills into my jobs. I worked at restaurants and done office work, but I cannot seem to get anyone in the Marketing/PR field to hire me.

&amp;#x200B;

After I graduated, I consistently applied for jobs in the field for around 6 months until I finally gave up and settled for a restaurant gig for a little while. Then I got an event planning internship and started looking for other Marketing/PR work. I consistently applied to open positions that were seemingly a good skill match for about 3 months until I settled for a sales office job where they let me make flyers and update social media to assist with sales. They let me go 10 months in for not closing enough sales. I was completely blindsided.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am unemployed and have applied for over 50 jobs in the last month with only a couple of interview requests. One company ghosted me and another asked for a second interview and then told me they were pursuing other candidates before the interview could be scheduled.

as of right now, i will most likely be attending the university of notre dame for computer science with a concentration in bioinformatics.

this is what i’m currently looking at doing after undergrad:
1. take that cs degree and get a good job somewhere.
2. go to grad school for CS
or
3. go to grad school for bioinformatics / computational biology

if i go to grad school, i’d like to go to a tech-focused one like MIT or CMU or anywhere else with a really strong CS program like stanford, etc. whether i’m doing compbio or pure cs (obviously i’m shooting high here — i’d like to do all i can during undergrad!)

i’m fairly unfamiliar with the entire process, so any help or advice would be appreciated, particularly in relation to finding internships, things to keep in mind while applying, or otherwise!

i have already formed a close relationship with a professor at a cancer institute and will most likely start doing analytics work for him this summer or during my freshman year. i am also close with CS professors as i worked with the CS department to set up a girls who code club at my school. i am a little worried that ND is too isolated for me to get internships at big name companies.

any advice would be very helpful and appreciated! thank you so much. "

* Columbia (RD) - Rejected
* Fordham (EA) - Accepted. 7k merit &amp; 38k need-based, yet the net price still ended up being 40k.
* Mount Holyoke (RD) - Accepted (sort of). I received a spring admit.
* NYU (RD) - Rejected
* Pace University (EA) - Honors college, 20k-ish merit. 
* Reed College (EA) - Accepted with great financial aid. (Disclaimer: I went to the fly-in program as well)

* Vanderbilt (RD) - Rejected
* Vassar (RD) - Rejected
* Wellesley (EE) - ACCEPTED  w/ A ""LIKELY"" EVALUATION DESIGNATION &amp; AMAZING FINANCIAL AID

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics:**

An Asian (Chinese) from a noncompetitive, semi-large, public high school in Connecticut. I think only one person got an SAT score above a 1400 the year before last.  My EFC is a little under 4000, but I do not qualify for free/reduced lunch so I had to pay for all of the schools I applied to, including sending SAT scores and the CSS Profile. My state schools were practically unaffordable for me, even after financial aid and merit scholarships. Knowing this, I applied to a ton of reach schools that would meet 100% of my demonstrated need. 

**Major:**

I applied Political Science for all my schools. If it asked for a minor, I'd put either Econ or Philosophy.

**Stats:**

Superscore: 1400 (710R&amp;W / 690M). Highest sitting was 1360. 

GPA: 3.7UW, with a downward trend (Fresh: 3.6 &gt; Soph 4.0 &gt; Junior: 3.5). First semester senior grades were also a 3.5, not pretty. I don't know if it matters but my humanities GPA is far higher than my STEM GPA.

AP US History - 5 (I was one of two people last year to get a 5 on AP United States History from my school

AP Lang - 4

AP Stats - 2 (didn't send)

AP Physics - 2 (didn't send)

Took subject tests but did not send any of them (they were all in the 600s)

Rank: Top 5%

**Classes:**

Freshman - H Biology, H English, H Geometry, the rest are regular

Sophomore - H Chem, H English, H Algebra 2, the rest are regular

Junior - AP Physics, AP Lang, APUSH, AP Stats, H Pre-Calc, H Spanish

Senior - AP Lit, AP Comp Gov, AP US Gov, AP Environmental, H Genocide (a class about genocide), H Philosophy, H Spanish, H Calculus

**Extracurriculars:**

* Job at a local fruit stand (9, 10, 11) - 6 to 20 hours/week
* Job at grocery store (11) - 4-12 hours/week
* Job at large department store (12) - 20 to 30 hours/week
* Work at the Election Polls every August and November (11, 12) - 2 days/19 hours
* Orchestra (9, 10, 11, 12) - Treasurer/Secretary this year. Organize fundraisers and such. I also lead sectionals for Violin 1
* Chamber Orchestra (11, 12)
* Tri-M (11, 12) - Vice President 
* Inter-Elementary Orchestra (11, 12) - I help 5th graders that are just beginning to play violin
* Model UN (11, 12)
* CT Regional Student Conversation (11, 12) - Organized and worked with the CT Department of Social Studies to bring other neighboring schools to talk about current events and politics. I moderated the Women's Rights topic. 
* Internship with US Congressman (11) - It was kind of boring
* Youth Vote (12) - Hosted debates for local politicians and asked them questions

**Awards:** 

None

**Recs:** 

One of them was (probably) really good, the other one was (probably) mediocre. My counselor rec was probably awful because she is completely new this year. 

**Essays:** 

I thought they were really bad when I wrote them. Veteran procrastinator so I waited until last minute to write all of mine. They must have been decent though if they got me in. I wrote about being adopted and struggling to fit in because my town is predominantly white (0.02% Asian population lmao)

LOW STATS ASIANS APPLY TO LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES!!! I got flat out rejected from every single reach university that I applied to.

b7isdn,1,2019-03-30,Questions from an incoming theatre major,TreeTopsCanvas,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/b7isdn/questions_from_an_incoming_theatre_major/,"As an incoming freshman for the 2019-2020 school year I have a few questions, I have tried to find the answers online or by emailing people but have not been finding answers. So, here are my questions: 

1) I am trying to figure out what the benefits of doing fixed tuition rate would be, for I live instate and will be in the college of fine arts as a theatre major, and am planning on going to UT Austin all four years. So would doing the Longhorn Fixed Tuition Rate be worth it for me? I figured out that it is a flat rate compared to a rate that could possibly go up or down, so which in theory would save money?

2) I have punched in the numbers time after time again, and am still unsure of myself, will I be saving money and will I be safer if I live off campus or in a dorm? I have found apartments with a 9 month lease that cost less than $900 a month, and have factored in living expenses, so a total of aprox. $1,100 a month, to live in the cheapest dorm cost $1,250 a month. Plus a parking permit to live on campus would be $1,466. But at the same time I will be a theatre major, and will spend long nights at the theatre most likely working on shows and will have to either ride my bike 5 min to the apartment I am looking at or however far it is to a dorm room (I am assuming it would be a 2 min bike ride possibly if I get lucky enough to get a dorm close to the theatre).  I will be living by myself if I live in an apartment, which I believe should be fine since I will generally be around people all day (b/c of theatre) and have always been known to enjoy my own personal quiet time at the end of the day because I get exhausted after working with or generally being around people for extended periods of time. So, which would y'all think would be better/safer for me? 
OH! ALSO! I have celiacs disease, meaning that I cannot have gluten/wheat. So that is an added factor on the whole dorm or apartment situation. Because is dorm food going to have what I can eat on a daily basis to maintain a healthy diet, or should I just rely on myself to make my own food so that I know that I will not get sick at the end of the day.

3) UT First-Generation Living Learning Community-- do I get financial aid from being in it or is it just another thing that will add to my work load? I know that I have to live on campus if I participate, and that there are ""great opportunities!"" but what are the actual benefits of being involved in this program?

4) University Leadership Network -- I have talked to some people about this but I suppose I am still confused, what all is involved in this program and what do I have to do to maintain this scholarship? It seems too good to be true honestly. I don't know what I did to have this scholarship and am being told that I am being given a total of $20,000 throughout my 4 years at UT Austin. Plus internships specific towards my degree?  It just, seems too good to be true... 

5) I have applied for a work study and have gone onto hire a longhorn, making an account and adding my resume and answering questions on it, but what are the next steps, what do I have to do to verify that I will get a job that can work with my schedule even though I do not even know what classes I am in yet. Should I just wait until orientation when I get my schedule planned out, or is there anything else that I can do before then? Also, is it possible to get a job through the costume design department of the school? I think someone had told me yes but I honestly do not know if it was in a dream or not... But I am wanting to be a costume designer and was curious as to what job(s) I could get that would allow me to work using my skills that I will be using for my career.

Just as a note, I have read the advice for incoming freshman thread and have tried to find answers without posting this, so thank you everyone for everything. I am extremely ecstatic about going to UT Austin this upcoming school year. Again, thank you so so much for even reading this, honestly any advice is gladly appreciated.

- White male, MA
- Private school, but not a feeder (there are many in MA, mine just isn't one of them)
- No legacy or ""hooks""

#Stats:

- 1580 SAT (780E/800M)
- 790 M2, 760 Chem
- 3.7 UW, 4.5 W, no rank
- Hardest course rigor in my school
- I know my GPA is low, but my lowest grades were Bs, and they were all sophomore year (straight As otherwise); this was mostly a result of some crazy personal/family circumstances going on at the time. I explained this in my additional info section. My school is also wicked hard so I know if I'd gone somewhere else I could have got a 4.0 with the same life issues 🙃

#Extracurriculars:

Please excuse my vagueness in some of these...

- Research internship at medical school, resulted in publication and presentation at a prestigious international conference. (Did not pursue Regeneron or similar programs because I had no idea they existed until long after the deadlines.)
- Full time software engineer at tech company (no, my parents don't work there lol)
- Provisional patent in computational linguistics
- Leader of a big international program for kids. 
- Community service: cooking for homeless
- Community service: teaching English to refugees
- Self taught some 5 languages and 11 programming languages
- STEM summer academic program at local university
- Some volunteer programming work for local non profit
- Political activism
- A fair bit of art as a hobby (was too self-conscious to submit a portfolio; this may have been a mistake as apparently those can only help)

#Essays/LORs:

- Common App Essay: 8/10, no sob story (didn't want to dwell on aforementioned life issues), instead wrote about my love for learning and teaching myself [thing]s. Great reception from everyone who read it (including admissionsmom!). I know everyone overestimates their essays but I have no question that this was good. It was very personal to my own life story :)
- Supplements were quite strong, again according to my counselor and all the feedback I could get from former AOs and online counselors. My best were (in decreasing order): Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, Michigan, other Ivies. CMU and Berkeley were probably my worst.
- STEM teacher LOR: 9/10, this is the only one I know for sure about and that it was great, my counselor read it and told me so, and she's very blunt with these things.
- Supplemental LOR: 8/10, I actually saw this one and am grading it according to what I've read about LORs. This is from my research advisor. Sent to Ivies and Stanford.

#Schools:

I'm super interested in CS and linguistics (weird overlap, I know, but not for the reasons you'd think), and I applied to different majors at different schools, as indicated below (listed in the order I opened decisions):

- CMU SCS (ED): Rejected
- UMass Amherst (CS): **Accepted**, Honors College
- Northeastern (CS): **Accepted**, Honors program
- Michigan (LSA ling): **Accepted**
- UW (CS DA): Accepted for pre-sciences (L), accepted to Honors
- USC (CS): Rejected
- NYU (Tandon CS): **Accepted**

- Brown (ling): Rejected
- Columbia (SEAS CS): Rejected
- UPenn (SEAS CS): Waitlisted
- Dartmouth (ling): Waitlisted
- Cornell (ling): Waitlisted

#Comments:

My counselor did not have high hopes for me at all. She told me from the very beginning that my demographic is extremely competitive, which I understand -- obviously I've had a lot of great opportunities because of who I am and where I come from -- but at the same time I feel like I did everything I could with those opportunities and still failed. 

It also sucks to watch people who slacked off for 4 years be accepted to some schools because they knew exactly how to play the admissions game from day 1 of freshman year (or are also legacy or go to feeders). To think of how much more fun I could have had...

I also know my GPA is low, but I did genuinely think that a strong upward trend with extremely hard classes would appeal to AOs. Clearly I was wrong (with one big exception of course).

Now, despite my shotgunning fail, I still would recommend you all do it... The fact that even *one* person has ever been rejected from all their reaches but one is reason enough. But as you probably know from A2C, it happens *all the time*, and it could certainly happen to you. So apply to 20 schools if you want. We live in a world that will never remember the chances you don't take.

**TL;DR—** Low GPA (with good trend), high scores, decent ECs, good essays, super competitive area: rejected at all reaches except Berkeley, waitlisted at Cornell and low-tier Ivies."

That was back when everyone had a console and computer. And no one knew how to fix them. I was running my own ""lemonade stand"" fixing computers as a 14 year old entrepreneur. Then I took up an internship at my high school Vo-Tech. That was your classic ""update Adobe"" kind of situation. It was sweet to get paid for going to High-School. (I also worked at McDonald's from 14-17).

Downfall 1: I've got a long history of Piss Poor Planning.

I went the career path, and had zero plans out of HS. Thankfully an Army recruiter showed up, and poof. The kid who quit JROTC was off to Ft. Knox for a four years. Mixed feelings there. I worked as a Network Admin (25N). I learned the basics of beating my way around a network. Troubleshooting. And my specialty, outright breaking things. 

Downfall 2: I didn't apply myself. 

When I was in the service I spent my off time drinking and playing COD. I look back and see that I wasted all that time playing video games. And that habit transitioned out of the military with me. Waves of PTSD, anxiety, and depression had me land locked in my own home for 6 years. (Did I meantion mixed feelings?). In that time IT skyrocketed past me. And in that time after the service I had 2 major jobs in IT. A network field tech, and a sys admin. Both ended poorly. 

I was laid off from my sys admin role. After that, well you read the headline. I'm now back in a field tech position. Mainly because it pays well. And the travel. It's the only thing IT related I can work and enjoy. I am really good at using computers to help me get things done. 

I absolutely loathe the industry. I think about going back into the service. It was a proving grounds that I could use now, to prove myself everyday. But the issues coming out on the other end are debilitating. For myself and Veterans like me. 

I went to school, and found a passion for writing. It's been a work in progress. I'd love to get into advertising. There's one problem now. 

Downfall 3: I do not have the courage to leap. 

TL:DR 

I hate IT. I'd rather cut my hands off than keep doing this. But I need my hands to persue other work. I want to be a writer, and I was in the military. What the heck am I doing out here?

Realistically, should I expect to have one, or start making other plans like taking classes?  I'm a current sophomore EE, \~3.5 GPA, club work with Formula SAE(design/embedded SW), worked as a HW test technician at a large tech company in SV last summer, and personal projects done, so  I don't think I lack the skills/experience needed. I've applied to almost 200+ positions online and at school career fair, with 2 positive responses thus far.  Starting to lose hope that anything is going to come up for the summer, so what should I do at this point? I know I can still make good use of my time without an internship, but obviously working would be better. Do companies still hire this late into the year for summer '19 or am I too late?"

A lot of those companies have office  in metropolitan hubs around the world (London, Singapore etc) that I would love to work at. Shoot, I wouldn't mind interning for other companies that have a US presence but are internationally based (SAP and Germany, Samsung and South Korea, for example).

NOTE: Not really interested in the pay-to-intern programs like CareerUp.

Would love to hear from fellow US citizens who studied CS and were able to snag tech internships outside the country, and any requirements you had to fulfill (work visa eligibility, language fluency requirement, etc) as well as your general experience living in a new country.

b7k5br,6,2019-03-31,SWE vs DS/ML,csthrowaway987987987,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b7k5br/swe_vs_dsml/,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently in the fortunate path where I can probably pursue either of these paths and I wonder what people think of each role. I'm in a top ranked MS program in DS and have a SWE internship at a big N for the summer where I will get to do some ML. Despite the credentials, I dont think I'm that strong technically - I think I got to where I am with a lot of luck honestly.  I think DS/ML is cool but a lot of its mystique has sort of evaporated as I've learned more about it. The coolest DS/ML problems are also reserved for the PhDs. Plus, I have met a lot of brilliant people who are super passionate about ML, basically willing to trade their WLB to do ML. So, this leads me to my question - is it worth it to keep pursuing ML? My two metrics at this point are pay and job satisfaction (prestige is kinda nice but not deciding factor). 

&amp;#x200B;

Pay:

It seems that FAANG SWE pay is already ridiculous and hard to beat (\~160k first year, \~300k in 4-5 years?). Seems like DS roles will be more so around \~120k first year but I have no idea what the figure will be with 5 years exp. Note: I'm talking about real DS roles btw (which, for non-PhDs are usually at startups), not like Facebook DS where you're like a business analyst. Could anyone in the industry shed light on this - much thanks! (No need to cite glassdoor/payscale btw, theyre not very accurate)

&amp;#x200B;

Job satisfaction:

I expect SWE to be less work but DS/ML to feel more satisfying. However, I'm a bit worried that the ML craze will draw in so many brilliant minds that DS/ML wont even feel that satisfying anymore due to the constant need to grind. What are your thoughts on this?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

I know berkeley is better than ucla for cs, but I'm just concerned about the 3.3 gpa cap needed to declare the major at berkeley. Also, I heard ucla has better student life. Also, ucla cs would be in the engineering school (BS rather than BA...I know there's no diff in terms of jobs tho) and I think I'd rather take more engineering-focused courses rather than humanities, but at the same time, it might be good to have some background in humanities courses?

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is, I'll have to work hard anyways in both schools to get a good gpa for internships and stuff. And i'm pretty sure if i work hard i can get the 3.3 at berkeley needed to declare CS.....so I might as well go with berkeley? But again, if I go with berkeley then I'd have to worry about declaring the major and I feel like things are unfinished until I finally finish CS70.

&amp;#x200B;

A separate question: how do the two schools for CS compare for recruitment at both start ups and top tech companies in the silicon valley (e.g. facebook, google, etc.)?"

b7l7af,1,2019-03-31,Confused about what I want to pursue in college; don’t want to disappoint my mom,alecxhound,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b7l7af/confused_about_what_i_want_to_pursue_in_college/,"I am a senior in high school, and for a while I thought I wanted to go to a small arts school for journalism. I enjoy writing and for the longest time I felt like that’s what I was meant to do with my life. However I recently took a dual enrollment college course for biology (BIO 101), and I LOVED it. I’d never studied so hard for a class in my life. I wanted to take the next course but my mom said no- I still regret that I didn’t push harder to take BIO 102, as it would have worked with my schedule and it would have gone more in depth and it would have been a great course to take.

I’d never been so passionate about a class. The problem is is that I feel like I’ve boxed myself in with this journalism and writing thing. Ever since I’ve been a kid I’ve been the “writer” in my family. I love writing, (I’m trying to get an internship w a newspaper to see what it would be like as a career) but the more I’m considering it as a career the more anxious and turned off I’m getting towards it. 

I feel if I don’t incorporate writing in my future I might disappoint my mom, and some people around me. But  if I really want to take biology seriously, it would probably be a better idea for me to go to a bigger, well known school. But my mom has already done a lot of paperwork and I’ve already applied and been accepted into the other smaller school. I’ve been thinking of going to the smaller school for a year or two and then transferring to a bigger one with a well known program.

I’m really conflicted and I feel like I’m being pulled into two different directions with my future. I told my mom that I was thinking of double-majoring, or possibly doing a major and a minor. She made a comment about biology being my minor, and I said no- biology would be my major and journalism would be the minor. She just said “oh.” It was kind of odd so I dropped it.

I’m not sure if it’s too late now to apply to some better colleges. I was really excited for the smaller college when it was just for writing, but I don’t think I could get too far with a biology degree from there. How should I handle this? I feel like I’m being silly, and I feel like I’m boxing myself in further.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

b7qgsr,1,2019-03-31,What skill should I learn to improve my career prospects?,balletuss,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b7qgsr/what_skill_should_i_learn_to_improve_my_career/,"After receiving plenty of rejections for summer internships, I'm starting to think that I should take matters in to my own hands and do something to make me stand out even more from the crowd. I'm currently in my sophomore year, majoring in international business, but this field does not seem to be as attractive as I would've imagined.  

I cannot say exactly what I want to do in the future, but I'm very interested in the strategic management aspect of business (i.e. analyse markets, competitors and financials). I'm also determined to become an executive in the future as I love to have responsibility and enjoy getting the best out of others. 

What skills should I learn to become more attractive for entry-level jobs and in the long term (considering my career aim)? Should I give coding an effort or am I better of learning a new language? Any other ideas? Thanks! "
b7qs8p,4,2019-03-31,Some advice for HS and College students,cs-throwaway520,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b7qs8p/some_advice_for_hs_and_college_students/,"I'm a CS professor and occasional poster here (posting with a throwaway because I'm going to give some advice that will probably be controversial). Anyhow, I was thinking about what advice I'd give my kid if they were in high school (or early college) wanting to build a career as a dev and I thought that I'd share those thoughts with you all.

* First off, if you have some natural aptitude for the material, you should skip CS1 in college by getting AP credit or taking a local (transferable) college course while in high school. Rationale: My most successful students maximized the number of internships by beginning in CS2 and doing their first internship at the end of *freshman* year.

* When selecting colleges, less people should go to big state universities and more should be going to strong liberal arts universities. This would include places like Harvey Mudd or Swarthmore, for example. It should either have a strong name or ABET-accreditation (or both). Rationale: Go to a big state school and find a domestic grad student. I will bet you $20 that he didn't do his undergrad at that big state school. You will find a disproportionate number who are from these smaller education-focused schools. No matter how good you are, you will be better prepared when the classes are not auditorium-sized and you can actually interact with your professors. Next, the high cost shouldn't deter you because they will normally offer you a discount rate of 50% or so by giving ""scholarships"" - eventual high dev salaries also offset the tuition cost. Lastly, big engineering-heavy schools are usually mostly male students. Do you want to spend 4 years at a place with 70% men (I'm looking at you GA tech)? Think of the impact that the college gender ratio will have on your love life - it's not small.

* Join Linkedin and send friend requests to all of your CS professors. Rationale: Recruiters regularly stalk our (faculty) profiles and will look at our connections. Sometimes opportunities will just fall into your lap this way.

* You want to be doing an internship every summer, and it should be with a new company each time! Rationale: The students that I've advised who ended up in ""rockstar"" jobs typically did an internship every summer. Each one helped to add credibility for the next, more prestigious one.

* When applying to internships/jobs include your citizenship status and major-only GPA prominently on the resume. Rationale: I've seen this make a big impact for students who had ""ethnic-sounding"" names and/or lousy grades in their general education courses.

* Unless you have a really good reason to decide otherwise, the program name should be ""Computer Science"" or something very similar. Rationale: Employers have a pretty good idea of what CS means. For example, even if your game development major has a lot of CS depth, a lot of employers won't take you seriously. 

* Side projects are great in college. You can find a rationale in many other places in this sub.

* Pay attention when you are learning data structures/algorithms. There is a crazy amount of emphasis there when you get to interviews.

That's about all I have for now, but feel free to ask questions. I'll try to check in for a couple hours if there are any."
b7qsqo,20,2019-03-31,Going from intern to Full-Time employee!!,Africa4days,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/b7qsqo/going_from_intern_to_fulltime_employee/,"Hey guys, I made a video with 5 tips on how to go from intern to full-time employee if you're going to be an intern this upcoming summer!

&amp;#x200B;

Link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qSjMXXt4lA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qSjMXXt4lA)

&amp;#x200B;

If you'e not interested in watching the videos, here are my 5 tips. Some of these tips are for everyone but they are also specific to CS interns and Engineering interns who are writing code this summer. Good luck guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 1: Actually use the technologies you're going to use this summer and prepare. Be the most prepared intern with these technologies and tools, frameworks, and libraries that your team and company are going to be using.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 2: Be the hardest working intern for the first month of the internship, and then work at the same level as the other interns for the remainder of the summer. First impressions stick and you'll still be known as the hardest working intern if you start off the summer with a bang.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 3: (Most important tip) Be personable. Make real relationship with the full-time employees and actually talk to them daily about their lives, their hobbies, etc. Being someone that other people enjoy to work with is much more important than being the smartest employee. The fun guy will get hired over the smart guy with a shit personality.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 4: Write Clean code. Don't just write code and never go back and clean it up just to write fast code and get your work done. Write clean, manageable, readable code. No one wants to have to try and work on a code base that is very unreadable and hard to work with. Take pride in your code.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip 5: Get feedback. Get feedback from the full-time people at the end of the summer on how you did, and how you could have done better. This will go a long way and make it look like you really cared about your work (hopefully you did lol) and that you want to keep getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the tips I have for you. If you want to hear about them in detail watch the video! Good luck guys."
b7qsw1,1,2019-03-31,UCLA vs CUI,sweet_autumn_goat,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b7qsw1/ucla_vs_cui/,"I’ve already posted this question a couple times in r/ucla and on this sub but might as well do it here so I get even more input.

I’m narrowing down my decisions, and I’ve basically come down to UCLA and Concordia University- Irvine. I’m trying to weigh the pros and cons, and I’m honestly stumped.

UCLA Pros- Dream school, I have family attending there, great for Biology, R. Reagan Hospital nearby is good for future internships/shadowing.

UCLA Cons- More expensive, how hard is it to get an internship?

CUI Pros- Really attentive to students, full ride scholarship, easy to get internships.

CUI Cons- It’s wayyy too close to where I live and the entire campus is literally on one fucking hill.

For UCLA I feel like I’ll be a small fish in a big pond while at CUI I’ll be a big fish in a small pond. I don’t know whether to go with my heart or my brains. Thoughts?"

They have not had formal education and it sucks having to teach fundamentals like functions and loops, and they both have more experience than me, and I have to hand hold to the amount that I feel this is an 101 programming class.

I have trained interns and mid level and i would like to know what is expectation. Do they complete tasks on time, make their own tasks and to what level of help is acceptable for me to push back to management and say it is a bad hire. The engineers have been here for 1 year now. "
b7qxcr,1,2019-03-31,Got accepted to UCSD ECE: Computer Engineering and Berkeley L&amp;S CS. Please lend some advice! I don't know where to go and I don't know how to choose?,TheGreatEmpire,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/b7qxcr/got_accepted_to_ucsd_ece_computer_engineering_and/,"As of now I'm literally not sure at all which school I'm leaning more towards and that's totally freaking me out. If you have any advice or a comment to share that would argue whether to attend/not attend Berkeley that'd be incredibly insightful, thank you!

Here is what I've thought of so far.

***Berkeley Pros:***

1.Prestige.

2.Quality of Professors.

3.Location.

4.Pretty Urban Environment (Esp compared to SD)

5.I'm a uber history nerd and Berkeley has had some dank history.

***Berkeley Cons:***

1.Wouldn't have a guarantee of becoming a CS major, and graduating in 4 years would be a struggle.

2.I've heard the culture is toxic/cut throat.

3.If I'm spending all my time worried about whether I'll even get my classes how will I be able to compete and get research opportunities, internships, co-ops.

4.Classes are huge and I thrive in environments where I'm allowed to ask 16 questions every 4 seconds.

5.Will I feel like I'm 'lower' than EECS students?

***San Diego Pros:***

1.Far Away From Home. I know I'll grow more as a person the more independent I can be (I live in East San Fran Bay near)

2.Am in the College of Engineering so I've got the major that I want, and I can take MechEng and EE classes. I can get the CS classes I want.

3.Since SD is pretty good at getting everyone their courses and has a very structured 4 year course plan, I know I can graduate in 4 years and maybe at a 5th year there for a Masters.

4.Since I don't have to worry so much about all the classes I can explore what I want to do (Music, Sports, Engineering Clubs)

5.Class sizes are a bit smaller.

6.Far Away From Home. This is kinda important but also idk but also maybe but also idk help me i'm dying.

***San Diego Cons:***

1.The location is not Silicon Valley.

2.Its pretty much just a sub-urb.

3.Prestige isn't as high as berkeley.

As I said before I'm really not sure what to choose. I've always dreamed of studying computer science and I know this sounds cliche but the whole concept of the Internet of Things, and using automation to do some really cool shit makes a lot of sense to me."

b7s6vw,5,2019-03-31,I enjoy smoking weed but I wish I didn’t.,throw_away_5317,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b7s6vw/i_enjoy_smoking_weed_but_i_wish_i_didnt/,"A little background about myself:
I am a 21 year old college student in my 3rd year studying finance and real estate.  I like to think that I’m a pretty smart student, i have a 3.8 gpa, I landed an internship in NYC for the summer, am vice president of a business club, and I am hoping to take over my dads real estate business at some point.  I am able to balance this with smoking marijuana every once in a while.  I don’t let it interfere with my work, but I do enjoy kicking back with a friend and listening to music on a sunny day with it.  I will go weeks without it when there are exams.

Although, throughout my time high school I smoked a lot with my friends.  I was not the student I am today.  I didn’t necessarily do bad, but I was mostly b’s some a’s, and a c every once in a long while.  At some points I would be smoking multiple times a day, every day.  I didn’t think I was addicted, rather it was just fun and I figured I could pick it up in college.   

My younger brother, who I am very close with, although, does not smoke at all.  Maybe once every 4 months, if that. 

Here is where I am worried:
For my internship, I took 6 months off from smoking to assure be fully on my game through interviews.  I thought to myself, “well by the end of the 1st month I will have no desire to smoke anymore at all.”  But throughout those months, anytime I was with my friends, I couldn’t help but wish I could smoke.  It’s not like I had to resist the temptation by any means.  I set my value, I knew what had to be done, and there wasn’t a slight chance I would fall back, as was raised to put my career and school before leisure.  But I couldn’t help but envy my brother who had zero desire to smoke.  Even though I knew I wouldn’t, I still wished the desire wasn’t there.  My 2 friends also stopped for a month and said both said they have no desire to smoke anymore.  I know how to balance the leisure with work, but I wish it wasn’t even a question.  I see it like beer: a beer every once in a while in moderation is fine, yet I long for that wanting to smoke to just evaporate.  I feel like people think I’m dumb for smoking, that it is immature, and that it is a bad habit.  Any thoughts on this?

b7sr1b,4,2019-03-31,Career Suggestions,omgitsaHEADCRAB,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/b7sr1b/career_suggestions/,"I'm based in London and I've got a masters in aeronautical engineering and just finished a PhD in theoretical fluid mechanics. The PhD was very math heavy, plenty of partial differential equations, numerical methods and also required a fair amount of coding in C++, Python and Fortran.

My coding skills are pretty good but obviously not at the level of a computer scientist (missing in-depth knowledge about coding data structures and algorithms from scratch). My maths is very good but doesn't contain much statistics knowledge. 

It seems to me that a lot of the quant job postings require stronger computer science knowledge than I currently have and don't really make any use of my current math toolset. 

Quant or strat roles? Is it necessary to invest these 6+ months to cram the knowledge of a comp-sci degree or are there roles I could enter with little additional learning? Also, should I be considering internships or associate/vp roles?

Thanks

Demographics: White, Male, Texas

ACT: 34

SAT: 1540 ( 740 R&amp;W, 800 M)

Class rank: top 7%

UW/W GPA: 3.95 UW, 4.4 W, 4.5 UC

AP Coursework:-- Human Geo (5) , World History (5), European History (4), US History (5) , English Lang (5) , Statistics (5), Environmental Science (5) -- currently taking calc BC, micro econ, macro econ, computer science A

Awards:

DECA 2nd in state

Nat merit commended

Most hours and service award - volunteer organization

Academic Excellence Award - teacher nominated award (each AP/honors teacher chooses a student)

Extracurriculars:

leadership position all 4 years in volunteer organization mentioned in awards (9-12)

DECA (12)

officer in a club dedicated to raising money and supplies for puerto rico (11,12)

football (9,10)

part time work for 4 years (20/hrs week) (9-12)

NHS + Spanish honors society (doubt these make any difference) (9-12)

150+ hours of volunteer work at various philanthropies (9-12)

&amp;#x200B;

Essays: 

common app: 6/10 - felt like my personal views were unique, but my overall message was very cliche (coming out of my shell type of thing)

apply texas: 7/10 - thought this one was better than my common app, but didn't really say enough about me personally - my friends thought it was good

UC app: 9/10 - the one about how i express myself creatively was probably my favorite essay and i feel like it showed a lot about who i am as a person, the other essays were solid as well

 

Accepted: SMU (35k/yr scholarship), A&amp;M (business honors, 3k scholarship), UCLA (business econ)

Rejected: UC Berkeley (applied pre-business), NYU(stern), USC (marshall), UT (submitted an appeal, hear back tomorrow)

&amp;#x200B;

Strengths: probably my biggest strength was my stats - i was a decent margin above the average admit at pretty much all the schools i applied too, think my volunteer work was also a plus but everyone else does it

&amp;#x200B;

Weaknesses: definitely my ECs - didn't show enough interest in business other than joining DECA this year, i feel like if i joined earlier and placed as high as i ended up placing (3rd nationally for my competition, but after apps were submitted)  or even did an internship during the summer after 11th grade - my essays were also pretty rushed and could have been much better if i polished them a bit more

&amp;#x200B;

Reflection: I shot high and got 1 top 20 under my belt, not really upset because i'm going to attend A&amp;M since paying 60k+ for OOS UCLA is a bit absurd to me - wish i could've gotten into Berkeley also, but fuck it"
b7tiyn,2,2019-03-31,"Considering not coming back for a second year for mental health reasons, how might this affect my future teaching career?",SunflowerRenaissance,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/b7tiyn/considering_not_coming_back_for_a_second_year_for/,"I'm concerned about my mental health. I went through a divorce, finalized 1 year and 1 month ago. I was focused so much on my finances and physical health, and caring for my son, that I basically neglected my mind and soul. 


In one year, I went through an alternative certification program and got my first teaching position, two weeks before the start of school at a great school. This year was technically my internship year. I also put my son into preschool, because for 3 years, I had been a work from home mom (working for my husband).


I'm worried that if I keep pushing this pace, I will continue to deteriorate mentally and physically. It has already started to affect my energy level and sleep patterns.  I love my job, but I think I may need to take some time off to take care of myself. And I believe I will need more than 2 months in the summer. I have tried to find a counselor that will see me after hours or weekends, but it has proved quite difficult. While working, I can't be taking off several times a month to go to a counselor. 


I was thinking of subbing 4 or 4.5 days a week next year and hopefully I'll be in a better place the following school year and will be able to accept a full time position.  


How would this affect might future teaching career? I plan on making the decision and speaking to my principal as soon as possible. She has already signed the recommendation for me to be fully certified. Thank you!"

I have been admitted to UCLA CS and Eng, University of Minnesota TC CSE, and Purdue CS. The reason I am having difficult deciding is due to tuition. Currently, UCLA costs 60,000, Purdue costs 40,000, and UMinn costs 20,000. My parents can pay for Purdue and UMinn without much trouble, but I will have to take around 60,000 total in loans if I choose to go to UCLA for four years.

I plan to go to graduate school. I know many will say undergrad doesn't matter, but I feel like going to a better undergrad school will increase my chances of going to a good grad school. Campus life does not matter too much for me, as I want to focus a lot on academics, getting internships, and hopefully conducting undergraduate research. Weather is not a consideration for me either, as I have lived in both in extremely cold places like ND and warm places like NM for several years each. On a side note, I did not make the honors college at UMinn or Purdue or else I definitely would have chosen either of those two schools. Any input or advice is greatly appreciated!"

Software dev internship seems more doable but I want to develop a plan for quant research too.

1. Build relevant skills
2. Projects to showcase skills 
3. Network with alumni
4. Network and more networking?

b7u4e7,14,2019-03-31,Accounting vs Finance as a major,Throwawaycreatedforu,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/b7u4e7/accounting_vs_finance_as_a_major/," 

So I tried accounting up to intermediate 1 and I did bad in it (got C+, maybe could have gotten a B if I tried my best) . I also do not like studying it as it gets very boring, but I would't mind going into accounting careers like internal auditing because I enjoyed my internship in IA. I hear real world accounting is different from classroom accounting.

I also tried some finance classes and I seem to do a lot better in them and enjoy them more.

Let's say I can get a 3.6 with a finance degree and a 3.1 with an accounting degree, what would look better on my resume for industry jobs that say ""require finance/accounting majors""? I have no intention to do public and currently do not want to study for CPA yet (maybe will later) and I have some personal reasons for this. I want to major in finance because it seems more interesting to major in and easier but also because I want to transition into a data analysis/tech friendly role about 5-7 years later after learning SQL and programming. Also finance professors are much better than the accounting ones at my school.

TLDR: Basically I'm asking would a better finance GPA make me more employable than a lower accounting GPA for corporate finance and industry accounting jobs?"
b7ue0p,1,2019-03-31,I feel like my mind is blank most of the time,DestabilizedAnkles,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b7ue0p/i_feel_like_my_mind_is_blank_most_of_the_time/,"I'm currently a full time student, an undergrad researcher, and I'm currently doing an internship too. I've been managing my time pretty well and I'm not really stressed. No issues with my home life. I have friends but I don't see them much because we're all busy. My situation isn't very different from what it was 5 years ago when I was 18. At 18, I felt very happy, very optimistic, super energized; I felt like I had a personality and I liked who I was. I used to be shy and for a while now I've been trying to fix that. For some reason, throughout the years, I've just lost all my personality. I'm not funny, I have trouble connecting with people. I can speak to them if I need to tell them something but I cannot connect with them on a personal level. I have nothing interesting to say ever. 

This has all come to a head within the past few months. All I feel is anxious most of the time. If I try crying I can't. I don't feel comfortable going to see a therapist. I honestly believe it's not a mental illness and that I'm just a weak and boring person. All my attempts to fix this (reading more, working out, going out, joining clubs) fail, and the way I'm feeling is definitely getting worse day by day. A few months ago I stopped going on subreddits that enabled my sad thoughts in an attempt to move on from them, but they're still here. 

Yesterday I went to volunteer at an animal shelter and could barely speak to the people there, much less my friend who was also there. It pains me so much to be like this. I hate who I've become. As a result I feel like I' sabotaging all my friendships because I'm not putting any effort in because I have a hard time saying things to them. I love my friends so much but there's only so much they can handle before our friendship crumbles. I especially love one of my friends very dearly, and the thought of losing him as only exacerbated my anxiety. I've told them bout how I feel but it makes me feel whiny.

I don't know what else to do, and I don't know how to fix this. I don't want to take any sort of medicine (not that I think I'm depressed). 

I'm honestly desperate for any sort of advice because I'm extremely lost"
