1njdny,8,2013-10-01,burned-out?,enraged_buddha,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1njdny/burnedout/,"Hi folks,

I'm entering the third year of my PhD program (Computer Science) and honestly, I feel miserable. I like doing research, I like my advisor, I like the projects I'm working on, and we're having success and getting good results, but I feel so burned out its like I can barely focus or get much done on a workday. This then makes me feel like I should work weekends to make up the time, and the cycle continues and gets worse.

I think a lot of this has been because I've been working for my advisor non-stop (summers, holidays, etc.) the whole time I've been in grad school. To his credit, he always makes sure I have things to do, so I'm not just thumb-twiddling, and I don't feel like I work any harder than he does... the guy's an animal!

Has anyone else dealt with this, or does anyone have any good advice for me? I feel like I could really use a vacation, even as much as several months, but I know that he's already got projects lined up for me this coming year. Problem is, I'm also sure that as I get done with these projects, more will just keep coming.

I feel guilty asking for time off when he doesn't take much time off for himself, and he's quite well-respected in his field, so I feel more like he's doing me a favor as my advisor and I don't want to lose the relationship I have with him. He's done a great job advising me thus far, and has connected me with some good internships, but I just can't keep up!"

But here is a little background on me:

 * Graduated May 2013 with a BS in Finance and Management from a good state school
 * GPA: 3.0 (oddly exactly 3.000) Major GPA: 3.3
 * From 14 till today with the exception of all of freshmen year and my semester abroad I have been employed
 * Worked 25-30 hours a week for 3.5 years as a pizza delivery driver during college, did some managerial duties without ever receiving any title. (I was offered but made more money delivering)
 * Leading up to college I worked 5 years at a fast food restaurant doing a variety of jobs at the same restaurant
 * Had an internship at Enterprise Rent-a-Car, which on name alone has gotten me some interest from some companies

Now I have a concentration on financial planning, insurance, and risk management, which means I have been contacted by a LOT of financial planning companies, which have ranged from the legit to not so legit. But a lot of them involve me cold calling and hitting up friends and family as potential “clients.”

I’ve applied to multiple organizations for a multitude of different jobs, some I’ve been qualified for, some I’m not 100% qualified for. I’ve got a lot of no’s and I have also gotten a lot of non-response from companies, which I am assuming is a less involved way of saying no.
What I would really like to do is get involved in project management or some type of implementation work. Essentially going out and teaching/training customers how to use our product. I like to travel and moving around the country has always interested me. Im also real interested in procurement, supply chain, and logistic type work.
What I am looking for is any direction, help, guidance, or any information that could help. Constructive criticism is welcomed. Maybe you have the same interests as me, maybe you’re in the field, or maybe you have some insight. Something, anything would be great."

1nhr2h,2,2013-10-01,Tomorrow I am applying for my first apartment. What are the tips and tricks you wish you had known when you were in my shoes?,Organic_Dixon_Cider,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nhr2h/tomorrow_i_am_applying_for_my_first_apartment/,"First, a little background on me. I (M/24) got out of the Marines over a year ago and am in my second year at a junior college. I've lived with my family for the past year but this is starting to put a strain on our relationships and we have decided it would be better if I moved out now vs. waiting until I transferred to a university. I have a steady internship position that pays well and will employ me as long as I am in school. The apartment I have chosen is 25% of my monthly income (including utilities) and the payments won't be a problem. *no roommates 

**TL/DR 24, financially stable**

Here's a short list of things I have picked up through googling.

* Get everything in writing.

* Take pictures of everything before moving in and host them on a third party site with timestamps.

* Check every appliance, outlet, and door locks for functionality during the walkthrough, before signing the lease.

* Visit the complex at various hours through the night to get a feel for the area. *I have been lucky enough to stay the weekend with a friend who lives in the complex. The place is eerily quit for friday and saturday nights.*
* Renter's insurance is not an option, it is a necessity.

**Edit- I'll add all advice here for anyone searching this subject in the future.**

* Visit the actual place you will be renting!

* Ask about previous tenants owning animals.

* Check the number of washers and dryers vs. units in the complex.

* Get the landlord to like you. They will be more willing to fix problems immediately. Nitpicking every small problem is a great way to get on the landlord's badside.

* If you get a chance, introduce yourself to your neighbors so you know who they are and they know who you are. 

* Cleaning supplies, clean everything your first day 
* Remember to book an elevator 
* If your neighbor plays loud music at 3am do not pound on the wall screaming obscenities... instead call the building manager the next morning to deal with them. 
* Never let someone you don't know follow you in the building... at the very least ask to see their door key. 
* Know what your lease says and under what circumstances you might forfeit your security deposit. 
* Do you get a parking spot? is there street parking? (cities and towns usually have special street permits for residents) 
* Near a grocery store? (don't shop at convenience stores) 
* Bed bugs? (fuck those things, run like hell) 
* Are the common areas well maintained? if they aren't chances are the building manager or management company doesn't care
* take pictures during the tour and when you sign the paperwork -- get them printed and seal them in an envelope and mail them to yourself but don't open it. This way if something happens you have proof of the current state of the apartment.
* Keep a copy of the lease/renters agreement.
* Open all the doors and check the storage space. Open all the drawers, and closets.
* Smell the unit. Smell outside, are you downwind from things like farms/paper mills etc.
* Find out garbage/recycling removal. Ask about utilities and average cost of utilities. Find out about lawn care. Find out about fees like Home Owners Association etc. and if you are responsible for this. What internet companies service the area. What utilities are included with rent.
* Find out who it is you will work with if theres an issue. Superintendent or the actual owner.
* Are you allowed to paint the place if you want? Will improving things make rent less (ie put up a fence and the cost of the fence + labor is taken off the cost of your rent that month)
* What type of lightbulbs are recommended.

So Reddit, what am I missing? What did you wish you knew before you rented your first place?"

I am taking 15 credit hours and now that I realize that this class that is pretty difficult and taking quite a bit of studying to do well in is now unnecessary for my degree.

A few things to note, if I drop the class I will have to pay back $300 to the state of florida because of Bright Futures scholarship. Also, I will only be registered for 12 credit hours, and for my scholarships I need 30 for an entire year. This means that if I drop the class now, I will have to take a summer course (which is not too bad) but I'm wondering how that might interfere with internship opportunities.

I've been to my advisor/s and they didn't seem to concerned when it came to me dropping an unnecessary course. What do you guys think I should do? Stick the difficult class out for the rest of the semester and have to deal with it amidst my other classwork, or drop it and pay 300$ (because of my scholarship) and have extra time to do well  in my other classes?

* Graduated in 2012 from a school consistently ranked in the top ten for computer science worldwide by many different publications
* Interned at one of those famous government physics laboratories and also at Microsoft during my sophomore and junior years of college respectively (can't say what either project was, secrecy/NDA)
* My resume usually gets past the HR screen (probably because Microsoft internship and my school)

The Bad:

* GPA of 2.77 overall, major GPA of 2.85.
* At Microsoft, didn't finish internship project to their satisfaction and did not get a return offer
* At this point, I don't have a specialty: I have strong knowledge in CS theory and know several different languages pretty well (especially Java, C++, and Python)

The Ugly:

* Living at home with parents even though I'm 24
* No job offers at graduation, still jobless while almost everyone I know is working at Facebook, Google, twitter, LinkedIn, etc...
* Poor health, though not anything that would prevent me from working

There were many reasons for this, but it all boils down to enjoying the actual material better in all my CSC/SENG classes rather than my MECH ones.

Now that I'm here, however, I'm slowly realizing the scope of what I need to learn. Not just the stuff from my classes, but on my own as well. Pretty much all I have is an 'intermediate' knowledge of C and Java, as well as basic HTML &amp; CSS. I know half a dozen terminal commands (ls, dir, cd, etc) but I have never used linux for anything important.

What I'm looking for is sort of a track to get me going on being a more well-rounded Software Engineer. As hobbies, I would personally like to get a handle on web stuff (so Javascript and PHP are on the palette), and also perhaps app development.

*EDIT* - took away ""ideal job""

Not too sure what my ideal job would be, but I would like to potentially work for myself in the more distant future.

So what should I start learning? C++? C#? Ruby? .NET? SQL? What tools should I be utilizing? What ODE's are good? What are some good starting projects, or ways for me to practice? 

In school right now, I'm catching up on required courses, but I am taking a course on Algorithms and Data Structures. The problem with everything I've mentioned above is that I do have a fairly full course-load so I can only do these things in my minimal spare time. But hey, my girlfriend just moved away for a 6-month internship, so it looks like I'll have a little more of it.

And do you think current medical marijuana users will switch to using recreational marijuana since it might end up being easier to purchase (no paperwork necessary\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke6jq?context=5)|I do anticipate major changes to medical marijuana in the coming months. I think many current users will migrate to the recreational system. State and city officials believe there are patients who may need certain strains, quantities, and perhaps lower taxes than the recreational system might provide. 
[In Washington state adults are allowed to brew, transport, and share beer without a license. When will legislators make adjustments to 502 to bring it more in line with the reality that marijuana is safer than alcohol? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke8mh?context=5)|Probably when the federal government changes marijuana's standing as a Schedule 1 dangerous drug. It's pretty hard for state lawmakers to treat pot just like alcohol when the federal government treats pot very differently than alcohol. Essentially, the feds have created a situation where they say they will let WA and CO go ahead with legalizing as long as we keep it tightly regulated in a way they approve. 
[As a CO resident, this is an issue I've definitely been following pretty closely on our own state. What are some of the major differences between the ways the two CO and WA will be regulating the retail sale of marijuana? Holder and the DOJ have claimed there will be little intervention regarding the retail sale of MJ, do you forsee that being the case, or do you think we'll see a lot more DEA activity in WA and CO? Also, how long do you think it will be before we see full-on legalisation at a national level? Thanks for this AMA, btw!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke4lz?context=5)|Here is a [side-by-side chart](http://i.imgur.com/3gbgoON.png?1) comparing WA and CO laws and rules, prepared a little while ago by the Liquor Control Board in WA.
 |As for the DEA, here in WA the top prosectuors have suggested they will go after medical marijuana operations that they think are skirting or violating laws. 
[Do you see Seattle becoming a city like Amsterdam, with coffee shops serving as places to buy pot or will it be more open than that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke4ud?context=5)|I think Seattle, at least initially, will be less open than Amsterdam. The state's ban on indoor smoking and Seattle's intention to enforce the pot law's ban on public consumption make it unlikely that we'll see a thriving pot tourism business for a while. That said, city officials have said they want to find a way for people who don't own homes to consume pot without doing it in view of the general public. This may lead to some sort of cannabis cafes, if they get get around the state indoor smoking ban.
[When you say ""people who don't own homes,"" do you mean people who rent and are not allowed to smoke in their units? Or do you mean people who cannot afford any sort of stable housing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccked61?context=5)|I meant, or rather city officials mean ""people who don't own homes."" They've raised concerns that people who rent won't be able to consume in the privacy of their abodes. They don't want these folks to get ticketed for consuming on streets or in parks so they're want to come up with some solution. 
[Do you honestly believe the Seattle Police are going to ticket people for smoking in public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckekts?context=5)|Fascinating question. On one hand, they haven't, and you probably know that they handed out Doritos at Hempfest in a clever PR/educational move. But on the other, the mayor and city attorney say they want to enforce the pot law's ban on consuming in general public view. That would require police to write tickets. I get the sense the police will do it if they get clear unambiguous orders to do so. Otherwise, they've got bigger things to worry about, is my sense. 
[I believe the city has tried to create a civil citation -- like a parking ticket -- settled in municipal court. If I write a letter explaining the circumstances of my infraction, do you think they'll lower my fine to court costs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckez70?context=5)|You're right about what they trying to do. It would be a $103 civil infraction for public consumption. And yes, Municipal Court has a history of reducing some fines for people who appeal. Not sure what argument they'd warm to in this instance. 
[How keyed in do you think government officials are to the way the tax rate on cannabis will affect the continuation of a black market?  Since people have been buying illegally for so long a large tax rate could make legal cannabis very overpriced relative to the sources they've already been using for a long time.  Are officials concerned about this or is there enough of a ""Sin Tax"" contingent from the less liberal parts of the states that the tax rate may end up prohibitively high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke5c3?context=5)|I think state officials are acutely aware of the complex interaction between supply-price-youth-access and illicit market. Generally, low state-system prices (and low taxes) means greater use and more youth access, but less illicet market. High taxes and higher prices means less overall use and youth access but a healthier illicit market. The market will ultimately determine prices, but state officials hope to arrive at a sweet spot in taxes and prices that produces a healthy legal system without fueling youth access and addiction. 
[My mom's 90th birthday party is Dec 1, which I understand is the date recreational marijuana becomes legal in WA. She'd like to try it but won't until it's legal. How can I get her some to try at her party?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckeh1v?context=5)|First, adult possession of up to an ounce became legal last Dec. 6. Since then we've been in a weird limbo where it's legal to possess but not legal to sell. I presume people continue to get their marijuana products from medical dispensaries or from illicit dealers. (Dec. 1 this year is when state rules for a recreational system must be in place.) You or your mom could get medical authorization, or find someone to sell you illicit weed.
[Do you think marijuana will ever be decriminalized on a federal level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke4et?context=5)|I think it is inevitable, much like repeal of the 18th Amendment prohibiting liquor. But I don't think it will happen for a while. There's not huge impetuts in Congress. Only 20 states now have medical marijuana. Many in the reform movement think that if California approves legalization in 2016, it will effectively be game-over for prohibition. The state's top pot consultant, Mark Kleiman, has said he thinks we'll have national legalization or decriminalization in Hillary Clinton's second term. I've got several questions about assumptions therein. 
[Will there still be dispensaries for those of us who use medicinal cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke3sn?context=5)|That remains to be seen. State officials are now working on recommendations about what to do with medical patients when the recreational system opens. 
[I've heard that the State will be leaving the MMJ system alone for some time. They don't have time to put together the recreational system, overhaul the medical one, and deal with the protests that would occur. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckf04m?context=5)|The state budget requires 3 state agencies to come up with recommendations for the future of MMJ by Jan. 1, 2014. What those changes may be, and when they'll take effect remains to be seen. But it seems logical that the state would want to move quickly because they want the legal system to succeed and are concerned that a parallel, largely unregulated and untaxed medical system could undermine the recreational system. Some of the first ideas for recommendations have surfaced. They include reducing amounts that MMJ patients can possess (now 1.5 pounds), and taxing MMJ, but at a reduced rate, and tightening the requirements around getting a medical authorization, i.e. higher level of proof of the qualifying conditions.
[If it's limited to 334 retails stores, what happens to the current crop that are up and running now?  I ask this assuming there are more than 334 now because it seems like they're on every corner.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckecoh?context=5)|If by current crop you mean medical access points, or dispensaries, it's unclear what will happen to them. I think many will become recreational stores. I think others may remain as medical operations. But to be clear, any current dispensary owners would have to apply, undergo background checks, and get licensed by the state before they could become recreational outlets. 
[I'm a reporter in nearby Issaquah covering I-502 developments. Do you share my concern that aggressive state tax will keep the trade largely in the black market? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/ccke8lk?context=5)|I do not, although that's just my opinion and not supported by facts.  I think many people will be willing to pay the taxes (25 percent on growers, processors and retailers) in order to buy legal, quality-tested weed. To be clear, many users are price sensitive. The state's consultants stress that most users are not college-educated, and not necessarily affluent, thus sensitive to prices. But they also point out that the growers' wholesale prices and markups could dramatically effect prices. They're proposed scenarios in which retail price could be as low as $6 per gram -- but also scenarios where it could be $17/per gram -- all depending on markups and wholesale prices. 
[Thanks for your answer, Bob. I had not seen those proposed scenarios, only covered the 25 percent taxed at the three levels of consumer production.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckhgc8?context=5)|The state consultants did one long study that covered those. If you're really interested email me (byoung@seattletimes.com) and I can try and get you a copy. The principal author is Jon Caulkins of Carnegie-Mellon if you want to ask the state Liquor Control Board for it. It's a public record. 
[Is it currently legal for me to give someone else some weed in Washington?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckelsx?context=5)|It's my understanding that you cannot give weed to someone. 
[Maybe not legally, but ethically and practically you absolutely can. My question is: what has been your most profound philosophical insight on cannabis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckfxz2?context=5)|Not sure if you mean most profound insight about cannabis, or under the influence of cannabis. I'll assume it's the former, which is a great question, though it's hard to pick one insight. I remember attending a meeting at which the Liquor Control Board has convened testing experts from around the country. And as they threw around terms like ""flame ionization diagnosis"" I realized this is rocket science in many respects. There are a lot of really smart people working in different aspects of marijuana. And there's still a vast amount of science to understand, such as why do some chemicals in the plant work the way they do. I was quite moved by the story featured by CNN's Sanjay Gupta of the little girl, Charlotte, who suffered from Dravet's Syndrome which caused her tiny body to be wracked by several hundred convulsions a week, convulsions that would ultimately kill her. None of the conventional treatments her parents sought worked. As a last resort, her conservative parents turned to marijuana, and it seems to have worked. (btw, Charlotte gets pot in a gooey form that she takes orally; she doesn't smoke.) Charlotte now suffers only a few convulsions a week. Her physical and mental development has returned, if you will, and she's now almost on par with her twin sister. That is profound, to me.
[Are you looking for interns or other knowledgeable folks regarding Cannabis? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckevap?context=5)|We're always looking for journalism interns. We're not specifically looking for an intern on the pot beat. Though you should feel free to contact me about your expertise. I'm always looking to improve my knowledge. 
[The level for DUI is zero for those under 21.  How long does active THC last in the blood in chronic users if they quit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckf3w1?context=5)|I'm sorry I don't know how long THC remains active after one stops using. 
[As far as you know, are you the first reporter at any mainstream newspaper in the world with a marijuana beat? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckj7fz?context=5)|No, I'm not the first. My predecessor Jonathan Martin worked the beat for a couple years here at the Times, through voter approval of Initiative 502. BTW, in reply to comments below about how long active THC stays in your blood, Jonathan reported on the DUI standard and debate around it during last year's campaign. Based on reporting I did earlier this year, neither the city of Seattle nor King County were prosecuting an increased number of pot DUIs under the new 5 nanograms of active THC per ml of blood. We will periodically check back on that, but I think the real test will come after the state-regulated stores are open. 
[As always, what is your opinion on people abusing the system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckfd5q?context=5)|Which system are you referring to?
[I mean, abusing Medical marihuana as a general.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckg5xr?context=5)|I think some abuse the system. How many is impossible to say, especially since we don't know how many medical patients we have in WA. We are the only state, as I recall, to not maintain a patient registry. I suspect there are many people who use MMJ for ""wellness"" -- insomnia, anxiety, digestive problems and more -- that are technically not qualifying conditions under state law. So are they abusing the system if they use it for their health? I think it's a tough question.  I don't think the medical patients help their cause -- and may feed some claims of abuse -- by using strains with names such as Chernobyl, AK-47 and Green Crack. Who would name a medicine ""Chernobyl""? And who would argue the government should never dare tax ""Green Crack""? 
[I really think legislators dropped the ball on this part. For now MMJ can still grow their own, I can only hope this will be applied to everyone eventually.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckh7ct?context=5)|Again, I think it's fear of the feds that keeps the state from allowing small home-grows. That, and the desire to collect tax revenues from the legal retail stores. 
[It's not legal advice. It is the position of the Seattle Police Department.  Don't sell to people under the age of 21.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1no6uv/i_am_reporter_bob_young_i_cover_marijuana_for_a/cckfau7?context=5)|They stressed not to sell to anyone under 21 because it is still a felony. Initiative 502 did not change that. And whatever they implied, it is still not legal to sell recreational weed in WA. You must be state-licensed to do that, and licenses won't be granted until December or January.

1nohha,1,2013-10-03,[Build Help] Is BaPC suitable for a small business with a budget? Or is buying better?,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1nohha/build_help_is_bapc_suitable_for_a_small_business/,"I'm currently working for a small non-profit organization. We're trying to update our Pentium 4 PCs with XP Home on them. It's time for an upgrade.

I spoke with my boss and he was willing to commit to buying several new Dells and several Mac Minis, I'd say maybe 3-5 new computers. Despite me being a huge Apple fan, I stopped him a bit and told him I could possibly find a better and cheaper solution for him. 

While I love Apple, they lack the support for Lao language that Windows 8 has. We're a non-profit that deals in Lao, Thai, and English and Apple is the worst when it comes to Lao language support, it's non-existant, so I want to push for Windows 8.

Since he was ready to commit to buying Mac Minis ($600), I figured I would try to build something a bit cheaper, maybe even around $3-400.

But is it a smart move? They currently pay $200 a month for an IT guy that doesn't really do much (well, probably because we pay him so little). It isn't a big business, there is only 3 full-time workers, two full-time interns, a few volunteers, and part-time consultants and interns that usually bring their own laptops. What I'm getting at is that there might not be a huge problem with support for these PCs if I were to build them.

Just asking what /r/buildapc thinks or if they have any input/experience on the matter."

1nodkq,0,2013-10-03,"I don't know if CS is the right major for me, but I also don't know if it can lead me there",I_am_Andrew_Ryan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nodkq/i_dont_know_if_cs_is_the_right_major_for_me_but_i/,"Hi there, I'll start with why I'm currently a CS major as a freshman.

**I have no idea what the hell I want to do with my life.**

I didn't even want to go to college till about junior year of high school. I wanted to join the army, see the world, meet interesting people, have the government pay for my education, and be a total badass. 
Then, with the end of high school looming over me, I realized multiple things.

-I'm not physically adept, at all. 

-I hate being ordered around by a system of bureaucratic nonsense. 

-And I want a family to come home to every day. 

Well now what do I do? I've never thought about what I want to do beyond ""what I want to be when I grow up is batman/an astronaut/a firefighter because they don't need to learn math"" when I was little. 

**I chose CS because

A. I like computers a lot. 

B. I'm good at using computers, I spent a summer working at a repair store because I knew how they worked and I liked fixing them.

C. This apparently pays well or something?

D. Game design is something I'm interested in.**

These may or may not be the correct reasons for choosing CS. Unfortunately, I don't know if CS can also be a stepping stone into another degree that is perfect for me. 

**Currently, I'm learning the basics.** C++ coding for dummies. ""hello world"" and all that stuff. Right now? I'm liking it a whole lot. I spend time on a tool I know very well, formulating ideas and coming up with a solution to a question using my skills. The problem I'm having is, I don't know if going deeper into this major there will be a moment when I say ""nope. this isn't actually what I thought it was going to be when I started."" Recently I spent hours on a problem, going over and over in my mind why I thought this was the right code, only to have the right answer staring me in the face.

**I'm terrible at math.**

No actually, I'm amazing at geometry and physics.Those were my best classes in high school made an A+ in both. The worst? pre-calc, and algebra. I failed algebra the first time, and I barely got a B- with pre-cal my senior year. CS is math based. This slightly worries me. I've learned I'm really good at solving real-world problems and physical dimensions and the like, but formulas and such are the devil.

I know that getting a CS degree is nowhere near actual coding and things. I worked as an unpaid intern in a computer repair store, and I fared either on par, or sometimes even better than the guy next to me with A+ certs. Degree != proficiency. I want to know how I can remedy this. 

I've heard before that computers are the biggest and fastest growing industry right now. I can believe it. But how does that affect me at all? Can I get a good job more easily? Can I be paid on a higher scale than my classmates upon graduation because of the major I chose? What are the real numbers involved?

**I also am very interested in game design**. Yes, yes I know this is a very popular misconception in CS, that you will learn to be a game programmer. I know that CS is not the straight line to game programming, but I also don't know what to do with computer science as a major. I think I would enjoy learning how to program, and learning how to use programming to solve problems. But if I could be a part of a game? That would be the best thing in the world. Can I get there through CS or a simliar degree?

Seen Indie Game: The Movie? Tommy Referenes. He's both what I want to be, and what I don't want to be. He's an awesome programmer, knows how to make a beautifully crafted game technically, but has no social life and is chronically depressed because it takes a lot of work and involves constant worry about whether this will bug or this code isn't executing properly. I want to be a creator, behind the scenes of something that is almost universally well-acclaimed to be top-notch mechanically. I don't want to be working day and night, not knowing whether or not I'll be able to make money off of these hours and hours of work. I understand that these wishes are a bit hopeful, and they are. I'm just looking for something good, not something perfect.

 This movie sort of solidified within me the exact reason and motivation behind my desire to work in the gaming industry.

**I want to affect people.**

**I want to make something**, be it a AAA blockbuster like Bioshock Infinite, or a slightly unknown indie title like any of the fantastic games on Steam, and have it affect people. Speak to them in one way or another. Be art, be fun, be challenging or innovative. One of the most crucial points in my life was during junior year of high school. That was when I decided that the military was not for me, I want a beautiful wife, beautiful kids, and a comfortable home to raise them in and be an all-american-white-picket-fence-homeowner. I also broke up with my shallow girlfriend I had at the time, and started dating my then best friend and now girlfriend of 2+ years. What stood out to me about that time among all of these major points was the game Bioshock. I know it's not the best game ever, I know that its watered down System Shock 2. But to me at the time, it was art. It was beautifully crafted, amazingly executed, and I wanted to get to know it intimately. I knew then that video games will from then on be something I can appreciate for something more than just a pass-time, but can be appreciated as a better medium than any other entertainment (possibly barring books, that shit's awesome) 

**I think CS is the place to start.** I decided to just start with programming, and go from there. If I end up coding software for British Petroleum? That's okay with me, I need to support a family. If I develop the next Super Meat Boy? I honestly hope I make good money doing it, but I know I will be at the very least happy that I did something in the world of games.


TL;DR: read the bold, I'm in CS right now, I don't know if its the best for me because of my failings in math classes before, but I know I could maybe do programming. Mostly I want to work on software, and more specifically games. I just want to know where I can go, what my options are, and what I can expect.


So I suppose my questions are, 

-what the hell am I doing wrong (because I'm sure I am doing something wrong)

- What can I do that is right,

- and how do I do what I want to do within the system of education that is before me."

[John, can you please yell at me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbt9t?context=5)|Go fuck yourself!  :)
[If Obama asked you to rescue Congress.  What would the game plan be?  They already SHUT IT DOWN.  So, what's your next move?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbex8?context=5)|If I was president, I would get in a car, I would drive to the Capitol breaking all precedent, I would walk up the steps, walk into a conference room, and sit leadership down.  And I wouldn't leave until the deal was done.  Rather than posturing and excuses, I would find a solution.
[Do you ever blink?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfav?context=5)|If you're speaking physically, yes.  If you're speaking mentally, no. 
[Hi Jon,  I’m a big fan of your show and I thank you for doing this AMA.  These days, with all the reality shows on air, it’s hard to distinguish which segments are scripted and which are not.  Can you give us some insight as to how much of the show is legitimate?  Are the owners/employees of the bars really that stupid/ignorant or is it just an act?  Also, when and how do you install those hidden cameras so that the staff is unaware?  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbhhg?context=5)|Well I will answer in the order it happens.
 |The cameras are installed a day to 1.5 days before I get there.  Yes, everybody knows the cameras are there.  But amazingly, after a day, they just start to forget and people start acting normal again.
 |Next, Bar Rescue is shot in real time. Day one is my recon, Day two is training and stress test, day three is training and tasting, day four is remodel (actually 36 hours so I can put that to rest) and then day five is when I reveal and we open.
 |None of Bar Rescue is scripted, ever.  We create situations like the stress test, a staff meeting, a meeting with the owners, and those situations of course I work into my thing, but nothing is scripted, ever.
 |As far as how do we find this people? Somebody says ""yes, Mr Taffer"" for 45 minutes, that's not going to make great tv, so if that's the bar I chose I would be a fool.
 |We have over 1,000 bars submit to be rescued.  We look at them all, and we pick what we think will be compelling.  We pick what we feel will be compelling stories, interesting people, interesting scenarios... In the end, the Bar Rescue is more about people and storytelling than it is about bars.  
[• What was your favorite bar to rescue and why?  • Can you discuss some of the off-screen interactions you have had with bar owners who were ungrateful for the work you did for them?  • Do you ever return to any bars you have rescued?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbem0?context=5)|Off-screen interactions:  The thing about Bar Rescue is it's absolutely real.  Not one word is scripted. So if there's no camera present, I don't talk to anyone.  None of the employees or owners have any contact with me off-camera.  Nothing happens off camera, and nothing is scripted. Period, END OF DISCUSSION. What you see is what you get in Bar Rescue.
[My friends and I have been planning to do a Bar Rescue bar tour once we graduate next year, and we would love to see you at one of them! Thanks again for the AMA. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbem0?context=5)|Do I ever return: Sure.  I will pop in one or two to say hello when I am in those towns.  As intense as Bar Rescue gets, with the exception of one or two times, it almost always ends positively where I have a great relationship with the owners and employees.  In fact, I'm talking to the network about doing a ""back to the bar"" kind of show where I go back and visit with cameras.
 |Favorite bar to rescue: Already answered.  Spirits of Bourbon was one of my favorites in regards to results, but favorite bar based on individuals, I would choose the Alexander Family, which owned Characters which became Moonrunners.  And that was the episode where the brother used to beat the hell out of the sister (mentally) and the sister was always crying and the family dynamic was a nightmare, and we changed the entire family dynamic, and it was a very powerful, emotional things to see.  It was one of my personal favorite episodes because I felt really bad for the younger sister.  But changing a dysfunctional family into one that loved each other was one of my greatest accomplishments, I think.
[Hey Jon big fan, who would be the first person you would like to encounter in a butt funnel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbuwl?context=5)|A butt funnel is something I invented about 25 years ago.  And it's one of the greatest tools of nightclub interaction I've ever done.  It's a narrow entryway to a dance floor.  It's wide enough to cause 2 people to go through it at the same time, but it's narrow enough that it causes the two people to have to turn sideways to get through it. So to answer the dance floor, the two of you are staring at each other in the face about 18 inches apart, stimulating interaction and eye contact.  First it's the butt funnel, next it's a drink, then it's breakfast.
 |My wife! ONLY my wife.  I've been with Nicole for 16 years and I would still be excited to go through a butt funnel with her. 
[What Bar Rescue are you most proud of either in terms of the changes you made to the bar or the changes you made in the owner's life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfs6?context=5)|Well I think the one I'm most proud of for both would be Spirits On Bourbon in New Orleans.  I looked at one of the owners, and called him a failure, twice.  Now, their revenues are up $100,000 dollars a month.  The barbershop chair is one of the most photographed attractions on Bourbon Street.  And lastly, Steve and Brad (the two owners) just bought a warehouse to stock all their souvenir cups.  And people should check out their Facebook page, which is fun: [Link to www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/SpirtsOnBourbon)
[Our question is:  Which bar rescue was the most difficult one for you?  Also, what is your drink of choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbf8q?context=5)|Pirates comes to mind because it was so bizarre, and uncomfortable every minute I was there.  I can't really say this about any other bar that I've rescued, but I did not like those people, candidly.  And I did not enjoy one minute that I was there.  It was my most difficult in that regard.  The other one was Headhunters, where the owner did not pay the employees and was such a joke that I wound up rescuing the bar for the employees, not him.  I gave the employees a choice, if I would rescue the bar or get them jobs down the street.  And had they chosen the second option, I would have walked out of there, I was prepared to do that.  The third was Zanzabar in Denver.  That was an Israeli military owner that I got in a physical altercation with.  He called my chef ""fat boy."" And I went at him and we had a fight.  And Ami was one tough cookie.  Four days later, he called me an angel and hugged me when I left.  And that's the beauty of Bar Rescue. 
[Love your show. My family owns an Italian restaurant/catering business in Cleveland. I will probably inherit more and more responsibility/ownership as I get older. Any tips for the future? We had to close a location recently but still have 2 catering locations and 1 restaurant up and running. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbprc?context=5)|You have the responsibility to keep a family legacy going, not just a business.  It's always managing costs that will keep the business going.  My suggestion is, don't change what your family has done, just make it better, make it deeper, make it more relevant.  Also, one more suggestion: go to work for a chain restaurant for a couple of months.  The problem with a lot of family businesses is that the only experience they have is within that one business.  Go to a chain who's really good at systems, procedures, controls, get exposed to it for a few months.  Then go back to your family business and you will see so many opportunities to make it better. 
[Jon,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfhy?context=5)|He's a great guy.  He is a great guy.  I must say that I was told (and I believe it) that he had never seen Bar Rescue before he met me that day.
[Is Big Cat from Barstool Sports the best guy you have ever met? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfhy?context=5)|And I must admit, when I cut loose on him, there were moments I thought he was genuinely pissed... still might be. 
[Hey Jon, thanks for doing this AMA! I'm a huge fan of Bar Rescue. I was lucky enough to meet you back in July at On The Rocks Las Vegas. (Such an amazing event!\)  EDIT: Found a picture of us in Vegas! Link to i.imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbsn5?context=5)|I think I remember meeting you!  You really should come to the Nightclub &amp; Bar Convention in Las Vegas, from March 24-26. [Link to www.ncbshow.com](http://www.ncbshow.com)
[I mentioned a startup company I recently founded called BreathAdvisor. In an effort to break away from the hokey breathalyzer machine reputation, we have created the world's most accurate breathalyzer kiosk designed to save lives.  We cap the readings to deter people from using BreathAdvisor as a game, and users can even request a cab directly from the kiosk. (We’ve already seen this save bar staff time.\)  We've had great feedback so far, but I was wondering… **As a bar owner, would you have any concerns that we haven’t addressed?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbsn5?context=5)|But here's my concern.  Sometimes these devices are used as contests to stimulate drinking, not to keep it responsible.  In essence, who can fail quicker amongst friends.  That's concerning to me.  Also, the ultimate responsibility lies with the employees and management, not with a device.  I would be concerned that the presence of that device moves responsibility away from the people.  Thirdly, if somebody fails on that device and does not get in a cab and drives home and gets hurt, and in theory, somebody from the bar should have known that, the bar would be more liable with the machine than with not since the customer was proven drunk before they left.  So I have a bunch of concerns.  But even though I think I'm always right, there are one or two times when I haven't been.  
[Jon,  I was proud that your show did a gay bar, are you going to do any in the future, were you worried about any controversy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbpxt?context=5)|No I wasn't worried about any controversy.  The gay community is a very big part of the bar and hospitality industry.  To me a gay bar is no different than walking into a rock n' roll bar or a hip hop bar.  Like any bar, I need to be tough, and show the staff that I respect them and that in fact, I am fighting for them.  I respect and fight just as hard whether they are gay or straight, I didn't feel any different, and if you watch the episode, I certainly didn't act any different.  
[Jon you are legend. I heard you had a role in developing NFL Sunday Ticket? To what extent is this true?  Loved your video on barstool last week. Viva. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbkc3?context=5)|This is a long story so I'm going to try to tell it short.  In the mid-90s I was hired by a satellite company that wanted to buy sports programming from the NFL and sell it in other cities.  It was called ""out of market sports programming.""  My company was hired to put together the business plan, financial models, and programming model for the bar industry.  The satellite company went to the NFL to license the rights, the NFL chose to do it themselves, and put me on the advisory board of NFL enterprises.  I then worked with the NFL to finalize, create and roll out what is now known as Sunday Ticket.  So I did not invent Sunday ticket.  The idea pre-existed me.  I was a creator of the Sunday Ticket product.  
[1\) Have you ever considered taking a protege under your wing? If so, let me know how to apply. I'm 100% serious.  2\) If congress was under a stress test right now, how many rolls of stickers do you think would have been put on the congressmen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfpv?context=5)|1)  You know, I have, and we do bring interns in.  As a matter of fact we are looking at starting an intern program in Las Vegas.   People can send resumes to us to info@tafferdynamics.com and we often can't respond to everyone but we certainly look.  We are not actively hiring, but there are projects where we do involve interns and students and people like that.  I see it as a personal responsibility to pass my knowledge down, so doing things like that is very important.  2) I think I would have gotten past the stickers at this point! I thinK I would have fired them all.  If you watch Bar Rescue, you know I'm not into posturing or ego.  I would have shot them down individually, not the government.  And candidly, I don't know why it's wrong to call a politician an ass on national tv.  Or a liar.  I don't understand why it's politically incorrect if they are.  I would call them out.  And I think they would think twice if they knew they were going to be called out in embarrassing ways. 
[What is the weirdest theme or gimmick that you've ever seen in a bar?  If that's not clear, maybe an example would help. An Irish Pub would be an example of a theme or type that is fairly normal. What is a super-weird one that you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbeob?context=5)|Well I can to speak to one that I created many years ago. Midget tossing as a bar promotion.  That was pretty darn strange.  I've also given away breast enlargements in nightclubs.  We hung the ""before"" and ""after"" brassieres in the men's room.  The girls that lost got ""booby"" prizes.  
[Have you ever seen a bar that was unable to be rescued? Due to location, popularity, and other circumstances?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbqr7?context=5)|I can rescue ANY BAR.  I can't rescue any person.  From a professional psychologist standpoint, changing human behavior takes 21 cycles.  Quitting smoking takes 21 days, changing something at work takes 21 shifts, learning to exercise takes 21 visits.  That is the science of human behavior.  In Bar Rescue, I have 5 days.  Steve, the owner of Headhunters, by the middle of day two I knew he could not be rescued.  I was prepared to walk out.  The staff asked me to stay.  If that guy stays in business, then it makes no sense to me, the only reason is because of Bar Rescue because he does not care about people. 
[What is the best advice to someone who wants to open up a bar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbntr?context=5)|1) First have a cool dad like you.  Next, money money money.  Opening a bar is tough.  The business is NOT inherently profitable.  You have to make it profitable.  First-time bar owners sometimes run out of money before they learn how to make it profitable.  If you had the money to make it through your mistakes, you have a much better chance of finding your profitability.  Football coaches say they never lose a football game they only run out of time.  Bars don't fail, they just run out of money.
[It seems like the commonality behind every failing bar is a failing owner. Have you ever been to a bar where that has not been the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbntr?context=5)|2) Yes.  Absolutely.  And I can't wait for everybody to see it: on October 27 is our very special episode, the Hurricane Sandy episode of Bar Rescue.  The episode is called ""Hurricane Jon versus Hurricane Sandy.""  In this episode, I take winner owners who had a very successful business that was robbed from them by Superstorm Sandy, and we do our most aggressive, most complete, biggest bar rescue EVER.  And if anybody misses it, they are going to hear from me. 
[One of the most appalling things on the show is how dirty and unsafe the conditions in most of the kitchens are. Without actually going into the kitchen what are some things customers should look for which can indicate clean and safe food preparation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckc3y1?context=5)|It's funny that you would ask this question, because on 10/7 I am doing a guest spot on the Rachael Ray show and she asked me that very same question.  And I answer it in detail there, but the fact of the matter is there three or four things you can look at when you go through the front door.  
 |Is the back bar clean and organized? Does it look like it's detailed?
 |Are the furniture, carpets and tabletops clean and detailed?
 |When you look at a menu, is it clean, professional and detailed?
 |Here's the premise: a restaurant with a dirty dining room will NEVER have a clean kitchen.
 |A bar where the back bar is a mess will never have a clean, organized kitchen.  So scope in the front, and you'll know what you got in the back. 
[Obviously, this was on Gordon Ramsay's turf, but if you had to walk into Amy's Baking Company, do you think you could have rescued them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbq1k?context=5)|I love Gordon.  He led the way for creating the format and style of the show that myself and Chef Robert Irvine (who's a dear friend of mine by the way) followed.  But there's a big difference between them and me.  I'm not a chef, I'm a businessman.  I go out to businesses and ownership in a different way because I'm coming from a different place than they do.  I'm in awe of the work that Gordon and Robert both do, as I know they respect mine.   That said,  I believe I can fix anything.  And if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be who I am.

[Jon,  I'm always amazed by the bar owners that refuse to budge from what's obviously been a losing strategy for a long time.  They are deep in debt and on the verge of closing, yet refuse to change the business name or image.  Surely these people have seen the show in past seasons and see that what you do does work.  Why are they so resistant to change? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbee6?context=5)|Some people are not the brightest bulbs in the box, candidly.  And they make thousands of bad decisions that got me there that day.  And they knew they were failing before I got there, and knew there were failing when I got there, and sometimes I can inspire them and get them to change.  But on some occasions, I can't. 
[When there is the recap after the show, and it says that sales went up by say 15%, while it was better than it was previously, how can that possibly be a big enough change given the amount of debt?  A big fan. Watched since episode one, and also follow on twitter! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbq5q?context=5)|What the show doesn't say, because we  don't provide so many details so it's boring, sales could be up by 15%, beverage costs could be DOWN by 50%, or the food costs DOWN by 50%.  So it's the increase in revenue and the lowering in costs that allows them to stay open.   Also, that update is typically only a few weeks after we left.  Their business tends to keep growing after that update. 
[Big fan. How many of the bars that you turned around ended up closing down anyway later down the road? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbfl1?context=5)|I actually start shooting my 50th episode in a few days which is quite a milestone.  As I understand it, and I don't track it full time so I may be off by one, maybe two, we've done 49 episodes and I believe 5 have closed.  And I might add in every case the owner told the camera that they were going to run out of money in a month or two.

[Jon, I know you have been adamant about changing bars around the United States, but have you thought about coming into Canada, perhaps even the more populated parts of Southern Ontario? Just curious because the work you do with some of the bars you work with is really top class. Have you ever thought about taking the show to Canada for an episode or two, and if so, which place(s\) did you have in mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbrzn?context=5)|Actually we have talked about going there with Bar Rescue, so all my Canadian friends know I've worked up in Canada for the past 20 years quite significantly.  I've worked with the Roadhouse in Calgary, I've worked in Toronto at Prince George, Nova Scotia, Halifax, Monkton, and many other places.  And I look forward to getting up there with Bar Rescue cameras one of these days. 
[, Thanks for doing this AMA! Me and my dad are big fans of the show.  Second, I have a question.  What was the experience like when you first started helping bars get back on their feet (not the first episode of Bar Rescue, but in your career\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbetn?context=5)|The greatest thing about resuscitating bars is that it makes people smile.  The customers smile, the owners smile, it's a really positive and exciting thing when it happens. And it's very motivating.   When I do my job well, it makes people smile.  And that's pretty cool. 
[Who was the most entertaining owner to work with? Do you keep in touch with any owners long after the shows?  My Sundays would be incomplete without Bar Rescue! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbt7w?context=5)|It's up to them as to whether we keep in touch.  Everybody knows where they can find me.  I've developed very good friendships with some of them.  With the exception of Pirates, I've left everyone in a good relationship.  Bar Rescue is very intense for me.  I build very close relationships with all of these people while I am there.  I have very personal discussions with these people.  This past week I had a waitress crying to me when she didn't have money to buy baby formula because the bar I was rescuing was such a failure.  That makes this personal to me.  I can't let these people down.  Many times, they are what inspires me.  Feeling bad for them inspires me.  If you watch carefully, I tear up pretty often.  If it's intense and powerful for you guys to watch it, it's much more intense for me to have lived it.  I want to share that with everybody.  When you are living it, it's even MORE powerful.  
[What advice would you give someone who wants to open thier own bar one day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbrek?context=5)|Work in one!
 |Don't open a bar if you like hanging out in bars.  Open a bar because you want the business.  Counting the bottles, building the space, keeping it clean, making the customer smile. If you are doing it because you like hanging out in a bar, build one in your basement, it's a lot cheaper.  
[Hi John! HUUUGEEE fan!  I have been working for a pub for four years now and have worked my way up from bussing to management.  Now that I am managing, I have found out that it is all quite dysfunctional. The managing partner works two shifts a week and i usually end up working one of those, my bar manager is kind of full of himself and is running away all of the good servers in order to give the prettier servers more shifts, and I feel like it's just myself and another manager trying to right a falling ship.  We haven't had a work meeting let alone a manager meeting since i started managing in January.  What should i do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbqur?context=5)|Get 10 customers to agree to come to a ""Focus group meeting"" at your restaurant while it's closed.  Only yourself and the managing partner should be there, no other management or employees.  Pick those 10 carefully.  When an owner hears it from the customers that the bar manager is chasing people out, etc etc it becomes far more meaningful than hearing it from you.
 |They will always question your motive and whether you'd throw someone under the bus. They will always think of it as being an opinion.  When a customer says it, it's a fact.
[Thanks for doing AMA Mr Taffer. I've always wondered what is the most disgusting thing you have found in a bar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbst2?context=5)|The first thing that comes to mind is rat shit in chicken.   Raw chicken being served to my daughter was in one of the episodes, which was about as disgusting as you can get.  In Headhunters, I found about 50 cockroaches in a bottle of whiskey.  I'm not sure it gets much grosser than that.  I went to Headhunters with my wife and a cockroach walked across her foot.   
[Has the show ever considered showing the construction process? I'd love to see how the actual bar is flipped and turned into the final product.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbpt4?context=5)|We're doing more and more of that now in each episode, where we are showing time-lapse of the actual work being done, and you'll see a lot of that in the Hurricane Sandy episode. 
[When/ How did you figure out that the bar business is one of your passions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbf1n?context=5)|I didn't plan it this way.  I went to college for political science, I was a musician when I was young and played the drums.  I loved music, and I got a bartending job when I was starting college, and one thing led to another, and I got hooked.  I wound up staying in bars, and I stayed in the industry.  What people don't know about me is that I've opened many restaurants, not just bars, I've been a food and beverage director at a resort, and a hotel general manager.   So I actually have a broader hospitality background than what is seen on Bar Rescue.

Do you still ever get behind the kit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbyqe?context=5)|I've never said this before, but I'm sitting in my office and to my left is a Roland, studio quality V drum set.  Further to my left is a Marshall mini stack, and two guitars.  So the answer is, I play the drums all the time in the privacy of my own office with the privacy of my headset and my ipad.

I took lessons in jazz drumming when I was younger,  I played in rock bands and jazz bands, I played blues, when I was a child I used to go to broadway shows with my family all the time.  A good tune with a good hook is great no matter what type of music it is.
[What kind of music do you listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbyqe?context=5)|Sometimes I wish I could have been a litigator, arguing cases in courtrooms and arguing for people.  Because at the end of the day, my motivation is being an advocate for something or someone during that day.  You see me being an advocate on Bar Rescue.  At this particular moment, I'm being an advocate for me, and I'm always an advocate for something.  
[I was wondering what the best part of the show was for you?  We all see the resolution at the end of the episodes, but what owners stuck out the most that have actually changed?

I get to see the looks on everyone's faces, there's not denying that doesn't get old.  But actually, to me the moments that feel the best are sometimes the ugliest.  I use confrontation as a tool.  It doesn't scare me.  I have five days to change the way somebody thinks.  My greatest moments of moving their brain are my loudest.  I always scream for a reason.  I always use confrontation in a very purposeful and deliberate way.   I act mad, but I'm not.  I am consciously forcing someone to hear me because they never heard anyone else before me.

And its whole purpose is to inspire you, so put on your seatbelt and have a good read.  Your question is a great one, and the answer is yes.  Sometimes I look in their eyes and motivate them through compassion.  You've seen it on Bar Rescue.  Sometimes I appeal to their pride by mentioning their family, wives, families.  Sometimes I play to their fear by asking them where they're going to live when a place closes, what they're going to do.  And sometimes I play to their own personal ambitions if it's there.
[What tips and thoughts do you have ft hosts of bar trivia? Any great promotions, insight, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nnxpm/i_am_jon_taffer_host_of_bar_rescue_and/cckbrew?context=5)|Bar Trivia is a lot of fun because it's interactive. The problem with Bar Trivia is that it can lower the energy of a room, rather than raise it.  So it's not about the trivia, it's about the presentation of the trivia.

The problem with college bars is discounting.  College kids go where the drinks are cheap and the beer is very cheap.
 |College towns are all about building them inexpensively and keeping costs low so you can sell cheap.  Personally, I'd rather go to places where I can sell at higher prices.  I will receive far more income with higher prices for all the money I've invested.

1no5o5,2,2013-10-03,Software Developer looking for advice from the wise!,EntropicTempest,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1no5o5/software_developer_looking_for_advice_from_the/,"I apologize, this will be fairly long, I have included some background before the actual question.

Hello! I am currently working full time at a small company, we'll call Job1, that provides many different services for mainly small businesses. Currently, I work in software development and specialize in C#, and have worked extensively with the .NET framework and MVC for the past year. I have not completed my degree yet, I have 21 credits left that I have been doing online to receive my Bachelors in Computer Science. Oh, and I am 24.

I took this job a year ago as an internship opportunity. It started out unpaid for about 3 months until I started getting paid for my work. We don't have a whole lot of development projects, but we do have a couple larger projects that have been around since before I started, and for the past year I have been the only person working on them. I started out just making very small changes, but eventually I have developed entirely new features. Prior to this, I had no C# experience, but only Java, C, Perl, and awk (all for very small periods of time in college).

Most of what I have learned has come from my own trial and error or internet research on any new topics I was learning. I knew the basics of programming, and C# was a very easy language to pick up, but I was pretty much on my own without any sort of mentor around to guide me. I have recently took it upon my self to pursue my Microsoft C# certification and have been reading Andrew Troelsens C# 5.0 and the .Net Framework 6th ed to try to sharpen what I already know and of course, learn something new.

Over the past month, I have been somewhat 'ready' to start looking elsewhere for a job, as I feel like the current environment I am in (working largely solo with absolutely no mentorship or team environment) has not been adequate to the development of myself as a professional developer. I have been approached by 2 companies in the past month that really got me thinking about this more and more, but I am concerned about some ethical issues of one, and some of the same issues I am facing now with the both.

One of the companies, is actually a client of ours. Let's refer to them simply as the Client. The Client has been in business with Job1 since before I started. They have commissioned Job1 to develop a program (which I have worked on extensively and am the only person with Job1 who has worked on it now), and since have been paying a service agreement for maintenance and pay for new features. They own the program - we just maintain it.

I was approached by them a couple weeks ago while I was onsite working on an IT issue (I do IT for Job1 as well). They told me didn't see the point in paying X amount per month and would rather do it in house, and thought I would be the best for the job. I had some serious ethical concerns with this though; it is Job1s biggest development contract and losing them would definitely hurt the company. No one would likely be in danger of losing their jobs, but I am not the one who makes those decisions. They pretty much want to hire me to work on their program, as well as any other development they may need for their website. They're not a small company, they probably have between 20-50 employees, and they're growing and still opening offices in different parts of the country.

Another concern I had was something my step-mom had pointed out to me, that I could be a 'one-trick pony'. I would really only being working on one project, at least in the foreseeable future, and I would likely be the only person developing these programs. I feel like it would present to be my biggest challenge yet, but I know I could do it. Again, my biggest concern here is the ethical issues..is it just business, or does it kind of make me a shitty person to do this? Because it kind of does make me feel shitty, but at the same time it sounds like they're going to just hire someone in house anyway. Also, I feel like I may be stuck in the same position I am now. I do not know how important it is as a Software Developer to be part of a team, or have that mentor starting out.

The other company who approached me was a previous employer. They want me to work for them but I feel like the role would really be temporary, since they just want me to build a retail website (they're a fairly successful company on Amazon, one of the top, at least in their department). Also, they would want me to be they're ""IT guy"" as they put it, but in all honestly IT is not something I really wanted to make a career out of.

Lastly, I have considered applying to other companies in my area. I live in Central Texas, and would like to stay in this area at least for awhile more. When looking for places to apply to for in Software Development, what should I consider? As a developer with 1 year experience in C# and a nearly complete degree, what can I expect to find?

Sorry if the post was kind of drawn out, but to kind of recap to clarify what it is I'm asking:

* What are any ethical concerns about going to work for a client of my current company, thus ending the relationship between the two?

* As a Software Developer, how important is it to work with a team of developers and/or work alongside senior developers in regards to building my skills as a professional developer? EDIT: Especially at the beginning of my career?

* What are considerations to make when deciding on what kind of company I want to work for, and what can I expect in terms of opportunities as a developer with a year of experience and a nearly complete degree?"
1nnleb,0,2013-10-03,"Keep going to school, or get a Firefighting job?",r_Dubwc,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nnleb/keep_going_to_school_or_get_a_firefighting_job/,"I'm a sophomore in college and I'll get my AA in the spring and I've got both Fire/EMT certs in my state. The trouble is I'm conflicted of what to do, (potentially) get a job as a FF/EMT or do I keep going to school? I'm enthralled with politics, both domestic (US) and international. I'm currently a Honors student with a 3.8 GPA at my community college and I've got a direct transfer to the bigger school down the road once I get my AA.

The honors director and other faculty members have been telling me that they feel I would be not be reaching my full potential as a FF. The thing is that I'm a Fire explorer and love the job, and I know exactly what it entails, how much I'd be paid etc, but over the past few months it's been an internal struggle on what I want to do. 

Recently I learned of an opportunity to be an intern and study in DC for a semester (only to find out the opportunity only cost a low payment of $14,900) and that really pushed me more towards keeping on with school. As a FF I could still take online classes and work full time, but I am not a fan of online classes, it feels as if something's missing and I'm not actually in a class. 

One thing that I can't 'grasp' in my head is that my certs are good to go in 30 something states and that I can extend them indefinitely by being a volunteer FF for 6 months every 2 years, but I feel as if I'm walking away from an opportunity to make a lot of money at 19 years old. The jobs aren't even a sure thing but I'm certain in my mind I'd land one of them. It feels as if I go to school now, I won't come back to be a FF, which may be a good or bad thing, but going to a school far from here and landing an internship is a chance that may only come once in my life and it could very well change my mind on what I want to do in life. 

My parents say they'll support me either way, but I know my father wants me to get a job, move to a town nearby, work 20-25 years and retire as a FF. He says I have ""youthful idealism"", I always talk to him about current events in US politics and throw about solutions I think of  and he says that later in life that goes away, that one day I'll stop worrying about how anyone can fix the system and more towards how I can play the game to make it beneficial to me, but I think it's complete bullshit and he's just jaded and cynical. 

The struggle is most definitely real. Or I could just say no to keeping on with school or being a FF and just keep working up the ladder at my grocery store (absolute last case scenario). 


TL;DR : I'm 19, and I can't decide between 2 paths in life, be a FF or keep going to school and decide what I want do then. I'd like opinions from outsiders. "
1nn5ti,108,2013-10-03,A note about GPA...,bacon_rainbows,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1nn5ti/a_note_about_gpa/,"I've been on this subreddit for little over a year now and have always enjoyed the posts about GPA and thought I might offer some perspective. The following are just my experiences and thoughts about what led to my GPA lowering/raising.

I started college in the Fall of 2008 and enrolled in a general engineering program at a university in the Midwest. After realizing my school did not offer the program I became interested in (Aerospace Engineering), I decided to transfer to the University of Minnesota the following year. The following years were a mix of frustration, guilt, and determination. My first two years were a complete joke. Being a new student I was often more interested in meeting new people and making friends as I didn't know anyone in the city I was living in. I partied quite a bit (although not that much compared to liberal education standards) and spent my weekends recovering from hangovers (but always finishing assignments on Sunday night ha). I was always diligent in attending my classes in the beginning of the semester but as it dragged on I would miss a lot of classes, especially the early ones but sometimes even in the afternoon. Even though I was missing some classes, I would always read the subject material and would spend hours studying and doing homework problems. Despite my best efforts, I would always do terrible on tests. After 3 semesters my GPA had slipped from a 3.15 to 1.74. To many of you that would seem insane. How did I not stop it from falling that far you ask? In my head I would always justify with other reasons. Early on I always thought ""C's get degrees!"" Yeah but C's don't get jobs as I found out when applying for internships. My roommates would often start partying on Wednesdays and would sometimes stay up till 3:00 am playing loud music. Lack of sleep led to more sleep ins than I would care to admit. Another reason was not really getting to know anyone in my classes. This was often difficult early on because you were in a class of up to 300 people (Physics/Calculus I, II, III). And as my grades slipped over the years, the biggest problem was the never ending doubt. Am I cut out for engineering? Maybe I should be Mechanical? Do I really want to do this for the rest of my life? These questions caused a lot more stress than they should have. 

However after my worst semester (3 D's and a B-), I decided to reform my studying habits and my educational lifestyle. As I retook some of my classes I realized that main reason I did so bad in them was because of my half ass effort in building block classes (Physics, Calculus, Statics, Chemistry, etc.) Attending class became a personal mandate of mine. I also got to know more of the engineering students by joining student groups and participating in competitions. For instance I became a member of Engineers Without Borders and The American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics and participated in the CanSat competition and SAE Aero Design competition. All of these drastically helped me as I made more friends (of which I could study with), increased my knowledge of engineering, and prepared me for an engineering career. Most importantly they displayed leadership, a quality that is not overlooked in resumes. During this time I applied to jobs and internships and never had any success. By the time I graduated I had raised my GPA back to 2.97 (my last year average was a 3.5). I applied to hundreds of jobs (literally) over the year and especially this summer. I had plenty of interviews and talked to many head hunters, recruiters, and hiring managers but nothing ever panned out. Often I thought it was because of my GPA. I mean how could it not be? An employer wants someone who can communicate, work in a team, and has plenty of skills. Those can all be accomplished relatively easily, but a below 3.0 GPA? Toss it.

Not true. Don't believe it. Why? Because I recently accepted a job to work as an Engineer for the International Space Station. Does GPA matter? Of course it does. But it's not everything. Your chances at getting a job are just as good as someone with a 3.5 as long as you have experiences or skills to back it up. College is what you make of it. Make no mistake no one is going to give you a degree or a job easily. You have all the tools and resources, you just have to know how to use them. If I have any advice for those of you with a low GPA, it's this: do whatever it takes to go to class (even if it means moving out of your house), make friends and study with people in your major, participate in anything engineering related (even the red bull air races ha), apply to EVERYTHING, and don't ever give up. In the end it will benefit you no matter what and one way or another, someone will notice and reward you with that job.

What do I need for an internship?,DuhGuy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nmuol/in_high_school_what_do_i_need_for_an_internship/,"I'm a junior in high school in the Chicagoland area and have been programming for about a year now. 

Although I'd dabbled before, I officially started when I watched the videos of Harvard's cs50 course in December. I did the homework assignments that involved C (so the first half) and then stopped to start learning java on my own for the AP Computer Science test, which I got a 5 on this May. I also took a VB course, which I found fairly easy.

Projects I've done include assisting programming (I mostly did autonomous) our robot for FIRST in Java, creating a platformer based on theCherno's game programming tutorials and later entering two Ludum dares (finishing one) based on it (Java), completing the first 21 project Euler problems the week before school started in August (java), making a pretty and iPhone-supported Tetris on Processing.js, making programs on my TI-84 such as pacman or programs for math team or calculus, and a tic-tac-toe game, single or two-player, in VB.

I'd say I'm well-acquainted with the Java Collections, having used ArrayLists and HashMaps and knowing the other Collections available to me.

Most of what I know about algorithms would be from ProjectEuler and the AP Computer Science course (search/sort, best path, how many paths, blah blah)

I'm weak on threads/concurrency/serialization and networking since I haven't worked on them much, though I hope to soon. I'm weak (ignorant) on web programming, knowing only how to do HTML and processing.js and applets.

TL;DR: I'm a first year Java developer.

Knowing this, I was wondering if it would be hard for me to get an internship with my age and experience. I'm super interested in programming and was hoping that you guys might know what I might have to do to get one. If not not an internship, is there a market for freelancing for what I've
been doing? Also, how on track am I for the future? Will colleges recognize the work I've done so far?


EDIT: Thank you for the thoughtful replies, I'll keep them in mind as I keep on programming! Seems to be that I'm ahead and that I should keep working on what I work on now, learning more, and getting an internship in college unless I know someone."

How do I prepare for these interviews?!! When I interviewed for my internship, it was really basic questions, but I've heard that for full time positions they ask MUCH harder questions, especially about algorithms and time complexity (my weakest points IMO).

I also have a behavioral interview with one of the companies.

Can someone please give me advice on how to prepare for these interviews? Knowing that I'm not very strong in algorithms right now, what should I read/do to get myself ready in the next two weeks???

1nmsq2,3,2013-10-02,"Reddit, I think someone might have started stalking me (35F). Help?",buzz_off_fucker,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nmsq2/reddit_i_think_someone_might_have_started/,"About six weeks ago, I started a new job that I love. I'm in a department with great people.

A few weeks ago, a new guy was hired in a different department. I saw him leaving the main office and he's of a different ethnicity of most of the employees so I noticed him right away, but then so am I, we're of the same ethnic background. I hadn't met him until last week when my department went to their building to help finish up some projects.

One of my coworkers (I'll call him S, we're good friends at work) was talking to him, he called me over because the new guy (let's call him B) mentioned that he's doing continuing education with the same university, in the same program and at the same level (related to the job, actually) that I happen to talk S's ear off about pretty regularly. I introduce myself, say I can't believe that we haven't at least crossed paths once in almost three years of this program, but hey, whatever... We're also about the same age (I think I'm a bit older), similar background, etc., so S and B and I are chatting it up. B seemed like he was full of himself, but a little lonely too, as he just started and doesn't seem to have a lot in common with the people in his department. He also had really wanted a position in our department but I guess our boss didn't feel like he met the qualifications, even though he's pretty experienced, although B said he didn't tell our boss about being in the continuing education program. (Weird in retrospect.)

He couldn't figure out why I was in the department I was when I'd only been there for a few weeks longer (where I work, you usually start in a particular department and work your way up and then move around if you want to, but I'd taken an unpaid internship via the continuing education and proven myself...I hadn't planned on working there but I loved it so asked for the job, even offering to start on a lower level but my boss placed me where I wanted to be). I explained the internship, and he kind of scoffed. I blew it off and didn't think much of it.

I had asked my boss if I could leave at lunch that day, since our department was caught up on all our projects and we were just killing time helping out the other department, he said sure, go ahead. So when lunchtime came, I told S to have a great day, see you tomorrow and hey B, it was nice meeting you.

B still wants to chat, so he walks with me to my car, saying he needs to move his to his building, as he'd parked at the main office for some reason. The different departments being in different buildings, each building has it's own parking area. Ours happens to be up front by the gate, just past the main office, so he basically walks me all the way from one end of the facility to the other. So we chat some more during our ten-minute walk, and suddenly bells start ringing in my head. He's starting to remind me of a few pathological liars and generally mentally unstable people that I used to know. I make sure to bring up my husband a few times (as if my not-inconspicuous wedding set was suspect-I also made sure to discreetly flash it at him once or twice). We get to my car. B says ""oh, this is your car! I noticed it my first day."" Sure, fine, I drive a somewhat distinct car with a few decals on the window, and have a vanity plate. But I realize I need to NOPE THE FUCK OUT OF HERE ASAP. I try to politely excuse myself, and manage to do so.

The next morning when I see S, I pull him aside and say, ""Hey, I know B seems really nice, and is having a hard time making friends in his department, but when he walked me to my car yesterday I got a bad gut feeling about him. So be careful, okay? And don't tell him anything personal about me."" S says, ""Yeah, I spent most of the afternoon with him and a lot of stuff he said just didn't add up."" He made some examples of stuff that B said while I was there, I agreed and that was pretty much that. We've joked about it once or twice since, but this week I don't know if it's come up at all. I asked my boss about him, and he seemed like he was on the fence about him and probed me a bit, but I didn't want to seem like ""OMG he's creepy!!!"" so I dropped it.

Fast forward one week, to today. When I got to work (I'm usually one of the earliest arrivals, I like to drink my coffee and check the task calendar in peace), B's car was parked in our parking area...in the spot where I usually park. The driver's side door was open and the dome light was on, but I didn't see B anywhere. I called around, but no answer. I wasn't about to go shut that door. When I walked to the main office a little later to pick something up, I noticed the door had been shut. Okay, just a little weird. I didn't see B all day; I managed to miss him at lunch and on breaks, even though I was running all over the facility all day. His car was still there when I left.

Tonight, I'm sitting on my front porch with a friend who'd stopped by (husband is upstairs reading) and I'm telling him about this guy at work that's a little creepy. Not five minutes later, a car that looks just like his drives down my street, in front of my house. It slows down when it sees my car (thankfully in my neighbor's driveway across the street, I've never been thankful before when my friend took up the whole driveway with his big-ass truck!), I say to my friend, ""Holy shit, I think that's B, the guy I was just telling you about!"" When the car, windows rolled down, stops at the stop sign (our house is on a corner), the streetlight illuminates his face... IT IS B. He turns left (the street dead-ends) and he comes flying back through, doesn't even pause at the stop sign. I'm flabbergasted.

Now, I know that he lives about five miles away, because he just moved to this area and we were talking generally about where we live last week. But there is no reason for him to be in my neighborhood, there's nothing here but, well, a neighborhood.

So. I tell the husband about this, and he's not happy. Usually if I think I'm overreacting, I'll run it by him, he's a good litmus test. Since he's worried about it (I have my CCW, he suggested I start carrying to work, which I don't currently because I don't have a good car safe/lock), that makes me take this a bit more seriously.

So, readers of Reddit, any suggestions on how I should handle this? I don't want to jeopardize my job, my boss has already given me more opportunities and responsibilities than anyone as new as me has gotten, so I really don't want to bring it up unless I have to.

I don't even know B's last name, and it would probably look like something else to the work rumor mill if I tried to find out (we don't have an employee database available to us).

I also want to tell S about the random drive-bys tonight, but not sure if I should or not.

TL;DR: new dude at my awesome job gave me the mild creeps last week. Parked in my parking spot today. Drove by my house twice tonight. Am I fucked?

I'd very much like to go to grad school for CS, so I plan on doing some of the AI/Robotics research if possible, and I'm just curious if it will hurt me in the long run if I decide to head to industry instead of grad school . . .

I'm interested in ML/Data/Bioinformatics, but I'd happily take some work in AI/Robotics if I can. We have one CS elective in AI and one in ML . . . I plan on taking the one in ML if I can. The research and AI/ML classes are all taught by the same prof, and I'd like to work with him.

I guess my big question is that I see everyone talking about working outside of classes on projects, building a github resume (I have my linux configs and homebrew scripts there now), and getting some internships. But no one ever mentions research. Is there a big difference between the two when it comes to industry?

In terms of industry I think I would like to either be a *nix/sysadmin for the money, or a software engineer for (google) somewhere that I could use the ML/datascience stuff . . . I guess I like the science/math stuff, and enjoy coding. I'm not at all interested in web/frontend stuff is what I think I am trying to say.

Even though I was taking a sadistic number of credits per semester, my GPA is slightly above 3.6. I went to my school's engineering career fair and got a lot of surprised responses when I told recruiters I was looking for internship opportunities. I felt uncomfortable when they suggested I should apply for full-time positions. I can't imagine having a fair shot against people graduating with any significant internship experiences already under their belt. I still feel like it's a terrible idea to apply for full-time positions. Am I wrong? How much of a chance do I stand?

1nr1w9,1,2013-10-04,Need help configuring Server 2012 Standard for Small Office,Reddcapp,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1nr1w9/need_help_configuring_server_2012_standard_for/,"The picture I had in my head to begin with (which is slowly becoming impossible) is having the office server run the office domain, where everyones personal virtual desktops would reside as well as a shared network drive for company wide documents, files, etc. Anyone could login from any computer on the network into their own personal virtual desktop and all management, deployment, and monitoring could be done from the SINGLE instance of Server 2012 Standard. 

Im trying to set up first the main server partition with AD DS (active directory domain services) USING our domain of something.net, not something.local. This, from what i've read, is completely OK now and would allow us to use email addresses as login names for the virtual desktop environments. 

The first question becomes: What configuring do I need to do, the main server partition being the domain controller, for it to correctly interact with the DNS server, which in our case is called computer.otherdomain.com (if you ping something.net, its the same server and IP address so I can safely assume both domain names are on the same server). I have tried using the DNS IP as the static IP but then i cannot connect to the internet, so I doubt im actually doing this right.

Second thing I'm trying to get into is installing the Remote Desktop Services. I attempted once to install it alongside the Domain Controller (same partition) but evidently that is NOT supported and completely screwed up the install so much so that I had to reinstall. What i've found is that I need to install RDS and the remaining virtual environment services on another server or in my case a virtual dekstop running server 2012. That virtual machine would be running RDS, the Connection Broker, Virtualization Host, and Web Access server. 

So a summary of questions would be:

1. How do I use an external DNS server for our server?
2. How do I properly configure RDS and the other Virtual Desktop Infrastructure services on the same server, virtual or otherwise?
3. Why the hell is this all so difficult and no clear-cut documentation on the web of something seemingly every business uses today, including my university?

Hopefully this all made sense. I copy/pasted this from an email I sent my dad an hour ago (he's been a network admin/sys admin/information assurance for about 20 years) to save time and hopefully its not disjointed. I changed some information around to not share personal info. Thank you in advance for help, I recently got this job as an internship and am currently flying solo when it comes to all of these issues as no one else in my department has been hired on yet (very small company thats been run by one person for a number of years). The ""training"" I'm supposed to be getting has quickly turned into teaching myself. Im learning other things but nothing helpful with this problem."

1nqgap,1,2013-10-04,Should I accept this Internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nqgap/should_i_accept_this_internship/,"**A bit of background:**

I'm a 3rd year (Junior) Computer Engineering student focused on the software side with knowledge in hardware.  I'm planning to graduate within a year or two (Spring 2015), so this coming summer will be my last to find a good internship.

I have no real job experience, no research or any notable accomplishment towards my career.  I just have a really good GPA: 3.970

**Now for the story:**

A couple of weeks ago, I went to several internship and career fairs and I received two offers. 

One of the offers was a good engineering/Software company.  They give internships during all semesters, and they are close to my school so I could go there during Fall/Spring.  Problem is, I failed their entrance programming exam on account of not having known the material (The test consisted of 3rd-class tier Java material when I had just entered 2nd-tier).  They said they liked me a lot, and that I could contact them again in the future to try again.

The other offer was from a non-Software/Engineering company.  I don't know how much information I can say, since I haven't signed anything, but for the sake of covering my butt, I'll just say it's one of the big Insurance companies.

They offered me a contingent job offer for the Summer of 2014.  The position is basically IT/Systems (in the way they call it) where I'll most likely be doing App/Website stuff in Java.  I'll be flown out to another state for about 3 months.  The internship is paid at around $18/hr @ 35 Hrs/Week with living arrangements covered by the company.

I have about 10 days left to accept the contingent job offer, and I'm just wondering if it's a good decision to go?  

**Would IT/Systems internship do anything to enhance my career?** 

**At what point in the hiring process can I back out of a deal if something better is offered?**

**In general, what should I do?**

Long story short, despite being a top performer, I managed to lose $10,000 (GM said that would never happen) by August. As a college student, that's kind of a big deal. I have to give him my contracts from the Summer some time in the next few weeks.
Anything special I should do for the occasion?

Some notes:

I produced $70,000, was billed for $60,000 directly from the company

Had to take out a $1000 insurance policy (yeah, you read that right)

GM referred me to a past FM selling his truck, guarenteed it would run for the whole Summer, it made it a month. $1300 down the drain there.

They never actually taught me how to paint a house.

Almost had to drop out of college because of my new debt.


I can't seem to think of the perfect parting words. Hopefully redditors can point me in the right directions."

I began interning at a very well-funded tech startup company in the southeast US in May of this year. The team of developers is about five total, including me.

I started my internship making $20/hr, and at the end of the summer, I was given a raise to $25/hr and an offer to stay on part time throughout my senior year. My boss really likes me, and he has given me reason to believe that he will soon give me an offer to come on as a full time developer after I graduate in May.

I'm pretty good friends with my boss. He's not too much older than me. When he gives me an offer, though, I plan to negotiate of course and get the highest salary I can. What should my approach be? I don't feel like I have much leverage as a current intern. I'm already working for this company, and I haven't been job hunting because this seems like a for sure thing that I'll get hired on full time. I just want to make sure I don't get shorted on salary.

I've been lurking here for the past few months, and I've learned a lot of useful information.  I need help with something though.

A little background first. I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering student doing relatively ok in my major (I have a 3.0 and have never failed a class).  I have never been in a study group with people in my classes, and never seen a professor about grades or hw help.  I have a small group of friends, most of which are studying things that are hardly related to what I am (the closest is a MechE).  With this being my Jr year I will be needing an Internship this summer,  I am also looking at doing graduate school.   The information that I have been receiving on both of these is ""talk to people"" and ""have relevant and interesting clubs and competitions on your resume.""  I don't talk to my professors because they intimidate me, and I don't do any Engineering extracurricular because getting out is very difficult for me.  The things I need help with are:

* Is not doing any Engineering extracurricular activities going to hurt me?  Do I just need to suck it up and find a club or something?  
* How do I approach professors about graduate school? 
* Would you still recommend a study group for me even though I have made it this far alone?  If so, how do i go about finding one?

Thanks for reading my post.

**Edit:**  I didn't mean to make my situation seem so bleak.  I am heavily involved with a couple of clubs on my campus. However, they are not even remotely engineering related.  One is a martial arts group, and the other is a group that plans a campus wide, week long game of tag every semester.  I was wondering if the fact that I don't do engineering extracurricular activities is going to seriously impact me. "

My son Jariah is missing. My little 8 year boy has been missing for nearly 2 months today; the police have no leads, and the case went cold last month.  Understandably, I’ve given my input to the case, but they say I’m delirious; I need rest. And to all honest ends, I understand their point of view. 

My little Jariah went missing late one evening while coming home from the subway around rush hour; and to preserve my safety, I won’t give any specific locations or names; they’ll be ‘X’d out. We were coming home, and it was fairly busy. The subway musician idly playing the music as they would; something which I and Jariah both enjoyed. It is always a change from the hustle-bustle of the train ride home from the malls, and the talking of strangers on phones or among their peers. I was never a people-person ever since my wife was murdered; or to be more correct, vanished. Her body was never found, but police deemed it as a murder. It was hard for both of us to move on and get on with our lives. But we managed eventually. 

However, this walk home would be a life changer; the subtle sounds of a man playing the tune on his violin and the clatter of shoes against the subway floor is what I’d usually hear until we passed through the turnstiles towards the exit and walk the rest of the way home.
 I always held my sons hand when we walked through the subway; any good father would but...

I remember losing the sound of his little feet; his innocent giggling about half way to the exit, when I looked down. In my hand, all I had was the single bag he’d carry. My little Jariah has disappeared. I freaked out as soon as I found out.

“Jariah?”  I called out, spinning around. “Jariah!!” I called back into the oncoming crowd. I rushed back, pushing between the people. I pushed people out of the way, unconcerned for their being. All I wanted was my son.

“Jahriah, where are you!!” I ran past the violinist, stopping as I ran by. “Sir, have you seen a little boy?! H-He just slipped out of my hand!” I yelled frantically. 

“Oh no; no I haven’t what did he look like?” he inquired, as he put down his violin. 

“H-he’s a little child, hip height, no taller than any of us!” I began to breath heavy. The violinist sat me down and began to try and stop the passersby. He suddenly picked me up y the shoulder.

“You go look down the line, I’ll be here to see if he ran back!” He gave me a quick push, and I nodded in compliance; my little boy is here somewhere, he can’t just vanish. I spent the next several hours pacing the subway hallways, scanning shops, bathrooms and spending a week’s worth of transport fair getting in and out of the turnstile. 

By now, the crowd was diminished. Only me, and the violinist remained in the now quiet halls. He only looked at me and shrugged. He began to pack his things.

“I’m sorry sir,” he said with sincerity in his voice, one only a street musician would know “I didn’t get any word on your child. I’ll put a call in with 911 rep-“

“No, I’ll do that.” I cut him off mid-word. My heart racing still, body sweating and feeling nauseous, we went our separate ways. We turned our backs and left the subway lines; him with his violin and change, me, more a less empty handed. I only had the little bag for children, with no child.

When I got out of the subway, I flicked open my phone; here I could get reception. I quickly dialed for the police, and to my dismay, they couldn’t put a search out until an entire day has passed. My heart sank for a moment. However, they were kind enough to send out a missing child alert for the region. It was enough to relax me for a moment. Now I live in a big city, in case you couldn’t tell, with the subway, and thankfully public televisions are set up all over the place and are always fixed on the news channel. With the report going around, someone somewhere must be able to find my child. 

That night when I got home, my body ached for the regular routine. I set two places at the table for dinner; my heart sinking when no one would be eagerly waiting on the other side. Later that evening, I called out, “Jariah! Come brush your tee--“ I cut myself off.  I went to Jariah’s room to tuck no one into bed, before reading the empty air a story, and then heading to sleep.

That night, I had a very unsettling dream. My son was running towards me and me towards him, but in the air around us, the sounds of violins were playing. They were playing a tune that would be soothing in any other situation but here, they were eerie; it wasn’t right. Next to that, as longer the dream progressed, the farther me and Jariah got; we just kept running towards each other, but we got farther.

I called out to him, “Jariah! Come here!!” and I heard him call back.
“I’m coming dad! I’m ...” His voice trailed off, as his figure disappeared into the unknown crevices of a dream. I awoke in a harsh cold sweat that morning, my eyes shooting open as the real world’s light brightly shone in as if nothing was wrong. Body aching and irritated. I breathed deeply; realising that my eyelashes were still bound by that morning crust. 

I sat up in my bed, remembering that I don’t need to wake up my son this morning; I didn’t need to make him breakfast or lunch for school. I sighed, and walked down into my silent living room. I begrudgingly turned on the TV, expecting world news, war and politics to be topping the headlines. But as I tuned the TV into the news channel, the headline caught my surprise.

“A young boy has gone missing on the XXXX line during 5:45 PM yesterday evening. Jariah XXXX went missing during the rush hour movement, and presumably disappeared into the thick crowds and was carried off. Police are currently putting out signs and information to help find this little boy.”

They’re looking for him! My heart leapt in my chest. For this information to have made it on the front of a major news network, it meant it was pretty big. The newscaster continued to list a few other names of the missing, but all I cared about was my Jariah. Although the news didn’t mend the hole in my heart that I had that morning, it did give me hope.

I had a rough day at work, I couldn’t concentrate for my life; I had pictures of me and Jariah around the small cubical I called an office. I worked in info and technology, so it’s not important to dwell on; but the images of my son distracted me. I found myself staring at one; a picture of us on a camping trip where he’d chopped his first log.  I just wanted him to leap out of the picture, and say “daddy, I’m okay, see? I could do it...”
I found myself mouthing those words; the words he spoke when I took that timed picture out on that trip.

“Hey.” A voice mumbled from behind me. I swivelled in my chair, still with a dreamy glare on my face.

“...Yeah?” I really wasn’t in the mood for talking. My friend, Ivan, leaned worriedly against my cubicle wall. He’d been a dear friend to me; he was there for me when my wife disappeared, and like an angel, here he is when my son vanished too.

“...I heard about your kid. Um...” He didn’t look at me, scared say too much in fear of offending me. “If you need anything; anything, man. Just ask. I’m here for you.” 

“...Yeah, thanks.” I tried to be sincere. But I don’t think Ivan would know where my son would be.

For three days, I lived in this routine. I’d wake up, and take the subway to work. Ivan would check up on me, I’d do what I can then head home. But, as you’d expect, I was starting to give in. With three days in, no leads and no idea or trace of my son, I was losing hope. And it was showing.

My boss caught me staring at some of the pictures of my son during my break.  He’s usually an all-business sort of guy, but I suppose he had some compassion for me. He sent me home; at least until they found my kid.  

I was thankful, in a way; I get to stay at home and the likes, but now all I can do is think. There is nothing to distract me from my little boy.  I took it upon myself to move the investigation forward; if the police and public are on the case, I should be as well.

That evening; the night I got sent home was rough.  I had that dream again. Me and my kid running to each other, and that song; the violin. It was enchanting; I’m surprised my mind could create such a melody; let alone remember it. 

I woke up violently when the dream ended. I was out of bed, and my face was on the carpet and I was right in front of my bedroom door. I must have been sleep walking; probably trying to find my son in my sleep but too stupid to open the door.

That morning I ate a big breakfast and suited up. I was going to look for my son. I ran back to the station, begrudgingly paying for entry just to get in, and started walking with the crowd. I looked at the people passing by.

‘One of these people has to have been here when my kid vanished; if I can remember a face I can ask them where he went!’ I thought. A stupid concept, realising that I didn’t remember anyone’s face from nearly a week ago, but I had to feed myself any hope I could create. 
I looked from side to side, pacing the station hallway. The faces of people; so stone-faced and unforgiving made it difficult to tell them apart. However, I noticed that around noon, the violinist from before was back, setting up his instrument and opening his case to collect the change of people walking by. He quickly got to playing his tune; a solemn song that, at first, made me uneasy. But as the song progressed, it helped me concentrate. I could better see the faces around me. 

A few people began to drop change into his case, and others even stopped to listen; people who looked like they had places to be. They sat quietly on the benches close by, or stood across the hall just to listen. I was tempted to sit down and listen as well, but I had to keep concentrated; if I could find one similar face, I’d be able to at least get some info.

Unfortunately, my ‘brilliant’ idea was a major flop. I spent my entire day pacing up and down that subway line, with not a morsel of evidence. By the time I was done, the violinist was packing up as well. A couple people from earlier were still there; maybe one or two of them had actually left the station a while back. 

I was surprised to see them still sitting or standing where I had last seen them, idly listening to his song. But now that it was over, they looked a little sad, disappointed. 

As he packed up his things and began to move out of the station, the others left as well. They all left through the same exit; heading up some escalators to the bus terminal I never need to use.
I went home that evening empty handed; the single clicking of the turnstile only exasperated that fact. 

The walk home was not silent however. Today I was lucky enough to have a busker playing a saxophone outside of a bar raise my spirit a little, with a couple drunkards and a vagrant or two listening in on his inspiring song.

By the time I got home it was 10-something in the evening. I was hungry, tired and depressed; flicking on the TV with the news only repeating the fact my son is missing and not a trace of him to be heard. I just wanted to sleep at this point. I quickly microwaved some canned food, and ate alone, sitting in the stereo voices from my television before going to sleep.

I didn’t have a ‘visual’ dream that evening. It was more like just the sound of music playing in my head. It left me tranquil and helped me, I guess, because this morning I didn’t wake up on the floor. 

Today, I’m not going to go through with a stupid idea. I was going to go look around the city, and pass out fliers. I quickly cropped a picture of my kid and just threw it onto a MS paint image and printed a whole bunch out and shoved them into a bag. As I passed through the subway again, there was another subway musician instead of that violinist. He had that same thing going on; people sitting around the area listening. A different batch of people too; so it wasn’t like the same people are just interested in street musicians. Thankfully, the subway wasn’t all that busy today, so I was quick to pass through.
I quickly marched by, and boarded a train to a busier side of town. As I exited the train, I saw another street musician, with that same phenomenon of people crowding around her as she played. Then I hatched a plan. I walked up to the person playing her song.

“Excuse me, miss? Can I leave a few of these fliers here? My kid is missing and I could use some help looking for him.” I shyly mumbled.
“Huh? Oh sure.” She tapped her foot; gesturing for me to leave it by her case. She was very kind, and I left enough sheets for rush hour. I dropped a 20’ in her case and moved outside. It was a nice day outside, so I was lucky to be out there at that time. I stood on the corner, handing out the flier; trying to talk to people, who would only shake their head no to the question “Have you seen my boy?”
At one point, I shamefully broke down on that busy city corner.  People stopped taking the flier, and just walked past. I sat against the pole, with my head in my arms.

“Hey, are you okay?” a soft, tender voice of a woman caught my ear. I looked up; a shameful red was strewn across my face. She had a keyboard on her back, and was setting it up in front of me.

“Looks like you need some help...” she set her fingers on the keys, and began to play a soothing melody. Slowly, over time, people began to flock, taking the papers and hanging around. I felt instantly better once she started to play; a heavenly little tune and I sat against that pole for a while, just listening. 

At one point, she tapped my shoulder. “Sorry man, I need to get going. I have other places to be...” 

“...O-Oh! Okay. Thanks for the help.” I stood up and shook her gentle hand, and she walked down the street; the crowd dispersing after she left; some trailed behind her into the crowd, and others into the other crowd...

I ran out of papers unknowingly, so I was forced to head home.  The subway surprisingly absent of music here; and thankfully none of my missing child posters were scattered across the ground like I anticipated.

The station near where I lived had a musician, playing his song, which helped me get home, and go about my evening with his song in my head. I hummed it as I brushed my teeth, went to peek into my son’s empty room, and eventually hummed myself to sleep.

The dream that evening was that soothing song that lady in the city played for me; just lulling me to the point of euphoria. No images, nothing in particular. Just her song.

I did this for a couple weeks, with the same sort of scenario; some sort of musician stopping by to help me attract a couple of people, and I’d swiftly run out of papers and I’d be forced to head home. And every night, I'd have some sort of musical dream.

However, by the second month, some serious shit went down. After no progress in the case, and the news getting bored of a stale story, I was forced to do all the interviewing and talking myself. On my way home, I stopped to talk to a subway musician who was packing up; she said she didn’t see anything, as I expected, and her and her little pose of businessmen, students and stuff getting up with her; the very few people I actually saw on the subway that evening. We bid our farewells, as her and her ‘group’ went off to the station, and I, towards the exit. 

That’s when curiosity hit me. Where did all those people go to? They always seem to leave in the same direction. I decided to follow them a good distance away. They made a right; I made a right. They headed up some stairs, and I followed. One more right; I followed—and they were gone.

“What the fuck?” I mumbled out loud. I was outside of the station, on the corner of a street; the musician, and those people were gone. I spun around. I must have made a wrong turn or something; I made a mistake somewhere. I swiftly turned around, before bumping into someone.

“Shit, I’m sorry-“ it was that musician. She was carrying her instrument on her back; everything about her was fine until I looked at her eyes. There was something wrong; such an aggressive glare, so full of malice, hatred. They quickly and suddenly changed to a friendly look.
“Oh, don’t worry about it!” she said, with an up-beat tone.
We walked past each other; my heart pounding against my ribs. Her glare was so... mean; so harsh. I could still feel her eyes glaring at me, as if—I’m sure she was facing the other way but; I could feel her eyes, melting holes in the back of my head.

I briskly walked home, and never in my life have I locked my front door so quickly. I sighed deeply as I sunk into the couch, and turned on the TV. Never once, did I bother getting out of my own head to notice the long line; the names, upon names of disappearance cases across the city!

“Holy shit.” I mumbled. There was some serious crap going down here, and I’ll be damned if I’m caught up in it. But I still need to find my kid; I’m not leaving here without him.

I didn’t sleep that evening; at least not for long. For the brief moment I’d close my eyes, I swore I could hear music. As soon as I’d open my eyes, it’d be gone, and nothing but the sounds of the city would be heard.  I kept myself awake with coffee and an energy drink that I kept in the back of my fridge for working late nights at home.

I went back out empty handed around five the next morning, and I wasted no time getting to the subway to head downtown to see Ivan; something is happening, and he needed to know. There was one of those subway musicians again, playing a song of some sort. I had no time to stop. 

But as I passed that musician... right as soon as I passed, him, he hit a sour note; and it rung in my head and sank into my heart. I don’t know what happened, but I looked at him, with some unintentional fear on my face. He had this smug look; he smiled while he continued his song as if nothing wrong had happened. I had this irrational urge to go and sit by him; to listen to his song. But his damn face; that sour note; I couldn’t. With those things on my mind, I turned around and kept walking.

I blocked out all sounds from around me as best I could. As soon as I got onto the train, I knew I was home free; at least for a bit. When those train doors opened, I charged out; passing another musician. 
I never felt so much dread in a public place. When I passed this musician, she played, like the last one, harsh, rough, sour note when I walked by. It made the hairs on the back of my neck jump up, and I cringed. I ignored it as best I could; I had to get to Ivan. 

By the time I got to my workplace, it was mid day, and it took much longer than normal to get up the floor Ivan and I worked on; the elevator was broken and I’m not much of an athlete. By the time I got up those several flights of stairs, I was drained, and sweating like a pig. My boss caught onto me, probably because of how heavy I was breathing and was quick to address me.

“ ‘The hell are you doing here? You don’t need to be at work right now.”

“I...I need....” I let out a hot, deep breath. “I need to see Ivan.” 

“Hey, don’t you watch the news? Ivan went missing too.”

My heart sank to my feet. I felt sick; whatever the hell is going on, it got Ivan as well.

“Yeah” by boss continued “I’m sure he’ll turn up sooner or later. Dont get worked up too much. He’s a big guy, he’ll be fine.”

“Yeah...” I mumbled, turning towards the stairs, my hands beginning to shake, and my forehead wet with a cold sweat. 

“Hey! Be careful out there, kiddo.” Those were the last words my boss said to me on the way out.

I hung around in the building for a bit, just taking it all in. My wife, My kid, and now my best friend are missing; gone. Poof. Kaput, into some unknown void. 

I just wanted to go home. I walked out of the building around sunset after my head cleared up and I wasn’t sweating or panting. 

I went down to the subway, half expecting to see some sort of subway busker just standing there playing a song. But no. There was no one; no busker, no music. Just no one except the one or three people on the platform and the ticket taker. 

Now this area is packed with people by this hour, and my head is spinning. Where is everyone? Where is everyone going off to! A train arrived, and inside was virtually no one. I was quietly panicking; I could see what was happening, but what was causing it.

When I got to my station, the two people on the train came off with me. I tried to stay close to them, it made me feel a lot better. But when we passed one lone musician in the halls. They stopped, and listened. In my head, I’m trying to call them back; ‘keep walking... keep walking!’ but they stood, and they listened to that musician.

I booked it; I ran out of that station and onto the street. Something about those people; the music players and the fucking song--.
In the middle of my panicking epiphany, the sound of a lone violin was playing. Behind me, I saw, under one of the only lit streetlights, a lone musician, with a couple vagrants sitting around the area. 

His song, was strange at first; a few sour notes, and a little of tempo.  I turned away; getting ready to sprint home when...
The sound, of his violin became... angry. It was harsh, and it was being played very roughly, only barely on its notes.
 
I slowly turned my body, to see him in the middle of the street, playing his distorted melody, on his violin. I could feel my pupils shrinking. I began to wheeze and cough; barely being able to keep him in focus. Then, I swear by my heart; the light in the city, became... unmoving; static, light, that didn’t go anywhere past its source. It just all stopped. Windows became a solid colour of yellow; lights and lamps just became some sort of buzzing grey. I stopped coughing, fearing that noise would cause this phenomenon to take my being away, off this earth.

I could hear the sound of his violin becoming softer; the vibrato in its song began to stir, and a black haze began to emit from the bow. It sunk, and formed around his feet, devouring the colour from anything it touched, and It began to form its way towards me. 
Dark, sinister whispers were coming from that fucking cloud, or fog, whatever it was. It was telling me to ‘go towards the song’, ‘it will make you happy’, ‘leave the world behind’.

 I was dying inside; my heart was trying to leap out of my chest and run; every muscle in my body was frozen to a concrete state, and I couldn’t look away. He just played his song, and I listened. The only thing that I could move were my eyes; I couldn’t blink, I could barely breath, and I had to watch, as that fog began to creep towards me.
The whispers became louder, as if they were right in my ear; sinister temptation forced into my head, and slowly, without cue, my left food inched forward. 

“No...” My right foot followed in time. 

“No...!” My left foot went forward again; the whispers beginning to become a cackle, and the sound of his violin becoming louder. The world around became hellish; they began to bend and distort; the apartments began to lean in over us, like hands clasping onto a small insect in its palm.

“No...!” My right food shuffled forward, and this song; that hellish, nightmarish tune began to break me down; I felt my body being forced to move. I was losing control of myself.

By now, that fucking musician was engulfed in that hell fog; nothing but an inhuman form of almost liquid evil. The once-fog now dripped from his arms and anything too sharp to rundown.
I was losing myself. I was going to listen. 

“No.”

“No!” I raised my voice; hoping that someone would hear me, someone would break me free.

“NO!!” I screamed, drowning out the song, and I could feel my arms come back to my power; I clasped them over my ears and yelled louder than I ever have. I shut my eyes; my knees gave in, and I put every ounce of air in me in that last, final yell.

It was nearly a minute before I ran out of breath. I slowly, fearfully... opened my eyes.

The world outside was quiet. The vagrants looking at me in the middle of the street, on my knees and panting like I’d run a marathon in a minute. The musician stopped playing his song, and was looking at me worried.

He briskly walked over to my side. “Sir, you look I’ll. You should come with me to the hospital!”

“No...! I—I know what you are now...!” I mumbled, backing away on all fours.

“Come... With... Me.” His voice; distorted and perverted with a sinister intention. He looked at me, and I looked at him. His eyes; a feral and inhuman glare; filled with hate; full of malice. 

I got up and ran. And I fucking ran! I got home in what felt like a fraction of a second, and I shut everything. Doors, windows, shutters—everything.  I hid in my bedroom, under my blanket; just wishing to never see anything till daylight. In my panicking breath, and delirious thoughts... I could hear the sounds of alluring melodies just beyond my walls.

I didn’t go out till the next morning, and here I am at work. Writing out this bullshit explanation on what the fuck is happening in my city. 
A whole bunch of interns came in to replace those who went missing from the company, and there are more than I hoped.  Just a whole bunch of new faces from out of town. They never found my kid by the way. Ivan is still missing, and there has been no word on the other disappearances.

The interns seem to be going off somewhere though. 

...I can hear a soothing melody, from just outside these walls. I think I'll go check it out. Just take a break and have a listen. Maybe then, I can be happy.

[So. Was Blue (Da Ba Bee\) suggested as a song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp92m?context=5)|Nope.
[Welcome, Thomas! The moment that cemented my love for Breaking Bad was the final scene of Season 1, at the impound lot with Tuco. Gnarls Barkely's ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"" plays the scene out, and it couldn't sum up Walt and Jesse's realization of how deep in shit they are any better.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqnqo?context=5)|I can't speak to my favorite as I love them all, but am really happy to see you pointed out Gnarls Barkley's ""Who's Gonna Save My Soul"" at the end of season 1.
[What has been your favorite music related scene or piece you've worked on, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqnqo?context=5)|We actually had a dilemma with that episode in that the writer's strike at the time ended our season early.  There were originally going to be two more episodes one in which Jesse Pinkman was going to be killed.  Thank God that didn't happen!  When we got to the end of episode 107, which was going to be a relatively straightforward episode ender, we realized that this was suddenly going to be the season finale.  By chance, I happened to be in Park City, Utah for a DJ gig at the Sundance Film Festival and bumped into my old friend Daniele Luppi, who had been working on the 2nd Gnarls Barkley record.  I didn't even realize there was one in the works.  When I got back to LA, I reached out to Danger Mouse and got an early version of that album.  That song struck me as being a perfect way of being able to make more of the scene than was originally there.  It worked out and we closed out the first season in style.
[I absolutely loved the music in Breaking Bad, but my favorite musical moments happened during the end credits (at least in the netflix version of the show\), where you would remix an important sound that occurred during the show into a song.  For instance, the moment when you put hector's bell into music was utterly fantastic as a viewer and a listener.  Now comes my question.  What is your favorite song in real life, and what was your favorite song in the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp4ta?context=5)|Hi Mrninja101.  I should point out that the end title music for each episode of Breaking Bad is created by our very talented composer Dave Porter.  He creates all those elegant call-backs and does remarkable work for Breaking Bad.  There are two soundtracks of his work available online.  Check Amazon.  Well worth picking up.  Can't speak to my favorite song or favorite song in Breaking Bad.  There are too many wonderful ones, and you wouldn't ask a nun what her favorite child was in the orphanage.  There's my diplomatic answer...
[Was there  ever a song that you wanted to use in Breaking Bad but couldn't find a way to fit it in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpanc?context=5)|There are tons of them.  Someday I'll look into putting together an 'almost made it onto Breaking Bad' mix and upload to our website, or Spotify.  
[Hi Thomas, thanks for all your work on the show! The music you chose gave Breaking Bad an even greater atmosphere than it had on its own.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpnal?context=5)|The creation of the narcocorrido ""Negro y Azul: The Ballad of Heisnberg"" was one of the most challenging efforts on Breaking Bad, and one that I am very proud of.  Vince and the Breaking Bad writers had found an amazing video to a narcocorrido online and sent it over to me.  ""We want to make one of these about 'Heisenberg'"" was the directive.
[Are there any good stories for the song ""Negro y Azul""? How did you find that group of musicians? What made them stand out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpnal?context=5)|I looked into existing artists in the narcocorrido field but found that everybody I spoke to either had an outstanding warrant, or had immigration issues or otherwise needed to be paid in cash, which wasn't an option.  Sony Picture Television wouldn't allow us to work 'under-the-table' so I reached out to one of the Godfathers of the genre Pepe Garza who runs a radio station that plays narcocorridos and also writes songs.  He was hired to adapt a song that was written by the writers, and we reached out to Sony Music Latin who brought Los Cuates De Sinaloa to the table.  It all came together in a low-key studio in Burbank and we shot the video on location in Albuquerque.  It was a great adventure...
[Why ""Knife Party - Bonfire""?  That was the most startling moment for me in all of Breaking Bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclptev?context=5)|We have Walt Sr. and Walt Jr. both acting like clowns.  Writer Sam Catlin and Director Rian Johnson made a product placement opportunity into something really fun and story-specific and a bro-step rager like ""Bonfire"" felt right for it.  Glad you liked it too...
[I think my favourite music moment was repeating the full version of the intro in the penultimate episode. Felt so epic. Was that something you'd planned to do for a while and were trying to find the right time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpcyt?context=5)|That was all Dave Porter, our very talented composer for Breaking Bad.
[Hey bud, so you're the chap who came up with Apparat's Goodbye for the scene where Gus walks towards the retirement home?  I'd like to shake your hand someday, maybe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr42q?context=5)|Thanks, Quakespeare.  I will be happy to share in that handshake.  That was another scene that I am particularly proud of.  I remember that when Vince Gilligan first watched that scene with that song, he said it was one of his favorite music moments in the series up to that point.  
[Do you ever walk around with head phones on and try to score the world with the perfect music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclq3y3?context=5)|All the time. Every moment you are alive is an opportunity to be creative and playing music through your adventures in life is a very nice way to spend it.  IMO.
[Hi, Thomas. Thanks for the AMA. I realise there might be several questions from Breaking Bad fans about that final scene in Felina, so I'll get mine in early. Before Vince Gilligan suggested Baby Blue, did you have any other songs in mind? How aware were you of Badfinger's work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2a7?context=5)|Hi no1partyanthem, I was already well aware of Badfinger's work, and that song ""Baby Blue"" was in one of my mixtapes, but not one I sent off to Vince.  I liked the song, but didn't really have a scene in mind for it.  It was Vince who pulled it from his iPod when he was first working on the final episode, which he wrote and directed.  Before I saw the scene, I pulled together a number of ideas - one which I thought worked pretty beautifully against picture: The Bees ""No More Excuses"" - but once I saw that beautiful shot, and saw the scene in context, I realized why Vince was so strongly attached to the Badfinger song.  It's tricky for us as music supervisors in that we keep pulling together ideas and revising them.  None of us know the right answer until we are at the very end of that process and have cut and locked picture to work with.  Vince is just really talented at knowing what the final effect he is looking for, and knew early on that Badfinger's ""Baby Blue"" was the right choice for what he was looking to do.  It took until the final picture was assembled that I was able to also see what a fantastic choice it was.
[Hi Thomas - Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions. The tone of Breaking Bad gets much darker as the season go on. How did you try to capture that with the music? (genre, etc.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp5j1?context=5)|That's a tricky question.  I would say, we always work with picture and with the story we are telling.  By making sure we are always sensitive to that, we will deliver the right answers.  In some cases, when the story in Breaking Bad is at its darkest - for example Ozymandias, this season - we ended up presenting a song to Vince ""Take My True Love By The Hand"" that was deceptively upbeat, but it did speak to the story we were telling and allowed the audience to take a little breath after the brutal actions that had preceded it.
[How hard was it to decide the music for the Breaking Bad ending? Did Vince have a say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp5ek?context=5)|Vince always has a say.  Breaking Bad is great because of Vince Gilligan's talent and generosity.  He encourages all of us who work on the show - whether it be Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and the rest of the case, or Michael Slovis, our incredible Director of Photography or any of the members of his team, or the rest of the crew - to do our very best work, and he guides all of us to the best creative answers based upon the options we deliver to him.  So, Vince has say in everything.  It's his tireless work and generosity of spirit that make the show so special.
[One of my favorite parts about the series was it's ability to use silence just as well as music to create tensions and dramatic moments.  We're you involved at all in the decisions on where to add music but also where silence would be more effective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqc3d?context=5)|Excellent question. You guys are asking some really smart ones... We have what is called a 'music spotting session' where the showrunner, or director (for a film) and the key producers, editors, music editor, composer, music supervisor and often the key sound effects and dialogue supervisors all gather together in a room to watch the episode from start to finish and discuss all music, foley (sound effects) and dialogue (ADR) needs for the episode.  This is a very creative session and we present, or come up with all the creative directives there. Then we each go back to our studios or workplaces and assemble the options or elements to deliver to the producers.  In the case of Breaking Bad, we are very careful to use silence as a key ingredient in our creative palate.  
[Why did you chose ""Breathe Me""?  Excellent choice, by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp12x?context=5)|Thank you, Morrison 21.  Myself and my former partner in SMV, Gary Calamar, were both introduced to Sia when she guested on the Zero 7 record many years ago.  We were big fans of that record and reached out to her management in Australia for more of her music.  Gary and I were both DJs at Los Angeles radio station KCRW at the time.  Folks don't remember this, but Sia's ""Breathe Me"" was actually used in the trailer for Season 5.  Alan Ball loved the song so much that he decided it was what we should use to build the final sequence of the show, and that's how it came together.  There's a much longer story about the complexities of making it work, but it was another mixtape discovery. 
[I have a bit of background in clearances for musical works. I'm curious what difficultly you've had in obtaining sync licenses for certain songs in the course of your career (especially given that producers/writers/directors/etc. may really depend on getting those specific selections\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp7r6?context=5)|Breaking Bad was a very poorly budgeted show.  The entire production really strained to get the job done with the budget were afforded.  It was because of Vince's stewardship and the quality of the scripts and production that everyone brought their A-game to the table.  It would have been a lot easier if we'd had a more reasonable budget to work with.  As far as sync licensing, we did our best to make the case for licensing music within those very narrow parameters and were very lucky in the generosity and understanding that was afforded us by our film and television licensing colleagues.  Smart directors and showrunners recognize that we are the experts in licensing and when we let them know that something is unlikely to be affordable, they will entertain additional ideas that we present.  It's always a struggle, but we do our best to be fair and honest with everyone about what we can and can't offer.
[How was ""Crapa Pelada"" chosen for the scene at Gale's house? And did you ever consider using ""Albuquerque"" by Neil Young at any point for the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpdjq?context=5)|That's a good question.  As much as ""Baby Blue"" and ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" are both pretty on-the-nose, we generally don't do too many literal song choices in the show.  Also, Neil Young is notoriously difficult to license so we tend to avoid pitching his songs.  ""Crapa Pelada"" was a song I discovered on a compilation of music from the 1930-1960s of Italian pop music from the Sugar Label.  It's one of those songs I would DJ out when I had painted myself into a corner and needed to cleanse the proverbial palate.  When we discovered that the very talented David Costabile, who played Gale Boetticher, was also a talented singer, it gave us a wonderful opportunity to showcase that skill.  Gale always seemed like a character that would travel the world with great love and enthusiasm and would want to learn the local languages and learn the local songs.   This was a particularly difficult one to sing, but David knocked it out of the park.  Also check his full-length version of Gale singing 'Major Tom' in a Thai karaoke joint.  It's a genius performance.
[Did you consider Bob Dylan's ""It's AllOver Now, Baby blue"" for the BB finale? Seems like a dumb question but what a great song about tangled webs, no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpqph?context=5)|Love the song, but it's been used too many times in high-profile scenes.  I try to not to re-use songs that have been used really well before against picture.  Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" took a lot of amazing music off the creative table for us, as did Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"".  Hopefully we used music in a creative dynamic and exciting way on 'Breaking Bad', 'The Walking Dead' and 'Ray Donovan' and those songs have a strong home in the imagination of fans.  
[Hey Thomas. Do you do record/produce/create your own music? If so, what is your setup gear wise?  Also, how big is your record collection? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp32v?context=5)|Great question, prariedan.  I do produce music.  I have a mash-up music production project called 'The Arbiters'.  You can download two EPs of music for free from my bandcamp site:  [Link to arbiters.bandcamp.com](http://arbiters.bandcamp.com)  The first EP was inspired by Brian Burton aka Danger Mouse's ""Grey Album"" and was completed in 2006 and called ""They Are Biters"".  The song ""Sure Side of Fame"" which was a mash-up of Lou Reed ""Walk on the Wild Side"", David Bowie ""Fame"", St. Germain ""Sure Thing"" and vocals by Biggie and Tupac got a nice amount of club and radio play.  The second EP ""Arrival"" was released in 2010.  You can download them both from that website.  I use Ableton software to create them and work with co-producers who polish my ideas nicely.
[If you could be any character from Breaking Bad or The Walking Dead, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqeq8?context=5)|Badger  :)
[Have you ever regretted a either using, or not using a certain song, or piece of music? Any particular faux-pas spring to mind...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpb6c?context=5)|That's a great question.  On Breaking Bad there is only one song that I didn't love, and we placed it because of a clearance problem at the very last minute.  For the sake of discretion, I don't want to point it out.  But that project suffers from almost no mis-steps.  I don't really think it's my job to look back at the work and judge it.  That's for you folks to do... 
[What was your favorite piece to work on for Breaking Bad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2lf?context=5)|Great question, Torquedo.  I am not sure.  There are so many wonderful scenes that I've spent countless long sleepless nights working on.  I love what I do, and there is a special magic when you find that perfect song that falls beautifully against picture and tells your story in a unique and surprising way.  There's nothing quite like that feeling.  Sometimes it comes very quickly and sometimes it takes days or weeks of digging to find.  So, I can't really answer that.  But if you take a look at our website: [Link to www.supermusicvision.com](http://www.supermusicvision.com) myself and my team have assembled clips of a few of our favorites. cheers...
[What were the reasons you chose Tom Wait's *Hold On* for Beth to sing in Walking Dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpfk5?context=5)|That was a song that then showrunner Glen Mazzara chose for the scene.  I love Tom Waits - I wore a ""Tom Waits for No One"" pin on my jacket in highschool - and had spent the better part of a decade looking for a home for one of his songs without any luck.  We almost found a home for ""Big Black Mariah"" in a scene in Six Feet Under when Nate has a fantasy sequence that he is in the afterlife waiting room in a restaurant with his dead dad, but we ran out of music budget and couldn't afford it.  I was thrilled that Glen was up for using ""Hold On"" and actress Emily Kinney did a great job singing it.
[Will you be working at all on the spin off show for Saul Goodman? Do you know anything about it that you could tell us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpzgn?context=5)|We'll see.  Nobody has asked me yet.  Fingers crossed.
[Hey Thomas, can you talk a little about how you became a music supervisor? Do you also play any instruments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2tr?context=5)|Hi Scooby4.  There is a ""Huffington Post"" interview that gets into some detail about my road into music supervision.  I'm sure you can find it with a quick search.  In short... I went to film school at Boston University, and ended up getting into journalism because of the war in Yugoslavia in 1991, and ended up working as a writer and journalist for the next 10 years or so.  I started an internet magazine in Los Angeles called the ""LA Magnet"" Los Angeles Magazine on the Net.  But lost a lot of money trying to keep it alive.  We were too early, and there were no city-oriented online magazines at the time.  I volunteered at KCRW 89.9 FM a radio station here in LA, and was offered a job doing A&amp;R (artist &amp; repertoire) and realized I would be terrible at it.  Somebody suggested I look into music supervision, which I didn't even know was a job.  I met G. Marq Roswell through my friend Gary Calamar and started working for his company as an intern.  I worked as an intern for a year, learned the basic ropes and then broke off on my own, where I spent the next two years eating Ramen noodles and barely making rent.  But I learned a lot, and with hard work and perseverance, I was eventually able to make a living at it and build the company I have today. 
[Hey Thomas thank you for everything you've done to bring such awesome music to the fore. I'm curious what would you say is the best pairing of music and image in movies or tv that you have seen outside of your own work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp3dg?context=5)|Great question Savvy_Sav.  I will go back to the experience that I think started it all for me: Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  My dad brought  me to the Nickelodeon Theatre in Boston for a screening of the 10th annniversary of the film.  I was 10 years old and completely mesmerized by the experience.  I still think all of us are working our way up to what Stanley Kubrick did in 1968.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! How many genres will you typically experiment with when trying to choose music for a scene?  Or do you typically immediately have a feeling for a direction you want to go in when working on visual/musical pairings?   Do you examine lyrical content when choosing non-English songs (like Quimey Neuquén in the ""Buried"" episode of BrBa\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqpax?context=5)|That's an excellent question, decenthappiness.  We put thought into everything on 'Breaking Bad'. Vince Gilligan is absolutely meticulous about every detail of the show and we make sure that the music has also been thoroughly thought-through.  If a song is in a different language, we are sure to have and often present the translation.  There was a lot of effort involved in translating ""Crapa Pelada"" which is in an extinct Italian dialect specific to Milan.  We will often take poetic license with songs, but always want to make sure that it feels right to the audience whether they speak the language or not.  It's one of the joys of Breaking Bad.  Nothing is by accident.
[How much does the cost of a song factor into your decision for using it? will you typically price up songs before even attempting to suggest them? or is everything considered from the start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpcyn?context=5)|Excellent and very intuitive question.  Budget makes a HUGE difference in what makes into Breaking Bad.  As I mentioned earlier, the music budget for the show was inadequate from the start was a constant challenge.  We tend to pre-clear (as much as possible) every choice we deliver to showrunner Vince Gilligan.  In the few times when he selected something we couldn't end up affording, it was such a disappointment, we never wanted to revisit that experience again.  So, in short, the cost of a song is a very big factor in our decision making.
[Do you have any projects lined up for the future now that Breaking bad has finished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp9x8?context=5)|We do.
 |The Walking Dead - Season 4 (premeries Oct 13th, I think) Ray Donovan - Season 2 (Showtime) Back in the Game - Season 1 (ABC) Halt and Catch Fire - Season 1 (AMC) Turn - Season 1 (AMC)
 |Lots of work ahead...
[What was the work flow--would they edit scenes before or after they had the music?  Or both?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpwhk?context=5)|This wouldn't by chance be former Massachusetts Governor William Weld, would it?  Just kidding. Our work-flow depends on the episodes needs.  Sometimes we would send  music ideas to the writers so they could work a song into the script, other times we would send music ideas to the directors and actors to get into character or choreograph a sequence.  For example the narcocorrido ""Negro y Azul: The Ballad of Heisenberg"" was worked on at the script stage and then developed before we ever shot the episode.  Other times, in fact most times, we work with picture and try to find the right answer once the episode is in editing.
[Playing Gounod’s Faust in the the scene with the schwartze's was genius. whose call was that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqs3h?context=5)|I can take credit for that one.  I grew up listening to classical music, and read a lot as a child.  I know the story of Faust and that particular piece of music and we knew that we could have some fun with ""scoring"" Walt ambushing Gretchen and Elliott and at the same time wanted to make sure that the music choice felt like something realistic they would program into their very expensive modern house alarm/music system.  
[Another question I wanted to ask you about is regarding song ownership. How do you and your colleagues feel about non-exclusively represented songs (specifically music libraries that re-title the songs\)? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp5m8?context=5)|I'll be quick on this one...  We hate re-titling.  It's a bad idea, it creates confusion, it allows for a lot of illegitimate tagging of songs, and crediting writers who didn't write a song. We try our best to avoid working with companies that do retitling. I would suggest the same to any artists out there.  Regarding exclusivity, that's a judgement call for individual artists. If you meet someone that wants to represent your songs and you trust that they will do great work, and the terms they represent feel fair, I think an exclusive arrangement is ideal.  You trust them, they trust you and you see how it goes.  I would give this a good year window and if it doesn't seem to work out, move your songs elsewhere.  I would NOT recommend giving anyone your publishing, unless they truly act as a music publisher.  Hope that's helpful.
[I was pleasantly surprised by some of the music choices in breaking bad like bassnectar and knife party. How did these choices get pitched and ultimately accepted into the series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclppjl?context=5)|They just felt right for the scene.  Vince Gilligan really trusts his collaborators and if he doesn't know the music, or at times may not even like the music, but does feel they are right for the storytelling, he greenlights those choices.  The breadth of music selection in Breaking Bad is as much a tribute to Vince Gilligan's bravery as it is to my obscene music collection.
[Were any of the musicians whose music you used in BrBa fans of the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclpzq4?context=5)|Absolutely. We brought Steve Perry from Journey to the Breaking Bad premiere and he is just about the nicest guy you could ever meet...
[Do you have any pointers for people who just want to put some of their original songs or compositions up online and no worry about copyrights, massive storage costs, etc?  ""Windy"" (1967\) was genius, guys, by the way!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclq0p7?context=5)|Soundcloud does the trick pretty well.
[I have a question about the Six Feet Under theme.  I absolutely LOVE the part where the flowers wilt.  It's so fitting with the music and the show as a whole.  1\) Is that something you talk to the editors about when putting together opening credits?  2\) Also, in season 5, Billy and Claire's manic scenes were accompanied by frenzied music.  How did you choose the songs for those scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclps10?context=5)|In the case of the 'Six Feet Under' theme, that was actually written by Thomas Newman prior to the creation of the opening main titles by a Seattle company called Digital Kitchen.  Ordinarily, the visuals and music are created at the same time, or the music is written to accompany visuals.  In the case of the Main Title to 'The Killing', I worked with both the company that designed the visuals 'Sarofsky' and the band that created the music 'We Fell to Earth' and we worked back and forth to  make that come together. Most of the time, music is created for the existing visuals.  Six Feet Under worked in the opposite manner, but what a beautiful result!   For your question 2.  We worked against picture for the scenes with Claire and Billy.  Their relationship was a fun one to work on as they both brought out the best and the worst in each other, we spent a lot of time trying to get the music choices right for that.
[Hey Thomas, can you talk about working with Dave Porter and how often you would have to communicate to determine what would need original score music versus what would need a licensed song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclq5ft?context=5)|I love working with Dave Porter on Breaking Bad.  I had known Dave and his work prior to the show and introduced him to Vince and our producers when we were first looking for a composer. He has done stunning work on the series and hopefully this will be one of many amazing projects he does.  Dave Porter rulez!!!
[From Iron Maiden?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp9vk?context=5)|Nope. My friend Fred has his birthday on the day I met Eddie the dog. He was from the Long Beach animal shelter and had just barely survived being put to sleep.  Fred became Ed, which became Eddie.
[Hey Thomas,  I saw you at Bonnaroo this year while you played a soundtrack for the Harold Lloyd silent film Safety Last. This was a really cool experience and something I hope more people get a chance to see.  Do you have any plans for doing more events like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr6mi?context=5)|How nice that you were there!  It was great fun.  I was actually invited by Bonnaroo to perform a live DJ re-score of the film ""The Road Warrior"" but wasn't able to get permission from Warner Bros to do it.  We then tried to get them to ok a live DJ re-score of ""Blade Runner"" but got the same response.  A last-ditch effort to get approval for doing a hip hop re-score of ""American Psycho"" was also met with a denial, so Sue Lloyd, Harold Lloyd's granddaughter was kind enough to let me perform a re-score of Harold's classic ""Safety Last"".  I would love to do another one,  maybe next year at Bonnaroo or some other music festival.  Fingers crossed somebody asks me.  Glad you got a chance to see that one.  It was great fun!
[Please bring some clarity to the debate; was Daft Punk's Random Access Memories any good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclp2sw?context=5)|It's just my opinion, but I do think it's great. What's wonderful about Daft Punk albums is that they don't always show their charms on the first listen and they don't always feel like coherent or even contemporary statements.  But they are always interesting, and always ahead of the times.  I think ""Random Access Memories"" is one of those albums you'll enjoy pulling out and listening to 10 years from now.  I'm not sure I'll feel that way about Justin Timberlake's ""20/20 Experience"". 
[Did you realise Breaking Bad would be such a hit, or where you going on a hunch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclqx1v?context=5)|I loved the pilot to Breaking Bad the first time I saw it.  I don't think I am particularly talented at guessing what will be popular, but I am pretty good at figuring out what is of high quality with people who are talented and enjoyable to work with.  I've been lucky enough to be on a few of those projects over the years.

One of my favorite underrated bands that I was sure I would find a home in Breaking Bad was 'The Bees' or 'Band of Bees' as they are known in the U.S.  Sadly, we never found a song to work magic in a scene.  Hope people will get to know the band and explore their music.
[Hey Thomas, huge local fan. How much interaction does it take to match music with the editor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclrm08?context=5)|We work closely with all the editors on our different projects.  Everyone is working toward telling the story in the best way and often it's the editors that can make something work seamlessly.  What Kelley Dixon (editor) and Michelle MacLaren (director) did with Moira Walley-Beckett's script for ""Gliding Over All"", episode 508, is remarkable.  The integration of all those elements in the ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" sequence is a tribute to that.  It's very much a team effort.
[If you could work with one composer today, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr9gh?context=5)|Alive or dead?  Dead: Dmitri Shostakovich. Alive: Arvo Part.

Vince knows his story better than anyone else does, and we all follow his lead.  I've learned more about storytelling with music on ""Breaking Bad"" than any other project and have Vince to thank for that.  We always arrived at the right answer for the story and the characters, and I think the end results speak to that.
[Hey Thomas! A lot of the music is Season 5B was very dark and chilling, such as the scene where Jesse goes to Walts house with thd gascan. Where can one find music like that?

Great albums both.

I can give props here to Tom Schnauz's lovely wife Maya for presenting Ana Tijoux to the show.  That was her idea.  As I mentioned earlier, it's very much a group effort.
[That Digital Animal song by Honey Claws is ridiculous, and I would never have heard it without you. Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nsvvf/i_am_breaking_bad_and_the_walking_dead_music/cclr4wc?context=5)|My pleasure.  It was a great way to end that sad and desperate episode for Jesse.  That's a good example of where affordable music is presented to me and works really well against picture.  We had very little source music budget left in that very music-intensive episode and because ""Digital Animal"" was affordable to us, and creatively worked really well in the scene, it got to take us out of the episode and turned a lot of folks onto Honey Claws.

1nrdz0,19,2013-10-04,"6 months since graduation, still unemployed.",gettingnothing,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nrdz0/6_months_since_graduation_still_unemployed/,"I'm at my wits' end. I graduated from a good school and live in a large city with a supposedly booming IT industry. I have two good summer internship experiences (1 in web dev, 1 in BA) and a good body of knowledge for a fresh grad in those subjects. I also have great references and interview well. 

I've applied to positions with all sorts of titles: ""junior"", ""fresh grad"", ""intermediate"", etc. 

I have received a callback for exactly ONE, from what is easily the most respectable of the companies I applied to. This only happened because the interview process began with a code submission where I actually had the chance to prove I knew what I was doing. I made it quite far but didn't get the job, which is fine as it was sought after by applicants globally and I was proud to make it to where I did.

Besides this, I have only received the odd polite rejection and emails from local recruiters. 

When I started looking I was open to positions in software development, web development, and business analysis (basically everything and anything). While I consider myself a skilled Java programmer, I stopped looking for software dev jobs due to my lack of professional experience with it, and the fact that my applications for even the most junior Java dev. positions were declined (ironically except for that large company mentioned above). 

I now have two resumes, one tailored for BA and one for web development. I tinker with them for every resume I send out. The problem with BA is there are few junior positions available in the field (maybe just locally). 

That leaves web dev; a field which I would be ecstatic to land in (I really like it). However even here I'm struggling  to land interviews. I'm seeing junior positions on Craigslist and Indeed from unknown companies that demand knowledge of several stacks on top of having a high-profile StackOverflow account and a GitHub with several open-source project contributions. Seriously, what the hell?

Can people who landed web development positions after graduating post their experiences?

What did you include in your resume?

What was in your portfolio?

What was your callback ratio?

I think my biggest issue is showmanship of work. Unfortunately I can't showcase my professional web dev experience as it is constrained to a government intranet. I do have a portfolio but it looks like the projects there aren't enough. I would be happy to add to it but I need to know what employers are looking for when they look at an applicant's portfolio, since apparently I'm not measuring up (if they even look at my resume).

Thanks for reading, guys."
1nv9re,16,2013-10-06,Switch to CS or stay in Computer Engineering?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nv9re/switch_to_cs_or_stay_in_computer_engineering/,"Hey everyone, I'm a freshman Computer Engineering student in his first semester. I'm trying to decide whether to switch to CS or stay in Computer Engineering. In terms of interest, I have a hobby-level interest in electronics, but I wouldn't say I have a *passion* for it. However, I do seriously enjoy CS and I've spent a lot of time out of school working on the Intro to CS course on MIT OCW and the Algorithms course on Coursera and just generally spending a lot of my free time on CS. With that being said, I have no experience with what an industry job in CS is like. I have done an electrical engineering internship and while I didn't love it, it was interesting. 

The CS program at my school is fairly well-regarded and the CS majors have a 100% co-op placement rate. The same goes for the ECE department at my school. In terms of academics, both programs are just as rigorous. The CS program is your normal CS program with  all the usual courses. Computer Engineering has a huge variance from school to school, so I'll explain it here:

     The first two years of the Computer Engineering degree are mix of Electrical Engineering and CS. So I'll take the traditional physics I &amp; II, Electronics I, Chemistry, Intro to ECE Lab, etc. (the usual 'first-year curriculum'). 
     My CS courses consist of Engineering Computation and Algorithms and Data Structures. Engineering computation is not a real CS class. It is an intro programming class. The most advanced thing we'll get to is probably making a class in C++ and Matlab integration. It's mostly basic stuff that anybody who has even gone through a book about C will know(very little C++ specific stuff.) 
     The last 2 years are the specialization years. They consist of technical electives which range from Software Engineering I and Computer Vision to Antenna Design. So technical electives run the whole gamut of the CS-EE spectrum, with topics that are CS to topics that are deep EE topics. I'm only allowed to take on course from the college of computer science as a technical elective, but the college of Engineering has about 4 technical electives that are basically CS-like:
Software Eng I &amp; II
Parallel and Distributed Processing
Numerical Methods and Computer Applications
Image Processing &amp; Pattern Recognition
Computer Vision
I can take exactly one of the traditional CS courses as well, such as Object Oriented Design or Compilers. 

I'm also required to take Optimization Methods, which is a high-level algorithms course. I can also use my general electives to take more CS courses if needed. 

My question to all of you is, if upon graduation, I wanted to compete for a top CS job at one of the in-demand employers like Google, would I be competitive? How about if I wanted to apply to a CS PhD program? 
If the answer to any of those questions is no, would I be better served by switching to CS and losing a semester or staying in CompE and doing some self-study?

Current Background:
Know C, Python, learning Scala through Functional Programming Principles In Scala course on Coursera. Have a working knowledge of C++ and Java. Completed the Algorithms I course on Coursera and trying to working through the problems in Sedgewick's textbook. I'm also taking Programming Languages on coursera. I'm also about a quarter of the way through Foundations of Computer Science: C edition by Aho(turtle book). I have a working knowledge of Linux, I can install an Arch Linux distro, use a makefile, UNIX utilities, and built a basic dependency manager using instructions from Zed Shaw's LCTHW. (Although I can't really get it to work like it's supposed to.) I learned how to use github and deploy code to Heroku and use SSH from Startup Engineering on Coursera but was unable to complete the course because I wasn't good with JavaScript."

1nu4fx,20,2013-10-06,"""Non-Traditional Student"" (44 Years Old) - Recently graduated with BS in CIS. Should I hold out for a big company with room for advancement, given how hard it is to get hired as an older new grad?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nu4fx/nontraditional_student_44_years_old_recently/,"I graduated in May of this year. I may have made a mistake by not beginning my job search immediately upon graduation, if not during my final year of school.

I have a stable employment history (including 8 months as a student researcher, but no internship), and my resume looks very good.  I was very careful not to put anything on the resume which would indicate my age.

I realize that the hiring process for the big companies usually goes slower than that of small to medium companies.  That being said, I have already been rejected by a couple of large companies, but am getting several nibbles from smaller companies.  Glassdoor reviews are not good for any of them.  I take that with a grain of salt, as I believe that disgruntled or laid-off/fired employees are generally more likely to post reviews than satisfied employees.

Looking at my current set of opportunities (no actual offers yet, but a full schedule of interviews for the coming weeks), it appears that I should be able to meet my salary requirements by going either route (big company or small to medium company).  The benefits at either would probably be similar.

My question is for those who are either in a similar situation, or at least know people in a similar situation:  Should I accept a job which meets my salary and benefit requirements, even if I'm not sure that the company has ""career potential,"" or should I hold out and try to land a job with a big company, where I would have a much more reasonable expectation of growth opportunities.

TL; DR:  As an older new graduate, is it still a viable approach to ""string together"" a career by working a few years here and a few years there, or should I really be trying to find a long-term, proven company which offers the possibility of employment and advancement until I retire?

1nxfay,1,2013-10-07,Stressed undergrad looking for insight regarding education path and career outlook!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nxfay/stressed_undergrad_looking_for_insight_regarding/,"**Caution: Wall of Text**  
  

I am currently an undergraduate student at a state university studying Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. This is my 2nd year in college but I graduate in the Spring of next year (2015) because of credits I have come in with. I really like the IT curriculum and very much enjoy the information systems and data analysis coursework.  
  
**First Question**  

I have a passion for development (strong interest in web application development) that I just discovered last year through a web development class. However, I am also gaining interest in database management. Are there any positions that could involve developing as well as database design/administration?
  
  
**Second Question**  
  
I have a couple of options when looking at the future.  
  
**My first option** would be to pursue a Master's degree. I really enjoy learning relevant technologies at a college level, and I think it would be nice to have a Master's degree. I am also not losing much time since I will most likely be finishing this degree close to after people my age would be graduating.    

  
I know many of you would advise against this, however, I will have around 29 credits already paid for if I did this and most of the Master's program I am looking at are around 32-33 credits. Would I be foolish not to take this opportunity?  
  
  
**My second option** would be to find an entry level position after my Bachelor's. Like I said earlier, I just started to pursue programming and development last year. Being so, I do not have much of a portfolio to show off at the moment. I am currently working on this though! In my free time I am learning more programming languages and computer science topics (e.g. Udacity, Code School, Learn Code the Hard Way) and am going to start working on side projects soon.  
  
I feel like I am behind though. I need to look for an internship for Summer 2014, and then I graduate next year. If I continue to learn on my own and work on side projects alongside my course work, would I have enough knowledge/experience to get an entry level position in software or web development?  At the moment, I am fairly proficient in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and I am currently learning Ruby. I also know Java, but not as well as I should. I work at a Software Company also. I started out as a Help Desk Agent last year and have since been moved to QA(going to start unit testing next week)! They also have encouraged me to learn C# to further my abilities there. Also by the time I graduate with my BS, I will have taken C++, Java, Python, and PHP courses.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  

I am sorry for the amount of information but I feel a little overwhelmed trying to think this through on my own and needed a place to express my concerns. Any advice, comments, and feedback are truly appreciated.  
  
**Also** to add on to the Master's part: I plan on pursuing a Computer Science degree. I have also been looking at MIS but currently CS is ideal. Would I have problems getting into grad school with my IT degree and the CS minor?(Assuming I can demonstrate basic CS knowledge)

1nx4sw,0,2013-10-07,[C#][gtk] mono; I have a little ButtonClick Problem over here.,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nx4sw/cgtk_mono_i_have_a_little_buttonclick_problem/,"Hey there, fellow programmers!
I need a little help, here. I don't have much experience with C# and just did a little programming before, so please be kind ;)

I wrote a little program that reads a txt file, searches it for the facts i need and put these in a SQL db. Everything works fine, but the thing is, that the method is called when i click a button, therefore it puts the same data into the db everytime the button is clicked.

Is there a way to avoid this other than to disable the button sensitivity? 
I have absolutely no knowledge of SQL thus far, so i don't know if i can handle this problem with it or not. Or how.
(I'm an intern, so i got a little help setting the db up but that's all).
I don't have the Code here, but let me know if something is unclear or you need more info or whatsoever!


edit: here's a little summary of what i'm doing


    protected void OnButton1Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
      import();
    }

    private void import()
    {
        string[] textlines=File.ReadAllLines(@&lt;location of file&gt;);
        foreach(string line in textlines)                                //it's repetitive text with the same variables so i   need to repeat the following 
           {
              if(line.StartsWith(""zHd""))
               { //here come a few methods to get the value i need for my variables (splitting the line etc)
                } 
                 //also some more if-request to get the other variables i need
              if(line.StartsWith(""--""))      // i have all i need now and can put the first row into the db
                      //    here comes the method to put the variables in the db, i can't remember it right now, 
                      //    but it worked 
        }
    }

                                               
i simplified it, because i don't think you need to know how many data i need to get for my database to understand my problem.
Due to the fact that import() is called on ButtonClicked everytime i hit the button it adds the same five rows(that's how much data i got from the .txt file) into the db.
So my question is now if i can avoid this somehow?

Also, sorry i can't remember the sql code but it really was just putting the variables in the right column-order.

cybersecurity internship program for community college students.  Over
the summer, 23 students had unpaid internships at US Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE). The summer internships varied in length from four to 12 weeks. They worked with forensic investigators, examining devices confiscated by ICE agents. In the first round, 300 students applied, 200 were interviewed, and 23 selected for the program. DHS plans to increase the number of students participating in the program and to include another agency in the next round of internships. The announcement for the new round will be published by early November, and the 12-week internships are expected to begin in February or March 2014.

Last year when I applied for internships, I just thought of any companies around Portland, Oregon and looked on their jobs page.  I sent in tons of applications to Intel and many other companies, but it was difficult to find them.  Many internships didn't list when they were happening (I wanted summer only) and many internships asked for knowledge in SQL and other programming languages I've never even attempted.

This year I'm going to try and hit the ground running.  I applied to six positions at Intel tonight and plan to keep looking as the year goes on because I really want an internship next year.

I love the feeling when I get my assignments to run and when I'm bored I'll write some basic programs to help me in my everyday life such as wages calculators for my job and what not.

Since I've got no family or friends that are really fit to give advice, I thought I'd ask for some help.

Story: I'm an Engineering and Science major who's been working his way through College. Took on an Internship in Florida, which I loved, just the circumstances weren't a perfect fit. I received a job offer opportunity from a friend, but turned it down since I didn't know how to go out and look for a place. Instead, I trekked back 3,000 miles and am back home to the familiar, where I'm mistreated.

My options right now:

1. I've received two job offers thus far, both well-known corporations. The only concern is it means I'd be staying in the state I don't really enjoy. Would it be worth the while of taking upon two jobs, and how would I go about doing so? (Not conflict of interests)

2. Return to Florida after 6 Months, and apply for a new job. The main concern is, how would I find a place to stay beforehand while I'm so far away?

3. A combination of the two: Take upon the first job offer, whom support my growth and eventually transfer down to Orlando after looking for an apartment beforehand. Once 6 months is up, then apply for my old job (non-Internship) for extra money, and the enjoyment.

Overall, I'm just really stressed about the next few months and am really unsure on how to go about taking care of it all. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like school is in the plans, albeit my love for it. 

I'd really appreciate any advice, as everything helps. Thanks.

A bit of a back story: 

I graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering Technology this summer. Due to poor life choices and shitty circumstances, my GPA fell to 1.04 after my freshman year. I took a year off to figure things out and I finally got my degree after 6 years in school, with a GPA of 2.4. Now I know that's pretty shitty for an engineering GPA, but what's done is done.

I don't really have anything in the way of internship experience as I was an international student without a work permit, and nobody wants to sponsor a work permit for a student. The only thing I have going for me is a bunch of academic projects that I've been involved in over the years and I did mention that in detail in my resume.

I've been applying to about 100+ jobs on job aggregate sites like monster, indeed, beyond, careerbuilder etc. and even submitted my resume to a bunch of recruiting agencies like kelly, adecco, etc. but so far all I've gotten back are a handful of phone calls and 4 in person interviews. I thought I did well in the interviews, but apparently not well enough. I had some amazing referrals for the last job I interviewed to, but its been a month and they just gave me the ""we're still deciding"" bullshit when I called back.

So anyways, it's been about 3 months of job searching now, and I'm getting pretty desperate. I don't have any loans to pay, but I need to support my parents who pretty much put me through school and paid for all of my expenses. If anyone can offer me advice or let me know of headhunters or agencies that specialize in placing engineers, I would be grateful. I've heard that some take a percent of your pay as a cut, but at this point, if they can get me a job, I don't really care. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!"

Yet, I feel like I hit a ""wall"" the way runners do when they reach a point they feel they cant go any further and if they do, every inch of them is yelling, stop!

I feel that way now, I feel overwhelmed and I don't know how to shake the funk im in at work. The reason for this is I rarely say no to an opportunity. I have been getting work piled on me and I am having a hard time just getting through it. I just see this big mountain of stuff that I need to complete, with not alot of time and little amount of resources.

I am doing about 11 different tasks at my job right now and it's really really draining. Once a week I am on the floor helping customers with resumes, computer skills, cover letters, applications, faxing, emails, copies and community resources. Then I oversee paperwork for one of our partners and have to complete a very specific and involved paperwork packet for their clients as we are their partner and oversee their enrollment, I do two of these and the paperwork for each person is aobut 1/4 inch thick, then everything is made into triplicates. As well as enter the information into a program. I also teach a computer literacy workshop twice a month for the general public. I also do paperwork for a Union training center, we are in charge of their enrollments and paperwork. Also, at my office we have about 70-100 diferent type copies that are single, double sided or in packets that we have out for the general public, in  order to make mass copies here, we have to order them from our main office and keeping up with that alone is a challange. Also am in partnership with a local utility company doing outreach for youth in the area where i recruit the local highschools in the area and screen them for internships, last time i saw over 500 applications, by hand. I am also part of a research team putting together a packet for the available apprenticeships available in our area of all types to have as a resouce. I teach a workshop on conflict management/office politics/workplace ethics. I am on a panel to create a video to have running at our office for our cutomers that bridges our employess and what they do to the public. I want to have an introduction of all of our staff and our main functions on video and played on repeat so that the customers can get familiar with our staff and be informed of what they can get involved in. Lastly I am also on a panel to improve our in office advertising. We have alot o fbare walls with just pieces of paper laminated and thumbtacked up. I secured funds to get legitimate signs, so i am overseeing exactly what will go up on our walls, etc.

I'm a few years shy of my thirties, and i have been doing this for 5 years and 7 months now. Granted I wasnt doing all of this when i first started, but I started when i was 23 and am now i feel really really burned out. It's great the job is somewhat fulfilling, but i just dont feel like i have enough time to do everything, especially this year.

Alsot, of the stuff i am doing is outside of my job scope, which i never cared about in my life, but i would say about 70 to 80% of this stuff that i am doing is pretty much extra. 

My company is non profit, but i heard somewhere if you can bring in busines x3 your salary, then you are considered a successful an asset to your company. Theres no way for me to guage that as we just get yearly funds but i feel like im doing my part and more.

I have days where i just want to ignore all reason and flat out quit. What can i do to keep myself motivated to overcome all these duties... I know that I will, it's in my nature, but what can i do to make sure my level of quality doesnt slip? Also, how can i make this stuff not affect me outside of work? I am constantly worried about this or that and feel like am am working around the clock, i dont have alot of separation from work and home or at least it feels like that.

It is the end of my sophomore year of college, and as with any lazy entitled college kid, I'm procrastinating my FASFA and looking forward to spring break. Afraid to tell my parents about said FASFA, I think ""Oh well, what's a couple more days?"" Thinking I can enjoy spring break and then submit the fasfa through subterfuge by questioning my parents nonchalantly about tax information. 

Dick move on my part, but I have a habit of lying about my procrastination to the extreme in order to present a facade of normality, even it creates huge problems later on. You know when you think if you ignore a problem long enough it will magically go away? That's my auto-mode.

Bear with me.

Jump forward to halfway through the summer. I've decided to stay in the city instead of going home for the summer, in an apartment my dad is paying for, in order to get a summer job and start living my own life. The apartment is a good deal because it is slightly cheaper than college dorming, and I plan to be paying part of the rent with my summer job. No summer job, and I have to retake an extremely difficult class that I got a D in originally (though I have learned I passed it with a B this time).

Still haven't filed that FASFA. That point in procrastination where you know you are so late that just a COUPLE more days/weeks can't fuck you over any more than you already are.  Plus, has to request W2 forms to file the FASFA now, which can take 60 days to process, and god fuck, already fucked over.

Falling into a circle of anxiety, shame, and depression due to loneliness, my own idiotic stupidity, and doubts about my mechanical engineering major. Thinking I should have gone to art school, know parents will never support it now, feel trapped in a rut because I chose mechanical engineering purely based on money and career options. 

Just before fall semester begins, finally buck up the courage to talk to parents, and possibly request a semester or year off to get my head back in the game. Didn't tell them about the FASFA thing, figuring I could handle it with my school without my parents finding out for some ungodly stupid reason. Lied that I still wanted to do mechanical engineering. Got a slightly-above-minimum-wage job that can cover my rent completely and most of my living expenses, which was a bonus in my argument.

Condition for time off was to see a counselor. Agreed, thinking that yes, I DO need to talk to someone. Figured I could do it on my days off, weekly.

Have not contacted or sought out any type of counselor or therapist, and have procrastinated on filling out my leave of absence form for college. Am possibly up for default/delinquency, though I have (finally) responded my financial office lady at school about meeting up to hash things out.

 Have entertained thoughts of both running away to Portland, Oregon and creating a new life or possibly suicide, neither remotely serious thoughts and only kind of half baked fantasies that flit through and are easily dismissed.

I have so many opportunities and am so goddamn entitled by I throw it all away by being a useless fucktard that can't get shit done on time because she is too lazy.

I know the logical thing to do is to sit down with my parents, tell them I have a compulsive habit of lying and procrastination, and seek help. Possibly even go away to the loony bin for a while. 

I know the logical thing to do is to get my shit together, finish college, get the internship that's damn near promised me by my dad's friend, and do art on the side. Maybe even go to college for art later.

But hell, I'm that stupid kind of optimist. I think I have a romanticized version of supporting myself, maybe because then I don't have to worry about disappointing anyone else because all of my choices will be on me. I like the appeal of working to support myself now, even if it's just waitressing, instead of going through two more years of fucking school that I hate to get into a career that I'll be stuck in for 20+ years.

And I just.... I have no idea what to do. Now, I know that turning to the internet for advice is a crappy choice for dealing with life-altering problems, but I just want to see if anyone out there has gone through similar circumstances.

So, my questions:
-How the hell do I get out of my current financial blunder?
-How the hell do I talk to my parents about all of this and possibly NOT get sent off to mental-rehab?


**TL;DR:  WAS A LAZY PROCRASTINATING IDIOT AND DIDN'T FILE MY FASFA, LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR THIS SEMESTER, AND AM CIRCLING DEPRESSION LIKE A WOUNDED, RABID COYOTE. 

ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE FUCK UP COLLEGE FINANCIALLY, AND CAN SHARE ANY TIPS?**"

What should my approach/strategy be given my experience, GPA, current situation?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1nyzrz/career_fair_coming_up_what_should_my/,"Career fair in a few days.  Trying to decide how I should approach things.
Currently a sophomore.  Had an internship at a fortune 500 tech company last semester and summer.  Great experience, loved it.  GPA suffered though.  Currently hovering around the 2.8-2.9 mark.  Retaking one class, will certainly end this semester with a 3.2-3.4 depending on how hard I push.  Resume consists of said internship, independent development of mobile apps, and a few cool hackathon projects along with brief summary of technical experience, student involvement, etc. (I think my resume’s alright - would rather not post it but could share via PM if need be)

Have a return offer from first company but they might want me to start in January again and I don’t know if I can do that.  Plus, I think there is benefit from trying something new and learning a whole new set of skills somewhere else.

Dream is obviously a top company (you know who) but willing to try something totally out of the ordinary if it’s in my career interests.

Do I:

1) Go to the career fair and talk to as many reps as possible, hoping they won’t be put off by my GPA (do I explain it?  Not mention it?  Can’t really leave it off, looks suspicious).

2) Skip the high-profile companies for now until my GPA is higher then apply online in December and talk to reps at the next career fair in ~February?  I’d be a stronger candidate but I’m concerned that is too late in the hiring process?  Hard to understand, different companies seem to be on totally different schedules.

3) Something else?

I'm a third semester CS student at a public university in the US.

I have written programs in Java, C++, and Python that are multi-class and up to several hundred lines, the most complex of which I manipulate a modest data set (think weighted, directed graphs) - thus, I consider myself knowledgable to that degree. 

My ""toolbox"" contains basic data structures and algorithms that I could ""hand-code"" if asked.

The one thing you got to know about Dave is that he’s working real hard these days. So, I asked him like a week ago if I could post since he’s so damned busy. He said cool, and now we’re down.

Dave finds an internship at some life insurance place in Manhattan. He shows up for his first day, real eager beaver, and gets the lay of the land. Apparently it’s one of those real old, stuffy kind of offices. Of course, his job is kind of shitty. Filing papers. Making photocopies. Tracking office supplies. Real office bitch kind of stuff. He figures that’s alright, got to start somewhere to get out of nowhere.

So, he’s wheeling the trolley, trying to deliver paper or some shit to some cubicle, when he starts hearing really loud clacking. And it’s getting louder. When he turns the corner, he finally sees her. She looks real old, hair all white, wrinkles like two feet deep around her mouth. She’s wearing this weird green visor kind of thing. And she’s just whaling on this old-school typewriter. Just beating it like it owes her grandkids money.

Dave’s surprised, then kind of annoyed because she’s so damned loud. But no one else seems to mind, so he figures it’s no problem. Actually, it’s kind of cool. So he walks up to her wooden desk thing, and tries to introduce himself. Like a bunch of times. But she never looks up and never stops typing. Dave figures she’s probably deaf. No worries. He walks away with crazy respect for someone so old who can still work so hard. From then on, he always makes sure to say hello.

Now, apparently Dave’s boss is a real grade-A dickhead. Just abusive, rude, and over-demanding. Everyone knows Dave is the office peasant, but some of the boss’ shit is getting ridiculous. So, everyday it seems like Dave is working later and later. But no matter how late he stays, the old woman is always still working. 

One night, he’s heading out. He starts saying good night like always, not expecting anything, when her fingers finally stop. Dave freezes. She looks up, staring straight into him. Says, “Richard Feinman” and goes back to typing even faster than before.

Well, Dave’s real confused because that’s his boss’ name. Maybe she thinks that’s his name. Maybe she’s not really deaf after all. Anyway, Dave’s beat so he forgets about it and heads home to sleep.

Week goes on. Just flying by, Dave says, when he finally realizes why he’s so much happier. His boss hasn’t been in the office for the last few days.
 
I got to go let Dave know I posted, maybe catch up. See what shit has gone down in the last week or so. If I get anything, I’ll let you bastards know. Peace.

I'd love to live in Iceland, so I want to go to either Reykjavik University/University of Iceland to study CS. I figure, if Iceland doesn't work out, I could always go to college in another Scandinavian country or use the study abroad program to visit other places in Europe, so I can have some variety either way. 
The unis/schools abroad, especially in Scandinavia, are cheaper than in the U.S, but I mostly just want to get out and find out if living in Northern Europe is really for me like I think it is. Honestly, I don't want ot stay cooped up in the U.S anymore, which is a huge reason why I want to pursue higher education abroad. 

They're universities, and I don't know about the rest of the world, but in Iceland, to get into a university, you need to pass a matriculation exam. You get it from spending at least 1 year from an ''upper higher education'' school, e.g: community college or a 2-year IB school. 
So I was recently considering going to IB school for 2 years at a low cost in Iceland, seeing how I like it over there, passing the exam, and if I like it, I go to one of the unis in Iceland, if not, another one in Northern Europe.

But, I don't want to go to a pre-uni-IB school if it's not necessary, hell I'd rather go right to uni and start on my bachelor's in one of those 2 schools, but the only way I can do that is if I show that I have ''maturity and adequate experience.'' I'm thinking an internship and good grades could help with that. 

What should I do? I'm a mess about what to do and where to go and what certifications I do and don't need, especially since I hear a lot about CS schools. "

As this is my last year, I have been pondering to myself what kind of job I would like to obtain post-graduation. An option that I'm interested in is compiler development.

The problem I have is that I don't know how to obtain such job. My university's job listing has no entry for compiler engineers. A brief look at http://www.compilerjobs.com/ shows only one compiler job at VA, the state where I live, and it's only for senior developer. In addition, most of the listings for junior engineers demand industry experience that I don't have. So here are some questions that I have:

- If I want to find a compiler job, should I look to moving somewhere else? (how much does location matter in this case?)

- Given that I have no experience working with a real life project, realistically speaking how much chance do I have now? What about after I finish a toy compiler? (I have stellar grade on the academic side, but I don't think anyone cares; on the personal-project side, I have a few small ones on [github](https://github.com/ktt3ja)--unfortunately, the most impressive project I have is a simple shell written in Rust for class that I can't show)

- If I realistically have no chance at all, what should I do the first couple years so that I can obtain such jobs later on?"

&gt;Hi Rob,
I have reviewed your resume and certainly take Steven’s recommendation quite seriously. I am not totally sure I am in a position to hire at the moment, but I welcome you downtown to sit down for a coffee and discussion?

I've only ever done one job interview in the past (for a factory) and dress pants/shoes weren't required so I don't actually own any. Should I purchase some for this interview?

My palms get sweaty just thinking about this. Like I don't even know where to begin. How should I act during the meeting? Should I be as professional as possible or just be myself? I have never even been to a real coffee shop, haha. Do you sit down at like a restaurant and you order your coffee? I am so hopeless, lol.

**A Little Background:** I'm currently working as a paid intern in a secondary school/sixth form (college) here in the UK, helping out two other IT Technicians.


**The Tale:** So the school recently decided to give brand new Windows Surfaces to every Sixth Former. They didn't bother consulting us about this however so were completely unprepared when more than 30 of the things turned up in our office.

Now I know next to nothing about the Surfaces but even I can predict what's going to happen. You can't connect Windows RT to a domain so we can't manage them with things like group policies and Active Directory logins so we know all hell is about to break loose when the Staff starts handing these tablets out to everyone before we've even had a chance to turn one on.

So this morning more than a dozen students come into our office asking to be connected to the Wi-Fi. Our usual method of simply using their logins doesn't work so my co-worker opens up AD and works his magic. I'm not too knowledgeable with AD besides setting up new students and resetting passwords but he manages to set up a group and gets some of them connected.

Their logins should work now so that's what we tell them, some manage to connect, some not. The ones that couldn't presented a number of face-palming moments.

&gt; **Student A: ""Do I need to use my school login?""**
    
&gt;*What else are you going to use!*
    
&gt; **Student B: ""I don't have a login.""**
    
&gt;*You've been here nearly 2 months, Why haven't you come to see us!*
    
We've still got the odd student coming in for help connecting but the problems aren't just limited to student's.
    
&gt; **Teacher: ""I've got some students that need to print from their Surfaces, can you set them up?""**
    
&gt;*Of course they can't print, all the printers are on the domain they can't connect to.*

This is just the beginning, may the gods have mercy on us."

Like many of you I've wanted to write horror, but felt like I couldn't reach that level of horror that could really make the reader shiver.

So I bought some Psilocybin spores awhile ago and grew some. Why did I do this? Well, I've always read many authors tend to have a sort of... addiction, in the mind altering sense. Before a few nights ago, I had never tried shrooms and in all honesty probably would have loved it with my friends. I cultivated them, did a lot of research before, everything was perfect.

I was asked to monitor a server at this place I'm interning at, they gave me a little run down and said it would be a long night and they just needed someone there to keep upstairs happy. So, with NaNoWriMo coming up, I made this night my shroombingewriting night. I stored some pre made pizzas and cola in the fridge that day so I would have something to snack on. 

I trudge through the day. My boss, Peter, comes and tells me that I probably won't get a job there. I'm not going to get to much into it, but man, fuck that guy. Then again, I wasn't expecting a ton from an internship.

I pull up to the building around 9:00 PM in my beat up little Civic and get to work. Around 11:00 I'm the last one there and I pop open my laptop next, pop some shrooms in my mouth and start to fire away. Strange thing is, nothing out of the ordinary happened. The lights were on, there was a deep bellow that would echo the building and startle me every once in awhile, but besides that, nothing. I wasn't worried about the noise because I figured it was probably just me hearing things. I was worried that I got ripped off on the spores.

I clocked out with around 25,000 words (including an outline).

I was stoked. 

I had the next few days off, and left what I wrote to simmer. I've heard that when you write a bunch, you should take a few days break, come back and reevaluate.

&gt; Put on rubber suit (remember 1st season of American Horror Story)

&gt; Goes in house

&gt; Slice yapping dog's throat

&gt; Wife is in bathroom, showering.

&gt; He is asleep, kids murmuring in room, won't go to sleep.

&gt; Quickly tie him up and cover his mouth with ducktape.

&gt; Wife in shower. Rape scene? (to far possibly, will edit out, trying to be too edgy?)

&gt; Tie her to bed, want to make their last time together a little bit more scary so do some devil worshipping type stuff to freak them out. (possibly too campy)

&gt; Bring kids in, tell them that the one who wins the game gets a special prize. (rock paper scissors)

&gt; Younger one actually wins, scoop out eyeballs of older one with spoon from downstairs. (maybe campy, Evil Dead vibe)

&gt; They all beg to stop, older one won't stop crying so cut off fathers tongue and shove it down his throat.

&gt; Duck tape his mouth shut.

&gt; Dismembering, blah blah blah.

&gt; Incest (no mutant babies though)

&gt; Finish up the job, younger kid is sort of freaked out, but hey, he got lucky. (Up all night to get lucky)

&gt; Throw him in trunk, light house on fire.

&gt; Man likes feeling that this gave him. Rinse repeat. 

Then the word ""cunt"" written about 100,000 times. It was written like it had paragraphs and such.

I don't remember writing that, I'm more into the psychological horror. The story I remember writing was about a man who finds out he will lose his eyesight in a year if he is not careful, almost once a week he is visited by a man who was (""sent by the doctor"") and gives him eye drops everyday. At the end the man finds out that the doctor had no idea who the man was and that he had been putting nothing prescribed in his eyes. He wakes up the next day blind.

That is what I wrote, not the word ""cunt"" 100,000 times and this summary.

Fuck those spores.

I just got back from work and my coworker Ronnie greeted me, he looked shaken up.

""Did you hear? Peter and his whole family died in a fire a few nights ago. It was all over the news."" I began to sweat.

1o5ydd,1,2013-10-10,I designed a few websites for some businesses. How much will that help in getting me an internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o5ydd/i_designed_a_few_websites_for_some_businesses_how/,"I've designed a few websites for some businesses. I have about four in total right now. One of them is a charity, which I did for free. The others I have charged and I've made a few hundred from them. 

The websites I made employ modern web design practices, including responsive design so they can be easily viewed on mobile devices. They feature implementation of cookies, php, mysql databases, and the standard html,css,javascript. 

They allow the person who I've made the site for put in information themselves and have it dynamically appear on the site. Including event planning and calendar applications that utilize mysql databases. All input forms are scrubbed for possible exploits and there's at least an attempt at error control. 

I did this to earn some money and also position myself better for internships. But now that the time is here and I need to start aggressively applying, I find myself hesitant. So I'm wondering if what I did would really help my chances. Especially with getting a paid internship, since I can't really do unpaid. My parents like reminding me how I'm young and still in college, and probably won't make much and probably never get an internship, etc. 

I have a personal site that shows off the sites I made. I made sure it does this in a visually appealing way. By fading in the sites in an overlay when you hover over the link, but still keeping the top part. That way you can easily navigate all my sites without having to actually go to each one individually. I thought this would make it easier for a potential employer. 

So how good does this sound, and what else should I be doing to improve my chances of getting an internship. To add I thought myself Java and made some small Android apps, I also have a intro level knowledge of c#. Plus a strong mathematics background, easily Aced Calc 3, although that probably doesn't mean much. "

Welcome back, and for those seeing this for the first time, I encourage you to check out the first introductory post that I made [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1l7i/the_yukaghir_documents_introduction/) In the meantime, I will be continuing with my duty and providing an insight into a Cold War era investigation of the extranormal. 

The biggest dilemma I now face is simply which document to choose from. Most of these files were made before the digital era and thus they were stored on volumes of paper, which I now have in a filing cabinet filled with musty manilla tomes. Most are like the first case - interesting, but ultimately useless and uninteresting. After careful deliberation and a few cups of coffee, I think I have found a suitable document to illustrate to you the intentions of the Agency.

I apologize for the speed at which I am providing this evidence. I am an old man, and these bones can only serve so well these days. Let us begin.

Agency of Paranormal Investigation, est. 1953

Document #555.1

DATE: March 1, 1963

SUBJECT: Codename Assumer, classified Natural Entity

LEAD AGENT: Mikhail Golovin

LOCATION: Vladivostok, at streets **WITHHELD** and **WITHHELD**

The Assumer was first brought to Agency attention when one Agent Vasin disappeared. After ruling out the possibility of going AWOL, Agency dispatched men to investigate Vasin's residency. They found distinct signs of a struggle, a spattering of week-old blood liberally applied to most surfaces in the bedroom, and a journal which all Agents keep and update regularly. Vasin's Agency Journal shed light on the manner of his disappearance. Vasin is now classified as MIA, presumed dead. Official explanation: American saboteurs, or assassins. Whichever tickles Pravda's fancy. Journal contents are transcribed below by lead investigator Golovin.

THE JOURNAL OF ROMAN VASIN

February 20, 1963

Dear diary. Writing in a diary every day is stupid. I suppose there should be something for the interns to do, but even the most paranoid in the Agency must realize that telling us to write down how we 'feel' everyday is a waste of time. I feel like I am a girl from one of the videos they showed us of Americans and their lives. Don't their teenage women write in diaries?

Dear diary. I feel fine. There, boss should be satisfied now. Miserable fuck.

[

February 21, 1963

Dear diary. Today I felt pretty awful. I guess I must be coming down with something. I know I shouldn't have trusted any Chinese food. I feel nauseous, but I can't seem to puke. Maybe I can sleep it off.

[

February 22, 1963

I couldn't get a fucking wink of sleep last night. This is what I get for living alone, nobody to take care of me. I was shivering in my bed all night. Damn these winters! All the blankets and furs couldn't keep me from feeling like I was in an icebox and then when I woke up and shaved, I must have had a black spot in my vision or something because there was a fleeting little line or puff of smoke I thought I saw in the mirror. My mind must be playing tricks on me. Nothing there, nobody but me in the house. Hey, maybe this is what the Agency was after? A shadow that moves by itself. I'm sure it'll fit right in with the entity that can only turn ketchup into mustard when you ask and it's a full moon, or with the anomaly that makes your moustache turn blue if you walk through it. 

Fuck this job. At least the pay is good. Not starving.

[

February 23, 1963

Another sleepless night. Can't focus on the words. My stomach feels like I am riding in a truck on a Siberian dirt back road while trying to read something about puking. I should see the physician as soon as I can.

In the meantime I could have sworn I saw that... something... something or someone in my house today. Well, apartment, I suppose. It was funny, I think my memory is just mixing with my vision - I could have sworn I saw a faint outline of shadow sitting where I sat yesterday, bent over the desk, just like I was all day yesterday. It must be the product of my imagination though. I'm sitting here at the desk now and nothing's amiss. Can't see the shadow now either.

[

February 24, 1963

I think I finally got some sleep last night, though I could have sworn I saw that same little dark spot in my bed beneath the covers. That's what was weird - it looked like it was *beneath* the covers. The spot ended when the covers began, and what else I could have sworn it was.... it was looking at me. I turned on a light, rubbed my eyes, and it was gone, but... I think I might call this one in to work. But... I haven't seen it all day after I got some sleep, so that's worth something. Maybe I was just imagining it, but I'm a bit jumpy now. We'll see how I sleep tonight. My stomach still feels like it's doing cartwheels or something... that Chinese was days ago, though. What greasy quasi-communist food. Disgusting.

[

February 25 63

I slept. At least a few hours. Woke up with a terrible headache. Writing is hard. Stomach still hurts. Saw the shadow again today. Headaches present with hallucinations. I called it in today just to be safe. They told me to take a few sick days off and that there was no lead in Vladivostok about a shadow. It's not just a shadow though, I see that now, it's a person. An outline of a person. Black like smoke. It disappears if I get too close. Maybe it's a ghost. Well if it is I'm going to find out and keep the credit for myself. No need to involve the higher ups if they'll just take the credit for 'rescuing me'.

[

Feb 26 63

No better. No sleep. Head hurt so much. Fucking A. I just want to leave but every light seems really bright and I don't want to go outside. Kept the lights off and stayed at the desk. Tried to nap, didn't work. I saw the shadow outline again, this time in the shower. It didn't even look at me. I think I want to leave.

[

2-27-63

I decided I need to stay to figure this the fuck out. I can barely get any sleep at this point but the outline is showing up more and more frequently so maybe it'll try to communicate with me. Imagine that, Vasin would be the first Agent to communicate with a paranormal entity. Straight to the fucking top baby. I sat across from it at the table today, it just held up its arms like it was reading a newspaper. Funny, I did that yesterday. Why does it imitate me? It's creeping me out.

[

2-28-63

**NOTE: The script is erratic and jittery now, which proceeds to become more frantic as the entry goes on.** The outline is thick now. Thick enough to see it clearly. It's definitely a person. I think it's me it looks like me it has my hair and when it turns I can see it's nose like mine the outline is getting thicker and I feel so sick so sick can't think straight because of my headache and lightheadedness, so lightheaded. Cut myself shaving this morning, hand was trembling from not being able to sleep. That fucking outline was in the bed again, just fucking looking at me I fucking hate I fucking hate it so much I cant sleep and I'm just going to leave. It's not worth it.

Can't

Door locked, I can't get it open. Outline must have locked it somehow, tried to call the Agency but it didn't work, phone line must be dead too

I'm gonna see if I can hold out in the bedroom, I see it now walking around, opening my icebox and sitting where I sit and doing whatever the fuck I do or whatever the fuck I did rather

maybe that's all it can do is just imitate me it hasn't done anything I havent not yet it must be one really fucking stupid gho

END OF JOURNAL OF ROMAN VASIN

AGENCY DESIGNATION: Yellow-Orange (Limited damage, clearly malevolent)

AGENCY SUGGESTION: Primary directive is to detain the Assumer, or anybody attempting to pass themselves off as Roman Vasin. The name has yielded a few matches in the census of Vladivostok, and they have been rounded up and detained and will remain so for the duration of the investigation. We can't afford to let the entity escape if it is pretending to be Vasin. 

The Assumer's use to us is multifaceted. Assassination, espionage, and possible psychological warfare. If it is a pliable entity it could be used to devastating effect in a large number of ways. 

CASE STATUS: ONGOING

____________________________________________

This was the first of two case files pertaining to the Assumer, who was thus named because he 'Assumed' the entirety of its victim's life. Personality, routine, and, we assumed at the time, physical appearance. Thus we launched an ongoing investigation for similar stories, and a manhunt handled by the KGB for the AWOL Agent Roman Vasin. He was never found. However once we sent some Agents to suggest the story to locals and see if they had ever heard of something similar... we found a few leads. I was one of these Agents - I would go to a pub, make idle chat, then tell a scary story about a spirit that steals your life. Some people helpfully noted that they had heard of it before, and we gathered information thusly. Golovin was in charge on this case, though. He was a good man - dependable and level-headed. But luck tended to be the deciding factor who lived or died in our line of work.

____________________________________________

Agency of Paranormal Investigation, est. 1953

Document #555.2

DATE: May 19, 1963

SUBJECT: Codename Assumer, classified Natural Entity

LEAD AGENT: Mikhail Golovin

LOCATION: Vladivostok, at streets **WITHHELD** and **WITHHELD**

Agents bring into custody a mild-mannered middle-aged man in a scruffy business suit that does not seem to have either been taken off or washed in at least a week. The man has haggard lines around his face but seems to be full of life and vigor, if a little confused. After standard processing and decontamination procedures the man, identified only as Sergei, is placed in an interrogation cell with Agent Golovin. The ensuing conversation was taken into records via an Agent on the other side of a one-way mirror.

Sergei (henceforth 'S.'): Why have you brought me here?

Golovin (Henceforth 'G.'): We have questions for you, nothing that a normal person wouldn't be able to answer. Are you willing to comply?

S. Certainly.

G. Good. Alright, first, I want your name. Full name. Please understand we will know if you are lying.

S. Of course. My name is Sergei.

G. Sergei what?

S. What?

G. Your last name. Surname. What is your surname?

S. **There is a long pause.** I... can't seem to remember it. Silly me, ha, my brain just seems to be malfunctioning again.

G. I see. And... it says here that your friends tell us you've stopped going to the bars with them, stopped playing chess, stopped... 'doing what you used to like to do', can you tell us why that is Sergei?

S. Do I need to justify why I don't enjoy doing certain things anymore? I guess I just got bored of those hobbies.

G. Your friends also tell us that your personality has changed quite a bit. They say you're being cruel, or angry.

S. Not their concern. 

G. And you were fired from work because your boss said you stopped getting even the fundamentals of your job right.

S. I guess... it was just a bad week. Being tired, sick, out of it. I'm sure you've had your fair share of hangovers, Captain.

G. I'm not a Captain, and I definitely have, but I didn't forget how to do my job for half a month because of it, Sergei.

S. I guess that people just change sometimes. As for your questions, I don't see how they're relevant, and I really should let you know that it would be best for both of us if you let me go... now. 

G. I'm afraid I can't do that, Sergei, and you know it. You should know that we want to work something out between us.

S. **Another long pause.** No. That won't work.

G. **Sighs.** If you won't cooperate, then we'll have to detain you until you do.

S. Which would be another mistake.

G. For you?

S. For you.

G. I doubt that. Guards, could you please -

*At this point the audio feed from the chamber was terminated and the lights went entirely dark. Armed personnel were unable to get into the locked door. Chamber remained sealed and dark for ten seconds. When the lights flickered back on, Agents reported a scene of carnage similar to that of Vasin's place. Sergei's body was lying on the floor beside the chair he had been seated in, whilst Golovin's body was never found. The room was covered in gore, presumably from the deceased Golovin.*

AGENCY DESIGNATION: Orange (Limited damage, incapable of controlling, clearly malevolent)

AGENCY SUGGESTIONS: Desist efforts to detain Assumer. Kill hosts if identified. Hopefully the entity will be susceptible to some sort of weapon which can be used to destroy the entity before it causes any more damage to government property. The entity is considered far too volatile to be of any use as a weapon, and it resists even the most basic attempts of civil communication. Note: perhaps in the earlier stages of its 'assuming' it might be weaker or more susceptible to be chased away? If the opportunity arises experiment further.

CASE STATUS: RESOLVED

_________________________________________

The document is one of the first detailing an encounter with a vicious and, for lack of a better word, 'evil' thing. The Agency, or rather the people in it, were not prepared to deal with a new threat of this magnitude. We were too used to dealing with benign entities, ones that didn't care enough to avoid our attention. I do not know why there was such a sudden shift of the kind of things we found in the early '60s, but it happened, and we just had to deal with it.

The most important thing? The Agency never cared about our lives. Not from the get go, and up until the end, we were all expendable. It is a very Russian concept, to view people as cannon fodder, whose lives are relevant only in the currency of their expenditure. Golovin was unlucky. I was lucky. In the end, when you're dealing with things as powerful as what are in these documents, luck is really all that kept anyone alive.

I will let you all mull over this. Maybe you have seen the Assumer. Maybe there's more than one out there. And maybe this might help explain why your friend has been acting strangely lately.

Stay safe."

Next year will be my final year of undergrad and I am looking for an internship in algorithmic trading anywhere in the world. I have applied to places like GETCO, D. E. Shaw, Jump, Tower, Wolverine, and Allston but am wondering if I'm missing out on any good companies, especially those outside the U.S.

As for my background, I am a computer science major at a top 3 school for CS with a very quantitative background (my specialization within the major is in artificial intelligence, and I have taken classes in statistics, machine learning, optimization, and control theory). Also, I am very interested in functional programming (but before you ask, Jane Street has already rejected me).

Thanks in advance for your help."

I recently graduated from a UC in california with highest honors (summa cum laude).   I have also had a software engineering internship experience with a leading hardware company (think Nvidia, Intel, AMD).  I currently do programming exercises on sites such as codeeval, projecteuler, etc.  I am attempting to learn Ruby on Rails.  I've also read both Programming interviews exposed and cracking the coding interview.  


Don't get me wrong, I am able to get plenty of interviews at both big/small companies (seeking positions in silicon valley/bay area).  However, I always seem to get the response, ""Although the interview went well and your coding is good, there's someone who's a better fit for this position and we are not moving on.""  How do I improve based on responses like this?  Sure, I may not be able to answer coding questions the fastest or the best, but I am very good at analyzing and answering problems through a theoretical view, but not a ""practical"" view.  I also understand that my experience is not all that amazing, as I only switched into computer science at the end of my sophmore year, but should a new college graduate with great academics be struggling this much?  Looking back, I wish I had gotten into programming earlier and had more internship as getting hired through an internship seems to be the ideal path.  Now, as a graduate, companies are much less inclined to offer internships.  I also see a lot of people working on github or personal projects, however, I feel like these experiences can be completely useless without any mentorship as bad habits or coding practices go unnoticed.  


Do you guys have any other suggestions? or is it time for me to head back to school or apply to some companies an airplane away from california?"

My concern is my first degree is in English and so now I'm getting the lightest version of CS my school offers. I know it's enough (along with my two cs internships) to get an entry level software engineering job, but since I haven't really been doing any math, I'm concerned I wont be qualified for sciency development jobs. It also seems like a lot of scientists just learn programming on the side as a hobby and use matlab and stuff so they wouldn't need dedicated programmers?

Does anyone have experience or a take on this?

How late is ""too late"" to start?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o3ylz/i_feel_like_im_so_far_behind_the_other_people/,"I'm currently about midway through my first semester of University, and I'm doing well in terms of coursework; I budget my time well enough to get everything done early, get my studying in, etc. I'm here on a full-tuition scholarship that poofs into oblivion if I don't maintain above a 3.0, so that keeps me motivated enough.

I've always been interested in computers, but not in the way that the  guys in the program and most people on Reddit seem to be. My adolescent hobbies were doing work for my classes, playing basketball (up through Junior Year), and playing video games. But, now, I've been talking to a lot of guys that are my age and planning on majoring in Computer Science, and these guys have ACTUALLY BEEN DOING COMPUTER SCIENCE growing up. I didn't even have AP Computer Science at my school.

All I had were a couple of summer camps where I learned about 2-3 weeks of Python 3 and (a few summers ago) very rudimentary C#. But I still am infinitely further back than some of the guys here. Hell, this is going to be the first year of my life I'm running an OS that's not Windows, because the department wants us in Ubuntu.

Like, just today I was talking with a guy about how we have to pick between Java and C++ for a class in the 300 block, and he said ""Yeah, they probably just want to offer both an interpreted language and a compiled language"" and I had to just nod my head like I had any idea what the difference was. (I looked it up when I got back to my residence hall; apparently Java is actually compiled to bytecode, but that doesn't make a difference to the programmer. Or something.)

***My question is actually starting here:***

So, to make a long story short, I feel like I don't actually know anything about Computer Science other than how to write really basic programs, since I was always putting it on the backburner before Uni and my school wasn't quite the boon either. Now, I'm seriously questioning whether this is worth it, when I'll basically be playing catch-up with my graduating class in terms of outside knowledge.

- Do people who ""start"" CS in their freshman year of university stand a chance in the real world? Why would anyone give me an internship when there's going to be someone else who's been coding since he was 12 years old?
- If I am able to continue, is it worth it to look for summer internships when more than likely I'll be at the bad end of the bell curve? Should I just use my summers to be an autodidact instead?

I'm sorry this got so long, but I've just been really frustrated with how little I actually know, kicking myself for my past and worrying like hell for the future. Thanks for your input in advance!"

I've been taking classes at a local community college with the plan to transfer to UNT in Denton to pursue a BS in CS. I chose UNT just out of convenience because it's closer to where I live than any other 4 year college. I should note that I'm a non-traditional student, 30 years old, and moving for the sake of school is hard. However, several times now it has been brought up to me in conversations that UNT is “not an engineering school” or at least they are not known for that or computer science. When people think UNT they think of liberal arts and music. College is expensive so if I'm going to spend as much as I am on college driving a bit down the road for a college that is known for engineering and computer science doesn't strike me as insane.

Specifically I'm considering UT Dallas that happens to be right smack in the middle of the “Telecom Corridor” where 600 technology companies are housed. Their internship program is large and even Google and Microsoft consider the school good enough to recruit from. Even if I went to UNT, internships will likely be from that area, so I could find myself driving over there regardless. On the downside, the commute is 50 minutes compared to 25 to UNT―each way. Furthermore, the classes I'm taking transfer, but not as cleanly as it would into UNT. UNT also lets your GPA transfer into an overall GPA category sperate from their GPA, but it affects if you graduate with honors. UTD does not transfer GPA whatsoever, which is annoying because I have a 4.0 GPA. UTD seems to have a much larger CS program, which means more class offerings, which means easier to create a sensible schedule. UNT has less and I may find myself driving back and forth more often. I cannot tell if I'm being pedantic about the whole thing or considerate.

Was told about the internships responsibilities, which was interesting. He said it would be 50% coding work and 50% research.

Allotted time was 1 hour. We finished in 30 minutes.

He said he would get in touch with me but would be out of town for the next 2 weeks (also needed to discuss with other people apparently).

Curious as to if that is a bad sign? (No immediate response and shorter interview duration than was expected)

I am a computer science fresher (UK) and I kind of expected my course to be very loaded and that I would barely have any time to do anything besides coursework. Turns out this is not the case, and I am going to have a considerable amount of free time. Since I am not the sort that goes around partying, I would like to do something useful when I am done with my coursework.

I guess I am using the word ""useful"" a little ambiguously here, but it's hard to be very specific in my third week of my first year, but generally I mean things that would benefit me when I graduate, i.e. stuff that's good for getting a job or continuing to a masters.

The only things that I've come up with are: Coursera courses (and other MOOCs),  competitions, attending career events organised by the university and other organisations, desperately trying to get internships (from what I've heard, it's pretty hard to get anything during the first year, but still not impossible) and doing some recreational coding the result of which you can actually show to people.

So, what are your opinions on this matter?"
1o8nca,6,2013-10-11,How to Choose a College or University,steve_nyc,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1o8nca/how_to_choose_a_college_or_university/,"Choosing a college is a very personal decision. Only someone who knows you extremely well can suggest specific schools. And if you don't know what kind of school you want to go to, how can others make recommendations for you?

However, here are some factors to consider when evaluating schools that interest you:

&gt; 

**1. Cost**

How much is the tuition, room, and board? Public colleges and universities often offer significantly cheaper tuition for in-state students.

Can you get merit aid or financial aid? If so, how much?

To what extent can you negotiate with the financial aid office?

Also, don't forget to factor in the fact that if your school is far from home, plane / train fares add up quickly.  



**2. Academics**

What kind of degrees does the college offer?

How strong is the college in your areas of interest? For example, if you want to major in finance, how reputable is the finance program?

Are there any combined undergraduate and graduate degree programs?

How competitive is the student body?

What's the ratio of students to faculty?

What's the average class size?

How accessible are faculty to students (email, office hours, etc.)?  



**3. Career**

What kind of assistance does the career services office offer?

What's their success rate with placing students in jobs and internships?

What kind of employers typically come to campus to give workshops?

What kind of employers have special relationships with the college for internship programs?  



**4. Extracurriculars and Social Life**

What kind of student organizations are there?

How prominent is the Greek life (fraternities/sororities)?

How strong are the school's sports teams? How strong is school spirit?

What percentage of students live on/off campus (dorms vs. apartments vs. living at home)?  



**5. Student Body**

How diverse is the student body (race/ethnicity/religion/national origin/gender etc...)?

What's the average age of an entering freshman?

What percentage of students transfer in (and out) of the college?

A little background on me: I originally went to school as a bio medical engineer but saw I would have to take more and harder classes than a premed student. So after a year of being indecisive and trying to find a major I chose finance, my parents to an extent pushed me into something practical. I have a few extra curricular activities but nothing spectacular that don't make me stand out. After graduation I had an internship with Toyota doing operations. In school I had taken a few higher level operations classes 6 sigma type stuff. I had enjoyed those classes and thought what the heck. I found out quickly that is wasn't for me. So it has been a month since I have finished that internship, I feel that I am just wasting my time (which I am). I have heavily contemplated going back to school for medicine, I know 3.3 is low but I would have to take another 2 years of undergrad just to take the MCAT so i can bring that up. My reason for this is medicine will give me a solid upper middle class income (I believe even with the affordable care act this still will be true, also both parents are in the medical field so they know some people whereas they know no one with finance), where as with finance I feel that statistically I will only top out at around maybe 100k (with an MBA in the future). So I was just wondering if anyone has advice or guidance for me on what to do about this. "

first I would like to introduce myself. I am a 3rd year(and final) IT/Programming college student from europe. My programming skills for now revolve around:  
* Java - was taught in college since day one, somewhat dislike it.  
* SQL,html,css - had few classes in college, know the basics, not a big fan.  
* Python - been learning for quite a while and I really love the language so far. Regarding the knowledge level I would I'm entering the advance seas currently.  
* Going through codecademy.com courses for java-script(not a big fan) Ruby (like it quite a bit), finished Python long time ago(loved it). Did a bit of HTML,css,js,jquary there as well, was quite fun.  
* Did WYSIWYG drag and drop programming with middleware software during my internship(found it quite fun) with this tool in particular [Transform](http://www.bottomline.com/document_process_automation/transform.html)  

Now since we're pretty much learning documentation and other forms of paperwork in college I don't have much programming to learn and I don't know how to further develop my skill for my upcoming career.

I am planning to graduate in 2016 hopefully. I want to find an internship or some type of work experience as soon as possible but I'm really worried that I won't be able to find anything because: 

1. I have absolutely NO WORK EXPERIENCE at all. I've never held a single job in my life, not even one at McDonalds flipping burgers. 

2. I go to a community college right now. I know there is a stigma associated with CCs and I think once employers find out I went to one they will think I'm stupid/lazy/unmotivated and this will significantly hurt my chances. 

3. I have really bad social and communication skills, I'm kinda socially awkward and speak with a mild stammer and sometimes I also talk a bit too fast. 

4. I have absolutely no experience with either phone or in-person interviews so I have no clue what to expect when I do get one. 

5. All the resumes I have sent out so far have received absolutely no responses at all, even for part-time IT jobs that pay $10 an hour. I've sent out ~20 resumes so far and have gotten nothing. 


Basically I'm really worried that I won't be able to find any job. I'll be graduating at 23/24 which is 2 years later than most people graduate, which means I'm 2 years behind in the workforce. 

The only advantage I do have is that I work on some hobby projects in my spare time, but they are TINY and they absolutely suck.. most of them are rails and php applications. I also know C and Python but don't really use it for much. But combine this with the fact that I have no ACTUAL experience and seems like this won't help me much.

The manager who is offering the position knows I do not have any real SW experience. He also knows that I am extremely hardworker and should have no problem quickly getting up to speed for the position. 

The gist of position is building custom modules (mostly with C#) that interface with our hardware in a way that could not be solved with our traditional programming methods (proprietary language) used to control our hardware. It's not a FW position.

My question is what is a reasonable salary to expect? I'm pretty much going to take the position regardless of salary because it's going to move me in the right direction career wise, but I don't want to sell myself short. I also don't want to sell myself high because I know my true software development experience is zilch.

6. National Spanish Exam = Top 10% Nationally 

Courses and School Information:

1. Top 1% College Preparatory HS in South Texas

Outside of School Courses:

1. Introduction to Biology (MITx) = Passed
2. Solid State Chemistry (MITx) = Passed

Sports:

1. Football = I played for one year (Team MVP), but fractured my spinal column while training for sophomore year, so unfortunately I cannot play anymore.
2. Track = Sadly, the same situation as above.
3. Bodybuilding = After rehabilitating from my injury, I’ve gotten extremely involved in bodybuilding. I lift before school 5 times a week and do a little bit of personal training for people in my local community.

In School Extra-Curricular Activities:

1. National Honor Society = The work I’ve done while a part of NHS fits better in the “Outside of School EC” section.
2. National Spanish Honor Society = I take the National Spanish Exam (NSE) each year and screen experimental tests for my school district. For my NSHS service project, I taught English to dozens of Spanish-speaking elementary school kids at my high school while their parents were taking night classes.
3. Chemistry Club = I’ve taken groups of other students along with me to take the American Chemical Society’s (ACS) Exam and received the highest score in my district for two consecutive years.
4. Student / Board Liaison = Honestly, I was a little bothered that the Student Council kids didn’t actively participate and instead use their positions for résumé padding. So, I created (with the district’s help) three positions that act as conduits for student voice. We’ve had a lot of fun and have introduced new, experimental curriculum that teaches through application of knowledge, as well as internship connection outlets for students to find what they’re interested in. I hold the founder’s position and will pass the torch when I graduate. 
5. “Student Aperture” = Building off of the last thing I mentioned, I decided to build an official academic organization at my HS (not an interest group since they have no power really), as a centralized hub for all of the awesome stuff coming out the student / board meetings. I coded a website, made podcasts, wrote papers and short articles, created a blog, and got featured in my city newspaper to help spread the word about what we thought was wrong with traditional education methods. If anyone is interested in knowing more, PM me and I’d love to tell you as much as I can!
6. Ultimate Frisbee Club = Just as a fun way to blow off stress, I helped create a club with about 100 members that meets weekly to play. I know it seems silly, but it has totally been worth it.
7. Academic Decathlon = I have been the team captain of my school’s decathlon team for all four years, where I’ve raised funding for each season, coordinated team study sessions, organized pre-season debates, and won several medals like, Team MVP (Region), 1st Interview (Region), 1st Speech (Region), and 1st Science (Region). As a team, we’ve gone to region twice and state once – and we’ve got a strong team this year so I hope we’ll be fortunate enough to go back!

Outside of School Extra-Curricular Activities:

1. 3-Day-Start-Up = I’ve competed for two sessions in a 72-hour, hyper-condensed entrepreneurial start-up program in my city. Here, I’ve won team MVP twice, built a company (elaborated on later), and have made several amazing professional relationships that will definitely help me after college. My business pitches are all online as well.
2. Molecular Pathogens Research = Last summer, I spent 60 hours interning in the oncological ward of a pathogen’s lab. My responsibilities included DNA extraction, biomarker reading, scheduling and interacting with patients, and general solution preparation. I loved being able to work with gifted individuals in the field as well as learn more about the disease affecting my mother (thyroid cancer). 
3. Pre-Clinical Research = The same summer, I spent another 60 hours learning how medicine goes from lab bench to patient bedside. My responsibilities included incubation, in vitro testing, and drug effectiveness testing. This job was especially valuable for me because I worked closely under a PhD who has helped me immensely with proper lab procedure.
4. “Spark Education” = Last summer, I, along with several other friends, built a community organization to teach STEM to underperforming middle school students in the impoverished portions of my community. We contacted over a dozen schools, hosted 10 weekend-long sessions with over 50 kids each time, and saw massive increases in their grades back at school. During the sessions which took place in a local co-working space, we split the groups up into teams, taught them Programming, Web Design, Entrepreneurship, and Robotics, and had them present to their parents. Honestly, getting to see them go from dejected to engaged was the most fulfilling thing you could imagine. At the end of the day, I’d like to say we inspired a new wave of local entrepreneurs and engineers!
5. Start-Up Venture = After the second 3-Day-Start-Up session, I kept in contact with my team and founded a new (yet-to-be-named) company that deals with severe problems affecting the academic publishing community (I’ve had to be vague because of intellectual property contracts). I hold the CFO and co-founder position. We’ve gotten 50,000$ of funding from investors, hired a team of 5 amazing programmers, established a primary market to test our beta, and garnered the attention of many philanthropists. Hey, now I can afford to go to college! Potentially, this project could be huge and I’m excited to see where it takes me. 

Recommendations:

1. I have a humanities teacher and my district superintendent (I’m actually very close with him, so don’t worry, I’m not just “name dropping”) writing my two letters. I know how important these are and I’ve taken careful measure to make sure they are both very personal, intimate recommendations that focus on my as a person and not just a student.

Essays:

1. For my essay, I’ve chosen to write a short, metaphorical piece that relates lessons learned in the gym to lessons learned from real life. Honestly, I felt very passionate about it, especially after my back injury. The way I approach problems and deal with failure all comes from underneath the squat rack. So, I’ve spent months writing as openly and as personally as possible to help convey my voice and be as unique as possible. 

School List:

1. Early Decision = Johns Hopkins University
2. Early Action = Northeastern University, UC San Diego, and UC Berkeley 
3. Regular Decision = MIT, Tufts, Carnegie Mellon, UT, Texas A&amp;M, Rice, and Boston University 

Thank you so much and I truly value each of your opinions and thoughts!

I may have forgotten some things, so I’ll edit and add as needed. Feel free to ask or message me if I forgot something obvious, I know I probably did.

Does company size matter?,sw_career,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ofsqq/entry_level_software_engineer_will_i_get_stuck_in/,"I'm a soon-to-be grad (BS) from a good school currently looking for jobs as a Software Engineer. I've had several dev and testing related internships, but they've all been at smaller companies.
So far the job search prospects are good and I'm currently in talks with a couple of companies.

One of the big software companies, the one I'm most excited about, is going to offer me a new-grad position in software engineering; now I must choose a location and a focus. The choices are embedded/os in Silicon Valley or automation/test in Georgia. This is problematic because I know I don't want to do test and I actually really want to do embedded/os. Unfortunately, I don't want to move to Silicon Valley due to high cost of living and various reasons for wanting to stay closer to where I currently study. Things I am trying to consider:

Will taking a testing position as my first job keep me stuck in testing, even if both titles are as a Software Engineer?

* I am told big companies encourage internal movement; would this be testing --&gt; testing or could this be testing --&gt; dev?
* If I were to take a development position at a smaller company, would it look as good as testing at the larger one?
* I'm told a lot of entry level devs end up doing testing for the first year, how different will testing and dev positions be early on?

How good for my career is a well-known large company vs a small company?

* How much difference in impact on a later job search will similar positions at a large and small company have?
* Would the position in Silicon Valley be worth the ~50% increase of cost of living with only a ~10-20% increase in pay?

Overall, I don't want to hurt my career right at its beginning, so the most specific questions I have here are:

* Will taking a testing over a dev position as my first job be detrimental to a career as a Software Engineer?
* Is large company testing &gt; small company dev for someone who wants to end up in dev?
* How much better is large company dev than small company dev for a career?
* Should I suck it up and not allow location to play any role in my decision? Is Silicon Valley a clear best option here?

Thanks for any advice!"

As I have been programming for a while (got interested in programming in middle school and it has evolved through HS) I am hoping/thinking it might not be impossible to get an internship for the summer of 2014.

I haven't done any big projects which can impress a recruiter, as I have focused on learning a lot of various technologies – also partly because of school work and depression. (Jack of all trades).  
I have tried to focus my résumé on being passionate about Computer Science, having a broad skill set as well as being willing to dig deep into a single area.

As far as jobs goes, I haven't had much. I've worked in a library in middle school, and as related jobs goes I had a 4 week internship while in HS.  
I've done a little freelancing for small communities (while in HS), but I don't know if that's worth mentioning as it's been pretty barebones HTML-websites with a simple PHP CMS as a backend.

Basically I don't have any jobs/projects where I can burst of my ""incredible"" conversion rates or how I have helped companies save millions of dollars. (But I am only a freshman after all).

I'm thinking of adding a link to my Twitter profile as well as removing 1–2 entries from the ""Experience""-section.  
Probably also change the ""Skills""-section. I know I'm not an ""Expert"" in any of these languages, but which level am I at? Basic, Intermediate, Proficient?

I rationalize this by the fact that UTD seems to be a good school for STEM type majors and the computer science department is better than my other choice. I also rationalize this by a possible pipe dream, and I'm wondering if I'm deluding myself. As many CS people point out all the time, don't be lazy, do projects and internships in order to get experience. Part of my rationalization of such a long commute is that the lion's share of internship jobs are over in that area regardless. I might find myself headed in that direction despite going to a college that's closer to where I live.

What I don't understand is how internships typically play out in software development side of CSE. Are most of them in the summer? Are a lot of students working part time internships while going to school? If that situation is the case, when and what days? I'm just wondering in general because I'm sure all these things depend on the job and the student.

In my deluded mind I'd like to see my self smoothly coasting into the UTD parking lot after a considerable drive, finding a parking spot without issue, and making it to class with time to spare. Then I see myself progressing through a sensible class schedule that leaves enough time for a part time internship. 

Trying to project more realistically into the future, I see myself punching the steering wheel after 20 minutes of driving around in the parking lot. Slowly traversing a schedule that takes up the whole day, and thus leaving no time for a part time job or internship. That would bother me, if I could find an internship in the first place. Despite not working, barely keeping up with course work and finding it hard to even commit to a personal project.
 
Speaking of course work, if I do transfer to UTD a lot of the classes that served a specific purpose for the other school and serve no purpose for UTD, end up taking up free elective spots. On top of that I'm pretty much done with humanities classes leaving me with math, physics, and a lot of CS courses to take. How likely would someone taking 15-17 hours of those type of classes be also working a part time job?

You're probably wondering why I don't just move. Well, I'm a 30-year-old non-traditional student with a house, so moving can be complicated."

1. Me. The business guy. I've been writing business plans and attempting to bootstrap projects for two years now. I'm very familiar with the initial licensing, validation, marketing, branding, seeking funding aspects.

2. The fraternity brother who I initially had the idea with. This man knows his way around fraternities (as do I). A social powerhouse and moderately business-savvy.

3. Our fraternity brother who is a web development genius. 

Together, we make a great team. Two CEO's and a CTO. 

Here's the problem. There's just so much to code that we won't make it in time for my proposed launch (for our first private beta). **We need to speed up the coding process.**


Options:

1. **I want to hire another coder.**

 I could work my ass off and pay them $10/hour. That would break the bank though and I'd probably sell some shit too. I do have a job though and I **could** do this. I don't think anyone would take $10/hour though. 


 ____________________________________________________________________________________
 
2. **We could ""hire"" another coder and give them equity.**

 I am against a 4 way split, we're already 33%, 33%, 33%. And I know how dumb it sounds to say you're going to give a coder 5%. I'm not sure what to do here.


 ____________________________________________________________________________________

3. **Outsourcing**

 I agree with our developer that this isn't worth it. He mentions that he would have to babysit and double-check their code and he doesn't feel comfortable with it. Same here.

I will be graduating this December with what I would consider a slightly above average Resume. I have no trouble getting interviews locally, and have done very well on every technical interview I have been granted thus far. However I am looking for positions on the coast (Seattle / SF / etc), and am having trouble getting callbacks; even from the likes of Amazon/MS/etc.

Last week MS did on site interviews at my school and I was not granted one; two friends of mine (one with a lower gpa and zero internship experience) got interviews, and both commented on how I would do very well on them (I routinely do algo type stuff for fun, be it project euler, topcoder, etc.). But I can't do well on the interview if I am looked over on even the most basic phone screens. I was also rejected from Amazon for even a phone interview.

I honestly don't understand what I am doing wrong. Like many students I have hoped to work at one of these companies, and not even being given the chance (aka an interview) is very confusing and exhausting to me.


Does anyone have any advice? Besides the large companies I have been quasi randomly applying to other well known and Dice search companies and have not been getting any responses. 

Thanks all

Having seen the popularity of [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/ccrvc75) in the [Should I Negotiate with Google](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ogl75/should_i_negotiate_a_higher_starting_salary_with/) thread
I thought it might be worthwhile for us to have an informal survey here in CSCQ
to get a better idea of what we should *really* expect when interviewing and
negotiating.

In the interest of making it at least semi-structured, I propose something like
the following format:

* Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
* Major/Concentration: 
* Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
* OPT: Interned At:

and then for each offer on hand:

* Company: $name
* Location: 
* Position Title: e.g. SDE, PM, SWEII
* Salary: 
* Signing Bonus:
    * Caveats or Obligations: 
* Equity or Stock Grant:
    * Vesting Period/Earn Out:

# EDIT/UPDATES

Glad to see such a large, positive response! To clarify a few things:

* **Target School**: I'd consider a Target for CS somewhere the top tier companies and VC firms recruit, e.g. UWaterloo, MIT, CMU, UW, Caltech, Oxbridge, Edinburgh. Essentially, be near the top for at least one computing discipline.

Additionally, some people have suggested adding:

* **Application Method**: How you applied to the company. Was it via on-campus recruiting, a career fair, internal referral, their careers page, etc...

* **Application Process**: Something as simple as a date range, e.g. `Applied: 9/25, Offered: 10/12` or a detailed explanation of the interview process. Whatever you feel works best!"

Even still I've applied to over a thousand positions yet I've received only one real interview and zero offers. I have a bachelor of science degree with a major in biochemistry.

I don't really have any passion for anything, nor am I particularly interested in any specific job. To be honest I don't really even care for life in general (I'm not suicidal or depressed, just apathetic). Due to my personality I don't really want any job that deals with people extensively. As far as I can tell I just don't think like most people do (I don't have a huge ego or think I'm a 'unique snowflake' or anything I've just sort of thought and acted differently from most people my whole life). I also have a very hard time lying and a low tolerance for bullshit so I can't really fake a more desirable personality during an interview or phone call. I'm really not interested in a job outside of a science related field either. I'm aware of how difficult it will be to find a job in my position and that I'm being picky.

I work at a small tech company as a process engineer. During our first couple of years, I saw the need for a way to record our data and created a data driven intranet app (asp.net/VB.net) where we could record our process data and maintenance records, it processed text files and inserted that into a SQL database. This worked pretty well but it wasn't the job I was hired for and the faults started to show through. Eventually we just needed to hire someone to build an application to replace mine and they chose of all fucking things MS access. In a bit of schadenfreude, it runs slow as shit and I laugh at it every time I see them trying to use it.

Anyways, I LOVED the programming I was doing. I loved writing the code and debugging it or trying to figure out how to turn a real world problem into code. You could spend a day or two on a problem but with perseverance and enough research, you could figure it out and it felt so good. It was like every day was a new victory. It felt so great to make something that would save someone in the company time and that they would use.

So now, I work in another part of the company and I've been trying to find things to automate with code but there is only so much that needs to be done and my manager would rather pay a professional to get it done quickly than to pay me to sit at my desk and learn programming. The big problem is I'm not happy. I don't really like or enjoy my job as it is now. 

My goals would be to help small companies develop data driven apps similar to what I did at my company or perhaps develop mobile apps. I'm not the only fish in the pond. Does every Tom, Dick and Harry who knows how to code also want to do that too? It seems like it could be a tough market. I'm sure I'd probably enjoy lots of other jobs but those are at the top of my mind. 

I don't think I would want to work at a large firm doing a small part of a job but I have no idea what a programmer at a large company actually does. How much is actually enjoyable work?

With those goals in mind I'm trying to make the decision to either:

* Stay at my job and learn to program as much as I can by myself. Pick up side jobs to get more work and practice. What else would be a good way to proceed here? I feel like the weakness here is that I wouldn't learn the *best* way to program a given problem. 

* Keep working while I go to community college and learn some programming. I do well with formal training/education so I think I would do well with this option but what to learn. Definitely a database class I think. 

* Quit my job and go back to school full time? I live near a large public university where I went to undergrad. My wife is in her final year of her Ph.D. program and will do an internship next year. This could be tough financially but could be done. Would it be worth it with those goals in mind? I'm certainly open to doing something else other than what I've listed above but I don't really want to help write the next version of metro UI unless it was to sabotage it. I would probably have to take out some loans to do this for the first couple of years.

Am I crazy?"

It is a little complicated but having an engineering degree should help right?,career123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ogvp3/need_helpadvice_on_my_career_path_it_is_a_little/,"I recently got some news that I would either lose my job entirely or would take a drastic pay cut so I am looking for a way out of my current position.

I have never had a traditional job. While i was in school i worked at a lot of bars. First as a bouncer, then bartender and by my senior year i was a Co-manager. The place i was working at got bought out by a local business man and i became the sole manager. As my senior year progressed they offered me enough money to stay and not pursue my engineering career. 

I graduated (from a decent school) with a 2.4 gpa (great test scores/terrible HW). I didnt apply for any other jobs before graduating. I had one 20 day internship in China but apart from that didnt do a whole lot.

So in the 2 years i have been the manager i have worked my ass off. I turned a failing business into a multi-million dollar a year business. I personally redesigned the interior (sketch up) and proceeded to build everything inside myself (literally one person). I remodeled/renovated a couple houses growing up and worked as a farmhand for about 8 years so everything was done quite well since i have some skills. As we grew we added more locations, I personally once again redesigned the interiors (using sketch up again) and completely gutted and remodeled 2 more locations.

I am currently the manager of 2 bars (capacity of 150 and 175), 1 bar/restaurant (capacity 400), a restaurant and i drew up the floor plan and design for another restaurant. Every business is self sustaining. I deal with approximately 50 different vendors, i have about 60 employees and 4 managers underneath me.

I currently make about 60-80k a year depending on business/bonuses and work anywhere from 0 to 100 hours a week (average about 20 hrs a week). I set up everything to be automated or par-systems to free up time when i was remodeling other locations so currently i work 12 hrs a week.

So what is the problem?

(ready yourself for a rant) The owners of the business made some bad decisions and had some shady dealings (all against my recommendations). They've squandered the massive amounts of money i made them and currently have to take out loans to pay employees. Instead of reinvesting in their businesses, like i did for them the first year, they've decided to live like rock stars while i watch the empire i created crumble. The whole thing should be collapsing by about December, if my math is right, and because of all the debt they racked up in the last 2 months i highly doubt there will be any saving it.

So my questions:

1) How do I apply any of my experience to an engineering career?
2) What should i call my current position on my resume? (ive never even had a resume)
3) I have a bachelors in civil engineering so what type of jobs should i apply for since i have zero technical design experience?
4) Do i say i ran a multi-million dollar a year business on my resume?
5) I probably will be leaving on bad terms since without me their business WILL collapse. So do i use them as a reference? or who do i use?
6) where should i be looking for jobs? websites? certain cities?
7) Am i going to have to take a large pay cut?
8) Im 24, does my age play any factor?

Im just generally lost and need some advice on places to start this process of getting a new job.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. "

I could use my interest/skills in maths and computing without day-long

1ol5pn,1,2013-10-16,"Submitted by background check information last Wednesday, completed a drug test and fingerprints last Thursday. Still haven't heard back.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ol5pn/submitted_by_background_check_information_last/,"I was offered an internship position last Wednesday immediately after an interview. I was emailed a contract, along with instructions to schedule a drug test and consent to a background check.

I immediately signed the contract, scanned it and emailed it to the Hiring Manager, and I provided the information necessary for them to complete a background check. The next day (Thursday) I completed a drug test and my fingerprints were taken in the afternoon. I received an email from the Hiring Manager letting me know that he would contact me when the background check clears.

So this is almost the end of the fifth business day since my background check was ready to start and I've yet to hear back. I've read some varying accounts of how long it can take but I've mostly seen 2-4 days. I'm a little worried that it's been this long, especially because I'm 20 years old and don't have a lot of education history, work history, etc. 

I know nothing would have come up on the drug test and I don't believe anything would have come up on the background check. The most trouble I've ever been in is a speeding ticket so I doubt anything there gave them pause. Does anyone have experience with background checks taking a little bit longer than they are expected to? Or worse, having an offer rescinded after a clean background check?

[As someone in between the psychology and criminal justice fields, do you feel that there is a workable solution or path to help stop the mentally ill from committing mass shootings through gun control? And do you feel that the suggestion you have is applicable with the second amendment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccseqtl?context=5)|If you dont want to have people commit crimes with guns, take away everyone's guns. But that's not constitutional, practical, or reasonable.
 |One: DESTIGMATIZE mental heath difficulties and increase education population-wide regarding the subject.
 |Two: increase the amount of quality, effective treatment options while at the same time reducing their cost. There are a lot of treatment providers out there who just coast on poor treatment practices just so they can collect medicaid money and they do more harm than good.
[Hello! Thank you for the AMA! I heard IQ test is not the best method to determine someones intelligence. What is your opinion about it, is the test trustable and is it ok to label people according their IQ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccscjed?context=5)|That's a big question.
 |IQ is just a proxy for someone's general cognitive abilities. It measures a vague concept that seems to be a decent predictor for a lot of outcomes, but it's not the be-all-end-all of factors (It doesn't tell you how well you'd do on Jeopardy, is what I tell people).
 |The example I like to give is that if you know someone's mile time,  bench press max, resting heart rate, and weight, you'll have a good idea as to how fit they might be, but as far as how they'd do in any specific athletic event, you really can only guess. IQ is the same thing, but for brainpower, so to speak.
 |So yes it's ""trustable,"" but it doesn't mean what most people think it means.
 |As far as labeling people because of IQ, no, that's either a bad idea or a useless practice. The only labels you could accurately apply wouldn't be very useful.
[How do you handle the issue of deception? Do clients often put up a ""defensive"" mental barrier because of the nature of your work, hold back, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccseblo?context=5)|Deception (or Impression Management, or Disingenuous Responding) is one of my most favorite topics. =)
 |People are almost always deceptive to some extent, doubly so during forensic evaluation time.  And there's useful information in that. What I always tell people is that it's not my job (nor within my ability) to determine the Truth-with-a-capital-T. I just collect information from all parties and that they can expect to be questioned further on any discrepancies that turn up.  
[I had two IQ tests as a child, one at age 11 and one at age 15.  I scored 113 the first time, 96 the second.  I attribute the lower score due to my mental health.  I was sleeping 3-6 hours a night and often I would just use one hand, as I rested my head on my other hand.   I was depressed and going through abuse at age 11.  I guess my question is, if someone is suffering from a mental illness, are the results  always accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdvvf?context=5)|Well the results, in a sense, are always pretty accurate because that's how you might have been functioning, cognitively, at the time, keeping in mind the fact that cognitive functioning is ABSOLUTELY effected by stuff like depression, anxiety, trauma, extreme nutrition, sleep imbalances, etc etc. It's important for the tester (and most importantly, the results-interpreter) to take into account information such as what you were going through when they interpreted the report. The number is almost always accurate, just like the number on a speedometer is almost always accurate... it's what causes the reported number to change that's often the most important.  Which gets to your second question... because context is so important, no, online IQ tests aren't very useful. Also, copy-pasted from another response...
[ question:  Are there any IQ tests online that are anywhere close to accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdvvf?context=5)|&gt; There aren't any I'd put any stock in, unfortunately. A big BIG part of why psychological testing 'works' is because they're developed with a particular protocol for their administration, and they're all designed to be administered by a human being as they require on-the-fly and organic decision making during administration.
[Edit: Ignore second question, I have my answer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdvvf?context=5)|&gt; IQ isn't something like blood pressure or cholesterol count, or any other empirically definable trait or quantity or substance. It's a proxy number for a proxy concept. 
[What is one thing you may have to testify about that isn't quite 100% verifiable? in other words, something that isn't so cut and dry as the public may think?  What is one misconception about forensic psychologists that movies, TV and media popularize about your profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsi4n5?context=5)|I would say the one thing that I have to talk about again and again is this: one's IQ doesn't affect one's competence in any given area, just like a psychiatric diagnosis doesn't pigeonhole someone in a particular category. IQ and diagnosis suggests a particular collection of traits but it's how those traits effect one's day-to-day functioning that REALLY matter.  Oh, also, the idea of an FBI profiler isn't what movies make it out to be.
 |As far as misconception, I'd say that psychologists don't go around automatically analyzing people all the time. We don't know what you're thinking. =)
[What's the most difficult evaluation you have ever done? I worked with a few patients who tortured animals, and those diagnostic sessions stick with me today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsgbax?context=5)|The ones that always get to me are the ones where kids themselves are accused of child abuse (""Crimes against nature,"" they call it here). The kids are just doing the best they can with the rules they think the world is run by.
[Also, what's the best outcome you were ever involved with? I've had patient success stories, so I know they are out there!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsgbax?context=5)|I think the best outcomes I have are the ones where I can recommend treatment and visitation schedules with disaffected parents that allow them to not so much spend more time with their kids but BETTER time with their kids. Parents do their best but sometimes they need extra help.
[What has been the hardest thing to overcome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cctaysb?context=5)|Hardest thing to overcome? Getting to the point where I can appropriately manage the effect my empathy has on my psychological well-being.
 |I work for a governmental agency. Any level of government that runs courts will have need for a forensic psychologist. So county, state, possibly fed, but it's rare to have staff psychs. Just so happens where I work it's in the agency budget. There's also room for forensic psychologists in private practice but because the evals are so time consuming the most work in that field is in family court which is very VERY exacting work.
[Now, she had talked to me when the office was closed, and nobody was there. The following day, I had another question, so I called her. This time, everything was different. She acted like the conversation never happened, and now I feel crazy. Is it possible that she believed I was officially released from my dependency court order from the fact I knew information about my radiation therapy, but my court order isn't actually done processing? It seems like a huge error on my part, but I am in trauma. I know trauma can cause issues with taking in information. What are the legal aspects to abuse cases, and childhood dependency records?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsvrew?context=5)|What my advice to you WOULD be, in this case, would be to find a therapist with whom you feel a connection (most good therapists  will meet with you for 5 or 10 minutes between appointments free of charge to see if you get along) and discuss this with them. Preferably find someone with experience working with adult children with a trauma history. They can guide you through the issues of getting old records, going through them, and helping you decipher just what they might mean.
[How accurate are IQ tests? I was evaluated by a psychiatrist (long story, but anyway\), and in the copy of a fairly lengthy report, he pegged my IQ at X (I won't post it, over 100 though\). Is this accurate, and what exactly does this mean? Is it possible for this to vary by test etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsm329?context=5)|First, psychiatrists don't usually administer IQ tests, so I'd guess that if the person in question was a psychiatrist then they were just making an educated guess as to what your IQ might be... and that's all that it is- a guess. I'm at the point now (it's a fun game I play) where I can usually guess within 5 points what a person's IQ is before I test them, provided I've had some time to talk with them.
 |And, yes, reported IQ scores can vary significantly from test to test, from administration to administration, from administraTOR to administraTOR, etc. Built in to each IQ test that's worth anything, though, is something called a confidence interval (CI; think: margin of error that you see on political polls). The only real, defensible way to report an IQ is in terms of its CI. If I meet three people  with IQs measured to be 97, 100, and 103, it would be professionally irresponsible for me to make any claims as to my ability to rank-order them on their intelligence. There's a fair amount of slop in the measure of IQ, which is accounted for by the instrument in the form of CIs, and should be commented on by the individual doing the actual test interpretation.
[What is the most common trait or attribute that criminals have ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsrj3p?context=5)|Lack of stability/support/security as a child that has ill-prepared them to function as an adult.
[What do you do for self-care? I am in an MSW program and am getting burned out with my internships. I'm starting to think the world is just full of wicked and cruel people. I am in therapy and it's helping.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct522l?context=5)|Therapy can be excellent. I also am associated with two or three dozen AWESOME clinicians in my area and we're excellent friends who hang out all the time. It helps to know people who go through similar stuff as you do.
[How do you help the overly empathetic? My husband has asked me not to bring home any more homeless people. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct522l?context=5)|I'll tell you, my experience with getting overwhelmed with wicked/cruel/sadness... that happened a lot, but you progress through it. You don't have to lose your empathy, but you learn how to open/shut the floodgate over time. It seems similar to exercising. You know how when you first start a workout regimen your muscles ache for days and can't walk, but then after doing the routine for a few weeks that goes away, even though you know you're still working out effectively? That happens emotionally, too. Another big part for me was realizing my limitations and that I can only help so much.
[How do you feel about the DSM-V?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccshd2z?context=5)|I actually like it. I feel like it does a good job of trying to put human suffering into meaningful categories. Such a vast undertaking is always going to have its faults, but I feel like the APA did a good job moving the field forward.
[What exactly did they improve on from DSM-IV?  The DSM-5 has many serious broadenings of what is considered a mental illness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsj59v?context=5)|Well, for example, I personally agree with the removal/attenuation of the Childhood Bipolar Disorder diagnosis. And I also like how they removed the five-axis diagnosis system.
[ create human suffering, by categorizing people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccss8q0?context=5)|While I totally get where you're coming from, my response to that would be: the DSM doesn't categorize people, it categorizes symptoms. It's up to clinicians to decide how those symptom-based categories fit, and it's usually bad diagnosis that creates categorization-based human suffering.
[They added other troubling childhood disorders.  Now having temper tantrums can be considered a mental disorder.  They've added many other new conditions as well which will increase the rate of mental illness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct3f30?context=5)|That's why it'll always be important to see a qualified and competent clinician. For example, if a child is throwing temper tantrums to the level that it is severely impacting life above and beyond what is usual, then maybe that SHOULD be considered a disordered set of symptoms.
 |There are a lot of people opining on the DSM who don't really understand how it should be used. I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm just saying its quite easy to attack in a hyperbolic fashion, rather than from a reasoned and scientific point of view.
[The way I see it, the DSM 5 makes it even easier to be considered mentally ill.  With the tremendous amount of people on psychiatric drugs, this is not a good thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct4fzw?context=5)|What's your professional background?
 |If misused by irresponsible or undertrained clinicians then yes it can have that effect. But that was just as true of the prior versions of the DSM. Maybe even moreso.
[4\) What are some common misconceptions regarding you job compared to the reality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsxbm5?context=5)|Writing up my conclusions and recommendations. The best analogy I can come up with is those magic eye posters. From a distance all the data I collect looks like random noise but when I think about it and think aboout it and focus it and play with it in my head, eventually it resolves into a clear picture (hey, it's a sailboat!) and I know where to take the report.  That we have some magic power of intuition that allows us to sense thoughts. Also- tell someone you're a psychologist and I guarantee you you'll be asked quite frequently, ""are you analyzing me right now?"" My response is always- no way. that takes too much work and I'm not that interested anyway.
[What are the general rules, guidelines for competency for which general areas of the law. Have or do you feel they are unjust in any way? How has this line of work changed your thoughts on this, if it has at all? And really anything else you'd like to add on the applications of this notion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsl9ln?context=5)|As far as guidelines for competence, I'd check out the Dusky standard... it explains what is required for an individual to be deemed adjudicatively competent, and I think it's a beautiful piece of law. I love the fact that our justice system takes into consideration stuff like that, and that serves as SIGNIFICANT protection for people who would otherwise be railroaded through the system.
[Oh and what's the one thing from your line of study and work you wish everyone knew or understood? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsl9ln?context=5)|I guess if I had to come up with one thing I wish everyone knew/understood, is this: everyone out there, from the sweetest old lady to the worst possible parent, they're all doing the best they can with what they have available to them. This fact certainly doesn't excuse reprehensible behavior, but once you understand that their behavior comes from SOMEwhere, that they're the product of their own upbringing, it suddenly becomes a lot easier to have hope for humanity.
[What are some free and reliable online tests one can do in order to determine IQ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdkrb?context=5)|There aren't any I'd put any stock in, unfortunately. A big BIG part of why psychological testing 'works' is because they're developed with a particular protocol for their administration, and they're all designed to be administered by a human being as they require on-the-fly and organic decision making  during administration.
 |IQ isn't something like blood pressure or cholesterol count, or any other empirically definable trait or quantity or substance. It's a proxy number for a proxy concept.
[Has there been much research done regarding the correlation btwn IQ and financial success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsd9f2?context=5)|As far as actual research I can cite, I don't really know. I do know that as an educated professional my guess would be that yes there's some correlation in that IQ tends to hang with academic achievement, and that academic achievement hangs with financial success, but that needs a big ol' Barry Bonds-style asterisk next to it as there are sooo many other variables that play a part (e.g., temperment, interests, original socioeconomic status, environmental factors, etc etc).
[Are you the guy they go to when people want to plead insane? Or am I thinking of the wrong kind of psychologist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccss8g6?context=5)|While I don't do those types of evaluations, yes, a forensic psychologist or psychiatrist is involved in that determination.
 |Fun fact- Insanity is not a psychological or psychiatric term, it's a legal term. There's no ""insane"" diagnosis in the DSM.
[Do you enjoy being a forensic psychologist? What major/degrees did you obtain? Do you find this career to be satisfying? What's the most interesting case you have been involved in so far? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccso77s?context=5)|I love it and find it satisfying, even though it's very challenging emotionally. I have a BA in psych and a Ph.D. in psych (School Psychology, actually), with a lot of specific training in forensic psychology.
 |I'd say the most interesting case was a custody evaluation that got national media attention. The media took our findings to be ""X parent can't be a parent because he has X medical condition,"" when in reality there was a LOT more going on that wasn't reported. Sure the implication of the condition was significant, but it was how the parent was handling the diagnosis and treatment that was what affected the judge's findings. It was interesting to me because it showed me what non-Forensic Psychologists will latch onto in a report, and to adjust my reports accordingly.
[I'm a junior in college right now in order to become a forensic psychologist. Could you please explain your educational background more for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsf45n?context=5)|Sure. I have a BA in psychology and a Ph.D. in psychology. Make sure you go to an APA-accredited graduate school that offers PRACTICUM experiences in forensic psych. Coursework doesn't really matter much on a CV/Resume.
[Is a Ph.D mandatory and/or would be beneficial to obtain? I've read mixed things about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsg7al?context=5)|For forensic psychology, yes without a doubt. The reason is supervision. If you don't have a Ph.D. then your work needs to be supervised, which blurs the line in regards to who is ultimately responsible for the submitted report.
 |For other fields, maybe not so much, but a Masters level forensic psychologist will find him/herself pretty limited.
[I see, it makes complete sense. Thank you so much for answering my questions, I appreciate it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsgsg6?context=5)|You betcha!
[Not sure if i'm late to the party, but can you describe a normal day/week for you? also, what was your dissertation on, broadly? and what are the requirements to become a forensic psych? i'm assuming you have a phd in clinical psych, but how do you specialize?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsjcfv?context=5)|Sure- let's see... for the most part, to practice forensic psychology you should have a doctoral level degree from a clinically-oriented psychology program (School Psychology, Counseling Psychology, Clinical Psychology) that is APA accredited. Also it helps to have formal forensic training through practicum experiences or from a forensic oriented post-doctoral experience.
 |My dissertation was completely unrelated to forensic psychology... it was more closely related to neuropsychology/educational psychology. It was very freeing to realize that one's dissertation  has VERY little to do with one's post-doctoral career options.
 |My weeks are probably spent like this: 15% psych testing, 15% interviewing, 5% phone calls to collateral references. This is all considered ""face-to-face time.""
 |15% scoring and interpreting tests, 15% writing up reports.
 |The  remainder is spent researching, speaking with stakeholders (e.g., judges, the DA, public defenders, Guardians ad Litum), and regular ol' boring meetings associated with government work.
[How did you get interested in this line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsco7y?context=5)|I went to grad school thinking I wanted to be a research scientist, but ended up having an opportunity my 4th year to work with an AMAZING forensic psychologist. I spent two years in her clinic and learned a ton. I find the work challenging as it requires me to be entirely open with my work and to be willing to hold it up to the light, so to speak, of public scrutiny. Also I like it because it allows me to apply the benefits of psychology to individuals who do not come from means, and who would not otherwise (likely) have a chance to benefit from it.
[What do you, well, do? What is the purpose and day to day work of a forensic psychologist? I guess my main questions are: why would you be called in; what sort of work do you do with clients; what is your goal in seeing them; what do you report on in the end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccspvh7?context=5)|Why I'm called in? The judges or attorneys suspect a person's disabilities or emotional/mental functioning are so outside the norm that they need substantiation from a mental health professional as to their level of impairment. (e.g., ""this guy can't remember what day of the week it is, he probably isn't fit to stand trial, let's get a psych to help substantiate that,"" or ""this teen has committed several sexual offenses. We need someone to come in and estimate the risk of him doing so again and the likelihood he'll benefit from treatment."")
 |What Do? Interviews and testing, LOTS Of interviews and testing, and reviewing records and making contact with collateral sources of information. The goal of this is to answer specific legal questions (aka Psycholegal questions) posed by the court.
 |Report on? SPECIFICALLY on the psycholegal questions. A court order has specific questions in it and it's  not ethical for me to evaluate or investigate functioning outside the scope of those questions (a client has a right to privacy). But in the end I only make recommendations. It's up to the judge to make determinations.
[Where is a reliable source to get an accurate personality test? Iq test?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccso03u?context=5)|A trained and licensed psychologist.  Half the battle is finding someone who can administer the tests in a manner so as to ensure a valid result, and the other half is finding someone who is competent in their interpretation.
[What are your thoughts on EQ/EI assessments? What about those assessments v. IQ when its comes to determining competency (to stand trial, parental rights, etc\)? In other words, could there be some use for EI testing in the legal system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccslc7a?context=5)|There really isn't a lot of research connecting the concept of emotional intelligence to various competencies.  It's interesting to think about, but HOW EQ is measured will need to be advanced quite a bit before it's worth even researching associations between competencies and whatever it purports to measure.
 |The thing about assessing for parental or adjudicative competency is that they are usually defined by statue and statue doesn't reference specific tests or test scores. It's up to the psychologist to integrate research with professional competency to justify just how closely his/her work comes to supporting/disconfirming the presence of the various statutory prongs of the relevant areas of competency.
[I do admit though that narcissists arguably possess psychopathic traits - so that's another bucket for our hypothetical subject - but from what I can tell it's relatively rare for them to demonstrate that complete lack of guilt associated with psychopath.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsor4p?context=5)|Lack of empathy (or a lower amount of empathy than is usual) can be problematic, yes, but only really if its in the presence of other troubling characteristics, behaviors, or circumstances.  And, yes, knowing results of psych assessments absolutely can influence their lives (else why would we even bother doing such testing?). It can go one of three ways, though- they can take it to heart, use it to make efforts for improvement and better themselves with it; they can ignore it; or, and this is the worst, in my opinion, they can internalize it and become despondent or bitter or disaffected and become worse off because of the information. It's because of that third possibility that I never release a psych report without having a chance to sit down with the client and go over the results in person.  One thing I always make a point of explaining to clients  is that a psych results just describe one's functioning AT THAT GIVEN TIME. You might be a different person one day, week, month, or year from now, and at that point your assessment results might be pretty different. It's up to them to decide whether they want those results one day, week, month, year from now to show worse/better/equivalent functioning.
[*One thing I always make a point of explaining to clients is that a psych results just describe one's functioning AT THAT GIVEN TIME.

It's up to them to decide whether they want those results one day, week, month, year from now to show worse/better/equivalent functioning.*  One last question, I hope you don't mind, but what type of clients do you work with in your private practice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccswzts?context=5)|Fair point, but I'd consider your examples as actual support for my statement, because of a slight technicality in how Forensic Psychology works (and your examples are all forensically based)... one of the cornerstones of forensic psych evaluation is that the person you're actually evaluating IS NOT your client. Your client is the court or referring agency and they are very much interested in making use of my results to influence lives.
[You know you're doing great work and I mean that sincerely. Most professionals wouldn't care to given their subjects such deliberation and care. Obviously they won't be the other extreme i.e. callous in their treatment of the subject, but they probably won't go to such lengths.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccswzts?context=5)|Pretty frequently. Being overly sensitive to others is just as problematic as being under-sensitive to others (by definition, I suppose... otherwise it wouldn't be called ""overly/under""). Overly empathetic people often perceive the world as a giant, cruel place that seems to be largely out of their control.
 |Thanks for the kind words! And in my private practice I see a lot of the same types of cases but usually they're clients with the means to pay for the services themselves. Generally, though, they're coming from family court and not drug court or the adolescent courts.
[I wasn't here for the AMA but have a question. Have you had any cases of PAS(parental alienation syndrome\) and how do you go about evaluating those types of cases? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsuoum?context=5)|PAS is a tricky thing. It's not even  agreed upon by in the field that it exists. But if it does, I've come across it. Evaluating it is tricky, but some researchers have outlined criteria for its existence that you can use to substantiate. In the end, though, the real reason for doing so is that it suggests a course of treatment to help repair relationships between children and their parents.
 |High conflict custody disputes are just terrible. They feature some of the most insidiously maladjusted people I've come across.
[Hello! I'm currently studying for my Masters degree in Forensic Psychology, with just my dissertation outstanding. I just wondered if you could give me any advice on how to make myself stand out when applying for psych jobs. My degree only covers stage 1 of the training and I currently can't afford the stage 2 training to become a fully qualified forensic psychologist. However, I do volunteer with my local probation trust. What else could I do to put myself above other candidates in the running for jobs? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsej7f?context=5)|Hmmm sounds like you might not be in the United States.
 |Here in the states licensing is done on a state-by-state basis, and if you're not licensed at the doctoral level you need to work under the supervision of a doctoral-level psychologist or a medical doctor. Additionally, not ever state grants field-specific doctoral licenses.
 |But to make yourself stand out get yourself actual on-the-job training. Volunteer and do it for no pay if you have to. And get very VERY good at writing.
[When meeting somebody, on your job, what is normally the conditions, and what do you talk about? Also, are you employed by the state you live in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccse8y3?context=5)|I am employed by the local government agency, yes, but I also maintain a small private practice for evening/weekends work.
 |People I assess are always done via court-order. A judge or a pair of attorneys somewhere did the law equivalent of throwing their hands up in the air and saying ""We have no idea what's going on"" and then they order an individual to forensic evaluation to answer specific questions. My to-be clients are usually not happy about that, and can be reluctant to talk to me, but I can deal with that.
 |My job at that point is to find out as much as I can that's relevant to the question(s), which is usually done through extensive interviewing of the individual and third parties as well as through testing. Interviews tend to be focused on collecting information about their social, work, education, medical, psychological, etc history.
[What is your IQ score? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccslpre?context=5)|I don't know. I haven't been tested since 3rd grade. And now with my knowledge of most all of the major IQ tests, any score obtained from administration of such a test would be invalid.
[Interesting... It sounds very similar to what happens when somebody is admitted to a  hospital. Thanks! Also, are you able to tell me specifically what you do/say to have reluctant people speak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsei15?context=5)|It's all about setting the relationship. I tell them (honestly) that I don't work for the defense, and I don't work for the prosecution, and I don't work for the police. I work for the judge and my job is to collect information and present it so that he/she can make an informed decision. I also make sure to emphasize that their own input is very important and that in order to make sure the best help is made available to them and/or their children, they need to make sure they are honest about both their strengths AND their difficulties.
[Do you work with guardian ad litem, in regards to your findings on parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccswe76?context=5)|Oh yes, GALs can be quite helpful.
[How bad do parents have to be before you guys remove a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsnfs9?context=5)|Well it's never me that removes a child, thank goodness. That's ultimately up to the judge. It's called a Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) and it's very srs.
 |Usually if my services are requested, they're requested in a confirmatory, rather than exploratory, fashion. DSS has been involved for a long time, multiple case plans have been created and not followed-through on, and reports of abuse and/or neglect have been well-substantiated.
 |It's tricky. You don't want to TPR to soon, not at all... these parents have the right to have children and have a right to try to parent the best they can, but you can definitely TPR too late (which I kinda think happens more often than not) and end up subjecting children to horrible, horrible conditions for far too long.
[Based on your experience in the field would you say its better to TPR too soon or too late? (I get that its horrible either way but in which case would to child suffer less\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct32wj?context=5)|It really depends on specific variables in each case, which makes that question difficult to answer. If you remove a kid too early  you're violating the rights of the parents and if you remove a kid too late you're violating the parens patriae obligation of the state.
 |I would bet that if you did a file review of all TPRs it would have been better for the majority of the kids to have been removed earlier than they had been, but that's hindsight.
[That... wow. I think in your place I'd have trouble sleeping.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/cct5jg6?context=5)|There are definitely points in the assessment process where I have trouble sleeping.
[How effective do you think standardized psychological testing is? Can you share any experiences in which traditional testing methods render unsuccessful, and how did you proceed in other to reach your conclusion. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oiv73/iama_forensic_psychologist_im_an_expert_on/ccsdarm?context=5)|Excellent question. In forensic psychology generally the best way to proceed is through the idea that you're either engaging in hypothesis generation or hypothesis testing.
 |A good psychological assessment (fun fact: a psychological assessment, by definition, is a collection of tests administered for a specific purpose)... a good GOOD psychological assessment will use many disparate sources of data to generate and test hypotheses. Quality psychological testing can certainly help. The only psychological instruments I use pass the Daubert and Frye standards of expert witness admissibility... they need to be adequately standardized, have clear normative procedures, and hopefully have built-in validity measures. If they have all those things then they're solid instruments and if they're not completely irrelevant to the referral they're quite helpful.

:--|:--
[What is the most creative way that you've punished a student?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs5cdl?context=5)|Last year, a student used Chrome's dev. tools in class to do a mockup vandalized version of our school's home page, using lots of awful language (the kind of dumb stuff you see on Xbox Live). He freaked out his teacher, who thought he was editing the live site. I had him create an online resource guide -- basically an annotated bibliography -- about appropriate classroom tech. use, ways not to use ""gay"" as a pejorative, etc. There were a few other things, but that was the big one that seemed to work out okay.
 |Edit: (removed a) typo.
 |Edit 2: clarified time/setting.
[Why was he punished if he was working on his own fake site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8gc0?context=5)|It was on the classroom laptop during instructional time. He also was distracting other students with his haha-funny work. The misuse of the computer violates the Acceptable Use Policy covering use of technology. His behavior was a disruption to other students. And the language was inappropriate for a school setting.
[Whats your stance on religious in schools? Do the kids in your school do the pledge to the flag every morning like in the movies? I always wondered if this was real as it seems like the kind of thing you would see in North Korea or anywhere with an ultra-nationalist, over controlling government. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs5fto?context=5)|In one school district I've worked in, yes, they do the Pledge every morning at the beginning of the TV announcements; they don't in the other. Some students actually enjoy it, and that's swell; others are smart enough (and/or cynical enough) to wonder themselves why they do it.
[What do you think about the school that recently banned all balls from recess to prevent further injuries? Do you think PTAs and parents should be able to push their influence onto the schools and all the children in them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs6ofa?context=5)|I haven't heard that story -- where'd it happen?
 |I think parents, individually in groups and as a whole, should have input into what happens at a school, and that administrators should seriously listen. Parents have eyeballs on children outside of school, in a totally different context than we see them; 99+% of parents I've communicated with have been tremendously helpful and communicative in trying to help their kid and the school.
 |I do get concerned, generally (i.e. I haven't had to deal with this first-hand) of a PTA or parent group having a skewing influence on the school. An issue that gets the most or loudest attention is not necessarily the one that is most pressing for the school as a whole. But sometimes that disconnect comes from a lack of communication between a parent group and the school leadership, and not parental cluelessness. Most parents seem pretty well informed and reasonable about the things they know to be informed/reasonable about.
[It was in Long Island, NY. Link to www.cnn.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs72z0?context=5)|Huh. Sounds like there's an immediate set of circumstances that led to the change. The district's press release ([Link to www.portnet.k12.ny.us](http://www.portnet.k12.ny.us/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&amp;DomainID=1&amp;ModuleInstanceID=1781&amp;ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&amp;RenderLoc=0&amp;FlexDataID=13302&amp;PageID=1) says this is tied specifically to construction. The school has also provided softer balls so kids can still muck about. There are also other hardball games available at other times/venues. Having gone through a couple of school renovations, I can easily imagine -- heck, recall -- circumstances when we were concerned about students' unstructured time/running near equipment and uneven ground.

[Are you in a district with zero tolerance policies, and what do you think of policies of that nature and what do you think of the common core curriculum? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs60jl?context=5)|A primer on my thoughts re. ""zero-tolerance"" policies: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1of5ni/honors_student_tries_giving_drunk_friend_ride/ccriul2)
 |I don't quite know what ""zero-tolerance"" actually means vis-a-vis school discipline. There are, however, lots of instances in which a school is compelled by state law to respond to student behavior with a particular set of consequences -- akin, I suspect, to mandatory minimums. Policies like that can help reduce inconsistencies between schools and reduce inconsistencies between student populations. I suspect legislators focus also on ""sending a message."" These can also help reduce inconsistencies between administrators within a single school, but I think that's a need better addressed internally that by state law.
 |The flip side to mandatory sanctions in school discipline is that you will encounter circumstances where the mandated sanction isn't the best fit for the misbehavior. They don't take into effect history, context, or other circumstances that might make you inclined toward an alternative consequence.
 |Regardless, every state's constitution identified free and appropriate public education as a right; students and families have a property right to education, with commensurate due process protections when a school system decides it wants to take it away. A one-day suspension has a chain of appeal, and so, too, does a school's recommendation for expulsion.
 |I think the Common Core Standards look pretty decent in the content areas where they are developed. There is no ""Common Core curriculum,"" despite what some publishers might think: the standards are essential skills and knowledge, but I think schools and teacher-teams are often in the best position to decide the curriculum (i.e. the delivery device -- texts, pedagogy, labs, etc.) they use to help students achieve mastery.
[How does one become an assistant principal? Not asking in that condescending way Bender asked the janitor in The Breakfast Club, either. It's a job I'd genuinely like to do. What degree do I need? What internships? What kind of jobs should I do prior?  PS: Eat my shorts. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs831n?context=5)|You should start off as a teacher, and being a good, credible one. From there, most folks will pursue a degree program for administration. Look for one that has a strong focus on developing a small cohort, is taught by current practicing administrators, and will connect you with a meaningful internship. Some of the best admin. prep. programs are geared toward the school district building their own: they identify folks internally, partner with a nearby university, and have their own current admin. teaching, setting the students up to intern in their own schools, and then they usually get vacancies left by retiring/moving people. A lot of being a good administrator is knowing whom to call outside your building when you need help, and programs like that help you build relationships with those people.
[What do you actually do?  What is your typical workday like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs5ndp?context=5)|School starts at about 8:15; I'm in by 7, looking at emails that've come in overnight. Try to finagle my calendar and figure out where I'm going to be when I have holes -- usually, that means blocking off time to drop into classrooms.
 |About 10 minutes before the bell rings, I head out of the office and check out the bike cages and the drop-off areas, just to wave at kids and parents and make sure folks aren't crashing into each other. Occasionally, I get a call to cover a class while a teacher is caught up in traffic.
 |During the day: it varies. Two days a week are heavily dominated by meetings. The other days, I'm usually in classrooms, chatting with teachers about what they're doing, or walking the building with my eyes on infrastructure/maintenance (I supervise custodial and technology needs).
 |When students get into trouble, I sometimes get called down to address it. Depending on what's going on, I might send a student back to class until I can investigate further; other times, I'll start to address it immediately. It depends.
 |End of the day looks pretty similar to the beginning of the day.
 |Afternoons, catch up on all the emails I missed walking around the building. Start to figure out what my priorities are the next day.
 |This is kind of a skeletal description. My biggest responsibilities are safety &amp; security and supervising/coaching teachers; I spend most of my brain power thinking through those. I have sundry other areas of responsibility: technology, custodians, plus other acute projects/responsibilities as the need arises.

[If school staff were allowed to obtain and use a concealed handgun permit while working at the school, would you encourage your staff to carry a concealed handgun at the school?

I don't have any notion of whether there'd be an impact on gun-related violence in schools -- such violence is so rare that even one or two tick marks in one direction or another would be a huge influence on the statistical bottom line.
 |However, I would be concerned about teachers', students', and parents' anxiety about whether there is a weapon in the classroom. I don't think any of the parents I've met would feel comfortable with a weapon, even in trained civilian hands, in the classroom every day.
[What is your stance on standardized tests and our current education system? In my opinion, it is a failing system and we should take a look into the Norwegian education system as a model for ours.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs6trs?context=5)|I've seen teachers develop and use common assessments across their classrooms, then bring the scores back to share instructional and re-teaching strategies -- that's very cool and an effective practice. However, the bigger district, state, and national standardized tests aren't there yet: score-reporting can be slow and per-pupil performance data is vague. We do have too large a focus on these individual assessments. (Unfortunately, too often the local measure of performance -- students' grades -- are fluff and inconsistent; they're not always a reliable or valid measure.)  I hadn't heard about the Norwegian model, but it looks interesting. Florida's legislature a few years ago proposed the notion of high school students picking a ""major"" as a course of study, e.g. if you plan to study engineering, you can be exempted from a language or phys. ed. requirement. Not sure where that went. Plus, it was Florida, which is pretty much the boondocks of anything K12-related.

[What is the craziest thing a student has been caught doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs68kb?context=5)|I caught a kid once writing in Sharpie on a bathroom shelf. Not the biggest thing from my perspective, but for this particular child to get caught doing something even remotely bad was ... crazy.
 |I'm struggling with this question. I've had students punch walls and threaten police officers, come to school high, destroy their own property, and fight their grandmother (I got bruised stepping between that one). They were all frustrating and upsetting, but not quite crazy: all of them with anxious, angry, and desperate.
[As a student...I hope you realize A LOT of students come to school high.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs99ps?context=5)|Yes, and a few drunk -- and that's just the school day; games and other events are a whole other mess. I really wish, particularly at the high school level, our teachers were consistently engaging enough that students wouldn't want to come in under the influence. And also that for the kids who are self-medicating because of how despondent they are about X, we were all better at identifying and responding to it.
[You have to tell us the grandmother story.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs96p2?context=5)|Grandmother was the kid's legal guardian. We had a meeting at the beginning of the year, just to touch base: I had a good relationship with both, but there was some stress between the two of them. At the end of the meeting, grandma handed the kid his phone, which she'd confiscated a couple of days before. However, the lock screen code didn't work, and he thought grandma had changed it. He stepped close to her, got in her face. She pulled a hand back, and he grabbed her wrist. Then she whacks him with her *other* hand, and kicks *me* right in the shin as I try to wedge them apart.
 |School resource office stepped in, had a talking-to with her, and then him. Even with their normal level of straining, it was pretty aberrant for both of them; they were both weeping in each other's arms about 15 minutes later, while I was showing off my bruise to the other administrators.
[I'm a substitute teacher in an area where teaching jobs are very competitive, what are ways that I can stand out against the other subs?

You don't want a reputation for being a sub. the AP (who probably hires for that department) needs to cover for.
 |Try to meet the teachers in a school or two where you frequently sub; attach a face to your name. Make your desire known in the department/content area you're interested. Have lunch with them. Ask them for some short lessons/activities to keep in your back pocket so that if a sub lesson plan runs short, you have something you can lead with the kids.
 |If you have a good relationship with a teacher or two, work with them on their sub plan, and perhaps something instructional that you can do with the kids. After you do that a couple of times, ask the AP to observe.
 |Hopefully, you can get to the point where a teacher or administrator can write a good letter of recommendation for you for grad./certificate school or for a teaching position.
[Student here, I know that you guys are just doing you job most of the time, but do you ever feel pleasure at the fact that you are punishing a bad kid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsb7wu?context=5)|I haven't met too many ""bad"" kids -- maybe one or two. It is frustrating and sad to dole out *punishment.*
 |Sometimes ""punishment"" is kind of fun: NB the note elsewhere about a kid's annotated bibliography. Other times, punishment is a lunchtime detention...with me. And then we talk about video games and life and the kid leaves knowing there's at least one adult he has a decent relationship with.
 |Dealing with student misbehavior is a huge time suck. It can take an hour+ to conduct an investigation and contact parents, and then many hours beyond that if I'm assembling a packet of information for a recommendation for expulsion or have to participate in a manifestation determination review for a student with special education needs. Imagine, instead, I spent that hour working with teachers on strategies to calm students down or redirect their energy, or how to identify a student in emotional distress before they become disruptive. I'd much rather invest time in the preventative end than the ""autopsy-data,"" after-the-face end.
[Have you ever worked with a colleague who didn't care, didn't like kids, or otherwise made you question why they were working in education? How would you as part of the administration address such an issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8tmy?context=5)|Yes. One of them was so regimented and structure-focused that she had no flexibility with students and was draconian in her classroom management. She wound up transferring to a smaller alternative program where she teaches one-on-one with students who are often going through the criminal justice system. Last report I got from her supervising administrator over there is that it is a good fit, and that working with very small groups of kids has made her soften up just enough that the students feel comfortable approaching her. Her attentiveness toward structure and predictable routines is a boon.
 |Here's another one: my first year as an administrator I had a teacher who just was not a good fit with the department and who seemed not to like kids. Had a big chip on his shoulder. Most damning, he was not receptive to feedback and support from me or his colleague. But, gosh darn it, he liked his job. It took me a year-and-a-half of documentation, communication, and trying time and time again, but he ultimately resigned.
 |Most teachers, though, are awesome. Some of them lose sight that what they intend students to learn, or that what they intend to convey to colleagues, isn't always what comes across. And almost everyone loses steam at some point. And almost everyone says something really really dumb they wish they could take back. And that's why I'm around. I see myself as a coach for teachers. And occasional cheerleader.
[Did you have to have your parent call the school telling them you are out sick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs9sce?context=5)|My parents are DEAD ... *SLAP*
[In our school district there seems to be an adversarial relationship between teachers and administrators.   There seem to be constant battles over working hours, student discipline, required meetings and training, etc.  Is that true in most districts?  Or is that just unique to California? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccs8p8a?context=5)|My understanding is that California in particular struggles with issues like this. I've worked in both strong- and non-union districts, and that is one of the big culture differences between the two. I've found that a good principal can help alleviate some of that friction, either through clear and deliberative planning or, failing that, a great smile.
 |However, even in my non-union system, teachers would balk at last-minute meetings, useless trainings, inconsistent discipline. I can totally understand being frustrated by all of these. I posted earlier that part of my normal day includes a ton of meetings two days of the week: at both this and my last school, much of that meeting time was to check on whether we were using teachers' non-classroom time effectively, communicating well, etc.
[What salary range are you in as an assistant principal?    What qualifications did you have to become an assistant principal?    How old were you when you became the assistant principal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsmo8u?context=5)|Assistant principal salary ranges are ... ranges. An AP in some parts of the country will pull the real-dollar value equivalent of a principal or superintendent elsewhere. But, adjusted for cost of living, I don't think there are too-huge discrepancies. When I became an AP, my salary went up by about 25% over what I'd made as a teacher. Part of that, though, was due to going from a 10-month to an 11.5-month contract.
[Is the salary 6 figures?  Just trying to get an idea ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccso6r0?context=5)|Yes, some AP salaries, particularly in highly affluent districts, are $100K+ (but not much more +).
[What kind of student were you? Did you have many discipline problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsd3a6?context=5)|The only discipline issue I was busted for was in elementary. Senior year of high school, I and the other student newspaper editor released a jerky underground newspaper right before graduation.
 |Academically, I stunk at math, did great in English, and was meh elsewhere. I took a few AP classes but didn't get bogged down. Did a few clubs, most notably student newspaper; got a few big awards for that. Did school well enough to get into a solid out-of-state state school.
[No offense, but why is the *assistant* principal always the asshole, as opposed to the principal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccshuut?context=5)|I tend to see that at high schools, the principal often has a broader, strategic view of the school and is more heavily involved with behind-the-scenes issues (finance, student activities, special programs). The mass of Things To Do in terms of day-to-day operations -- including handling student discipline -- lands with the APs. I'm sure there are plenty of folks older than you who knew your principal when he/she was an AP, and they might've though he/she was an asshole then.
[My last assistant principal put me in jail for using sidewalk chalk at school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccshuut?context=5)|For what it's worth, my last principal a couple of times was receptive to me convincing him that a student deserved a diminished punishment for misbehavior -- or, hearing my update, he would convince me to cut it back. Regardless of who pushed it, he always told me to tell the kid and the parent that he was the one asking for a more severe punishment and that I was the one who talked him down: precisely because the high school APs have more day-to-day relations with kids, he knew that that kind of message might get me a favor, or at least some compliance, down the road.
[I'm interested in potentially becoming a school psychologist (ideally doctorate level in California\). I've heard conflicting opinions on the job outlook and description -- e.g., difficult market, high burnout rate. Do you have any thoughts on the nature of the career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsbnk4?context=5)|At my current and last schools, I've worked with amazing school psychologists; I've adored both, and their support with students at, or nearly at, a cliff's edge was tremendous.
 |I don't know the various routes of endorsement/certification for school psychology. The position itself involves a lot of time working with students with emotional needs, and it also usually means administering and scoring psychological testing as part of the evaluation process for special education services. Both of those I'm certain are emotionally taxing. The psychologist is often part of the IEP team for students who receive special educational support, and as an expert in the room, I've seen the psychologist sometimes become the focus of different-minded parents and advocates target the psychologist specifically -- again, taxing. So, I can understand reports of burnout.
 |As for the market itself, again, sorry, I don't know much about the outlook.
[I once had a teacher who despised and picked on me in middle school, wrote me up and whatnot for no reason.

 |If the teacher is writing superfluous referrals, I need to speak with the teacher about the volume/triggers for writing up the kid. At my last school, about five teachers (out of 100+) were responsible for ~35% of all discipline referrals. With one teacher I supervised, I required him to write his referrals with me; often, we decided it was an issue the teacher himself could handle.
 |I'm curious as to whether your AP ever went back to the teacher, and I wonder whether the teacher was trying to ding not just you, but also to irritate the AP who never did anything to squash you like a bug.

I've found teachers to be pretty good about reporting up their concerns around bullying and harassment, and as administrators, we in turn respond pretty quickly.
 |We're sometimes stymied, though, by lack of information from or follow-up at home. I've had a few students report to me that they told their parents weeks/months ago about being bullied, but the parents did not share that information with the school to do something sooner. I've also had some parents commit to take action at home -- such as calling a cell phone provider to block a number or to contact Facebook to report an offending post/account*, and then heard later that they didn't. (*Facebook has been very good in my experience about responding to parents/families when they raise the flag about harassing content -- and they've also been very consistent that they will only take action in response to a parent/family request, and not in response to a school request.)

Teachers can be frustrated when a student seems to be apathetic or to have no affect -- beyond that, though, if you're a nice person who does honest work, we think the world of you.
 |I'll put it this way, too: I taught probably ~1,500 students as a classroom teacher or program director before I became an assistant principal. Probably every single one of them was, for at least a moment, my favorite kid in the class. They answered a question right or helped a kid out or reminded me to do something, and I was grateful. Chances are, even if you're an under-the-radar kind of person, you've been someone's absolute favorite student at least once, even if only for a moment.

For a while, I thought TFA might be a good stepping stone for people who need ""teacher cred"" before shifting more toward ed. policy things; now, though, there's so much baggage around TFA, and the TFA experience is so wonky, that I don't think it even carries that much cachet among wonks outside a particular political sphere.
 |My best advice to become a teacher is to go through a master's program. Look for one with a nice, long field experience, preferably with partnerships with nearby school districts that themselves put in resources toward teacher training and support. You will need to have undergraduate or grad. credit hours relevant to your content area (at least at the middle or high school levels; I don't know what the specific course area requirements for ""highly qualified""ness is at elementary), so you might start jumping into those now.
[Do you believe that schooling has become increasingly revolved around test scores rather than content comprehension?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/cctaqgy?context=5)|I think even ""content comprehension"" is an insufficiently high bar. As a teacher first and now an administrator, I want students to be able to apply their skills and knowledge *beyond* the content I/teachers provide, and make connections with novel material.
[Junior right now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/cctaqgy?context=5)|There is too strong a focus on test scores. Data can be useful to start a discussion or in making decisions, but it is not an end-all snapshot of student or teacher performance. No scientist, after all, just publishes a spreadsheet of statistics and says, ""Here ya go; science done"" without reflection, commentary, interpretation, notions of what happens next, etc.
[How do you protect children from each other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsngko?context=5)|Most of it comes down to kids' relationships with teachers, and teachers being good observers of their students. Kids sometimes are also good advocates, either for themselves or their friends, when need arises. When students do harass or harm each other, there are a few things we might do: behavior contracts, schedule changes, escalating consequences for violating personal space, referral to outside counseling, or any number of other things I'm not thinking of.

At another school, behavior is much less intense. Testing wise, the schools where I've been have all done pretty well.
[I teach arts in an after school program in a reputable school in NYC with kids K-5 and I graduated HS not long ago.

For the latter, we pay particular attention to whether they are identified to receive appropriate services in school -- some students with autism benefit from a 504 plan (so named after the relevant federal code) for general education or an individualized education plan for special education. (And lots of kids with autism don't receive either.) If folks are concerned about making friends, we might try to coach them into joining a club, showcase some of their work...there're lots of options. It depends.
[Who is your favorite fictional Assistant Principal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oi73o/iaman_assistant_principal_ama/ccsfrqz?context=5)|Hmm. I'm having trouble even thinking of one. I think I liked the AP in Boston Public, but only because it was Anthony Heald. The only other fictional APs I can think of are the twits in Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club.

1onygi,7,2013-10-17,"[need advice] Currently in a software-engineering internship until the end of the year, but a contractor agency wants to hire me to work for a major gaming company.",narett,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1onygi/need_advice_currently_in_a_softwareengineering/,"The internship pays 25.00 hourly.  This is 5 bucks more than my first job out of college as a Tech Support Technician at a call center.

The major gaming company (I'd throw the name out but I want to play it safe for now) has a position open whose qualifications match with what I do at my internship, except with video game engines instead of corporate software.

A contractor company invited me to an interview.  They asked me a few questions, asked for me to do a few examples on a dry-erase board, and said they wanted to offer me the job but couldn't match my compensation.  At first, they said 13/hour, but today they called me back to propose 15/hour.

I'm willing to be paid less money to work for this company, but I don't think going down from 25/hr to 15/hr is good, especially considering my first job paid 20/hr.

I would've asked for advice sooner, but this went by fast.  When I was called again about getting the compensation raised to $15, I was told I could be given the weekend to think about it.  I told the guys doing the contracting to see if they could get me in touch with the hiring manager on the gaming company's end and see if he/she would be fine talking to me directly.  I even said I'd take the manager out to coffee to talk for 5 minutes if needed.

I'm 23 years old and I'm finally renting my own place.  I graduated from college last year so I'm fresh out of the education world.  I held a full-time job for 9 months, became unemployed, and then landed this decent internship.  This gaming company deal sounds sweet though.

1onux5,3,2013-10-17,[USA] Online contest sketchiness,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1onux5/usa_online_contest_sketchiness/,"This might be long winded I'll try to keep it short. My SO interns for an app-promoter (Android, iOS, Win8, etc) and I have been supportive of her in sharing their social media advertising (sharing with friends, tweets, etc). They do actually have some cool stuff...

Anyhow, yesterday they start promoting a contest on their FB page. I follow the link, make an account and read up. There is a brief introduction to the contest on the [homepage](http://imgur.com/9qKKife) to my profile, but no official rules page. 

It pretty much states to upvote or downvote, subscribe, be a beta tester, downloading, and other various activities get you random values of points. I was able to rack up ~9000, and cash them in to be sent a Samsung Galaxy S4 on the opening day of the contest.

I logged in later on to check for updates and the value of the Samsung has been raised to 15,000. I sent an email to ""contact us"" and the CEO replied saying I violated the guidelines/rules and he would not be honoring my prize. They have since raised the value AGAIN to 75,000 points for a Samsung Galaxy.

Also it states in his ToS that browsing there only falls under jurisdiction of laws in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

So before I make /b/ aware of this contest what ground do I have to stand on? I honestly did it because I need a phone upgrade and I feel cheated that he changed the premise of the contest mid contest."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[**Down in the Valley** is one of my favorite songs by anybody in the last few years!  Is there a story behind writing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlet6?context=5)|Not a great story. It's the same as most any song any of us in the band write, a little bit too much whiskey and reflecting on what the hell is going on in your life.
[FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHO IS JOSH MCBRIDE?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlah4?context=5)|He is a good friend of mine. The song was written about him by his lady, who is also a dear friend. It started as a poem, got turned into a song by myself and one of my earliest musical partners in Seattle about 4 years ago. The rest is history.
[Hey Josiah. Huge fan since the self-titled here. Your verses on Rivers And Roads are my favorite parts on that album. We actually met in Hoboken, NJ when you played a last minute show at Maxwell's a few years back. You and all your band mates hung around with my friends and chatted for a while and I left with a poster autographed from all of you guys. It's actually up on my wall right now and has been since.  I wanted to ask how the sonic shift in this new album came about. I've read statements that said you guys were inspired by touring with bigger, more eclectic bands, specifically Iron &amp; Wine for example. On this new album, I feel like you guys fell victim to the same fate as Iron &amp; Wine, in which you expanded your sound strictly for the sake of expanding it, without any substantial inspiration or direction behind that, resulting in you guys applying your great voices and instrumentation to generic, uninspired ""Indie Rock Lite"" style songs. Mostly gone are your wise and wistful lyricism and genuine backwood, down-home roots sound and what we are left with is an album full of songs that sound like Mumford &amp; Sons and Coldplay had a baby that just bought its first Microkorg last week. Was this shift in style encouraged and maybe a bit executively decided by Sub Pop? Was it more to follow in the footsteps of the big arena bands you toured with? Or is this truly the sound you envisioned for The Head And The Heart from the start?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlvzf?context=5)|I've never envisioned a sound for this band. I've envisioned writing great songs and then arranging them with the other five people in the band. For me, this album feels like a much more genuine reflection of what we sound like when we play live than it would have been to make another record that sounds like the first one. As to the phrase ""genuine backwoods"", none of us live in the woods, we live in a city. Making an album that sounded backwoods would be very not genuine. Which is why we didn't make that album.  From my perspective, this album is a document of what this band is into and what we sound like right now. Might change drastically again on the next album or might stay similar. If you don't like it, that's ok. Listen to the first one. I like this one better now, because that's where I'm at.
[Who is the main songwriter in the band? It seems like almost everyone takes the lead vocals at some point; is the singer based on who writes the song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctla7o?context=5)|We're pretty open. This album has more Jon songs, but we kinda open it up for whoever writes a good song to take lead. But yes, whoever is singing lead 99% of the time wrote the song.
[1\) Will you release some of your previous songs in a different album? Like Oh Virginia and No One to Let You Down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlogm?context=5)|Most likely not on the releasing old songs on a new album. But you never know. I know Jon has still been really into playing Oh Virginia from time to time live though, so that one is still living and breathing.
[2\) What would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlogm?context=5)|1 horse sized duck. Can you imagine how terrible you'd feel beating up duck sized horses??
[Would you rather be friends with 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm10u?context=5)|Definitely 100 duck sized horses. I'd LOVE to be friends with 100 duck sized horses.
[Excellent new album, as expected!  My question is, what are you guys currently listening to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlcvf?context=5)|Phosphorescent - Muchacho. Yeezus. That's pretty much it. On repeat.
[Where is the rest of the body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl1zl?context=5)|Below the part you can see.
[I caught a setlist at a mpls show in sept 2012. They had alternate names for ""rivers and Roads"" as well as ""Down in the Valley"" they were ""Rivieras and Rodents"" and ""D in the V"". Inside joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmam6?context=5)|Haha, just keepin ourselves entertained.
[Do you ever get tired of playing those/any songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmno9?context=5)|Oh all the time. Life goes in cycles. Different songs are more or less relevant as life comes and goes.
[Oh, goodness, what a great day. I love your music so much and am absolutely crushed that I can't see you play in Indianapolis next week- I got to see you last year in Broadripple and it is still one of my all time favorite experiences.  I remember you saying that that crowd was the biggest you had as a headliner. It made me really happy because I'd been listening to you for ages. **How do you stay so humble when you have become so popular? And what musician do you dream of working with?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlh2v?context=5)|I'M THE HUMBLEST OF ALL HUMBLE PEOPLE.
[Josiah! I wanna thank you for the AMA and for such beautiful music! ""Heaven Go Easy on Me"" def fits my life and ""Don't follow your head/follow your heart"" has inspired me to give up on the boring life of business and pursue a career in my passion instead - independent music.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl9fx?context=5)|I cannot secure you an internship at Sub Pop. But best of luck there!
[So can you secure me an internship at SubPop this summer?  But really, I started writing songs a month or two ago, and man its a lot harder than I expected. What advice can you give me for writing lyrics and music as beautiful as yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl9fx?context=5)|I wrote bad songs for maybe 7 or 8 years, numbering in the hundreds before I wrote a truly good one. Don't think you can just start writing songs and have a career. It is a craft that has to be a labor of love. You should write songs. More songs. Songs about anything and everything. And just try your best to get at the heart of what is true in whatever it is you are writing about. If you find yourself writing in cliches, I've found that means you're not being honest enough, because if you really get into your psyche, you'll find you say things a little different than anyone else. Stripping away the years of conditioning to not be yourself and fit in makes doing that really difficult at first, but it comes if you keep at it.
[Do any of you guys live together in Seattle?  Who fights the most in the group when you're on tour?  Who is the funniest person in the band?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlzsm?context=5)|We don't live together anymore. We're an Equal Opportunity Arguing band. Hmmm, funniest is obviously subjective. But to me, Charity is the funniest.
[Hey Josiah! Love you guys, have seen you three times so far and can't wait to see you again. Where is one place you haven't played yet that you're dying to? Could be a country, venue, etc...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlf24?context=5)|Wanna play in Spain. Gone to Europe a bunch but never there yet.
 |And Hollywood Bowl. I grew up in Southern CA so that one is a big part of growing up and the musical legends I nurtured in my brain at that time.
[Any plans to play Ireland? What's your favourite album of 2013 (that isn't you own, obviously!\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl9w6?context=5)|Not positive it will happen on this particular upcoming tour but we're coming back to Europe in February. I'm assuming we'll be getting to Ireland. Loved our one time there!
[Dude, outstanding new album. Haven't finished listening to it all the way through, but holy cow it's good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl8x0?context=5)|As I met Jon and then as the two of us met more and more people, we added people that we felt a kinship and a chemistry with, rather than thinking about finding people that played specific instruments.
[How have you guys found your blend of rock/pop/folk? How much ""messing up"" or experimentation did you have to go through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl8x0?context=5)|We never thought we'd have violin, Jon's big instrument he imagined early on when writing melodies in his head was a trumpet. But. We never met a trumpet player we clicked with. And we met Charity who obviously kills it. So we just stayed open to what fate had for us. Worked out.
[Hey Josiah!! I really love your work and i am proud to say that ""THE HEAD AND THE HEART IS MY FAVORITE BAND"" you have so many fans in all of the world, i am brazilian and want to know when you come to here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlg6t?context=5)|We're trying to get on one of those Lollapalooza fests that gets down to Brazil. Cross your fingers that we get it!
[I've always thought that Honey Come Home was one of the sweetest/saddest songs I've ever heard. Was this written from the experience of someone who has gone through a divorce or a child who witnessed a divorce?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmhjx?context=5)|The characters in the song were a creation that allowed me to deal with heartbreak without needing to spell out my own. 
[What's your favorite type of fish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlesf?context=5)|Humu humu nuku nuku apua'a.
[Hey JJ new album is killer, im so proud of all your hard work to get there.  2 Q's - Who are you singing to in fire/fear &amp; The title track Lets Be Still's lyrics sound about the challenges you as a band touring for close to 3 years faced and needed some quiet time. is this a fair assumption? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlsxo?context=5)|That is a fair assumption, and there's some truth there, but I think Let's Be Still is definitely more widely applicable than just to our situation.
 |And Fire/Fear is an odd one, the feeling and weaknesses and problems in it are things I've dealt with hard, but it was easier to write about them by creating the people in the song and letting them deal with it than to write straightforwardly about my personal situations. So. It's to several different people really, or no one, or to myself. Probably to myself. I think the person who is the narrator of the song is probably saying those things to me.
[Does it ever get boring playing the same songs on back to back nights?  Even your favorite song you can only listen to so many times over the course of 3-4 months, so as someone who plays songs do you ever feel that?  Like on a certain night, man I just really don't feel like playing this tonight, or I just can't get into this song tonight?  Love the new album!  Thanks guys!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmxj5?context=5)|Yes :)
 |But you don't bail on it just because you don't feel like it. You know?
[Hey Josiah!  The new album is great!!  Any specific reason why there are less harmonies on this record than on your self titled release?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlc3k?context=5)|It's where the band is at. Some of the lyrics that don't have harmonies felt too personal to cover up with harmony.
[Looking forward to seeing you guys for the third time ever. How good is Thao and the Get Down live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlc8e?context=5)|Definitely get there early to see them. Fantastic. That's why we're touring with them for a second time. Quiet Life (the opener) is also fantastic live. We bring out bands that we love and believe people should hear. So please come early and enjoy them.
[How did you guys react to seeing Pearl Jam Tweet a shoutout to your new album? That must've been quite the honor!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm60h?context=5)|We retweeted it :) But yes. Pretty sweet!
[Been seeing you guys since Feb 2011 and it's awesome to watch you guys grow as a band, and individually.  Are you guys going to do another Chapel Session or Daytrotter Session?  I really enjoy both of those, as your harmonies are able to really stand out - especially the Chapel Sessions!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlfta?context=5)|Definitely another Chapel Session. Those are fantastic.
[Is there any chance we'll get to hear some of Josiah's other older songs come to life like Snowed in Seattle or Sounds so Sweet? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctloz2?context=5)|Nah, the time for those songs has passed. Time to write new songs. That's kinda how this works. I write songs about what I'm dealing with or living NOW and because it feels relevant to my life, I want to play them for people, I'm able to play them for people in a way that is believable. Those songs just... their time has passed.
[Hey Josiah!  First off I want to say I'm a HUGE fan and love everything you guys have created!  What song on your new album means the most to you, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctl90p?context=5)|Fire/Fear. See my reply to monkeyslicky. Heaviest most personal lyrics.
[Hey Josiah! I've been a fan for a while and saw you guys put on a great show in Richmond last Summer. I love the amount of acoustic live sessions your band performs. How do you think this kind of performance connects with the fans rather than releasing solely recorded songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlhkt?context=5)|It's good for my spirit and soul to do songs in a variety of ways. That's really what's good about doing those sessions. And I love seeing songs by bands I love performed in an alternate way, so I'm sure it works that way for fans of ours as well.
[What are some of your major influences?  Did you have any formal training/music school?  Any tips for an aspiring musician who struggles to write songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm1y0?context=5)|I wrote so many bad songs for so many years before I wrote my first truly decent one. Just write about anything and everything and keep doing it and poking at the truth in what you're writing about. Takes a lot of failures to get to your first success.
[You guys signed my egg shaker, but I've used it so much, all the ink wore off. Will you guys sign it again the next time you play in Boise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctln8t?context=5)|Yep :)
[I'm guessing you wrote Honey Come Home? What's the story behind it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlrrk?context=5)|The characters in the song were a creation that allowed me to deal with heartbreak without needing to spell out my own.
[Big fan from Denmark Josiah! I've even created the Danish wiki-page for you guys. It might be weak in information, but it's the effort that counts!  Will you ever go on tour in Scandinavia (or Europe\)?  Keep on making excellent music!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlym0?context=5)|YES! Thank you. Definitely coming to Scandinavia (and Europe) in February.
[Any chance of you guys of you guys doing a small clubs tour ever again? Poor saps like myself missed you on your stint with DMB, ya know, cause I'm poor. So maybe come back and play Velour in Provo sometime soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctm2cu?context=5)|Probably not a full tour, but we throw them in every once in awhile. Not sure if you saw, but we played at Urban Lounge with a last minute announce later that night after the SLC DMB show.
[But you guys don't live in the same physical spaces any more. How will this change things, do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmqn0?context=5)|A wider array of themes and influences. But the chemistry is so natural that coming back together still always feels like home.
[I saw you play live last summer at Warehouse live in Houston. You wore your Raybans inside for the first half of the set... Any interesting reason behind that? It was pretty dark in there...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctloc4?context=5)|No, I wanted to dress it up. At the time I didn't want to sing it acoustically because it is a heavy song and dressing it up let me hide behind upbeat music. Now that the situation I wrote that song about is more processed in my mind, I can play it the honest way.
[I love the stripped down acoustic versions of the tunes that you guys play live (Ever Since, Fire/Fear, Homecoming Heroes, Honey Come Home, etc\). At the root of it, you guys are an acoustic guitar driven band, is it difficult to decide how much accompaniment to include on the album?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctloc4?context=5)|It's normally pretty natural to arrange songs with this band, nothing is forced, but obviously it's pretty cool to strip the songs down, which we get to do at radio sessions/take away shows, etc...
[What is your take on these ""exclusive tracks/deluxe editions"" that hit stores like Target.  With your recent (fantastic\) release featuring one new song and live takes of others on the Target version of the album I find it hard to keep up with the ""definitive"" release. How does this impact sales, or your view of the ""album"" as a whole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlkcd?context=5)|Sales gimmicks. People trying to sell you things.
[Do you also write music upside down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlbqt?context=5)|I've tried, I get dizzy.
[How is your group dynamic, are you always in good terms or have their been ups and downs? PS. Have the records from both your albums!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctmhkv?context=5)|Ups and downs. It's like family. You love each other and you fight but no one is going anywhere, because we are bonded together, with or without the band.
[Will the band be playing in Virginia any time soon (Richmond or Hampton Roads?\) I would love to see y'all live. :-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlyuk?context=5)|Not sure when. But we will definitely be back.
[Hey Josiah, it's Kevin from Wisconsin. What's your favorite Stones record? I feel this says a lot about a man. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1on8y1/iama_the_head_and_the_heart_ama/cctlm27?context=5)|Satanic Majesties. Fuckin weird.

All of the requirements for the ads listed are made for someone that has been in the business for at least 20 something years. They shouldn't even list it as entry level, but the only advice I got was to apply anyway.

1om6sf,1,2013-10-16,Need advice after 3 months of being mislead and underpaid,Rosetta_Clupea,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1om6sf/need_advice_after_3_months_of_being_mislead_and/,"~3mo ago, I transferred locations (+7miles each way) because the department manager at another store wanted to train me as his assistant. I have been waiting for the official promotion, but needed to speak with our regional merchandiser(I believe this is her title) again and today found out that she is looking for someone with open availability instead.

*I spoke with her months ago and let her know that school limited my availability. Open availability is listed as a requirement, but her response made it sound like something doable and she continued to go over the requirements and such with me as though it were a possibility.

*I was told she needed to talk to me about it again to finish the process, but her vacation, opening a store, hiring a new manager, teaching that manager our new ordering system, and the managers conference all got in the way.

*She mentioned teaching me the new ordering system about two weeks ago. Managers and assistants do the ordering in our department.

*I have been doing the work of an assistant for about three months, listed on our schedule as assistant manager, while being paid the same as regular staff.

*For about 10 days and one long weekend, we had no manager. I ran the department.

*After using me for three months, they are just now looking for someone to officially fill the position.

When I told her that she had not been clear about my availability being a disqualifier, she said she was ""sorry that I misunderstood her"". The store has been using me in place of paying someone more to do the job and I feel I have been taken advantage of and mislead. Supposedly the person above her will not approve if my availability is not open, but I made it clear that it would not be open from the beginning.

This job is my internship for school, so I'm stuck until that's complete; furthermore, I don't believe I can list assistant manager on a resume because it was never official. If I take online only in Spring(bonus: w/ scholarship money from this company) I may be promoted, but might have to transfer or see if they will let me continue as I am for two months, performing the job without the pay.

Advice will be greatly appreciated."

How difficult will it be to get back into the field?,ThatAssholeMrWhite,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1om1qs/im_in_my_early_30s_with_an_unused_cs_degree_how/,"Quick background: I have a BS in CS from an Ivy with a respected CS department. I wasn't very smart about my career in college. I didn't do any internships and only took a few interviews my senior year. I wound up working for a small local company for a pathetic hourly wage. I was basically left to my own and I hated the projects I was working on.

I decided to quit and change careers. Fast-forward 8 years, my new career hasn't worked out as I expected. I'm considering getting back into the software field, preferably in a project manager or similar role rather than an engineer. A few questions:

1. Do I even have a chance at competitive entry level jobs targeted at new grads? (To be honest, it would not be worth it to me to get back into software unless I were making somewhere around $70k within a few years of starting. I love my current career; I just don't make enough money.)

2. I don't want to go to grad school. (I already have too much debt.) What should I do over the next year or so in order to make up for the lost time away from school? Is it worth it to review the theory I learned in school such as big-O analysis, data structures &amp; algorithms, linear algebra, etc.?

3. Would it help to develop personal projects? I have a few ideas for niche mobile/web apps related to my current career, but I don't know if it's worth taking the time and money to develop them.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I know that I need to find internships pretty soon, but I can't help but feel like I'm nowhere near prepared enough to be writing code that would impress employers.

I breezed through all of my CS classes through high school and my first two years.  I passed both AP CS tests with 5's, and have taken Intro C++, Advanced C++, and Data Structures so far in college and have gotten all A's.  I feel very confident with my scholastic programming abilities, but when I see code that other's have been asked to write during their interviews or internships I feel like it is at an entirely different level than I am at.

**Question**:  How will I know if I am qualified to start applying for internships?  What level of programming knowledge did you need to be successful at your internships?  Is it even possible to get actual CS-related internships while at a community college? If I'm not proficient enough, is there anything that I could do to better prepare myself?"
1oqpqw,1,2013-10-18,Thinking of switching to Outside Sales... Need some advice guys,PoRco1x,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oqpqw/thinking_of_switching_to_outside_sales_need_some/,"Hey guys,

I am currently doing my Masters in Computer Science. I graduated from BSc in Computer Science with Magna Cum Lauda (not that this matters jack squat, but you'll know why I mentioned it) I also did co-op terms in companies such as Adobe and IBM and some other smaller companies.

Now, after graduating... I had little to no problems finding a job. But instead of taking the job, I decided to accept a scholarship with funding for my Masters.

All my friends asked ""Why?, you don't seem the Masters type"". My reply was ""Oh, I love school..so why not?""

But the truth was not so much that I loved school, but more so that I hated my job. I hated the 9-5 schedule SO bad that it would make me depressed when it was enforced on me. I also hated the fact that I was confined to one desk the entire day. 

I love talking to people, I LOVE doing presentations. I love looking up techniques on how to improve presentation skills. And I'm always making conversation with new/random people. I hit on girls all the time, and get rejected 98% of the time. But you gotta swing to score, right? ;)

 My grades in school matter LITTLE since I don't take that knowledge above and beyond by researching new technologies for fun. I don't want my job to  be a job I'm doing just for the money. 

The way I see it is that for the next 30 or so years of my life, I'm going to be spending majority of my week at work + sleeping. Do I really want to spend it doing something I don't absolutely love?

Am I looking at this wrong guys? Am I just burnt out? (I doubt a few internships could do that) Am I cut out for sales? Or will I be throwing away my skill set as a Java/C#/Android developer/Flex developer?

Any advice whatsoever will be appreciated. And if you have any questions that you need to ask to get a better understanding of my situation, feel free to ask!

Thanks

First of all, I've been lurking and asking some questions here and there. This community really helped me out when I had to make a call or a certain decision. A big THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart!

So I received a summer internship offer from the company that I've been aiming for since the beginning of the year. It is one of the major investment banks in the world (if you make a guess, you'll probably get it right the first time). They flew me in last week and everything was great. The people are really chill and nice. I can't speak for the whole IT department, but the team I was the most interested in and the one I eventually got the offer from works with desktop applications as well as it does quite a bit of mobile development (Android, iOS). So you can't really say that this team uses outdated technologies. I was reading some reviews on glassdoor and a good percentage of people say that this is a great place to start your career for young college grads. I got this impression that people actually want to go somewhere else to work after? The pay is great and the things you might be working on are pretty interesting (imo). I mean, there's really only tech companies like Google, Facebook or Microsoft that might be better and maybe suitable for certain people in terms of company culture and pay. Maybe it's too much stress and people simply burn out after a year or two?

I guess I'm just not sure how much higher can you go from here (aside from starting your own business later on) and why anyone would want to leave. Can anyone enlighten me on this career-related subject?

* Born in Venezuela, currently that is my one and only citizenship.
* Moved and lived in the UK since I was 8 
* Lived in Ohio, USA for two years in my teens
* Moved back to the UK
* Currently in living Malaysia, leave to remain here for a year (social pass).  Living with my parents in the middle of Kuala Lumpur.

I want to go to Canada.  Seven years ago, I met my fiancée, who is a beautiful and wonderful Canadian citizen.  We plan on getting married, but since I need to a visa to even visit Canada, that has not happened.

---

* I am 24 years old, 25 this November.  I have a BSc 2:1 Honours degree from a good university in the UK in Biomedical Science.  I had to do a project on my own for the last year, and present a thesis, so I am not new to working in a lab.  However, I have never gotten paid for it, either... while I was studying, I was a waiter.  I've also worked as a PA in Venezuela, where my English came in handy, for a solicitor's office.

* I am open to doing a MSc here in Malaysia while I visit briefly to Canada under a visitor visa and getting married while I'm there.  I am not sure how (or if!) that would work out.  An MSc in Canada would also be great... however, I applied to Western, only to be told at the last minute that I need to take a GRE.  

* No available dates to take it until April, where I applied for May, so... I somehow don't think I'm getting into Western.  However, I am open to the idea of any other Canadian university.  Please bear in mind that I need estimates of rent and such, unless it's a university near London, ON (where I could live with my fiancée).

* I have zero criminal conviction, I don't so much a jay-walk.

* I speak fluent English, and am also fluent in Spanish.  I have moderate proficiency in French and Japanese.   I am also learning (on a self-study basis) IT programming - HTML, CSS, JS, and Python.  Not sure if that helps, but there you go.

* I feel kind of lost... my fiancée is in University, and we don't have a huge deal in the way of money.  Our respective parents are financially stable, but not super-rich either.  They would be open to support us, but I have no idea what to even ask for.   Fiancée is living with her parents.

* It's highly unlikely I'd be worth the hassle of a worker visa for any prospective employer...  I only have a BSc (hons).

* Finally, I am seriously fretting about my chances of my fiancée getting sponsorship approval, she is still in Uni and only has an internship at a prestigious private school (doesn't get paid) and a part-time job at some high-end retail place.

How do I (permanently) get to Canada?"
1oq8yp,0,2013-10-18,A program idea I would love comments on,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oq8yp/a_program_idea_i_would_love_comments_on/,"Hello LearnProgramming, this is my first post here.
Just to give a short introduction: I'm 22 years and I study Computer Science in Denmark currently on third semester. I've learned Java and SQL.

My program idea is sort of an upgraded version of the calender as we now know it and use it.

So about calenders and the need for them:

Calenders are smart, many people have a calender which they use daily; other people don't use a calender at all, some of these people might not because it seems like more trouble than it's worth to manage one.

Some people use an old-fashioned physical version, some people have a calender app on their smartphone, and others use a calender program on their pc. Calenders are here to stay, they're not going anywhere, dates and times are becoming more and more of an issue in most peoples life, especially the part of managing it is a struggle for many.

About my idea and how it occurred:

So, I'm one of those who don't use a calender, simply because I can't be bothered with typing in the event and time in my calender app on my smartphone, I'm too lazy to do that I'll admit.

But yesterday, as I was browsing a forum, I entered a thread about the upcomming movies in 2014, with people showing links to imdb, trailers and such. I quickly realise there's actually quite a lot movies in 2014 I want to see.
Now the problem is, there's not release date for most of them, and the thread I'm looking in will be gone from the first pages of the forum in a few days, and I'll eventually forget about most of these movies, although I'd like to see them.
It would be great, if I could somehow subscribe to something, and be updated automatically as each release date is announced. But how would this work?
This is where my idea starts; now, if I had a personal online calender(either phone app or pc program), which I could use as a standard calender, typing events in for dates manually, but with the extra feature of being able to 'subscribe' to services of my own wish; then I'd suddenly have lots of purpose of managing my own calender.

The way I imagine the subscribing part, is that the services I'm subscribing, will be able to add new events/reminders in my calender.
Etc. if IMDB had a movie announcement service, people with this calender app could subscribe to it, and when a release date for a movie is official, the people managing the IMDB movie announcement service updates all subscribers calender with an release date event added to the date of the release. Maybe getting an event added for each new movie worldwide would be annoying, so obviously there could be added a filter where you choose only to have your calender updated with the release dates of movies you choosed, or limited to one or more genres, actors, producers etc.
This way you get updated automatically, and don't have to sit and do all the work of checking up on when there's a release date announced.

But there's tons of other options:
Starting a new education, or just a new semester on your current education? Well simply subscribe to the schools scheme for your class, and you'll get your calender updated with dates and times for every class lesson. Teacher is ill and have to cancel todays lessons? The teacher simply uses his/hers mod-login for the schools calender service, and updates every students calender for the classes for which it's relevant.

Want to watch Tour De France, but only the mountain stages, which you're not sure on what days is happening? Simply subscribe to a Tour De France service and choose to the filter option they've made(we're playing with the idea that this app is real and popular), to pick the types of stages you prefer, and get your calender automatically updated with the exact dates for each mountain stage, time it starts, and maybe even link to the stage profile.

Invited to a birthday party? Check your calender, and simply add the date of the birthday as an event like you would in any other calender.

Annoyed that you've subscribed so many services that you're calender feels spammed by added events, and you have trouble finding the birthday event you added, to check up on time, just to be sure? Well choose the filter option for your calender, and choose 'family and friends', or 'parties'. Or you want a good overview on all stages in the Tour De France you're planning to watch, choose the filter that limits shown events to only those from the specific service you choose, in this case the Tour De France service.

I could mention more options of use, but I think the idea and potential is clear now.

If I'm going to pursue the idea of this project, I'm well aware that it'll require a good amount of time and coorporation with others. Currently, I simply want to share my idea and get some input and thoughts on it from other people. That is what this thread is made for.
On my fifth semester, there's no class lessons, because it's meant to be where you find an internship with a company you can work for and learn from by putting your theory into practice. But there's also the option of working on your own project, if it meets the required criterias and gets accepted by the school. I'm thinking a project this size, could very well be accepted, and it would open up for the possibility of that I can get fellow students from my class to join me on the idea.
This program is a gamble in therms of making it worth the time used on developing it, but if I where to work on it as a school project, it wouldn't feel that way, since worse case scenario, should be that I'll get through my education, just like if I had chosen an internship for the fifth semester.

Obviously there's still a lot of things to consider, like choice of programming language, ambition and expectations, feasibility as a fifth semester project, features and functions in the program, and so on.

Also, I'm aware there's probably tons of similar functioning services to this, but I have yet to see a calender where you can subscribe and combine everything in a smart way like I'm thinking for this program idea. But you're of course welcome to mention programs I could find inspiration from, and from which I could get answers to some of the things I'm considering.

Even if you got nothing to comment on this, thanks for reading through.
But of course I hope to get some responses :)

1oq8r1,1,2013-10-18,Quit or continue working?,carolinafever,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oq8r1/quit_or_continue_working/,"I graduated in 2012 from a top 25 school and have been working as a business analyst in large corporation for over a year now. I have internship experience with IBM Application Server support as well.

I enjoy coding and believe that I am above average in my coding skill at least with respect to my fellow classmates who graduated with me. I want to get back into programming, however, it has become difficult to search for jobs while continuing to work. 

I am certain that I do not want to follow the career path as a business analyst,therefore, would it better if I quit by job to work on improving my interview skills and expand job search? I am financially able to support myself for 4-6 months. 

Given the job market, how long of a wait should I expect? Will I miss out of fall recruitment (which, I believe is significantly better than spring), if I do not try my best in my job hunt? Does it impair my resume if I work on independent projects and have no work for 4-6 months? "

I started out undecided and then a week or two into classes I found that it seemed like everyone else had already decided a major. **TL;DR will be at the bottom.**



1. I figured ""what the hell, I'll just go do History. I enjoy history and I can become a teacher with a degree in it."" After a few weeks(didn't waste any money on classes yet) I realized that although I enjoyed history classes, the only thing I can really do with a degree in history is teach. I thought teaching wouldn't be so bad when I first decided on History, then after thinking about it I thought I'd be a horrible teacher. I'm not very confident in myself, I had speaking to groups on people, and I wouldn't be stern enough to try to get kids to pass. I have the mentality of (well, if you don't want to do it suit yourself you can fail and take the class again). I had also heard many stories where people said they really regret becoming teachers because 

2. Then I went to the Agricultural building and signed up for Plant/Soil sciences. I had heard from a neighbor it was interesting and they make decent money. But after thinking over it I decided it wasn't the best for me. I'm not a science kind of guy, and I'd have to take Chemistry (not a big deal. I mean I hate chemistry but I'll do it if I absolutely have to.) Plus I'd have to travel to the university's farm which is on the other side of the city, but I have no ride over there and being the shy guy I am and not really wanting to ask for help from other people, I decided the mix between me hating Chemistry, me having to travel there every day, and me not being a science guy, Plant/Soil sciences wouldn't work out.

3. Then, and currently, I came into Sport Management. In my philosophy class last semester my professor told us we should major in whatever interests us because (she said some statistical number) of college graduates end up working in a job that doesn't require the degree they earned (and I think it's some bs, but whatever I followed it because I didn't know what else to do). So I decided to go into Sport Management. I've only taken three classes is it so far and it's interesting I guess. I mean, I thought there'd be a more statistical side to it and more real life, current day examples of the things we talk about in class. But apparently it's a very competitive field (one of the most competitive) because so many people go into it because they love sports and it's the thing for them. I'm not sure it's the thing for me though because there is a business side to it where I have to take 7 elective classes in marketing/business. I'm taking one marketing class and it's the first class I have had a 100% in by midterm. It's the first upperlevel class I've taken too, and it's easy but soooo boring I hate it. Marketing I know isn't for me. Back to the SPMT part of it, it requires a lot of experience which I have minimal and it's hard for me to get any considering I can't drive yet. Representatives from the Red came and spoke one day and said that for an intern position they had available, they allowed applications for about two weeks and ended up with over 3k applicants. I'm starting to think it'd be a waste for me to do because I really doubt I will be able to stand out in 3k people for one position that doesn't even get paid. 


******TL;DR***
I've come to the conclusion that I think I'm wasting money. I mean, college is a waste of money in general right? But I want more wisdom, so I'm doing it. I want to waste my money on a degree that will help me land a job or help me in a job. 

- I want to do something that makes decent money. I'd like to pay my parents back for all they have done for me.
- I want to help people. Growing up I've heard that if you aren't helping others, you're wasting your time.
- I want something with a traditional 9-5. In SMPT the hours a terrible (working like 14~16 hours a day and on weekends, and missing out on majority of the holidays no matter your experience/time with an organization. This is another reason I'm doubting SPMT. 
- My interests are Running. I like to play video games. I like animals. I like to eat. I like teeth (most beautiful part of a girl if she has nice teeth, imo) so I thought Dental Hygiene would be a good field for me to go int, but my 
school doesn't offer that program. 



Do you all have any suggestions of what maybe I could to? Or any idea on how I can find out what would be a good career for me? I'm starting to feel ""depressed"" (don't know if depressed is the right word for it, maybe sick with anxiety?)
Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks."

Please help if you can.

Currently I am 23 years old and 6 (8 if you count the 2 I'm taking now) classes away from my Computer Science degree. This hasn't been an easy journey for me, I had to leave my first university at 17, ended up with an anxiety disorder and panic attacks that made me fail a few classes (Calc II several times actually) and put me behind in where I'm at and as it stands I'm about $80,000 in student loans with no degree to show for it. Last year I had to drop out of school due to lack of financial aid, but was lucky to find a job that paid $20 an hour doing programming in a bastardized SQL language called Visual FoxPro. This semester, I was able to afford to go back to school part time and pick up 2 more classes to put me closer to my degree, but now I just got laid off and now I'm not really sure what to do.

My resume basically has 3 years of running a mobile DJ business, a year and 2 months working at my last company writing/running SQL queries in FoxPro to process data and a few retail/fast food jobs. I know this probably isn't going to get me a good CS job, especially without my degree, but I've been applying anyway lately and I haven't had much luck. 

So right now I sit, really wanting a software development job, but not knowing if I really am where I should be for that. I'm only missing basically an ethics course and some elective CS courses (Compilers, Game Programming, Networking, other such courses), but I don't think I can afford to take them, and to make matters worse, my school only seems to offer them during the day.

My options seem to be the following (let me know if you can come up with something else):
1. Job hunt everywhere and anywhere until I get hired and drop out
2. Mooch off unemployment and my tax refund and try to take 2 classes in the spring then finish up on financial aid in the fall (this will be REALLY tight on my money)
3. Find a job that pays the $2k a month min I need to pay my bills in any field I can and basically abandon CS

I really don't know what to do right now. I see a lot of people on this site getting great jobs, but I've had the worst time trying to finish my degree or even find internships. Yeah, now I have a year of ""in the field"" experience, though it's with a outdated language, will anyone even consider that? I don't need a $60-80k job now, just a $40-45k job would cut it, but I also don't want my career to be dead end, I really felt like my last job was. And I should add, I'm willing to relocate for a job, especially to Seattle because that's where I've always wanted to live, I just need someone to give me the job offer and I'd be happy."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[You mentioned you've finally gotten comfortable being naked in front of strangers. what motivated you to start nude modeling in the first place as a self-described awkward, shy person? have you noticed any difference in your everyday life (as in, less modesty with your partner\)? also, how much does it pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuavrg?context=5)|$15 an hour, I sit for 2h45m each class period, in a variety of different poses.
 |I had always been interested in figure drawing modeling (an old roommate of mine did so for her mother &amp; a few other artists), and I'm a student in the art history department, so it's important for me to associate with professors &amp; be more involved. I found it to be actually really no big deal at all &amp; has improved my confidence (I'm pretty but I have some body issues, and seeing the drawings is both interesting &amp; a confidence booster sometimes!)
 |As far as improving life with my husband, it's the same. The only thing that's changed is he wants to buy a painting/sketch of me :]
[Ha, yeah, you should plaster your walls with nude pictures of yourself and act like it's no big deal when people come over. the most elaborate, expensive joke that would get old pretty fast...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccub2tj?context=5)|Yeah, the students are usually cool with me walking over behind their easels after a long pose. The ones I saw yesterday, of me in a reclining pose, were really quite pretty!
[I hadn't even thought about how you'd get to see the drawings afterward, but i could see how that could go both ways depending on the style of art. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccub2tj?context=5)|Also I super want a sketch of myself for sure. The new class I'm going to be modeling for OMG the professor is the most incredible painter. I wish i was just posing for his work instead, but alas.
[Since you're a student too, does it ever make it awkward that your professors have presumably seen you naked?  I could understand coming in off the street to serve as a model, but hanging out naked with your professors adds another dimension to it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccucqy6?context=5)|Nope. I see the professor I mainly model for all the time (I'm an AH major, I'm always in the building). He is funny and nice and not creepy at all. :&gt;
[It's nice when the model takes interest in the artwork done by the students. The people that would model for my class I don't think ever peeked at our artwork once. :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccud8am?context=5)|Aw :&lt; I really enjoy seeing it, it's so neat.
[Any oddball stories from classes? Many boners/ladyboners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuan07?context=5)|Surprisingly, no. The classes have a few ""older"" students, but mostly everyone is close to my age, but it remains a professional environment. It's not silent, we chitchat and make jokes (never about my body, of course, they're there to learn). No ladyboners here, (I'm married!)
[What do mentally while you pose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuan07?context=5)|To pass the time, I listen to music, if they have some that's playing, or think through songs in my head. Sometimes you have to keep a difficult pose for literally upwards of 30+ minutes(just yesterday, I was putting all of my weight on one leg, the other foot on my toes, with my right arm against the wall. It sounds simple but oh my god my legs are sore today). Sometimes I'm laying down and nearly fall asleep. Otherwise, breathe, concentrate, and don't lock your knees!
[As an art student I can say this (as awful as it sounds\); the model becomes just an object. Even nude, I had never felt any limerence or sexual desire for them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubkc2?context=5)|No no, you're totally right. Honestly, I forget that I'm not wearing clothes. It's a job. I have to think about how to pose myself, where my light is, as well as just concentration and dealing with any pain &amp; passing of time. Most of the time you guys are too busy trying to get the grade than pick up the model, anyway. It's nice if you talk to us though (if you can!)
[I being a nude model a full-time job? Do you work any other jobs? HOw do you feel completely comfortable with artists staring at your naked body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccualon?context=5)|Nope. For one class, I work every other Tuesday and Thursday (Tuesday one week, Thursday the next week, back to  Tuesday, etc), and the other class I work every Tuesday and Thursday, as well as if any other models call out sick.
 |I do! I work from home, and am also in the process of writing a book. I don't do art modeling for the money (although it pays relatively well).
 |FINALLY yes. I am probably the most awkward person you will ever meet, and very shy, so preparing myself before the first time was a real trip. I think it was more a matter of ""Taking my robe off the first time will be the hardest part, but then I can deal with the rest."" You honestly forget you're nude, and the classes are very friendly. They're close to my age (we're all college students), so we just chitchat. It's very professional.
[Probably not quite comparable, but derobing the first time sounds a lot like skydiving. Just hop out the plane and hope for the best.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccucxgz?context=5)|My dad loves to skydive, so yes, I would compare the feeling.
[I've been considering signing up for this job actually.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuatx5?context=5)|FUN STORY. NO BUT YES.
[Have you ever had to pose for people you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuatx5?context=5)|The FIRST TIME. as in the FIRST  time i ever modeled (i was SO nervous), turns up the ex-girlfriend of my roommate was writing a paper over figure drawing classes. she got to see all the goodie bits. really, it was no big deal, she's such a sweet person and we ended up talking &amp; she interviewed me a bit, but at the time, it was absolutely hysterical once we realized who each other was. other than that, i don't really have any friends on campus, so no. the classmates and i do talk a lot during class, though!
[Any other awkward moments you've experienced a potential model should be aware of? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuatx5?context=5)|I think a lot of people (especially women) worry about body hair. i shave my armpits (although i forgot to yesterday, and i modeled, oops), but i don't go bald downstairs. in fact, i've heard a lot of artists say they actually prefer it that way, for whatever reason. it's just hair and it shouldn't freak you or anybody else out, you're there so people can learn how to draw real people, and you are a real person.
[I imagine it's much easier to depict a triangle than to accurately depict nether lips. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuc285?context=5)|Hahahaha. yeah.
[*other than that, i don't really have any friends on campus.*  Right in the feels, op.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuc5g8?context=5)|It's sad. I'm 24 and although I'm not an ""older student,"" I'm still an older student. :/ All of my friends that I made last semester just graduated and none of them are here anymore.
[To the extent drawing nude models is about learning the human anatomy, body hair **is** part of that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccucvse?context=5)|Very right!
[But why male models?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubu68?context=5)|But why what what? What about male models?
[Did you ever think that there's more to life then being really really really ridiculously good looking?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuclrm?context=5)|Oh now I get it. I've only seen half of Zoolander :&lt;
[Are you serious? I just...I just told you that a moment ago. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuchi4?context=5)|No I'm really confused what are we talking about.
[How does it feel seeing people's depictions of you naked? I've done nude modeling too and I was very flattered by the results.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccucepo?context=5)|It is AWESOME.
[Just wait till you learn about the multistream. Ever wonder why sometimes after a guy pees there is random pee spots everywhere? Multistream, and he didn't manage to clean it all up.  These penis things are a liability.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuckkx?context=5)|I live with lots (and lots) of male roommates, and I have found pee five feet up on the wall before. HOW?!
[Do you live with fire fighters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccud54o?context=5)|No i wish hubba hubba am i right.
[On cold days do you hear the endless tapping of pencil as everyone sets about drawing the goose bumps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubxjf?context=5)|Hahaha, not yet. The classroom stays pretty neutral (and it can get warm under the spotlights).
[If not are there any other drawing sweeps or noises that make you wonder what the heck's being drawn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubxjf?context=5)|Also no, I have the thing where certain noises gives me the tingly feelings so it is wonnnderful to listen to.
[How do you manage to stay still. Wouldn't there be times that you need to itch or you're in an uncomfortable position? Also do you take anything before a session as well as shower etc or do you go right in there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubgex?context=5)|Concentration, concentration, concentration. And breathing.
 |I almost always have a bottle of water with me. I don't shower before, the classes that I work in literally come right after two other classes, so I don't have time to run home. I'm not stinky, it's nbd.
 |I can briefly move if I need to, I just need to know exactly how my body is placed before I move, and I only move what i need to. If I need to take a break, I just let people know and then we take a break. I'm naked, so I'm the boss.
[*I'm naked so I'm the boss.*  Have you seen conversations with my two year old? I think episode two has this exact line.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccucy66?context=5)|YES that's where I got it from. Love it!
[I tried the ""I'm naked so I'm the boss"" thing at my job... The manager of the grocery store I work at was not amused.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccud0vs?context=5)|I almost choked on my chocolate milk.
[Sorry if this is a weird question, but I took a figure model drawing class one semester and always wondered - how do you handle a day when you're on your period?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubu4g?context=5)|I would call in, probably. Good news is, I don't get one! Huzzah!
[You don't get a period? What is your secret (that I may share it with my wife\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccucn51?context=5)|Hormone imbalances. Probably means I'm infertile, and I would really like to have kids (although I'm adopted and will be adopting most if not all of my children). Trust me, you don't want this. I sometimes get cripplingly depressed over it.
[My friend's wife has the same thing and they have 6 kids. Look into it, and see what your options are.

And what's the worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubdg6?context=5)|Best thing about this job is seeing whatever the artists have created. You can look at yourself in a mirror and obviously know the general shape of yourself and how you look, but it's so different on a piece of paper. Sometimes I think, ""OMG my boobs are so saggy ;-;"" and then other times it's like, ""Wow, I didn't know my hips were that big &amp; shapely."" It's just neat to see how other people view your body (both objectively, as they're learning classical technique, but also subjectively, because they all have their own style and little touches).
[Also, besides your husband, do your friends/family know about your job? If so, how do they feel about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubdg6?context=5)|My friends all know, my family knows (but they think I model clothed. For some reason it would be outrageous to them if I was *naked* in front of *people*). My parents think it's...interesting, but hey, i'm covered in tattoos and piercings so I guess they're really not all that surprised. In fact, I'm not sure if they actually believe me or not. Friends think it's great.
[Covered in tattoos... ever though about posing for Suicide Girls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccue4uq?context=5)|Yes and no.
[Ever fart while posing? What's the most embarassing thing to have happened to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubc12?context=5)|HAHAHAHAHAHA no.
 |Most embarassing thing was showing up the first time to model and realizing my roommates ex-girlfriend was there to write an article on the class. Neither of us had any idea the other was going to be there. Turned into a great interview and some good laughs, she's a very nice person.
[Did you ever get ""excited"" being nude in front of all the students, that it was visible? How did you handle  it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuauta?context=5)|I am a girl, so no. well i guess you could see if my nipples were...loud and proud. but no, the temperature stays even and it's not an arousal thing for me, really.
[For some reason, I thought you were a man ... : ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubxtk?context=5)|Nope!

[Does it bother you that art history is used as the primary example of the degree **not** to get if you want a useful degree?  What do you plan on using your degree for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuct39?context=5)|For me, it's less competition. I go to a REALLY top university in the south (say what you may about our football, but we're not called the Harvard of the South for nothing, and I'm not necessarily talking about academics, just the prestige that comes with the name Ole Miss), and I am in a REALLY small department, and I'm excelling well. I have done one awesome internship last semester, the first semester I ever went to this school (as a transfer student, no less), and am working with a professor this summer, as well as nabbing this art modeling gig. I've got it MADE.

I think it's bullshit, but there are bigger reasons (that Reddit doesn't really like to hear) why I think STEM is pushed pushed pushed and people just like to shit all over anything lib-arts. I actually am getting more opportunities as an art history major than I did as a bio major back in the day. There's just such a flux of STEM and, yes, there are jobs in STEM fields, but the math just doesn't compute when there's a glut of students racing for those jobs.

I'm sure your body type has something to do with it as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccubaau?context=5)|I saw a sign on the bulletin board in the art department, called, started modeling the next day with no prior experience. I do not believe you have to be a student, but it's probably encouraged (we're obviously pretty poor). As far as I know, no certain age (other than legal, for obvious reasons). As far as I know, my body type has nothing to do with it. I have heard that sculptors prefer thicker models, but as for drawing, all body types are encouraged afaik. I am not skinny, but slender &amp; curvy, and have seen a few older models, as well a verry thin dancer-type girl, as well as a thicker model. :&gt;

Most students are around my age, 18-24. I don't feel offended by any drawings. They're all from different angles so even a more ""unflattering"" pose is still true to life. Most of them are incredible artists.

Yesterday I was in two longer poses, one reclined, one standing, both of which were very painful. The first pose was the worst, though. my legs were half-stretched out and I was kind of rolled forward onto my right hip, while my upper body was slightly propped up with pillows, kind of like if you were on the floor and resting your head on a low stool. The pilows were comfy but my shoulder blades were pushed further out instead of closer together (or something?) so that hurt, and any time my right leg even twitched, it hurt so bad. Laid there for a good 40 minutes.

There are a lot more opportunities here than you would think (and there's so much room for growth, because I honestly think we have no more than ten AH undergrads here, and no AH grad students). My focus is in minority art, particularly art of women and art BY women. My super super focus is on Mabel Dodge Lujan &amp; the Taos art colony she founded in the 20s.

I sincerely forget I'm naked, because I either zone out or I'm concentrating too much on how to position myself, or working through the pain of a difficult pose. I tend to keep my legs more closed, just because I don't want the pose to seem vulgar, although if a student or the class wanted a more ""exposed"" pose, I would be comfortable with that. It comes down to what shape the students want to learn how to draw.

[Hello! I actually used to schedule models to come in for my college's art club so that we could do public figure drawing sessions. I always had an easier time getting women to model, men were always a bit cagey about it. Could never figure out why, but guys seemed really self conscious about doing that kind of work. Any thoughts on that? Have you ever noticed a disparity between male and female models? Any ideas why that discomfort would fall along gender lines like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccud4ee?context=5)|I've never met any male models in our department yet (although we have some).

I wanted to do it for general interest in art modeling, as well as wanting to be more involved in my department, as well as a confidence booster. It's quite liberating!
[Have you thought about branching out into other aspects of modeling, such as photography? Why/why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1opoaj/iama_nude_model_for_art_classes_at_a_large/ccuclw1?context=5)|I don't feel I'm conventionally attractive and no photographers I know have expressed an interest in photographing me.

I have written in a lot of languages (including PHP, C and Java) and have experience with MySQL but I am far from a master of any because of that, and furthermore I have only taken a couple courses of programming (Java) in high school and college; though I have been programming for ten years. Most of the code I currently write is not really presentable in a comp sci job either because only a small part is mine (ie, I have modified some supercomputer codes that I run to better suit our needs) or because I very quickly put it together and it looks like junk. Some is good code but it is not often object oriented as much of programming in the scientific world is not. I am also not very familiar with things like factory patterns or not at all with things like MVC architecture. I do have a few ""projects"", especially one large complicated project, I have worked on but they have always been for myself and compared to modern PHP they are quite outdated (quarter of the code was written before PHP 5 was even very well adopted, with most of the latest code being early 2011 as I have been to busy to put in a lot of time). I have done basic LAMP system administration for about ten years as well (2 production servers most of that time). I have, from almost scratch, written projects for 2 friends in their 400 level CS classes, but they have had internships and classes where they learned things I do not know (e.g. data structures other than multidimensional arrays, which is basically as far as I know). I am absolutely horrible at web design. Can anyone give me any ideas on how to go about finding a job outside of standard online sites and what kind of places I have a chance in (I live in a large city in the mid-Atlantic East Coast)?

1ooyjx,8,2013-10-17,"[USA, TX]: Non-Compete form for a therapist. Can my friend be sued?",dpd102,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ooyjx/usa_tx_noncompete_form_for_a_therapist_can_my/,"This is for a friend of mine who was recently involved with a counseling group in Texas. She is an LPC in training which means she needs 3000 hours of work under the guidance of a supervisor before she can get licensed and have a practice of her own. The facts are as follows: 

* She first made contact and agreed to work for the group in question 11 months ago

* 7 months ago she was presented with a home-made non-compete agreement and told she had to sign it or leave the organization. She signed it. 

* The agreement states that if she leaves within 12 months of beginning her employment with that organization that she cannot see ANY of her clients for a further 12 months beyond the date of leaving

* The fee she paid to be a part of this group varied from month to month but averaged about $600 per month. This is high. For this she was supposed to be supplied with a constant stream of referrals. In 9 months she received 6 referrals and only one of them turned into a full time client. This is a very low amount. During this time she did receive clients of her own through her own advertising and from referrals from her existing clients. She had brought in about 8 clients from her previous arrangement (a non profit, the relationship ended amicably). 

* When her supervisor first found out she was leaving he reminded her that she had not fulfilled the non-compete and informed her. He stated that she should stay until the end of this year (Which would have been approximately the 11.5 month mark) and if she did that then he would consider the terms fulfilled. She responded by offering to stay one additional month (The 10 month mark), but that was going to be her only offer. He responded by saying he would let the courts handle it. 

* Today she received an email from him stating that she would have to either pay him $2000 or else he would be seeking $9000 of damages in a lawsuit. 

So the crux of this question revolves around whether or not the non-compete she signed is enforceable, and if not then *how* unenforceable is it? It contains the following phrase: 

Note: To be clear - at no point does the organization offer anything at ALL in exchange for the agreement. It is simply a one-sided demand. 

* When leaving Organization…

* If a therapist at Organization for a minimum of one year, I agree to not transfer or see any Organization clients at another location that I have seen for less than 20 sessions and less than 6 months at Organization.

* If a therapist at Organization for less than one year, or for Organization clients not meeting those criteria, I agree to not see any Organization client for a minimum of 1 year after leaving Organization.

My contention is that this is entirely unenforceable for several reasons: 

1) There is no definition of what an ""Organization Client"" is or how it is determined. Most of her clients came with from prior to her coming to this organization, and all but one of her clients were direct referrals from existing clients or from her own advertising work. 

2) There are two rules fundamental requirements of a non-compete in Texas: That it be both a) Reasonable and b) Part of an Otherwise Enforceable agreement. I believe that this satisfies neither because a) It's not possibly reasonable to keep a therapy client from seeing their therapist for ANY reason - let alone because of a legal contract, and b) There is no actual agreement here. The organization is not promising anything in this agreement, and neither is the person threatening the lawsuit. They are just making a demand and saying ""Sign it or you're fired"". Basically there is no way for the ORGANIZATION to hold up its end of the bargain because it doesn't have an end of this bargain. Therefor this is not a part of an enforceable agreement. Additionally this was most definitely signed MONTHS after the beginning of employment at the organization. 


I have advised her as a friend that she should immediately cut contact with this guy on ALL channels and seek the advice of an attorney. However, given that I am not an attorney I cannot give any legitimate legal advice here. 

My question is: What are the odds that this guy has the necessary standing to WIN a lawsuit and claim his stated $9,000 in small claims court? (Note: In texas the small claims limit is $10,000)

One extra note: She left this guy's organization because he's extremely shady and is a massive asshole. He was supposed to be helping her as a supervisor and he most certainly was not helpful in any way. She was desperate to get away from this guy but she's incredibly poor/struggling so her options were always limited. She has no money so I'm not even sure what he stands to gain by filing suit. 

**Extra Info: Just to alleviate some of the confusion around how this arrangement works... Interns work for these supervisory organizations. They pay the organization and the organization in turn provides supervision and offices for the intern to use. One of the unfortunate parts of being an intern is that you are NOT allowed to have clients pay you directly. Instead they have to pay your supervisor and he then pays you in turn. Typically organizations charge a flat fee of $200-$300 per month for this service. However in this case the organization was charging a flat fee plus a portion of overall earnings.**

IT career path vs engineering.,jerseyLifted,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ooubt/upcoming_interview_it_career_path_vs_engineering/,"So I have an on campus interview coming up with a huge pharma/medical supply company for an internship position in their IT Sector with work possibly in network systems, IT, or e-business. 

However, I am an Electrical/Computer engineering major, concentrating on Telecom, who has previous work/internship experience in IT and Networking (Which is probably why I received an interview).

Currently this is the only interview I have scheduled, but I am hoping for positive feedback from telecom companies in my area such as Verizon, and AT&amp;T. I spoke to them at the career fair and I think I left a good impression since I got their contact info and emailed them. I'm just waiting for the email they hopefully send me. 

I understand it is still to early, but what if I receive an offer from the pharma company before I potentially land an interview with a big Telecom firm. I am ok with an internship in the IT sector, but I'm studying engineering and want to work in the Telecom industry after I graduate. 



Any feedback is appreciated guys. Thanks for the help!"

I knew what industries I had some interest in. Every job I applied to I qualified for based on the job description. 
I have held on campus leadership positions as well as 3 internships including the one I just completed the summer after my graduation. These were probably the biggest help in getting my foot in the interview door. Even if a previous internship wasn't directly relevant to a position, I had transferrable skills that I highlighted in my cover letter.  

I found job listings via Indeed, going to company's websites and looking at their jobs section, and on NYFA's job board. Out of 100 applications I had 2 employee referrals at major tech companies. Neither panned out. For every other job I applied directly to the listing. My cover letters were always written from the heart, explaining why I want this position and what background I can offer to contribute to the team. Hiring managers don't like robots, unless maybe you're applying for an old-fashioned corporate company. I applied to a lot of big companies who for sure use some sort of resume parsing system and I'm sure I didn't make the cut in many cases there because I was filtered out for not having certain keywords. Whatever, I don't want to have to deal with bots looking for matches so I stopped applying for companies like that. The companies I did hear back from are small to medium sized with a casual, friendly vibe. 



* Started looking for jobs 8/22/13; didn't start seriously applying till the first week of September
* Jobs applied to: 100 (16/100 internships, 84/100 salaried positions; 5/100 resume only, 95/100 with cover letter)
* Shortest response time for interview after submitting application: within a few hours from a tech startup, media agency, pr agency
* Longest response time for interview after submitting application: 17 days/12 business days from a tech company
* Average response time for interview after submitting application: 1 week
* Number of requests for first interview (some first interviews were on the phone, some in person at an office): 18/100 (4 for internships, 14 for salaried positions).
* Number of rejections after interviews (whether 1st or 2nd round): 4 (1 went to internal candidate, 1 went to more qualified candidate, 1 didn’t like me, 1 thought I didn’t have enough experience). 
* Number of companies I withdrew from after interview: 3 (would not be happy at these places)
* Number of companies interviewed and waiting for response: 4
* Number of companies with first interviews scheduled: 7
* Most enlightening moment: I got a reply from the CEO of a small startup. He said I should have passed highly in his resume review but I didn't because my cover letter was too generic. He told me (rather harshly, but I thank him for this) that I need to figure out how I as a recent graduate can add value to a company. Why would a company invest time and money in you? Show them that it will be worth it. Come up with a pitch about how you can contribute to a company. This changed how I approached cover letters and got me more interviews. 


Most common interview questions I encountered:

Why this company?

Tell me about yourself and why you applied. 

Tell me what you did in X position.

Do you have experience doing [insert specific responsibility from job description here]?



My advice:
Try not to get discouraged no matter how long your job search is. I would get really depressed days at time after a string of rejection emails and it really sucked. Just know that if you are determined and keep at the job search, you will see progress. For example, I got SO much better at job searching (finding opportunities, cover letters, interviewing) with practice over the past two months. I have more interviews now than I did one month ago near the start of my search. If you need to pay the bills, consider getting a part time job at a grocery store or other job like that to bring in some sort of income. I lived off my savings, which probably boosted my motivation to keep on applying, knowing that I had to find a job before my money ran out. 

Write an awesome cover letter. Put yourself in the hiring manager's shoes.. will they think, ""that person sounds awesome, they have the skills and they have a great personality"" or ""meh forgot about this person among the 50 other applications I received"".

An interview tip that's really worked for me. Before an interview, stretch really big, move your muscles, roll your neck, make your body really big. I saw a TED talk about body language and how powerful it is to stand in a ""victory stance"" before a job interview. It brings up your confidence, opens you up, makes you feel better.  It has worked for me.  Listen to a fun song before the interview. “Without me” by eminem always gets me feeling relaxed and happy.

Good luck to my fellow job-seekers. I'm still in talks with a few companies, all of which I really like. So hopefully I'll be employed in the next few weeks. "

[Thankyou for answering this, but can I be rude and just ask another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuihg6?context=5)|Sloane got a job as a receptionist at Henson's and made herself as invaluable as possible - willing to help anyone and everyone out, smiling a lot and being easy going.  When Henson's were planning Muppet Treasure Island she asked to be an assistant in the art department (ended up in the model shop though).  Then she made as many contacts as she could.
[What is your opinion on the state of film schools within the UK? I'm currently attending one but I get the sense that it's too late and I've wasted my money. How did the both of you start out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuihg6?context=5)|I (Ant) did trainee (unpaid) work in an art department and got my foot in the door that way.  It really is about meeting people - which is hard, but you just need to reach out and understand that is is an ongoing process!
[Great advice for people thinking about joining a film school! Thankyou once again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuihg6?context=5)|UK film school is tricky - Rhetorical questions: Does the school have a track record off graduates getting into the industry?  Are you learning? Are you enjoying the experience?  Are you spending every spare moment making shorts with other students (you should be!).  In your holidays are you trying to get runner/assistant/trainee positions for experience? 
[Thanks once again. I have a lot of things to think about... Even though the school itself is highly rated, I just don't feel like they're giving all they could &amp; creating shorts without any equipment myself is next to impossible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuixgl?context=5)|Does the school not let you use their gear?  They should!
[They're very reluctant to do so mainly because a lot of students don't look after the equipment properly. Often we will go to see what is available &amp; all they will have is some gel's and a C-stand.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccujb3c?context=5)|Ouch. Not great.  Don't forget though - it's all about learning how to tell a story, so if you only have a borrowed iPhone, then at least you can experiment.  It might not help you much to learn about being a technical DP, but you will learn about coverage etc.
[What was hardest to sacrifice for your dreams?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugqcg?context=5)|""If we loose everything, but make the film, would we still feel it was worth doing?"".  We both said yes.  Life is short and it is something we were really passionate about doing.
 |The house sold really quickly - so we didn't have time to back out. ;)  
[Sloane U'Ren - what set design in Harry Potter were you most proud of/impressed by?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugufm?context=5)|I was impressed by so many things!, both sets drawn up by other members of the art department and my own.  Having worked on the 6th Potter, the Quidditch Pitch came up again and our amazingly talented Production Designer Stuart Craig wanted to change the design slightly from what it was in the first few films.  I got to draught the new version that had 20 towers now instead of 16 - and the towers were now about 25 feet taller (in theory!), so over 110 feet tall.  There were other smaller changes and tweeks as well.  Though a part of the tower had been built at full size for previous films, on the Half-Blood Prince, this was the first time that the Quidditch Pitch (that is the field itself) was built full size.  So we had half an entire pitch laid with grass at full size!, plus the grass bank that curves around the far end behind the three hoops.  It was quite exciting to actually have the big field.  I (and a couple of junior draughtsman) drew/redrew the entire Quidditch Pitch, both on the computer - so that it could go to the VFX houses to be built in 3D and the characters could be composited, flying around on their brooms! - and by hand. Other impressive sets definitely include the Observatory, the Room of Requirement - such amazing detail in every set!
[Some advise for people who want to get into your trade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuguc9?context=5)|It's all about meeting people. It is hard to cold call/email and introduce yourself to people - but it's part of the business.  Sometimes people will have time to chat, sometimes not - but persevere.
 |When you do get someone on the phone/email, ask if you can send a CV (resumé).  It always pays to know a bit about who you are talking to - be familiar with their work and reference it.  Write a polite email and follow up every couple of months (email is best).  We get lots of emails, and when it is time to find people for a project, we naturally will be more likely to remember someone who has kept in contact.
 |Of course, study everything you can about the field you are interested in.  Find out what skills are required and learn them.
 |One thing that is really important - film/TV hours are long!  Having a positive personality, an can-do attitude and a smile really helps.  Everyone likes to be around nice people.
 |Hope that helps?  Good luck! :)
[Hi Sloane and Ant! Sloane... What/who inspired you for the half blood prince? I loved the colour pallette you used. It's definitely the most aesthetically pleasing film out all of them. And I think it's inspired that you moved. Less rugby traffic. (I live in that area\)  And another question. I'm a student in animation and would love to get my foot in some kind of ..well any kind of art department to one day become some sort of part of a design team. What do you think is the most important aspect to show in your portfolio/showreel? And more importantly do you guys enjoy your jobs? What's the best bits and the worse bits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccum4hu?context=5)|Hi! When it came to the Half-Blood Prince, as that was 6/7 years into the 10 year span of shooting the films, the colour palette was fairly much already determined by the production designer by then.  So I didn’t actually have any influence when it came to the colours - that credit has to go to Stuart Craig and his Set Decorator Stephenie McMillan.  Glad you like the look of Half-Blood Prince though - I am proud of my work on it.  I think a portfolio should of course show your talents and creativity to the best of your ability as well as showing off any technical elements that is important to your specific creative talent.  As I’m sure you know, although we all like to flex our creative muscles, when it comes to film/television/animation, etc., as it is not a fine art, we generally can’t just do whatever we want(!) - their is a script to follow, a director and/or producer to work for/with, etc.  So we have to look at these requirements in a creative and yet logistical and practical way (to problem-solve and invent ways to tell an overall story and to add to this, without taking over or being to flashy).  That’s usually the challenging but fun bit, from a design point of view.
 |Make sure when you talk through your pieces in your portfolio that you point out how you made something ‘work‘, how and/or why you chose to design something a certain way so that it worked for the project.  We love our work!  Best bits...I love working as a director now, though I do also really love working in art depts (and do still do that here and there).  Worse bits...lack of sleep when you’re working very hard on your own project! Thanks very much, Sloane.
[In doing art design or soundtracking other people's work how much leeway were you given?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugsq7?context=5)|In doing art department work and designing, it really depends on who you are working for (how the head of the art department - the production designer - works). Some PDs know exactly what they want and will sketch up an idea, do a loose draughting up (a loose technical drawing of plans and/or elevations, like in real world architecture), and/or give you references of images, like photo reference out of magazines, books, the internet, or other designs/art work - as inspiration.  Then your job is to work out how to make their design work in terms of size and materials used to build it.  Other PDs will just give a photo reference of a set and basic sizes of how big/tall it should be and, as a set designer/draughtsman or art director, you get to run with it.  Even if the latter sounds like you get to be more creative (and frequently you do!) the former isn’t bad either - when you are working for a designer, I do also appreciate that they have a clear idea of what they want.  So both works for me! The first feature film that I production designed was also the first feature film that I directed - Dimensions.  Though it was great to design (and I did specifically think that if I didn’t like directing, at least I have now designed a feature and I can continue getting into designing films! - though I love directing), I would not do that on the next one - as you can image, it’s too much work.  Still, it worked for me on Dimensions...and the conversations between the director and the designer were very short and the director always agreed with the designer!!
[Thanks for doing this!  What are some things that no-budget independent filmmakers can do to up the quality of their production?  Also, what's a question you wish we would ask you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccujas3?context=5)|Tips:  Shoot with what you have.  Write around what you have access to.  Collaborate.  Scripts are free (assuming you or a collaborator writes them) - so nail it!  Use actors and not friends (lots of good actors will do shorts if they like the script).  Don't be afraid to ask.  Put together a team of passionate people that are good.  If your DP (etc) isn't up to scratch, then have that difficult conversation - an audience won't give you a 'free-pass' because it is no-budget.
 |As for a question... ""Would you like me to sell my house to fund your next film?"" :)
[Awesome, thanks for the reply!  I'm guilty of using friends as actors.. But now I will start looking at the local university drama and film departments for people looking to build up their reel!  If I owned a house, I would sell it to you.  Maybe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccujvqw?context=5)|Hehe.
[With more and more production design and set design being extended (or created entirely digitally\), how does this affect your job as an art director?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuiqg0?context=5)|It really depends on the film - often it is a combination of green screen and sets so we work closely with vfx.
[Do you enjoy the creative possibilities that CG allows for, or do you prefer physically working with the art?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuiqg0?context=5)|There is nothing like the atmosphere a good set creates though - it feels magic!  Also, it really gives the cast something to react to.
[How much of the job now involves directing animators or effects teams instead of dressers and building crews?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuiqg0?context=5)|CG does open up a huge amount of doors - and I love it when it is done well.  For me, a combination of physical and CG can give the best of both worlds.  For Dimensions we had SFX (smoke, explosions) and VFX (sparks, glow etc.) for the time machine.  The actors react to the set and SFX, while the VFX heightens the illusion. 
[What's the most difficult thing about being in the industry, and are you willing to part with some trade secrets for a 3rd year film student? Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuil8d?context=5)|Lack of sleep. Finding work. Getting people to say 'yes'. Getting people to read scripts.  But it can be sooo much fun.
 |Smile. Always be on time (or early).  Be willing to pitch in and help anyone.  Respect boundaries.  Watch how others behave on set and emulate (the good bits).  Everyone is sleep deprived so a positive attitude really helps!
[What are the chief responsibilities between production designer and art director? How collaborative is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuifro?context=5)|Here is a great link to the breakdown of what the production designer, art director (sometimes the supervising art director on big films, with larger art departments) and assistant art director.  (On some bigger films, the head of the art dept is the PD, then their right hand person is the supervising art director, then there might be a couple/few art directors, then assistant art director(s), set designers (called draughtman or draughtsperson in the UK), and so on.)  It is written by Greg Papalia, who is a fantastic and talented Supervising/Art Director who I had the opportunity to work with a while back when I was still in the U.S. on the film The Patriot... [Link to www.adg.org](http://www.adg.org/sites/art/pdf/art_department.pdf)
[What's next after your first feature? I've always heard making the first is hard, making the second is even harder!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuifro?context=5)|It depends on the personalities of the PD and the AD but, hopefully, they almost always work well together(!) and that they usually get the best results when their is a lot of collaboration.  I worked with a PD and AD who did many films together and the AD could frequently answer questions of the other departments that the art dept work with, such as construction and location, without consulting with the PD constantly because he know what the PD would want, or he knew that the PD would like the ADs choices.  That way, as well, the PD had more time to devote to other things (meetings, issues, etc.). You are correct about getting the second one up and running.  I guess , with the first film, as Ant and I took the plunge and sold our house to make our feature, once we decided that...that was it, we just went ahead and started pre-production and went on to make the film.  With the second, we are beginning to attach actors and it’s a different process.  Dimensions has helped open doors for us and we’re getting meetings that we would not have gotten had we not made the first film. Thanks very much for your congratulations! Sloane 
[What makes you laugh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugqmr?context=5)|I actually really like my feet tickled - find it relaxing. When I was a kid my mum used to get me to tickle her feet and she would fall asleep, so I guess I got it from her.  Under my arms though - now that is ticklish.
[Are you ticklish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugqmr?context=5)|I laugh at a lot of things - I try to especially laugh at myself (try not to take things too seriously!).  Recently just been wetting myself laughing at Tim Minchin's work - he is brilliant!
[If so where and are your feet ticklish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccugqmr?context=5)|Ant 
[Did you get support when/if you revealed your dreams to people of your family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuhb4h?context=5)|Not at all - ask away! - cue: outrageous questions in 3...2...1 :)
[Sorry if that's really too personal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuhb4h?context=5)|When we told people we were selling our home to make a film, the initial response was a little wtf?  When we explained that it wasn't a financial decision, it was a 'life' decision, then the reaction changed completely.  People understood that this is important to us and the support has been amazing! 
[What is it like working with Christopher Nolan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccui1h6?context=5)|When working on set, directors tend to have to be so focused on the job at hand that there frequently isn’t a lot of time to be social.  I was introduced to him on set once, on Batman Begins, but I didn’t really have a lot of interaction with him so I’m afraid I don’t have anytime fun and/or fascinating insights or stories!
 |That said, as a film-lover, he makes films that I love to watch and are really well made - The Prestige, Memento, Inception. Thanks, Sloane.
[Having a lot of experience in many different areas of film making which element of Writing/designing/filming a movie would you say is your favourite? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuh42s?context=5)|I would have to say that directing is my favourite. I’ve only directed one feature so far, but I love both the creative and the technical/logistical elements of directing a film - working with the actors and my HoDs about how we want to make the story come to life, and working out my shots/shot lists, lens sizes/how capture a scene with my DoP...I just the love the team work and working off of one another to create a flushed-out film from the script.
 |I do still love working in art departments, too, though - in fact, I have still gotten work in them after completing Dimensions.  Every script and film is, of course, different and I feel fortunate to have worked on so many various projects over the years - drawing up parts of space ships (Lost in Space), Edwardian England (The Wind in the Willows), New York City shopfronts of the 1960s (Ali), part of an opera-theatre set (for a Six Feet Under episode) to name a few.  Each one is a new challenge and almost always fun!
[So the film is done? Any links to trailers?  Web site?  Is the look along the lines of Sky Captain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuhl9n?context=5)|Yes the film is done - we're currently in the US doing some cinema screenings.  Trailer here: [Link to youtu.be](http://youtu.be/93sxrEx-mpg)  It has some Dieselpunk / steampunk elements - but we had such a tiny budget we had to focus the spend on specific bits (so it isn't as grand a Sky Captain).  That said, we think it looks stunning (we had an amazing cast and crew).
[Why do you suppose the color correction trend in the last decade has leaned toward desaturation? Are there larger politcal/social influences on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuk5g2?context=5)|It's interesting - my feeling is it is just a trend.  We went through the blue/green thing in the early 2000 - maybe a backlash to that?  I suppose you could argue it reflects the bleak nature of our times (economic difficulties etc.).  However, I am not convinced we see that in the actual story telling, and I would have thought a backlash would encompass all elements.
 |Sloane and our cinematographer (Simon Dennis [Link to www.imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1171917/) used McCabe and Mrs Miller as a reference palette wise.  She then worked closely with costume, set dec and hair/make-up to unify the look.  We are both fans of a lot of 70s type films, so it was fun to use elements in that way.
[Hello!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccul6ye?context=5)|As the designer, it is great to offer up to the director options that s/he might not have thought.  You of course want to provide the set and the props that are mentioned by name in the script but just as important is to provide the rest of the world in which the characters and the story itself lives.  Since your job is create a world, be it contemporary, or perhaps and unusual take on the world we live in, the more you can layer (though that doesn’t necessarily mean clutter) a set, the more interesting it usually is, and also the more the actors have to work with, or many absorb, even if they don’t know it at the time. Things to think about are the colour palette, and foreground/mid-ground and background (giving a shot depth, etc.)  If you give the director/cinematographer something to pull focus on, say between something/someone mid-ground and something/someone in the foreground, if it aids the story or the character’s journey, you will have added something to the film that is that much more interesting, by perhaps linking two things together that might not have been apparent before.  So offer ideas up to them that might help enhance the whole world of the film. Also, if there are any particular items (furniture, hero props, etc.) that you would like but don’t think you can afford, go to charity shops/thrift stores and have a good look around for inexpensive items that would work perfectly for a character/in a scene. Hope that helps. Thanks, Sloane.
[My question is, what are some really simple things I can do as far as set design goes to make my short films just a tiny bit nicer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccul6ye?context=5)| 
[Yeah I found the IMDB link, And sky captain as grand as it was was still mostly green screen.  My guess the bane of the art department.  Ill check it out.  Coming to Seattle with the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuhutb?context=5)|Aaaahhh, green screens...  I do admit to being biased towards set builds as opposed to shooting entirely against a green screen.  I think green screens are helpful and useful when adding to a set build, whether it’s as a backdrop or something within the middle of the scene (i.e., augmenting a hero prop, or creating a particular character like Gollum). But from an art department point of view, it is not only more interesting for the most part for us to create a set build, but the actors usually appreciate it - gives them something to work off of - and allows you to be bit more flexible when it comes to the world that you create.
 |Having said all of that! - we just saw Gravity in 3D in the cinema and although there were interiors of spaceships/shuttles built and exterior parts of the spaceship, there had to be a fair bit of greenscreen.  And I thought the film was fabulous.  The performances were spot-on and the director (and his team, of course!) creating an amazing world in space.  Very captivating. Unfortunately, we’re not coming to Seattle, though I wish we were. thanks!, Sloane 
[The kind of camera you used has a very distinct look.  What kind of camera did you guys use? ...or maybe it's the color correction, I don't know.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/cculgza?context=5)|The camera body we used was a Canon 5D Mk II.  And our director of photography - the extremely talented Simon Dennis - arranged for us to hire Zeiss prime lens (basically, fantastic “movie” lenses).  So, yes, it was a combination - between Simon’s cinematography that did look fabulous coming straight out of the camera, and Adam Garstone’s colour grading (Adam was the editor AND did colour grading), we got the glorious look we were going for - I like to think it looks beautiful and timeless!

[You're coming to NOLA? I hope you have fun here! You just missed the film festival. What's screening here?

[If you had $1000 art budget on a small film, what would your priorities be? Paint? Thrift stores? Wall paper?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuqh2a?context=5)|Thrift stores are a very good place to start.  On our film Dimensions, the time machine was based on a lovely piano we bought from a charity (thrift) shop in Cambridge.  Then we spent some time and effort on changing it and turning it into a time machine!  You can find good hero/hand props from thrift stores, and other set dressing as well.
 |Presuming you’re shooting at a location, unless you really think the existing wall colour/wall coverings are awful(!) and really don’t work with the story, I would try to not paint or wallpaper - it will end up eating up more of the $1000 quicker than you think, and is time consuming.  I would use you time and money elsewhere.
 |If there is a particular style of set dressing or special prop that you want but can’t afford, you can try to find a cheaper version of it and change it/augment it, i.e., get some material you like to cheap-and-cheerfully reupholster a chair you love (but hate the current coverings of) to make the piece you like.
 |Remember to prioritise though - balancing what is required in the script but making sure that you layer and add to the overall world you are creating.
 |I have in the past borrowed items from friends on short films in the past...and though that did, thankfully!, work out well for me (no items were lost, damaged or stolen), it is a bit risky as you can’t guarantee that nothing will happen to these items and, ultimately, you are responsible and have the obligation to replace them should anything happen to them.
 |For a few more similar things that I touched on, please see my response to im_friENTly above.
 |Hope this is helpful, thanks, Sloane.
[I am an aspiring writer. What's the best way to begin marketing a story if you've never had any previous exposure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccuh6rm?context=5)|The 'traditional' route for a screenwriter is to approach agents or managers - but it is really tough.  Also, if you get representation you still need to network - works (probably) won't just land on your lap!
 |Some people raise their profile in different ways - there is one guy who wrote a blog about a possessed house (anyone remember the name - or link, please?).  The blog took off and he ended being approached to write a screenplay.
 |I think working with local filmmakers to do shorts etc, is a good way to meet others while honing your craft.  If you are not into writing scripts, you could always see if anyone on the r/screenwriting sub wants to adapt a short/novel - you might end up forging a working relationship that way.
 |TL;DR It's different for everyone - try any angle you can think of.

[I am a clothing designer. How could I get the word out to costume designers and wardrobe people about my availability to provide unique pieces for their productions? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccukp47?context=5)|I would start by looking up on IMDb who you would like to contact.  If there are particular films/television shows that you like and/or think your pieces might suit, I would take down their name and try to find their contact details on line.  If a costume designer has worked on many different looking films/tv shows, they will have designed what would work for that story/that character, so of course that will be different from project to project.  But if you think your pieces are unique (and I’m sure they are(!) and that so-so-designer might be up for using interesting and unusual pieces, they try to contact them.
 |Some might have their own websites and you can contact them through there.  If they do not, if they are on something currently, you can try them through the production office (sometimes at a particular studio) of the project that they are on.  Or you can try them through their agent - though sometime through someone’s agent is quick, and sometimes, not so quick.
 |Don’t be put off if you don’t hear back - as I’m sure you know, people work incredibly long hours in the industry (and sometime barely have enough time, if that, for family and friends!...let alone people they haven’t met yet).  If you don’t hear back and really feel that your pieces would be something of interest to the person, email/ring them again (not too soon after the first time, give them a bit of time to get back to you, possibly) and be short/succinct about who you are and - most importantly - what you can do for them (i.e., provide something they haven’t seen before that they could work for them/their project...without sounding like you know more than them!!).
 |Also, and I’m sure already know this, so please forgive me but...always, always, address the person by name.  I can’t tell you how many c.v./resumes I’ve gotten addressed to Dear Designer (or some such), or even Dear Mr U’Ren (I am a women, and I’m sure that could have been googled).  It’s not that I’m easily offended but I think it can show a lack of attention to detail if your name is not used/spelled correctly/correct gender, etc.
 |Okay, enough of my babbling on...! Thanks, Sloane.
[Where do you see see distribution going in the future? Or should I say, when can we expect to see a similar model to what you've used for your film implemented on more mainstream films. Staggered release dates etc have always bugged me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccujye7?context=5)|I think we are going to see a lot more day and date.  It makes sense to make films available in whatever format the audience wants - at the same time.  Some people can't/don't want to go to the cinema, they want to stream or watch a DVD and we think you should be able to do that on the same day as cinema release.  There is a lot of distribution politics though - it's changing very rapidly and different outlets are trying to figure out how to exist with each other.
[Hey! Mad respect for doing what you are doing - I will see and buy your film just because of this amazing AMA. How do you work with directors?

We really appreciate that. :)
 |With regards to 'Dimensions', as I (Ant) wrote the script and Sloane directed it we had a rather unusual situation.  I tend to not discuss anything about a script, write it, then give it to Sloane - so she can evaluate with no pre-conceptions.  If she likes it, we move on to rewrites, if she just doesn't think the concept has legs, we drop it and start again.
 |As for other directors - it really depends.  Some of them are keen to work on every detail and have strong ideas, some want you to come up with ideas to present.  I would advise always to have ideas - let them lead a meeting and pitch in.  Plus, always have back-up ideas and not just one!  Some people need to see a few things to help focus the decision making process.

[Heres my dilemma right now. I  transferred from colorado to a school Near hollywood. The school is pretty good at getting its students interns, but staying here will put me 30 grand in debt. There is a school that is ranked a lot higher than the one I am at now, and if I went to it, I wouldn't be in any debt. But that school is in Colorado. I'm afraid getting a small internship wont be enough to get me into the industry and that I will end up in super debt. But I am also scared that if I go to the one in colorado I wont be able to get in on any action. What are your thoughts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1oq8g6/hi_reddit_we_are_sloane_ant_neely_after_working/ccusjko?context=5)|That’s a tricky one!  My own opinion is that I’m not sure that I, personally, would like to come out of school 30k in debt - but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth it or that you shouldn’t do that...I’m afraid that you will definitely have to come to your own conclusion about that(!).  Still, good (and even not so good schools) are expensive.
 |I was impressed with the facilities at Colorado Film School.  They have an extensive amount of equipment for the students to use, post facilities that the students learn on; they edit their own shorts right after shooting them, etc., so there looks to be very good level of practical learning.  There is also theory and film studies, I believe.
 |I didn’t sit in on any of the classes, tutor sessions, etc., so I cannot comment first hand on them, but I was impressed with the knowledge, dedication and enthusiasm of all of the staff that I met there.  As well, they told me that their students make many short films a year - I believe they said 6, if I remember correctly. I think this is great because I believe you need to study (whether it is film school, or studying films themselves, filmmaking books, etc., if you don’t go to film school...and I did not go) AND you need to get out there and just make films.  You will do wonderful things and your will also make mistakes along the way, but you have to put yourself out there and create and learn.

One thing I am strongly considering is applying for a PhD. I have about one year before I might be starting those applications, and I want to make sure I'm doing everything right in the meantime to make sure I a) know what I'm getting myself in for, and that it's right for me, and b) maximise my chances of success with my applications.

Here's what I'm currently doing:

* Looking for a research internship for next summer (my current plan is to ask around in my department, but if anyone has advice for finding research internships, let me know!)

* Going to research group seminars in my department. I'm usually the only undergrad there and half of it goes over my head... but it's interesting and gives me an idea of what kind of research is going on (the seminars are given by a mix of PhD students, postdocs, academics in the department, and academics from other universities). I'm hoping to build up to asking questions and talking to people in these seminars, but at the moment I'm still the shy undergrad sitting at the back just listening and looking :p

* For 1/4 of my year's modules, I chose to do a 'mathematical extended essay', which I'm doing on a topic in an area of CS close to the areas of research I'm most interested in. I have a supervisor for this. There is a small amount of original research that I'm going to try to do as part of this essay (just proving the correctness of a couple of algorithms, one of which has been around for a while, the other of which has been implemented fairly recently but not written about)

* I am trying to be better organised and work harder than in previous years to try to get a high degree classification

* Occasionally blogging about topics in mathematics/CS that I find interesting (I don't know how helpful this is, if at all... but maybe it demonstrates a real interest in the subjects? or something?)

On top of that, I'm working on a few programming side-projects, some of which I put on my website (the one with the blog on it) (since if I don't go into a PhD, I'll probably end up applying for software engineering jobs).

What am I getting right? What am I getting wrong? What can I start doing now that will benefit me in a year's time when it comes to apply for these PhDs? Any other advice?

Thanks in advance!"

My university doesn't have a formal program or anything for undergraduate research experience/internships. I am going to ask some members of my department whether they have room for a summer intern - but does anyone have any advice for finding research internships? Have any of you found them through an organisation or scheme that I'm unaware of? Any other tips for getting research experience or improving my chances with next year's applications?

If it matters, my interests in research mostly lie in verification (especially probabilistic model checking), automated theorem proving, and other areas related to computational logic.

1oux1u,5,2013-10-20,How to make up for lost time and position myself for great success? Career/life advice needed.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oux1u/how_to_make_up_for_lost_time_and_position_myself/,"Hey Reddit. I'd very much appreciate it if you could spare a minute to help me think through my career and future. I'm asking for one part career advice and one part financial advice. My goal is to craft the most resilient life possible at an upper-middle-class standard of living. 

Here's my story/your frame of reference. I'm 22, graduated in 2012 with a philosophy degree from a large, public university in Minnesota (the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities). Philosophy...to retail with me, right? Well, I thought I'd be somewhat employable, as I have a good GPA (3.77), little debt (around 4k), a bunch of in-school leadership activities and about 2.5 years of work/volunteer experience relating to nonprofit work. For example, I spent the last year conducting applied research as an AmeriCorps VISTA. I had originally intended to study law with the philosophy degree, which shifted to public policy, which shifted to communications/development/advocacy work for nonprofits. Basically looking to use persuasive writing skills to shape public discourse relating to social issues. I'm currently unemployed (since September), back living with the parents, but doing an unpaid internship and actively searching for work. For example, I've applied for jobs as: 

*A research assistant/associate with a nonprofit
*A communications assistant with a nonprofit
*A technical writer with a software company
*An editor with a business group

...and all sorts of writing-related occupations, but so far no luck. My skills mainly lie in research (literature reviews, prospect research), writing (descriptive, technical, persuasive) and marketing/communications. I'm a great simplifier of messages for audiences, a synthesizer of information and trends, that sort of thing. 

However, since I've been back, out of the workforce and out of the college-bubble, I've taken the opportunity to survey the economic and employment landscape through internet research. Most of what I've read points to a worsening or stagnant American economy and a separation of domestic jobs into high-competition, high-skill, high-reward professions and low-skill, low-reward, generally shitty service jobs, with increasing unemployment. Therefore, my concerns have become much more practical, and center almost entirely around figuring out how to get and maintain higher-paying jobs than those that I've been looking at. My main concern is job security or resilience to drastically changing market conditions. I really think that the job market of 2050 is going to look drastically different from that of today (much more automation, possible depression, for instance). 

I see three ways to go about positioning myself to have a highly successful, resilient career: First, continue on the path that I'm on and eventually work my way into a foundation as a program officer. If the economy improves, more people will be looking to donate money through foundations and if the economy tanks, more people will need charitable donations from said foundations. I see this as the most natural progression, and a compromise between ambition/idealism and practicality.

Second, go back to philosophy, get my PhD, and get tenure somewhere. This path would allow me probably the greatest joy, but given the job market (pretty bad) and the changing conditions (rapid) in academia, this seems like the most risky route.

Finally, retraining. Change my skillset to center around a different field, namely programming/web development. This would be the most economically/practically wise, I think, as the market for web development and web design seems positioned to grow rapidly. It's also soooomewhat similar to the sorts of things I've been doing, as it requires design/communications/logical ability, but the downside is that I know really nothing about computers besides the basics.

So, given these options, which do you think would be best for me to pursue? Are there other options that you think would be a wise choice that I haven't even considered yet? Have I just completely wasted my time in college and work in terms of employability? Is my analysis of the future way off the mark, and will abundant middle-class jobs return? I appreciate any and all advice. Thanks!

Although I loved working for this company, I was beginning to question how long I could manage living in this location so far from my friends and family. I somewhat reluctantly accepted a position that would have the broadest applicable experience to potentially future jobs in other industries. This position is a contractor position, so while I have a ""1 year contract,"" my company extends these contracts typically indefinitely until you find a full-time position with the company, or leave.

I have been in this position for nearly 4 months now. I still enjoy the position and the work, however, this love is fading fast. With new management, the environment of my company and department has gone sour. Most are unhappy and express their frustrations daily. Between still not loving the location of where I am at (in fact hating it more) and now work being a more toxic place to be, I am not happy. One thing that holds me back is my current supervisor is amazing. He is extremely kind, gives me paid time off (off book), and is an all around great manager. He reminds me constantly of what a good job I do and how he is happy to have me on his team. I hate the idea of disappointing him by quitting out of the blue and leaving him with more work due to my departure. I know I don't want to live here longer than a have to and want to move to California (where I have friends and family), but am not sure how to proceed. 

Today I found a job posting with my company at our California location, that while it is not my ideal job would at least combine aspects of a job I like in a location I want to be. I would like to apply, but am concerned that if I do, my manager will be questioned about my performance, alerting him that I am intending to leave.  

What is the best way to handle my situation? I don't want to burn bridges or flush my career down the drain, but I want to get out of where I am ASAP."
1ot27z,0,2013-10-19,Is this a case of disparate treatment or impact in the workplace?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ot27z/is_this_a_case_of_disparate_treatment_or_impact/,"Hello,
I work at a marketing company in New Jersey. I have been there for about 9 months now. I wanted to share with you all some things that I have experienced there and was hoping that you could answer a question that I have.

So, my job title at this company is Intern/office support. This is a permanent contract position, and not seasonal like a common internship. All three of us currently in this role are college graduates. The point of the internship is to learn how the company works and eventually gain a permanent position in the company.

I want to share my experience with differences in treatment that I have experienced between myself (a male) and other female interns. There are three situations that have stood out in my mind.

The first situation was when the two of our interns (both female) were asked by the president of the company to sit in on a marketing meeting. He wanted to have them give their input on the design of the new company website that was in the process of being launched. Apparently the president wanted our generations’ viewpoint on the design. I was sitting right there when he came by our desks to ask if they were available, and I was not included even though I am the same age and had been at the company just as long as the two female interns. He also did not explicitly ask them if they would like to seet in on a meeting, he asked them if “he could borrow them for half an hour.” I learned after the fact that it was this meeting that they attended. I would have loved to have the opportunity to sit in on the meeting, and receive the same treatment as my fellow interns.

The next situation was when our company ran a meet and greet for some of our major clients at our bosses’ country club. About a third of our staff was asked to attend. Neither I nor the only other intern at the time was asked to attend, however on the third day of the trade show, she (the other intern) was given an invitation from one of the higher-ups to attend the show. This was frustrating because she was offered an opportunity to showcase her skills, impress the bosses and win high value giveaway prizes, and I was not included.

The third situation was when the other intern was given a promotion. I was on vacation for a week in the summer and when I came back they had moved her into a new role as a sales coordinator. They did not inform me that there was an open position, and I would have loved the opportunity to interview for it. It almost seemed as if they capitalized on the opportunity of me being away to move her up so that they did not have to deal with me.

There just seems to be an overall difference in the way that they treat male and female interns. I learned that I have been labeled “the phone guy” by one of the senior members of our company, which actually is not true. Admittedly, I have been on my phone before in the office, but only when I am not busy and I never am on it long. I never let using my phone get in the way of completing the work that I need to. Also, the two female interns that I worked with were on their phone a lot more than me and would snap chat each other during the day and gossip constantly. The difference is I get labeled “the phone guy” and they get promoted and given opportunities to succeed.
The way that it feels to work there generally is that female interns are catered to and get taken under the wing of upper management figures, and male interns are looked at under a microscope and not given as much opportunity to rise.

My question to you all is, is this a possible case of disparate treatment or disparate impact?"

I am about to graduate this year (if everything goes well) and i have to do an internship during the next summer. I am really interested into working in the US in the future and i think that getting a internship would help quite a lot. But the problem that it's seems really hard nowadays to get into the US even as skilled person.

Does anyone got a internship in the US as student from western europe. Could you share your story and give some advises.

Thanks and Bye"

1ox9pw,2,2013-10-21,Questions about a GE Information Leadership Program Internship,throwawaygeitlp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ox9pw/questions_about_a_ge_information_leadership/,"Hi there fellow knowledgable redditors.  I'm a Junior in college in the US, and I recently got an summer internship offer with GE in the ITLP program.  I just had a few questions that some of you might be able to answer.
If anyone could give me some general information on what I'll be doing, it would be much appreciated.  To my understanding, the ITLP kids do half programming and half business type stuff.  How does this program differ from a spot in the EEDP portion of GE?  Will I be coding a lot (I love coding and want to be a software engineer)?  And will I be simply supporting GE internal IT issues, or will I be able to actually work and innovate projects. Are there options to move around at GE into different issues as an intern?  

I'm crazy excited about this opportunity; I've never really been offered something like this. I'm eager to hear some more from experienced people that know more about this program.  Thanks for any information or advice!!!"
1ox550,2,2013-10-21,Have you ever stayed in a job that didn't make you happy to avoid disappointing a manager you respected?,Going_to_Pasalacqua,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ox550/have_you_ever_stayed_in_a_job_that_didnt_make_you/,"Folks. Currently working in a coffee shop after spending 7 months in an out-of-state internship under a manager who hired me with a mutual [unwritten] agreement that I would be there long-term (1-2 years.) She develops more of a personal connection to her employees than any other manager I've worked for. I was hired on the spot of my interview about three months ago now. 

A few problems. Right now, I simply do not enjoy what I do. I have a respect for the job and the people who work there, however it's just not satisfying my own professional goals. I'm kept there (often later than scheduled) after working 9 hours on my feet and then waking up to go to classes. It's an extremely tough balance and I've already had to drop a class.

My other problem, which I feel is the biggest, is that it was established that I wouldn't be heading back out of state again this spring. At the time, it was true. I had no desire to go back...anytime soon, anyway. I'm experiencing a change of heart. I established a life down there. Developed relationships and connections that I feel I'm not as ready to walk away from as I thought I was. When I think of going back, it's actually one of the few things that makes me feel better about anything.

I don't know how to approach her about this. All things considered I don't think it's going to go over well. 

What have your experiences been under these circumstances? How did you approach your leadership about the situation, and how did they react? "

1owvca,18,2013-10-21,Google internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1owvca/google_internship/,So I recently applied for Google's SE internship and I ended up getting an email back from a recruiter saying they wanted to do 2  phone technical interviews.  I was pretty shocked because there isn't much special about my resume and I haven't taken some classes that would be helpful for this position. For example I haven't taken my data structures course yet. This seems to be an area that they really focus on during the interview even in the email they say brush up on this. So my question is why did they pick me? I'd assumed they would look at my resume and transcripts before accepting for an interview. I'm super nervous because I don't know data structures very well and that is what is going to be asked. Should I just deny the interview and not waste there time or do it for the experience and see what they ask to be ready for maybe next year? I applied assuming I wouldn't be chosen and surprised I got picked. Will they possibly ask more questions that deal with what I've done according to my transcripts and resume or am I just screwed? I'm not a person to give up easily so I'm going to be reading up a lot on data structures for this. But I doubt it would help much since my interview is in 3 weeks. Any advice?

[How much money do you earn p/a, roughly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwqi6?context=5)|With &lt;5 years industry experience I am making $ 115,000 USD + bonus a year.
[Do you enjoy your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwqi6?context=5)|I am very fortunate to have the opportunity I do. I enjoy my job and it provides well for my family. I can sit inside on hot/cold days or go play with very large equipment if things get boring. Couldn't imagine not being in the oilfield.
[Do you need a specialized degree to do this kind of work?  I have a Geology degree but I didn't have any particular specialization in college.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw0pzj?context=5)|You are not required to be an accredited engineer or what not to do the work, but I don't think anyone would hire a non-engineer for an engineering position.
 |I think the new standard for geologists to work in industry is to have a masters. Again, not a requirement but my understanding from talking to the Geos is most companies won't accept anything less. 
[Yeah, I'm definitely no engineer and unfortunately I never got my Masters.  Never could figure out what I wanted to do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw161s?context=5)|How old are you and what type of experience do you have now? Big companies have different requirements for themselves than smaller mom &amp; pop operations. Are you in an area that's busy with oil &amp; gas activity? 
[I'm late 20's, no oil/gas experience (I've done all environmental consulting to date\) and live in Southern AZ. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw1rvm?context=5)|The area you're in is probably the biggest hurdle to overcome. I don't know of anyone out that way who I could hook you up with to talk to. Sorry. 
[Can you explain the process behind extracting oil from tar sands and why we don't have the technology for it today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvvm44?context=5)|Preface with: I do not work those sands. I specialize in high temperature/high pressure (HTHP) formations. Someone involved more intimately with them could give a better answer. The technology to extract oil from tar sands does exist - its just there are easier places to get hydrocarbons from for the time being, which means a dollar goes further elsewhere.
 |Basically my understanding is the hydrocarbon is simply too viscous to flow through a rock matrix. In fact it is so viscous that it requires cutting with liquid hydrocarbons in order to be able to pump it through pipelines.
 |There are methods of increasing the temperature of the oil underground so that is becomes less viscous (steam floods for example) but those require extensive planning, maintenance and a very high capital investment. Even then, I am not sure of the % of oil that can be recovered from what is initially in place.
 |I'll do some asking around for you if you want and message you a response.
 |ETA: Here's a video from Cenovus who is a big player in the oil sands. In this example they are using steam to heat the oil to decrease the viscosity and letting gravity drain it to a well beneath for production.
 |[Link to www.cenovus.com](http://www.cenovus.com/video/sagd.html)
[Sure. That would be awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwaar?context=5)|Luck of the draw really. The company I work for is large enough to be able to afford the increased capital to chase HTHP stuff. But whether its tight shales or very permeable sands its all a variation of the same, you know? The thought processes and operations don't change. Specialized sounds a bit douchey - let's go with ""I mainly focus on HTHP"".
[How did you get to specialize in HTHP formations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwaar?context=5)|With how hot the market is right now, most companies are taking whatever they can get in terms of experience. If you are trying to transition to a company that predominately works tight shales of course it makes it easier to sell yourself if you have experience in that area - but at the end of the day, it all falls under the same roof.
[Also, how much does it differ between the conventional and unconventional oil and gas industry - in terms of job prospects, pay and expertise needed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvwaar?context=5)|I have worked over-, normal-, and under-balanced formations all for the same company. They pay me the same regardless.
[How did you get your job? (did you make lots of contacts at uni etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw21vi?context=5)|I spend a lot of time on the computer (writing procedures, checking information, approving invoices), going to meetings or talking on the phone. Pretty much the typical office job.
[With oil being a non renewable resource, what will you do when reserves are low or run out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw21vi?context=5)|I did not intern with any companies and so when it came time to look for a job, I applied to ~ 10 places. The company that hired me had just gone through some folks leaving and were needing people. I was lucky to get hired on. Most of the time it would not have happened that way.  I figure we will not see that in my lifetime. If we do though, with all the things that come from petroleum products we use on a daily basis, there will be plenty of other people up shit creek too, not just those in oil and gas. 
[Source: organic matter from a long time ago that was trapped in the rock during deposition and became what we know today as hydrocarbon after millions of years of increasing pressure and temperature.  Pathway: Permeable rock capable of allowing fluid to migrate upwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw51uu?context=5)|The point is that the same impermeable layers that have kept the oil/gas from migrating upwards all these years, can also contain my fracture. We know what our layers are all the way from surface to our target zone, and are capable of using tools to log across these zones during drilling and obtain these rock properties. There are mathematical models (models are not the end all be all though, question anyone who tells you they are) which can be used to predict fracture geometry to an extent.
[What is the first thing we do when we start a well? Punch a big hole through all of these impermeable zones with our drilling rig.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw51uu?context=5)|In the image above they are sigma 1, 2 &amp; 3. When we frac a well we are overcoming the minimum local stress regime and parting the rock. Imagine we have a balloon sealed inside the block that we are pressuring up on. We would overcome sigma 2 first and the rock would split in half perpendicular to sigma 2, right?
[The photo above shows a representation of the drilling casing program. Basically, as we drill deeper and deeper into the Earth, every so often we stop and run steel pipe into our hole. We then cement up the backside (annulus\) of the pipe before continuing deeper.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw51uu?context=5)|The above photo shows an outcrop of rock depicting layering. Now imagine we initiated a fracture where his left hand is and our minimum stress is perpendicular to your computer screen - that means the fracture is going to grow parallel to the layers.
[I am considering the field of petroleum engineering. I hope you can answer some of my questions. First off, what is your work schedule like? Do you move around a lot?  I am planning on a degree in mechanical engineering, will that cover my needs? Is there a lot of competition as far as getting a job?  Do you enjoy your job? Would you recommend it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvzjpe?context=5)|My particular job, no. I could travel but I have a family and choose to be with them. I work ~ 50 hours a week, almost all of it in the office, but am available to field calls 24 hours a day.
 |There are essentially two routes you could take out of school: working for a service provider or for an owner/operator. The operator of a well oversees each operation - leasing land, drilling, completion, production - and calls out service providers as needed for the various work (drilling rig company to do the drilling i.e.).The best analogy I can think of is that of a construction general/sub contractors. Working for an operator typically pays a bit more than working for a service company.
 |With the recent boom in the industry, more and more companies are hiring non-petroleum engineers. It used to be you would have a hard time finding work as a non-PETE but you very well could land on something now. Not sure how long that will last though. I actually started out as mechanical as well but changed my major along the way. Engineering classes are basically the same up until the last 3 semesters or so just so you know.
 |Internships are huge in this business. If you are able to hook up with an operator for a couple of summer internships, it shouldn't matter what your major is. Without having an internship you will most likely have a hard time landing a job with an operator out of school.
 |I am very fortunate to have the opportunity I do. I enjoy my job and it provides well for my family. I can sit inside on hot/cold days or go play with very large equipment if things get boring. Couldn't imagine not being in the oilfield.
[Was the college you graduated from highly competitive? Was it difficult to find employment after graduation? And finally, how important is the specific 'Petroleum engineering' degree? I ask because only one college in canada offers it while all others offer whats called Mineral engineering. Would it be difficult to find employment as a PE with an Mineral E degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccweiyu?context=5)|I can't speak to what Canadian based companies look for. But there are quite a few big operators in your country that you could call up and ask those type of questions. Not sure if you guys have career fairs up that way, but down here they are a big here and would be another chance to touch base with the companies in your area.  Seriously, just call up one of the guys up there and ask to speak to someone in HR that deals with college recruiting. That's your best bet for the right info. 
[Have you seen the documentary Gasland, and if so what was your overall assessment of the movie?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw2do7?context=5)|I watched about 3 minutes of it and turned it off. 
[Yeah, my impression of the trailer was that it was completely a waste of time, then I watched the first 10 minutes. Seemed too propagandic (is that even a word\) to me.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw2wnv?context=5)|Propagandaish maybe? :p Yea I'm in the same boat. It was way too one-sided to sit through. 
[Why wouldn't a rich enough company explore cleaner renewable energy? Last time I checked nobody complained of wind gusts because of wind power :-/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvxhuy?context=5)|That's a fair point. I'd argue that the thing to remember is that hydrocarbons don't just provide energy. Petroleum products are in almost everything you touch. That computer sitting in front of you is proof of that.

 |Unless we as a society plan to quit using things that are made up of derivatives (or come up with a substitute) there will always be a demand. Why not try to answer using the most efficient ways we know how? 
[Fracking in Canada right now is highly controversial, there was actually a riot last week. The long term affects are still relatively unknown with many feeling it's not worth the economic boom. Does Texas and the surrounding states face as much controversy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvyy0a?context=5)|Short answer: no. Oil and gas is HUGE in Texas. It may be the friendliest state for companies to operate in. The industry has been here for over 100 years, and it is such a commonplace thing now that no one thinks twice of it. OK,KS,LA,MS are all similar when it comes to acceptance.
 |I'd say the closest state to us with well known opposition would be Colorado. They do have protests and I know of folks who have had to have security escort them to their vehicles when leaving work due to harassment by locals.
 |Hydraulic fracturing is not a new process - its been around for over 50 years. In recent years it has become more mainstream I suppose due to mass media and sensationalism (youtube videos of people lighting tap water on fire - something they could do 100 years ago by the way). Most of the time I have found those with the loudest voices against it, know nothing of the science behind it...
[Is that tap water thing real, btw? is it due to the water being actually full of liquid petro-chemicals or just NG letdown through the pipes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccwc3uu?context=5)|The stuff in those videos is a result of shallow coal bed methane formations where gas percolate up into the ground water. There are rebuttal videos to those where people go in areas without any oil/gas activity and light river water on fire for instance.
 |So yes, people can light their tap water on fire. But they are able to do so not because of something humans did, but because gas is naturally migrating upwards into their water supply. It has been going on for thousands of years. 
[If a community would like to complain about the two main types of contamination you mentioned, either a chemical runoff or fracking into an aquifier - what kind of evidence would they need? That is, what would be considered conclusive proof that the fracking operations in the area caused considerable environmental degradation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccvz0d4?context=5)|That's tough to say without knowing the specifics. The general idea though, would be to get samples taken before/after the activity in the area. These could then be analyzed and a determination made based off the findings.
 |The most recent case I can think of around that topic was the Pavillion field in Wyoming. Here's a link with some info on it (granted its from the operator who was accused of causing the damage, but I like this because it lists why they refute the claims).
 |[Link to www.encana.com](http://www.encana.com/news-stories/news-releases/details.html?release=632327)
 |I should point out that the EPA discontinued their study, so there would seem to be some merit to the disputes listed by Encana. There are a ton of other sites with info on this case on the web if you want to do some more reading.
 |Truthfully though, you will not be able to find a case in which fracturing was the sole cause of an aquifer contamination. Barring a shitty cement job done during drilling, the physics behind a frac job don't support that type of anomaly. We can go more into the specifics of that if you would like.
 |If you are talking about chemical runoff, or behind pipe (bad cement job) communication - in which fluids migrate up the wellbore into shallower zones  - I fully acknowledge the potential that exists for aquifer contamination. But it won't be the induced fracture downhole itself.  
[Can you talk a little about why the physics don't support a sole cause of aquifer contamination? Interesting AMA, thanks for doing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ouxt0/iama_petroleum_engineer_specializing_in_hydraulic/ccw3l9j?context=5)|[Link to www.gaslandthemovie.com](http://www.gaslandthemovie.com/img/themed/frontend/still-gasland_hover.jpg)
 |[Link to fracfocus.org](http://fracfocus.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/horizontalfrac.jpg)
 |Granted the depth of the target formation could be closer to the water bearing zone, but take the first photo with a grain of salt.
 |First thing we need to talk about is what makes a reservoir. Let's stick with conventionals since they are a bit easier to talk about. So three things have to exist for us to have a reservoir by definition: a source, a pathway, and a trap.
 |Source: organic matter from a long time ago that was trapped in the rock during deposition and became what we know today as hydrocarbon after millions of years of increasing pressure and temperature.
 |Pathway: Permeable rock capable of allowing fluid to migrate upwards.
 |Trap: A 'cap' if you will that blocks the further migration of fluid towards surface.
 |So by its very nature a reservoir could not exist without something that keeps fluids from migrating further uphole.

 |The photo above shows a representation of the drilling casing program. Basically, as we drill deeper and deeper into the Earth, every so often we stop and run steel pipe into our hole. We then cement up the backside (annulus) of the pipe before continuing deeper.
 |For this particular example there are 3 steel barriers, one with cement behind it, protecting the ground water from contamination from below. Typically the minimum set depth for the surface casing is a state requirement and is dependent upon the water table. We are required to test the casing/cement job for integrity prior to continuing operations to ensure everything is holding.
 |So although we did create a pathway for the gas to travel to surface on, our casing/cementing program should keep the various zones separate. However, there are times when shotty cement jobs allow for crossflow communication and can in fact contaminate the ground water. This is due to drilling practices though, not hydraulic fracturing (we haven't gotten to that step yet).
 |Hydraulic fracturing is used for one purpose: to increase a well's productivity. Productivity is just a fancy word describing how much fluid we get for a given pressure drop i.e q (flow rate) / (P initial – P flowing).
 |Let’s put it into something we can picture. Out in my backyard my son has a kiddy pool filled with water covered with a lid I cannot take off; that is my reservoir. You approach me and say you will give me $1 / gallon of water I can give you that I take out of the pool. Hell of a deal I think and I head off to get your water. Now reservoirs, just like pools, come in all different shapes and sizes. The important thing to remember is compared to the diameter of the hole we drill (called ‘wellbore’ – varies by area but typically &lt;12”), the reservoir is HUGE! Its like a coffee straw compared to my kiddie pool, or if I have a really big reservoir, a coffee straw compared to an in ground pool. Needless to say I’ve got a ton of water to get out of the pool, and a very small straw to do it with.
 |No big deal I think, I’ll just put in a bunch of straws and suck out of more than one. The catch is that a straw may cost me a week’s worth of sucking, or a month, or a year before it pays itself off. I can’t afford to put too many in the pool, or it will take too long to pay out. I decide that 5 straws is an economic compromise, so I put my straw in the pool (drill my hole) and start sucking (producing the well).
 |Now there are two important differences between my kiddy pool analogy and the real world that we need to understand.
 |The first is that not every well I drill in the real world will be equal. Some will produce more than others, and some not at all. Some straws I bought will never pay for themselves.
 |The second point to make is that unlike water flowing freely in a pool, the fluids in my reservoir cannot move so readily. In my analogy the straw would be the limiting factor in how much fluid I could move (frictional pressure loss associated with such a smaller inner diameter). In reality though my wellbore can move however much fluid I can throw at it, the problem is getting it there. That is, the connected pores in the rock do not line up perfectly to my straw. There are tight spots, backtracking, dead ends and all sorts of things that the fluid has to fight. Not only that, but once you get to the base of the straw there are some other effects. We can mimic these behaviors by placing a maze around each straw that restricts how much fluid I can suck. So now this maze, and no longer the straw, is the limiting factor in how much water I can move.
 |So here I am sitting in my backyard, with 5 straws spaced around the kiddie pool sucking away (don’t forget we added the maze). My wife walks out, sees me and asks how would I like to decrease the amount of effort (pressure drop) it is taking to suck a certain volume? She says she will create a path that completely bypasses the maze and can increase how easily the water flows to the straw by 4 times. Not only that, it is only a third the price of a new straw.
 |That is what hydraulic fracturing does to a well. It creates a pathway for the reservoir fluids to bypass the permeability of the rock – a one lane country road – and jump on an 8 lane highway headed straight for the straw. For the same amount of pressure drop, I can move much, much more water.

 |Granted the depth of the target formation could be closer to the water bearing zone, but take the first photo with a grain of salt.
 |First thing we need to talk about is what makes a reservoir. Let's stick with conventionals since they are a bit easier to talk about. So three things have to exist for us to have a reservoir by definition: a source, a pathway, and a trap.
 |Source: organic matter from a long time ago that was trapped in the rock during deposition and became what we know today as hydrocarbon after millions of years of increasing pressure and temperature.
 |Pathway: Permeable rock capable of allowing fluid to migrate upwards. Trap: A 'cap' if you will that blocks the further migration of fluid towards surface.
 |So by its very nature a reservoir could not exist without something that keeps fluids from migrating further uphole. The trap has sealed the fluid for millions of years, why would it suddenly give way? The only way that gas could get closer to the surface (and aquifers) if it a pathway was created.

 |**Frac Mechanics**
 |Any combination of forces on an object can be represented by three principal directions.

 |In the image above they are sigma 1, 2 &amp; 3. When we frac a well we are overcoming the minimum local stress regime and parting the rock. Imagine we have a balloon sealed inside the block that we are pressuring up on. We would overcome sigma 2 first and the rock would split in half perpendicular to sigma 2, right?
 |So a fracture will always grow perpendicular to the least principal stress.
 |[Link to www.southampton.ac.uk](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg-Lyme/11LYM-Thin-Oil-Shales-lab-m.jpg)
 |The above photo shows an outcrop of rock depicting layering. Now imagine we initiated a fracture where his left hand is and our minimum stress is perpendicular to your computer screen - that means the fracture is going to grow parallel to the layers.
 |Although no formation of rock in nature is homogeneous, for our purposes we will assume it is. You will notice that on either side of our target layer, we are bounded by rock that looks significantly different. There are two mechanical properties of rock we are concerned about when it comes to fracturing: Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio. Basically how stiff our rock is, and how much flex it has. So we have a layer of rock, our target zone, with a certain YM and PR bounded by rock on either side with a different YM and PR.
 |So we pressure up on the rock next to his hand, overcome the minimum stress and the rock parts. Now how much of the rock parts is dependent upon how much pressure over the minimum we exerted. If it took 1,000 psi to open the rock and I applied 1,001 my fracture will grow less than if I applied 2,000 psi. This concept of pressure greater than my minimum pressure required to open my fracture is called 'net pressure'. This is the energy that will be used to grow my frac. Let's say I have one gallon of fluid and I pressure up on my rock with a minimum stress of 1,000 to 1,001 psi and my fracture initiates. As soon as I create enough space for that 1 psi to dissipate into, my fracture will quit growing. In order to keep growing my fracture I must continuously inject into it.
 |So back to our photo. I initiated my fracture, and will continuously inject into the formation to keep a net pressure of 100 psi. My fracture begins to grow both out and up. At some point, it will reach the upper and lower boundaries. Because of the varying mechanical properties, the pressure required to grow a frac in those layers may be 2,000 instead of 1,000 psi and the fracture will no longer grow vertically. Sure, the layers could be less than 1,000 psi but I will eventually hit something above and below that will be too hard to breakdown with my 1,000 psi. My frac will quit growing in height.
 |The point is that the same impermeable layers that have kept the oil/gas from migrating upwards all these years, can also contain my fracture. We know what our layers are all the way from surface to our target zone, and are capable of using tools to log across these zones during drilling and obtain these rock properties. There are mathematical models (models are not the end all be all though, question anyone who tells you they are) which can be used to predict fracture geometry to an extent.

1ow3xs,9,2013-10-21,College graudate: what do i do?,confusedinlife55115,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1ow3xs/college_graudate_what_do_i_do/,"Hello Reddit,

Long time lurker and first time poster. I recently graduated from a well-known university with a management science degree (a lot of economic classes with emphasis in math, microeconomics, econometrics, etc.).

It has been about 5-6 months since I graduated and I really don't know what to do with my life. I realized that I don't know anything of the real world and that I don't have the business personality and mindset that so many people in my major seem to have. Along with that, I have no experience with internships or anything of the sort. I was just that college student that took classes and did nothing else but do general club activities, drink and game.

I feel like I made a wrong choice in my major and that I should go back to school (looking into a computer science degree as I am interested in the subject and the job opportunities that are open with it). Even though I have no idea on how to do such a thing.
What I'm wondering about is this. Is it smart to go back to school to get another bachelor's or should I just try to keep finding jobs in my major? Also, to those that say I should go back to school, should I go back to my old university (where I would have to pay an arm and a leg for) or is an associates good enough for this field?

Sorry if this seems like a ""I need help, please give me all the answers with no work on my part"" type of question. I have just been extremely depressed for the past month as I took an extra year to graduate with this major after switching from a science and all of my friends seem to have moved on to the next stage of their lives.

P.S: If neither of the questions seem like a good idea, any answer would be great. I just feel like my glass was shattered when I finally left school. Finding out I don't really like my major, and with no classes to take, I feel like I can do anything; however, I just don't want to make the another mistake (such as switching from science to management science without really thinking about it).

TLDR: Depressed college graduate with a BS in Management Science wondering if to go back to school for a Bachelor's in Computer science. yay or nay?"

[A month ago, this stupid chick started stalking my boyfriend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ml1ou/can_this_be_considered_stalking/) She got his number from their mutual friend, she texted him and called him, he tried to convince her to fuck off and even told her that he's engaged (he isn't, but she doesn't have to know, now does she?), but she just didn't care, because we're in a long distance relationship and she believe she could make him happier than I do.

He didn't go to college once and she texted him asking if he didn't, and if not, then she'd get a ride back to his place. He never answered.. then she showed up at his place. She walked around outside the buildings, called him, he ignored. She left after he told her he'd call the police if she didn't fuck off, and she texted him, ""i like you, im capable of sacrificing myself for u""

She eventually stopped calling and texting, as far as I know. She still tried to talk to him while he was at college but he ignored her.

Until tonight. She got a friend to text him asking why he wasn't talking to her.

I'm getting more than fed up with this, I thought she was finally done being a crazy bitch but apparently not.

He didn't want to get a restraining order before because he was supposed to come here (NC, he's in Puerto Rico) for his internship but that didn't work out. He doesn't think he can get one now because she hasn't done anything lately.

What the hell should he do?"

It's been a few months now and I'm feeling pretty unhappy at my current job. 

I hate to say it but most of all, I dislike my team. There is no team chemistry at all. Everyone does their own work, they rarely socialize with each other and cooperating on work related stuff is at a minimum. I'm also the only recent grad. Everyone else is a Senior Developer and there is very little mentoring, which is a big departure from my old team. I have reached out on many occasions but most of the time I get the sense that they do not want to take the time to help. I'm not asking anyone to hold my hand but at the same time, I do not feel like I'm benefiting from working with a team of Senior Developers. 

I also dislike the product. I have learned to use it but nothing outside of work compels me to use it. 

All of this has drained all of my motivation. While I had less free time when I was in school and working as an intern, I still found time to do a little extra programming on the side, just for fun or self-improvement. Now, when I get home I want to do nothing but watch TV, eat, and maybe exercise before I head to bed.

On the bright side, pay is competitive with good work-life balance but like I said above, I no longer have the motivation outside of work to program.

Should I stick it out for a year or try to jump to a different company right away?"

I am in the third year of a four year degree in a technical field. I feel a year out from college would make a lot of sense for me, but I don't want to do it unless I have something lined up. I am looking for internships at the moment for the summer as I have not done one before now, and I don't want to put that in jeopardy by making myself look bad. Do you think what I want to do is realistic? I am an average student, my grades are not amazing but not horrible either. Should I apply for graduate positions and include a cover letter?  If somewhere will take me, even if it is unpaid I would take it in a heartbeat, but I don't want to undersell myself either. I really want to make this happen for next year, does anyone have any advice?"

I’ve recently finished a 6-month internship as software engineer on a project at a university where I used Java, PHP, JavaScript and MySQL amongst others, I feel I did pretty well and got good feedback. Now I’ve just started my first proper job, my first day went well, I met everyone in the office and a co-worker helped me install everything on my machine, it was a bit of a blur, my line manager was busy all day and I barely saw him but I was busy setting up my machine anyway, I should mention at this point that I’ve had no introduction to the tools I’ll be using, the projects I’ll be working on, who the projects are for, the deadlines, the timescales etc etc.

Also, this company uses C#, ASP.net, MS SQL, none of which I have used in previous jobs, obviously I realize C# and Java are very similar but I haven’t had any time to brush up before I started this job. So my second day comes along and I assume I’ll get some time with my line manager and some sort of introduction to the job, I tell him my machine is set up and he gives me a task to do, he emails me the task and his request is one sentence long and extremely vague and requires me to update a tool (which is a very small part of the very large project) that the previous guy wrote and no one else knows anything about. My line manager then leaves me at my desk, I try my best to get going with it but really struggle, no one has told me how to access the database (which contains tonnes of data, various logins, groups etc) which I need to do to complete the task, how to run or compile the main project (which is made up of 100s of smaller projects which have to be configured a certain way and there are also different versions of each project and no indication of which to use).

I occasionally asked the guy working next to me for help and he was very helpful and friendly, but he was also busy with his own work and I sometimes got the feeling that he thought I should know the things he showed me even though I feel there was no way I could have known (e.g. I asked about how to login into the database and he listed a username and password from memory, both were about 12 characters long and made up of seemingly random letters and numbers, how was I supposed to know this?). I should also mentioned that this is an entry-level position and I did not lie or exaggerate during the recruitment process, I even completed a test which I felt (and was told) I did well on. Anyway, long story short, I was wondering what should I do tomorrow, I don’t want to struggle on in silence trying to finish a task I feel I am ill-equipped to tackle but at the same time I don’t want to seem whiny or incompetent by asking for at least a basic introduction to the job and set-up."

I'm finishing up my lower division courses next semester, as a CS major. 

Over the phone, they asked me if I knew C++ or any other languages. I said I took an intro course on C++ and am delving deeper into Java, and she said that is good because they need students with familiarity of programming languages.

I'm so excited, especially because I'm a huge fan of WD harddrives as well. Also they are offering $17/hour which gives me reason to quit my current job that I despise.

Any general advice? Do you guys think they will ask me programming questions? I know I should dress well/conservative, keep eye contact, firm handshake, smile and all those interview basics."

I'm having fun learning but I feel like it's a waste of time and that employers will see it as irrelevant.

I also don't have the skills to make huge projects. I'm only currently in an intro to Python programming class. I enjoy programming though and do it in my free time. I feel like that if I make an program it will seem trivial to employers. I'm currently working on a GPA program.

I've been trying to learn web development but I always get bored and quit because I'm not making anything of use to me and just following examples.

So do you just suggest that I do projects that seem fun and are useful to me or should I do difficult projects that will impress employers?"
1oy43n,1,2013-10-21,What language should I learn for this project.,cj122,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oy43n/what_language_should_i_learn_for_this_project/,"A bit of backround information on this, I am currently a highschool senior and have taken five classes on programming so far. as a senior project and internship of sorts, I have a whole semester to learn a NEW language to create the software for my school districts academic challenge for the middle schools.

I need to be able to:
Be able to read in pre-written files that I will be doing, that will hold around 100 questions at a time, and be able to display them at random with out repating one.

Be able to cycle back through questions that I have moved on from

Keep track of each schools score at each meet.

and save easy to read files with the rankings of each school for each individual meet and the over all year.

I need to be able to impliment some simple GUI (which may be hard because I was never taught it) and It needs to be simple enough that a teacher can read the rankings and use the software if I am sick that day.

So far I have learned C++ and Java, which are as a result off the table, and Im familier with some basic object oriented programming and advanced data structures.

Any idea what language I should learn for this kind of program, or any tips.

This is a big step up for me considering last year I was doing simple file reading and calculation programs.

Much appreicated, and appologies for my English.

EDIT: I should make note that they want this all done in a single scripting language of sorts."

My problem is I haven't done that many personal projects and i've never really been able to find open source work that I really liked.

The large bulk of my programming work and experience is solving mathematical problems or the course work i've been assigned. I've done work with puzzle solvers and this really neat A* pathfinding program I built. 

I'm trying to land internships options for the summer and I'm afraid that i've either started to late or that the blank spaces in my resume will give away how inexperienced I really am. There's just so much crazy talent out there and I feel painfully inept in comparison. I suppose the obvious long term solution is to gain more experience that I can put on a resume, however there must surely be a short term solution to act as a maintainable patch until I can get to the optimal situation where I have experience in spades.

I am a systems analyst intern with no previous database experience. Nobody in my office works with databases or any other IT. I am all alone, and in full charge of my project.

The office that I work in has over 4,000 hardcopy files that they want scanned and stored in a database. The files should be loosely (major keywords only) indexed for quick retrieval.

Here's my blueprint:

1.	Scanning PDFs with OCR (optical character recognition)
2.	Converting OCR format to .txt file
3.	Altering the .txt file using word cloud software* for optimization
4.	Using .txt file as an index for Microsoft Access
5.	Uploading PDFs as Access BLOB files and associating them with the .txt files for optimal indexing

*Thoughts on word cloud software: Shrinks OCR to only include frequently-used words and eliminate words such as: and,or,the,if,then,etc.)

Thoughts? Is this a horrible idea? I have a year to work on this project (15 hours/week) and it's paid+college credits. Our office has no CMS software that I know of."

My interviews have gone fairly well, but I feel like I'm missing the engineering industry experience. I'm going to continue to pursue full-time work, but if the interviews I've had lately don't look promising, I might take the co-op and graduate fall 2014.

Anyway, I missed 2 calls (4 hours apart) on Tuesday because they were both during my only 2 classes of the day, really stupid I know. They were private numbers so I can't call back, and I don't know which of the two places its from. I was hoping they might call again today, but they didn't. Its possible that I didn't get the position and they just wanted to notify me and give me some feedback (which one place said they would do) on my interview, but I'm pretty worried that I might have missed my spot over something really silly like this.

Should I send an email to both places? Wait a few days? Let's just say that they were going to offer me the spot or call me back for another interview, would they actually call me again?

One of the interviews was a month ago, but they were interviewing a lot of people so a late response would be understandable, the other place was a much smaller company, and the interview took place two weeks ago.

Hey guys! I am an amateurish programmer (I just finished my first year at college) who always wanted to contribute to open source. I stumbled across this project idea through my internship, where I was required to use the [Fogbugz API](http://help.fogcreek.com/8202/xml-api) along with [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/). It turns out, there wasn't any node package that used the Fogbugz API so I decided to create one!

I literally created it today and it is pretty bare bones but I will be adding a lot to it over the next few weeks. It's also my first git project (with actual contributors I'm hoping..).

###Contributing
Basically, what we want to do is provide a nodejs library for calling functions in javascript that interact with Fogbugz. We would want to port all the supported Fogbugz XML Api calls in the documentation and return JSON instead of XML.

If you have any questions about the project or how you might be able to contribute, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm going to be very patient because I know what it was like to start out. 

###GitHub Link
https://github.com/claudiowilson/FogbugzJS

Right now, all it has are functions to call the API with text, and to logon. I have written a lot of these functions already in javascript but haven't ported them to coffeescript yet, and will do so soon. 

###Development Setup
I finally got a contributor! Anyway, people have been asking me about my development setup for coffeescript and node so here it is. I'm using [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) as an editor along with the [Better Coffeescript](https://github.com/aponxi/sublime-better-coffeescript) for syntax highlighting. Also the [Coffeescript cookbook](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/strings/) may be useful for people like myself who are not used to coffeescript yet.

Obviously I have node installed for testing, along with a free fogbugz site set up so I can test functions. "
1p14d4,7,2013-10-23,Spreading myself too thin at school. Should I cut back on classes and delay graduation - or just push through and get this over with?,Pecorino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p14d4/spreading_myself_too_thin_at_school_should_i_cut/,"This is a bit embarrassing, as I'm only taking 14 credit hours - but I'm getting burnt out very quickly and it's starting to affect me in ways I did not anticipate. Basically, I'm at the point where my workload at school is so high, that it is starting to affect my overall performance in school. Lately, I haven't been able to finish assignments and the quality of my work has been horrid.

I feel I'm particularly disadvantaged because I tend to learn at a more leisurely pace (a nice way of saying I'm slow) than my peers, and I have to put in more time to ""get it"" than others. Currently I'm in the second CS course, and a Java course. The workload alone in these two classes take up the majority of the time I spend outside of class. 

Of course, if I'm completely honest with myself, I could be managing my time and focus better - but still. I am stressed out. I don't have weekends anymore, or free time for that matter.

My question is this... would it be wise to cut back on the amount of classes I take at the expense of delaying my graduation even further? Many on this subreddit seems to emphasize the importance of getting an internship. Well, I don't know how I could possibly hold an internship, with the same workload at school and not go insane.

Any input would be greatly appreciated."
1p0zjb,1,2013-10-22,Fear About My Future: Should I Choose College or Experience?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p0zjb/fear_about_my_future_should_i_choose_college_or/,"**For those who want a tl;dr:** (although I'd prefer you'd read everything to know my position)

My dad owns a company where he is the only employee; He maintains the COBOL code for old Counterpoint systems. I was screwed doing an experimental program in high school, and now my college is pretty much half-ruined and costs about 1.5 times as much. The degree itself is proving to be useless anyway, as the way it's designed I learn very little pertinent to my field and can't skip anything. Should I face my parents and intern with my dad, work on open-source, and build a portfolio; Or should I stay in college, tough it out, and hope to God everything works and the degree is worth it?

**For those of you who can hear me out:**

About five years ago I started programming. I was a 4.6 GPA student at my high school until about two years ago, when I went into the Saint Petersburg College Early College program. This program allowed me to take all my classes at SPC, and get an AA when I graduated high school.

Now this program was highly experimental and nobody really knew what they were doing. As such, I was put into humanities classes I couldn't possibly handle - three of which were 9 credit hours each - and my strong subjects were being diverted because they didn't think my high school calculus could even let me skip college algebra.

Because of my ineptitude at humanities, my GPA in the program ended at 2.7 and my high school GPA plummeted to a 3.4 (4.0 weighted), but at least I got my AA. And hey, I was promised that my GPA wouldn't transfer anyway; I would be accepted with the “dual-enrollment” credits, and on the fast track to my major.

Well they were wrong, the GPA did transfer, while some of the requisites didn't. So another calculus, more humanities, writing intensive classes. And the classes I have to take aren't easy classes where I can program in my free time. I actually had one week of ~4 days of no sleep getting 27 pages of essays done. And like I said before, humanities are my weak spot – analyzing the role of Virtue in Plato's Utopia (Republic) isn't something I do especially well.

To make matters worse, that 2.7 on 60 hours transferred instead as a 2.4 on 72 hours. This means two-fold:

* After the first 140 credit hours (including the already obtained 72), I'm going to have to pay *double* for my classes.

* I may not even get into the computer science department. It's a very small department with a 3.0 entrance requirement (with other requirements as well). To get the GPA I need when I need it, I need to get A+ grades in *every* class.

And if I thought it couldn't get worse, the way the schedule is set up, I won't be able to touch programming in my classes until next Fall; The classes I then take are made up of “concept” programming, such as learning OOP and “Common Data Types”; I talked to the head of the department and she said I cannot skip any of the concept classes without a documented class from another college, because “how else can they know that I know”; And I can't even take comp sci based electives instead of the requisites that *did* transfer until my senior year, because they require the concept classes!

In terms of pricing, I have about $10k of loans a semester, plus another $4k out of pocket (on private loans) even with scholarships. But remember, starting my Junior Spring, I'll need to pay twice as much tuition because of the new credit hour laws. So I estimate by the end I'll have ~$79k of debt. 

Meanwhile, my dad owns his own business. A small contracting one that (mainly) maintains COBOL code for old Counterpoint software, where he is the only employee. He's a phenomenal programmer and all his clients love him/his work.

After everything I've been through, I've started to doubt the use of the college I'm paying so much to receive. I want to ask my parents if I can just come home and instead intern or work for my father and start contributing to the open-source world, and when I feel I'm comfortable in the “real-world”, I can start looking for jobs with an AA and a few years of experience under my belt rather than an expensive degree.

In terms of experience, I like to think I'm actually a pretty good programmer. I've learned some-odd 13 languages, although my proficiency is in C++(11), Ada, and a (toy) language called Nimrod. Programming is my passion, and I spend almost all of my free time doing it! I have a firm understanding of all the concepts, but my main weakness is that I don't know how to do “real-world” programming. And no, I don't want to do game programming like so many others do, I'd prefer something more along the lines of what my father does (but as an employee of a real company – not a contractor). 

What I want to know is what you guys think of my situation, and which course of action you all think I should take. I feel like this might be a great opportunity but I'm absolutely terrified of disappointing my parents and telling them I want to drop out like this, but I'm far more mortified of what will happen if I don't. 

Note: I'm sorry for how long this is, I wanted to be as concise as I could but also be well spoken. It might have some spelling/formatting errors, and I apologize ahead of time."

So, I will be graduating in December (finally!), and have been pretty steady on the job hunt since August.  I would say about three weeks ago, the interviews really started coming in.  I've had four interviews so far, with four separate opportunities.  One has already offered an internship (immediate start) with ""potential"" to go full time in December, and another offered a second interview.  The other two positions told me it would be a few weeks, so I'm not really stressing over those.  

My issue is offers for interviews are still coming in.  I have been asked to come in this Thursday, and received another for mid-November (it's a government job, so I'm not put off by the length of time).  

Obviously, my goal is to have a position for when I graduate in December.  The internship hasn't (understandably) guaranteed anything, but if they did, I wouldn't have a problem staying there.  I know that nothing is absolute when looking for positions, but should I still be taking all the interviews that I can get?  Should I get through the process with the first four companies, and see where I end up?  I don't want to screw myself over here, but I also don't want to keep taking time off of work and school to go to interviews when I have so much potential...

I have the tendency to take work very personally.  I feel like it is irresponsible to accept an interview and cancel, or even start the process if I'm not 100% committed.  What is the proper way to handle this with HR?  Do they even care?  Should I be in touch and tell the different companies that I am interview other places?

He's a GREAT guy and REALLY knows his nerd stuff. He lives in New York though and I'm in LA, so that was the biggest reason why it didn't go anywhere, but our personalities weren't completely compatible either.
 |*Edit, forgot to answer some of it. There is a ton of footage that didn't get used of Andrew being the funniest guy alive. I seriously love Andrew, he was my favorite in the house.  We most likely won't get a season two. Were pretty sure.  I start for Regina possibly in January. Though Comikaze starts Nov 1st! So I'm helping out there too!

Do you have any thoughts as to how SyFy handled the marketing of the show and basically burned off the last three episodes in a bad time slot without any warning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyutg4?context=5)|I think the show portrayed real nerds VERY well. I was pleased with how everything came out.  I do not think Syfy really got what it is nerds like, as far as marketing. They called it The Real Big Bang...when most nerds I know HATE The Big Bang Theory.  Syfy was pleasant to work with, I liked everyone I met, but it's not like it's run by nerds. As for the time slot changes, I think they realized they weren't getting the ratings they wanted and were just trying to air the rest of it without canceling it.
[Hey Dani! So happy to see you win the show! (Job\) Was rooting for you!  Question - Lord Of The Rings? Yes Or No! (Do you like it\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytif8?context=5)|LOTR! YES! I saw the Fellowship in theaters 7 times. 
[ now we move on to Harry Potter.  You just received your letter ... congrats.  Which house are you most likely to end up in, and what will be your animal of choice to bring along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuiq1?context=5)|Kristin from the show is the biggest HP fan I know and she thinks I'd be in Gryffindor. I agree. I read the books as a kid and I always saw myself as a noble and brave kid haha. As for animal...maybe a cat, maybe an owl. Probably cat.
[You said you're a makeup artist on the show.  Do you have any pictures of stuff you've done that you're really proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuki8?context=5)|I have tons! [Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/CBNvw)

Are you still an aspiring make-up artist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuhuq?context=5)|I am definitely interested in doing moor makeup, I do enjoy it. I'm also interested in acting, I miss theater and haven't done much lately. I'm in LA so I may try to get into it.  I REALLY like Regina and her team, so I can see working for Comikaze for a long time. We'll see!
[HEY DANI! WOULD YOU RATHER SWEAT GREEN SLIME OR FART BLUE SMOKE??? (im asking for a friend\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccywquj?context=5)|Hmmm Casey...I don't think either would effect me to a terrible degree...I guess maybe I'd fart blue smoke. Ooo ooo, I know why! So when someone DOES fart and it wasn't me, no one could ever blame it on me! ""Remember guys? Mine is blue? Yeah, wasn't me.""
[If there was going to be a second season of Fangasm what would you want to see on it?  Also, if you were a producer or SyFy executive what would you have changed in season 1 and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyvopt?context=5)|If we somehow got a second season, I'd love to see even more nerd-celebs on the show! Kristin and I kept mentioning in earshot of the producers, how much we loved Simon Pegg, and Nathan Fillion, and Neil Gaiman. Andrew's metting George Takei was a magical moment, I think people would love to see more of that.
 |If I could change anything about season 1 it would be the way it was marketed.
[What was the first show or comic character you really geeked out too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu3o9?context=5)|I've always loved Batman, and the first comic I ever read was Gotham by Gaslight. I started to get really into him and that led me to the Justice League. I remember falling pretty hard for Green Arrow and Black Canary, but also loving Martian Manhunter.
[I have a couple questions. I NEED to know...Is cheese a kind of meat? A tasty yellow treat? Is it normal that I make it from my teet? Should I try and be discrete? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv45b?context=5)|Ohhh cheese! Cheese is a kind of beef!

If so which one's are your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccywveo?context=5)|I am aware of the show, but I haven't watched it. I haven't watched a lot of anime, it's not really my thing, but I did watch all of Deathnote and I liked it a lot.
[Hey there, Dani! Big fan of the show! Now it's time to answer life's heaviest question: Green Arrow or Green Lantern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytwgr?context=5)|Oliver Queen all the way. He and Dinah are my favorite comic couple EVER.
[I'm not a total geek so I can only relate to you a little bit but your show was pretty awesome.  I was pulling for you and Sal but apparently, he's too immature for you, relationship-wise.  Besides you, Andrew was my other favorite in the house.  Do you still keep in touch with him? Do you keep in touch with anyone on a regular basis from the Fortress of Fandom?  You also just tweeted you have a mancrush... who is it? and how do I make you crush on me?  Lastly, you are very pretty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuoap?context=5)|I do keep in touch with Andrew! We both live in LA so I go see his stand up now and then and we had lunch the other day. He's a sweetheart and his GF Lisa is just as hilarious and nice. The fortress of fandom and I have a FB message we're constantly posting in and talking to each other. I love them all! I miss my girls.
 |Yes I have a HUGE crush on a guy I know...actually we're seeing each other :) He's a big geek like me! Harry Potter tattoo included.
[Have you managed any mischief with him yet? ...sorry, bad pervy joke, but I love Harry Potter.  Thank you so much for a reply.  You're energy on the show is what kept me coming back.  Congrats on the job and good luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv7gh?context=5)|HAHAHAHA! I'm so using that line!

[What was your favorite moment that didn't make it onto the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu8rb?context=5)|Oooo toughie. There was a moment when Andrew got trapped in the bathroom and I kicked in the door to get him out. A lot of good Andrew stuff didn't make it. They also didn't show the trivia challenge Regina gave us when we first met her. I'll brag and say I answered 4 correctly, I think everyone else got 2 or 3.
[What is your shoe size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytjg5?context=5)|I wear a women's size 5 shoe.

[Did you think you were the winner before it was announced?  You certainly seem to work the hardest.  What are your duties now at Comikaze?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu1n2?context=5)|I really didn't think I was going to win.

At Comikaze I will be assisting Regina. We'll all also be in a booth and we'll be doing a panel too!
[Really enjoyed watching all the geekiness in the Fortess of Fandom. Congratulations on your new gig with Komikaze -- most excellent. Now, from a fellow LotR lover: fan of the novel?  Fan (Or even aware of\) the excellent BBC radio production? Ian Holm voices Frodo and Bill Nighy is amazing as Sam. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu345?context=5)|Thanks! I read the books when I was younger, but the movies for me are such amazing visual and musical masterpieces, I wasn't obsessed with middle earth until I saw the first movie.
[If you haven't read the Game of Thrones books as I have what do you hope happens next season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyu72w?context=5)|I'm not sure! I have given up on making predictions about GOT. I just hope that Arya gets to whatever family members she has left. I also hope she exacts some revenge.
[I just wanted to say that you're beautiful and you were great on Fangasm. I thought you and Sal were awesome together and I felt bad for him during the last episode when all you guys had to leave. I do have one question: is there going to be another season of Fangasm or is the show finished?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyzun3?context=5)|Thank you very much!

I feel like thair banter would be good but Deadpool would be more inclined to fight dirty, and possibly win.
[Has anyone ever pointed out to you that if Daenerys Targaryen married Jon Snow she'd be referred to as Dani Snow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyuamu?context=5)|Ummm...actually no. WOW!

[Before I give you my question, I would like to say that you and Andrew were my favorite people on the show from the first episode until the very end, I told Andrew the same thing. My comment and question is about Doctor who, so I have been watching the show about as far back as I can remember, I stayed at my grandmothers house in the summer and weekends a lot as a kid because my mom had to work a lot, my grandmother lived out in the country and only had 11 channels, one of them being PBS and on PBS I found Tom Baker, so he was my first Doctor, I have been a fan every since, so I have a couple of questions, first who was your first Doctor?  Who are your 3 Favorite Doctors?  Who are your 3 favorite companions?  Do you have a Favorite moment in Doctor who?  Do you have a Favorite episode? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccz5r4r?context=5)|Thanks! The first Doctor I ever saw was David Tennant, he is forever my Doctor. I have only seen episodes here and there of the older series, but I really like Peter Davidson! Three fav companions would be Martha, Rory, then Rose. Favorite moment in Doctor Who is hard...David Tennant when he absorbed the radiation in Smith and Jones and expelled it into his shoe, Matt Smith shouting at spaceships from Stonehenge. Favorite episode might be The Doctor's Daughter or The Girl in the Mirror.
[Hi there! First, I know I'm late to this but I had a question I don't anyone had asked which I'll get to in a moment. Second, I really dug the show. Even with some of the editing, you guys all came off as cool and likable individuals. Congrats on the job! Third, my question. As an aspiring make-up artist, have you seen/do you watch SyFy's other reality competition show, *Face Off*?  If yes, who are you rooting for this season and would you considering going on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccz5vyy?context=5)|Thank you! I have watched SO much Face Off! Season 1 was my favorite but I learn things each season. I rooted for Tate season one, and this season, I am all Tate again. He's my favorite artist. I couldn't go on Face Off, I can paint and apply prosthetics fairly well, but I do not sculpt or mold them. I think I would be ok at sculpting and molding, but the formal training I had included far more on-set and out of kit makeups.
[Hi Dani! I absolutely loved the show - and congratulations on getting the job, you absolutely deserved it. How did Syfy go about casting Fangasm? As in, how did they find you all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyvgxu?context=5)|Thanks! I got an email from a friend almost two years ago that had a link to an appellation for a syfy show about geeks/nerds. I applied and they liked me, but it wasn't until I'd moved out here to LA that they started bringing people in for interviews. I saw about a hundred other nerds the day I went in for casting, they had a lot of interesting people.
[Are we ever going to get access to the podcasts you guys were recording during the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytt76?context=5)|Syfy has those podcasts, so it's really up to them whether they'll release them or not. 
[One more thing: Seeing you pitch your comic book idea inspired me to work on an idea of my own. Do you have any tips for developing a comic/graphic novel? Any tips for moving to LA and breaking into the business? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyulyy?context=5)|I don't really have any tips other than really look at stories (movies, books) that have elements that blow you away and use those as inspiration. What business are you trying to break into?
[Thanks! I want to develop a story (I think it would be best as a graphic novel\). Seeing the Stan Lee Fangasm episode really inspired me to go for it, so right now I'm looking into internships at comic book publishers so I can get to know the business and make some connections.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyv7sr?context=5)|Ooo, yeah I really have no idea how that works, but I do know that companies do hear pitches now and then, so write write write, and start sending the stuff to comic companies.

Do you have a favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccyur7h?context=5)|Thanks! Good question! I'm only on TOS of Star Trek, so I'm still learning about it all. I would be a human, but I'd most likely fall for a Vulcan. I do like the Vulcans haha.
[Hi there Dani! First off, congrats on getting the job!  What is your official title at Comikaze? What's it like working for Stan Lee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p533r/i_am_dani_snow_from_syfys_recent_reality_show/ccytr0b?context=5)|Thanks! I will be Regina's assistant. I haven't worked for Stan directly yet, but I just can't wait. He's the SWEETEST guy!
[Aside from LOTR and Game of Thrones ... are there any other Fantasy type series of books that you've read?

As far as sentimental value, I have a replica of the One Ring from LOtR that I used to wear on a chain to school (yeah yeah, nerd) and wearing it got the attention of a girl who is now my BEST FREIND in the world. So it's pretty special to me. I also have a Martian Manhunter collection that I love [Link to t.co](http://t.co/L3WTeapvIF)

Batman Begins is just a really cool movie, the Dark Knight is AMAZING, thank you Heath Ledger. The Dark Knight Rises...I mean it wasn't a bad movie...but it kind of messed with the Batman mythos. Tom Hardy is a great performer, but Bane wasn't as vicious as I think he should have been. Also...the whole Talia thing...and then she died. No Damien Wayne?

I have done a lot of short films, but nothing too huge. I did beauty makeup for a Reebok video and recently, 495 Productions, who shot Fangasm, had me come in and do injury makeup on a Hidden Camera show they have coming out soon.

Well I was living in Oklahoma, working at Dish Network customer service and hating it. I moved to North Carolina and lived in my parent's basement. There I decided I wanted to go to makeup school, so I moved to NYC (My boyfriend at the time was living there) and did makeup school, but I hated NYC, so when a good firned of mine who has lived in LA for the last 4 years offered to let me stay with her while I looked for work out here, I did it. Then Fangasm happened. I got lucky really, but I also had help from friends.

1p57jp,3,2013-10-24,What is the least worst time to have a year long break from CS studies?,norsul,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p57jp/what_is_the_least_worst_time_to_have_a_year_long/,"Hi guys! I would like to apologise for the rather vague title, but the issue is a little complex and requires more explanation than what I could fit into the title.

So here is some background information to explain the situation - I am a Finnish student doing a CS degree in the UK, and I intend to stay here after I graduate (I'm far from finishing my degree, I just want to start planning as soon as possible). In Finland military service is mandatory and can take up to one year to complete, however, you can choose when you are going to do it. I chose go to university before going to the army, which now seems like a mistake, but the past is the past. The CS degree structure in the UK is usually a 3-year bachelor's degree and a 1-year masters degree (masters is of course, optional, but I want to do it).

Now I can finally come to the question. I have a choice between doing my military service after the bachelor's degree and before masters, and doing the military service after I'm finished with my masters. The advantage of the first method is that it is possible to continue straight into a job, and I would imagine that employers would prioritise people who haven't spent a year doing something other than CS. The disadvantage of it is that I will miss the opportunity to do an internship between my bachelor's and masters, which seems to be the best time to be doing internships since you already have some kind of degree. The second method obviously has the opposite pros and cons - possible to do an internship before masters but would have to have a near year long gap before going for a job.

So my question is, which option do you think is the least worst? Either way I lose something valuable, I just do not know enough about the industry to know which decision is better. I should also note that in the Finnish army there is some free time during the evening and you are sent home for the weekends, so I can maintain my coding skills and such, but an employer won't know this before they allow me to get to the assessment stage."
1p4wlm,0,2013-10-24,"What is this ""passion"" for computer science?",if_ii_equals,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1p4wlm/what_is_this_passion_for_computer_science/,"I am a current computer science student and have been attending college for a little over 2 years now.  I decided to become a student, not for this passion of computer science, but that I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzled that came along with computers and that I wanted a deeper understanding of them.  I attended lectures about the computer science field, and it sounded like something could always keep my interest as a career because of the brain work and constant learning.

However, for the past few years of attending school, I've noticed that you have to have this ""passion"" for it.  I can tell my colleagues have that passion for it, but sometimes hearing about this ""passion"" too much makes me feel like I don't have it.  Prior to my studies at college of computer science, I had little knowledge of how computers completely worked, how programming actually worked and even what RAM really was.  I could however, do simple IT work, such as fix software issues, windows issues, format and build computers.  This was all self-taught, but nowhere near how much my colleagues know and how much they had taught themselves.

At this point in my life, I have nearly no time to do computer science projects.  I work and go to school full time.  I'm currently in my calculus and engineering physics series and it takes up all of my time.  I do have projects I would like to work on, such as open source programming and some hardware/sofware work with Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.  However, these projects slowly are worked on and just sit there in the back of my mind or on paper.

Now my doubts for myself come from that I have other passions in life too.  Computer science, and science in general are not the only things I enjoy.  I feel as if I have a different passion for computer science than other people.  It's one of many passions, and I truly do enjoy it, but I just don't understand this constant ""passion"" over computer science.  Sometimes I see it as kind of an obsession from some of my colleagues, and I don't ever think I would be that type of person to constantly be tinkering with computers.

So, I'm just curious, from those who work in this field, if you can explain this passion for computer science a little more.  I feel as if college has given me a skewed point of view on this.

In addition, how does a company(for jobs, internships) expect me to work on projects, attend school full time and work?  I'm confident that I would be a great employee, but I don't have the experience or knowledge others have yet."
1p4or4,2,2013-10-24,"Questions about thematics, under grad research, and grad school.",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1p4or4/questions_about_thematics_under_grad_research_and/,"Hey all!

Some background information: I am a junior engineering student, on track to graduate in may 2015.  Currently, I have a 3.73 GPA and have to start making some decisions fairly soon and I was hoping to get some opinions from fellow engineering students.


Firstly, I have to choose a thematic to focus my studies on for my senior year.  This essentially just means I will take 4 or 5 classes that focus on the areas below.  The choices are:

1. Thermo/Fluids
2. Mechanical Systems
3. Business

Now, I know I should choose whichever field interests me more, but is that really all there is to it?  How much of an effect will this decision have in my job search? Specifically, how would it be viewed to take business courses?  Do engineering firms like to see that business background, or is it looked down upon?  From the few professors I've asked, they have all pretty much told me that business is boring, and the people who choose the business thematic are the people who couldn't cut it as an engineer.  But people I've asked who are engineers tell me it would be beneficial to take the business route because they like to see that.  So, any thoughts would be helpful on the difference in the jobs I would be doing with those thematics, as well as how companies view business.


As far as plans after graduation, I had always been told by current engineers that I should just get a job right away, and the company would pay for my masters if they wanted me to have one.  However, after discussing it with my adviser and other professors, they've told me to go to graduate school, and at least get my masters, but probably also my PhD.  Thoughts on this?  How much do companies like to see a masters, and a PhD, and how large of a difference of job quality and responsibility between bachelors, masters, and PhD?  And although I'm not in this purely for the money, I am interested to hear the differences in salaries for someone with a bachelors, compared to masters and PhD.  I know it varies, but a general idea would be helpful.  


And if I were to decide I wanted to go to graduate school, it's my understanding that it is far more beneficial to have undergrad research on my resume than internships.  So should I be focusing on finding undergrad research projects for the summer instead of an internship? 


I know that's a lot of questions, but I'm really just trying to gain as much information as possible on the subjects before I make a decision.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully answer some of my questions!"

http://www.skillshare.com/classes/technology/Program-iPhone-Apps-Become-an-iPhone-Developer/461761892?discount=REDDIT97 (100% discount link)

I’ve been dabbling with iOS development since 2008 when I worked as an intern at Apple Inc. At the time I really wanted to get into iPhone development, but my assigned work was in Python, so I couldn’t.

Fast forward a year, I tried to learn in college, but RIT didn’t teach it. So I taught myself, and boy was it a struggle (even as a computer science major). I used free resources and a few books, but nothing really clicked until I sat down and coded. A lot of times it was super frustrating and I didn’t have anyone to help me. The iOS SDK was full of bugs or undocumented behaviors in Xcode. FYI: For any real beginners, the Standford iOS courses were too long and totally missed the beginner audience. (i.e. they expect programming experience... yikes!) Over the years I've submitted a handful of apps to the App Store, which has been a great learning experience.

Last year I was offered an Adjunct Professor position to teach iPhone app development at RIT. It was great, but I wanted to find other creative people like me who have ideas and struggled to put the pieces together. Programming is hard, and if you don’t have a programmer friend it can be overwhelming. It’s easy to lose motivation and stop when you hit those walls. It seems like every developer goes through these struggles, but I think it can be better.

In 2012, I started teaching on iPhone Programming on Skillshare.com because it aligned with my desire to help more people. I spent a ton of time filming, editing, and planning high quality lectures and screencasts. I think you’ll enjoy free access and if you like the course, please leave feedback.

p.s. I’m happy to help direct beginners or anyone struggling to get off the ground. Right now, I’m filming iOS 7.0/Xcode 5 materials, which will be available in November. Anyone in my current Skillshare class will get free access to the new iOS 7.0 course.

However, my second semester I got really depressed because I wasn't really making any friends and I just stayed inside all day. My grades dipped into the B's and C's. The semester after that, my depression was even worse, and I thought about killing myself almost constantly. My grades dropped into the C's and D's, not because I didn't understand the material, but because I never did any work or really went to class.

After some therapy, my grades made it back up to the B/C range, and I thought that I would start doing better again like my first semester. However now, at the start of my Junior year, I'm doing terribly. I don't really understand the material for my classes, and I've already dropped one.

So now my grades are pretty much terrible. I've got a 2.7 GPA and I don't really know how I can get it to improve. I've failed two of my midterms this semester, and had to drop one of them as a result. I can't drop the other one, and it's a major course, so that's even worse. I can feel my depression coming back again, and it scares me. I actually broke down in tears outside today behind a building where no one could see me. I feel like a wreck and I don't know how to improve.

I'm a computer science major, and I'm a pretty good programmer. I've currently got a job as a programmer at school, but I think that compaines will care that my grades are so terrible and I won't be able to get internships. I don't know if I'll be able to graduate.

Now this is starting to get long and rambly, but I guess I'll stop now. I'll clear anything up if anyone needs me to."

I am a computer science student in my sophomore year at a state college. I took some java courses in high school which allowed me to enter in one class ahead during my first semester, freshman year. In my CS2 class we learned a lot of java and i was excited for what was to come in future classes. my second semester comes and I take one course in which we got an introduction to C++. Fast forward to this semester, and none of my courses involve explicit coding at all.  

Here is my issue:  
I have not done any actual coding since last semester, as i was taking calculus courses over the summer. My coding skills are not commendable in any way. My resume as a computer scientist is pathetic to be quite honest. On top of that, my lack of coding has left me feeling that i know nothing. my schedule has not allowed me to attend any hackathons or gain any practical experience.  Bottom line, I need to get an internship for the upcoming summer but i have zero confidence in myself or my resume. I have not done nearly enough coding to consider myself a computer scientist.  

What I am asking for is some assistance as to how to get my ass in gear. I built a gaming desktop a few years ago that is running windows, which is not ideal at all for coding. I also do not own a laptop, which makes things very difficult when living in a dorm. What can I do to start shaping up? I don't know how to use github really but i do have an account and i am so terrible at setting up environments to code in, especially with the limitations of windows? Do i convert to linux? Do I dual-boot? where do i go from there? any specific languages i should learn first? Any help is greatly appreciated."

Look at /r/politics and /r/worldnews. What a mess. Everyone has an answer. No one has a question. No one wants to know more about the topic. Minds are already made up. One side evil, the other side good. Be curious. Be insightful. Understand differences.  Finally, understand there are things you can control and there are things you cannot control. You can be mad about certain things. You can want to change certain things. But understand that actions, not words, are what actually enact change.  Instead of being mad about politics. Go register people to vote. Or better, contribute positively to your community. Mad about poverty? You can bitch about Republicans. Or you can go ladle soup at a homeless shelter.

Many GOP staffers were wildly pissed that they spent two years fighting ACA and now ended up having to jump onto the DC exchanges. I think many of them took some small bit of satisfaction that -at first- they didn't have to register. A personal victory or something like that.

 |I can't tell how many times, as a legislative guy, I had to meet with some lobbyist because my boss didn't want to take the meeting.
 |Sometimes one lobbyist will come in and argue one way. Next day another comes in an argues the other.
 |We listen patiently, make sure they feel like they're heard. Sometimes they do pass along good info, like if I law could affect jobs in our district.
 |But this practice is so heavily regulated post-Abramahoff that it's neutered to the point of inanity. People still tell stories of the good old days, when the powerhouse lobbying shops would rent out Six Flags and let all Hill staffers in for free -- exclusive for staff.
 |Now staff can't even score a comped meal from them because of the regulations. Sounds like world's smallest violin, but no member in his right mind is going to change his vote because his leg assistant making $29k a year got a cheeseburger from Verizon's dude on the hill -- and the free meals was one of the ways to make a shitty, underpaid job a little more tolerable. 
[If lobbying is so ineffective, why does almost every major corporation spend millions per year on it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhn6y?context=5)|Well it's similar to law. A lobbyist represents a business to government in the same way a lawyer represents a client to court. If you're a multinational corporation, say Exxon-Mobile, you'll have representatives working with many governments.
 |They also throw a ton of money at non-profits and NGOs. I know a major energy company that funds hawkish think-tanks, dovish think-tanks, do gooders like Africa Relief and nuclear non-proliferation.
 |Having relationships is a good way to get intelligence. And if you're having a problem with a law, you absolutely need to inform Congress about it. Congress might not always listen, but it's simple reality.
 |BTW -- most lobbyists represent trade industries, groups of mid and small sized businesses that represent their larger interests to Congress (think agriculture, infrastructure, aerospace, etc). The whales are few and far between.
 |You would be AMAZED at how many environmental and global warming ads are sponsored by BP, Shell, etc.

Fox News is partisan in their coverage, but their Hill producer has been around for years and is one of the best shoe-leather journalists in the business. He presses both sides hard, and has a knack for asking your boss the one question you didn't want asked.
 |Any outlet with a good Congressional reporter is high quality. I'd say The Hill, CQ, National Journal are some of the best -- they have a strong presence and are always snooping around hearings and talking to members and staff.
 |Stay away from blogs and opinion rags like Mother Jones, National Review, and ABSOLUTELY avoid the garbage they up vote in /r/politics, The Contributor and PoliticsUSA. Those guys don't have a clue and are just telling you what to think, rather than what is actually happening.

First let me say that I think that more veterans need to run.
 |If you are a Republican or Democrat, first find the PACs that specialize in running veterans. Democrats have really made an effort at this in recent years.
 |They will give you seed money to run if they think you're a quality candidate. Make as many connections as you can at church, rotary club, key club, American legion, VFW, and with local business leaders. Let them know you're a good guy and care about Tennessee-7.
 |I would, however, recommend playing the long game if you live in Blackburn's district. Republicans and Democrats love her, she's well funded and very savvy political. Very difficult to dislodge. Wait until she retires, and then spring your trap.

Does a degree from Harvard automatically make you more appealing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczjcj7?context=5)|Very little. The staff that advance are the ones that bust their ass, stay late until voting is finished for the night, and work well with their coworkers and constituents.
 |Many staffers are children of donors. Sometimes, not always, these types can be entitled little shits and end up going nowhere.
 |It's the guy who walks down the hall, knocking on doors, asking to intern for free that eventually ends up as a legislative director or even chief of staff. The ones with the real passion for legislating show that in their work. And they usually go far.

 |And yes, my current job is related to politics --not lobbying-- and is more lucrative. I want to make money and get out of this business as soon as it's financially feasible.
[I volunteered on my local congressman's successful campaign and interned for a semester of his freshman term. The money I was offered to work full-time in DC was pitiful to say the least. Judging by your comment on the $29k staffer, I take it this isn't uncommon.  I consider myself pretty innovative at finding solutions, but no way in hell can I figure out how someone can survive on $29k in DC working 50+ hours a week. I had to refuse the offer, which in hindsight I'm glad I did because he has turned out to be someone completely different than the humble state senator we knew before he hopped aboard the Tea Party express.  So two questions: how did you make it on such low pay in such an expensive city and what sort of stories can you tell of staffers who fall out of sync with their bosses? Did they grin and bear it? Jump ship and attempt to start over with someone else? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczoht2?context=5)|Well I'm unique in a couple of ways. I was transitioning military. My first job was at $50k a year which isn't bad. Then I moved to a committee, and -as I'm sure you know-- committee staffers do pretty well. I made a little over six figures doing that gig.
 |Then I took a pay cut to do a Presidential campaign, then I went back to the Hill.
 |So living paycheck to paycheck? Well, it was tough to do as a 2Lt living in California. By the time I got to DC, I was ok.

Then it spun off the planet.
 |But if you go into McCarthy's office (House whip), the set for Kevin Spacey's (House whip) office is almost dead on.
 |Some of the other plot points were really impressive. Zoe Barnes as a new media journalist going on tv against her old-school boss' wishes, jumping to a new Buzzfeed style outlet.

[Have you ever lost a friendship or broken up with someone because of their politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczhjok?context=5)|Definitely not. Never, never, never let politics hurt your personal relationships.
 |I'm great friends with staffers across the aisle. We rip on each other, kind of like a Dallas fan rips on a Washington fan, but it's always cordial.
 |In many cases, we work with the opposite party on bipartisan issues. National Security is a big one, so is veterans affairs.
 |And never assume someone is a bad person just because their politics differ from yours. No one, *no one*, looks at an issue and thinks ""how can I be the most evil Fuck possible here?"" But both sides characterize opposing issues exactly like that.
[If I wanted to start a career in politics, it best to get your masters degree or just go volunteer for a campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1p7c2t/iaman_excongressional_staffer_ive_spent_years/cczgifd?context=5)|A JD is more valuable than a masters I think. Lawyers are all over the hill and in the executive branch. They do policy and some even do communications. Some do law stuff, like consul work.
 |Volunteering on a campaign is something you should absolutely do in college or even younger. Go knock on doors for your guy/gal -- learn how the process works. You could be a career campaign staffer, which can be lucrative, or go into a Congressional office and do legislative work from there. That doesn't require higher than a Bachelor's.

 |Always tell folks, forget going $100k in debt for your masters degree. Get your military commission. It will do far more for your career than a scrap of sheepskin.
 |That said, service isn't for everyone. You need to volunteer with a campaign (2014 is coming up, we're in an election year as of next week). Then intern on the hill. If you can't get an internship, march around hill offices and meet people and offer to intern for them in person.

It's my sense that their refusal to compromise has been a negative influence on Congress.  Constituent calls do matter. An individual one, probably not. But they keep track of the issues. If 100 constituents called them in a day about an issue, it's something they take seriously. Most recent example I can think of was the authorization for military force against Syria -- many very unhappy constituents about that. Fortunately the vote never happened.

1p7xqi,7,2013-10-25,What should I focus on as new CS student?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p7xqi/what_should_i_focus_on_as_new_cs_student/,"Hey, I've started my degre just a month ago, and I'd like to know what do you think I should focus the most on, because there is just so many things and so little time to master them all. I will be doing a 5 year master degree program as it is pretty standard in my country (Poland).

My goal is to score internship at a big company, preferably in USA. I'll try to do it after my 2nd year at uni, as it is when I'll have done my algorithms and data structures class.

Up to that point I'll have taken:
Calc 1,2 

Discrete math

Linear algebra, abstract algebra

logic and formal structures

probabilistic methods and statistics

introduction to cs (mostly easy programs in C or pseudocode)

programming course

physics course

programming technologies

data bases and operation systems

architecture of operation systems

networking technologies

algorithms and data structures class


Now in 4th semester I'll be able to freely choose 2 CS course (that will be concurrent programming and alternative paradigms as /u/PasswordIsntHAMSTER suggested)  and 1 math course - there is a lot of options, so feedback on what would be the most important would be greatly appreciated aswell.

I have been waiting long to make this post and I hope redditors who have experience in moving/working in Netherlands can help me!

I am currently studying Master Degree in Finance and Accouting in Poland. My speciality is Business Evaluation. I have very good knowledge of controlling, managerial accounting, risk management. I also studied in Finland as a part of student exchange programme. I am fluent with Basware, know a little of SAP and very good with MS excel.

I have 1 year working experience in a company which has its accounting centre located in Poland. So basically I book/keep accounts for Dutch invoices/costs and according to Dutch standards.
It should count as normal working experience in Netherlands.

I am fluent Dutch and English speaker. I want to move to Netherlands (or in worst case Belgium :)) next year in june, after I graduate, cannot stay in Poland. I am making this post here because I see so many successful stories and I hope if you could do it I can also. 

Problem is honestly I have no idea where to start. Where do I look for jobs related to finance/accounting. How do I look for a job in Netherlands in general? Is it a problem for Dutch people that I did not finish my degree in Netherlands? Accounting standards in Europe are basically the same, plus I know the rules from my work. Also other jobs related to finance such as business evaluation for example, are using the same methods worldwide so I guess it would be less problematic for differences in education, or at least I hope. I will try to transfer from my company but I know they have no open vacancies now :(.

I will also try to register from AIESEC but I know there is not that much internships in Netherlands/Belgium. Or maybe people who went with AIESEC - can you give any tips?

Please kind redittors help me/give me guidance. I know if I stay in Poland too long after I graduate I won't be able to handle it. I don't want to say bad things about my country but staying here fuels my depression and I am desperate to get out. 

Thank you in advance for reading it and helping :)

1p7hl5,43,2013-10-25,My internship is going terribly,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p7hl5/my_internship_is_going_terribly/,"I got an internship at a multinational tech company which is 1 year long. The team I am in has a high pressure job and as a result people carry a lot of responsibility and therefore often a lot of blame.

The thing is I am very good at computer science but since I have arrived I have been drip fed training and had absolutely no trust or responsibility given to me despite my enthusiasm and work ethic. I am not sure why my team hired an intern as I clearly just get in the way, which I have told them. In response they say that just because they are busy/under pressure I am absolutely welcome to ask questions and shadow them, but when it actually gets down to it they just shut me out.

I am becoming really depressed and would quit if I had any feasible alternative that wouldn't absolutely screw up prospects for future jobs.

The worst part is I don't really know if I am expecting something realistic or not, I thought I would get there, they would train me to do a job and I would do it, but in reality the hardest part of my job is forcing myself to try and integrate with these people and getting some work to do.

I've already told my manager that I am not getting anywhere near the same training a regular employee gets so now I am getting 1 hour a week but it just feels like charity and I am becoming more and more alienated from everyone else (who are all at least 10 years older)

Internships are meant to put you in a better position in your career, this is so disappointing.

EDIT:

Didn't expect so many replies, so I'll just do a general one.

In retrospect of your comments I guess my attitude needs to change. My confidence is pretty damn low at the moment but I'll need to take the humility up another level (ok they are not the same thing but they correlate). When people told me about internships at this place the line ""they treat you like a regular employee"" came up a lot. Well my experience isn't what I thought it would be like and I have to come to terms with it.

For those of you who think I am being a childish asshole you're mostly wrong. I do have a lot of growing up to do though and that is probably why I am having such a tough time. It's good to hear that a lot of people relate to this situation though, I guess it's just a part of life."

1p65xd,17,2013-10-24,"[Rant / Advice] So I have been interviewing for an intern lately, my findings and advice.",Maleus21,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1p65xd/rant_advice_so_i_have_been_interviewing_for_an/,"First let me say that I am not an HR person. I am a Systems Administrator,so this isn't geared toward ""the magic sentence that will get you an interview"". That being said, when I finally got approval for an intern (basic help desk position, with potential for higher level projects and exposure to multiple types of technology) I drooled. I felt like if I were looking to get my foot in the door, this would be great, so I was excited about giving someone an opportunity that I greatly desired just a few short years ago. 

So here is the position: Primary role: end user support. Secondary: back up to the sys admin. environment: Windows domain, 50% mac/windows, some linux administration if you can prove your worth. Seemingly very simple, and the possibility for some great experience.  

We got some resumes in from the local universities, I sent some emails out to some mailing lists asking for referrals, and got a decent amount of resumes. They obviously aren't great, but for what we are needing, I just wanted some level of technical ability (doesn't need to be professional experience) and a good attitude, which apparently is a tall order. 

So after a mountain of interviews, here are my recommendations for anyone that is looking to interview for a somewhat technical position.

1. This may seem basic, but read your own resume. Do not type it up, and see there are no little red squiggly lines, and feel it is ok. I saw at least 3 applicants that had incomplete phone numbers, and email addresses on their resume. If you don't have enough attention to detail to make sure I can give you the job, it makes me weary of turning you loose on my network. 

2. Do not exaggerate your resume. I understand you feel you need to add that you are an experienced Active Directory wizard to your resume because you watched a youtube video. But when I ask you a basic question (such as how to change a users password) and you stare at me like a deer in headlights, it shows me you have never touched it. If you want to add it, then set it up at home. Use a VM, go to dreamspark.com and set it up. THAT is initiative, and would have bumped many applicants to the short list instantly, its a single weekend of your time. Which brings me to my next point...

3. Do some things on your own! I asked every applicant if they have any personal non-professional items they want to add. Anything from installing linux as a VM, to setting up a LAN party at their friends house. Only one single person was able to give me something. Personal experience counts. It shows desire to learn on your own. It shows you are not afraid of something breaking, because you have the confidence to fix it. And it shows that you spend your free time learning instead of just surfing Facebook and twitter. 

4. Learn the command line people! I know I will get some backlash for this, but I feel it is important. I don't care if its Windows, OSX or Linux. Open that terminal prompt and learn how to navigate in it. Learn to find your IP address, and what the basic commands are. If you want something even remotely technical, it is a needed skill in my opinion. 

5. Study. I told every applicant that there would be a small technical portion of the interview. I even told them the subjects I would be asking about. And for that very reason, I set each applicant's interview a week away to give them time to study up. I felt like I was handing it away, and was worried my technical questions were to easy. I even asked others if the information I was wanting was considered to advanced for the position, but was told I will probably need to toughen up and have 2nd interviews. Well, not a single person made it all the way through them. So, if you have an interview for a technical spot, and they tell you what you are being quizzed on, take some time and look that info up. Just get the basics down at least. 

Anyway, I know this was long, and I apologize. Although almost everyone in this subreddit will not need this info, you may find some of it useful for someone you know, so pass it along to them. I would suggest adding anything that I left out. 

And no, I still haven't found my intern. Are there no real geeks left in the world?"
1p60r6,4,2013-10-24,"first full time job without a degree, in SF",onetimeaccnt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1p60r6/first_full_time_job_without_a_degree_in_sf/,"I have been attending a state school for a CS degree, but been pervasively disappointed with the curriculum. I have learned *nothing* from school, and had an unhappy time there. This lead to me disregarding my work there, and after failing several classes, I dropped out. Luckily, I love what I do, and I spent the time mostly teaching myself. I interned with a tiny, but successful startup (~10 employees, ~4 million users), from which I have learned a tremendous amount. After the first summer, they asked me to continue on a contract basis. I then had a ""second internship"" with them the following summer, and have continued contracting with them since. One incredible perk with my work there is that the majority of my work has been open source, which combined with some personal projects, has given me a well-off github account with about ~1800 commits in the past two years. I have also lead two major integrations with other very well known companies.

I have nothing but good words for the company I am working for, but they will not consider me for full time employment. I make enough to get by part-time, but have been living paycheck to paycheck. Meanwhile, I've gotten a number of contacts from other companies (I have not been actively searching, but answer anything that comes my way). Several days ago, I had a final interview with a company in San Francisco. I was asked what salary range I was looking for, and I was not confident. I answered 70k, and got a strange look, and an offer for 75. Meanwhile, I am mid-interview-process with 3 other companies whom I have let know I need an answer within the week. 

The big thing here is that I don't really like any of the companies I am talking to. I do believe that I can learn a lot at them, but I won't really be happy doing that type of work. But I need the money - soon I will need to start repaying my student loans.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking here. I think I sold myself short with the first company, but I feel it is very important to have my first ""real"" job sans degree. I'm also worried about ending my relationship with my current company on a good note. I will be asking for 90k from the other companies I am speaking to if it reaches that point. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice.

Thank you!

1pa3jx,49,2013-10-26,Something Strange is Going On in Clearview...,SebasV96,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pa3jx/something_strange_is_going_on_in_clearview/,"They've erased us off the map, and I think I know why.

I don't know what is going on, but I do know that whatever it is is enough for the US government to take us off the map and keep us some sort of secret.

I'm from Clearview, a small, out-of-the-way, idyllic town you have probably never heard of. We USED to be located in northern North Carolina, yet we've literally just disappeared off the map.

I suppose it really all started two months ago with Mrs. Leverett. She was an old widow, almost Victorian in manners, uptight, proper; she used to sit outside of her tiny little cottage in the poorer section of town, rocking aimlessly and mumbling about ""the war"" (although she never specified which one). Everyone in town accepted the fact that she was crazy, although at times she seemed perfectly clear and coherent. Then came her suicide, and things began to get weird. 

Mrs. Leverett was a weak and extremely old woman, at least ninety and unable to move without her wheelchair or the help of her nephew, Edgar. Yet somehow, the local authorities were convinced that she had somehow moved a huge, heavy armchair from the living room into her bedroom, stood on it, swung a noose over a support beam, and somehow kicked the 80 pound chair over (despite the fact that Mrs. Leverett was probably eighty pounds herself) to kill herself. 

I guess I should tell you how I know about this. My father is a local doctor, and he was called to the scene to investigate the body. The call came in from Mrs, leverett's nephew, the odd, awkward middle-aged Edgar. My father spoke to me about how weird the case was, and how he suspected someone (maybe Edgar) had to have played a role, yet the inspector and his sergeant both disagreed and noted it as a definite suicide. Case closed. 

Then things got weird. Edgar Leverett, the old widow's nephew, started wandering around the streets of the city. In fact, the whole house fell to ruin: he started ignoring it completely. He never went inside. He grew emaciated and gnarled, yet he was such a strange, odd man no one cared, everyone ignored him. He wandered around the neighborhoods, scaring children and mumbling to himself. He stopped speaking English--he started talking in what sounded like Latin, but people usually stayed away so no one really knew for sure. Eentually, people started calling the police about him, and he just went into the woods around the suburbs of the town.

Eventually, Edgar killed himself. I remember that day well: I like to sit outside to read, especially since my backyard looks out into the woodland everything is so calm and serene. I heard screaming--shrill, girlish screaming. A little girl who I semi-recognized (was it Amanda or Samantha?) was running out of the woods, crying and shrieking. I got her inside and my mother called her mother, and the whole time the little girl cried about finding a corpse. Police were sent out into the area, and they uncovered Edgar's body. The creepiest part, my father told me, was that it had been chewed and bit and torn apart--but not by an animal. A human being had done this. 

The town hushed it up. 

Then Amanda fell sick. Everyone attributed it to the shock of finding a corpse in such a condition, considering she was no older than nine. Her mother came to ask me what she had been like when she found the body, etc, and told me that the girl had just laid down and stayed there, motionless, terrified. 

Eventually Amanda Hammond was admitted into a hospital. She died about a month ago, and in a very strange way, too. She just died, and no one had figured out how. Her mother had been in the room at the time, yet she couldn't say anything--ever again. She refused to speak. She stared blankly ahead of her and refused to answer any questions from the police, my father, or other doctors. 

Mrs. Hammond shot herself a few days later. The gun was hanging from the roof with a string attatched to the trigger, yet my father knew it was ridiculous to imagine that someone could pull a gun's trigger with a piece of string and have it enter the right temple perfectly. Eeriest of all, there was no blood anywhere except the wound and the gun--the blood being the bloody fingerprints of Mrs. Hammond. 

The first real sign for me, though, that this was not only weird but quite possibly entirely supernatural, came when I got an internship working with Rufus Ferguson, the head of Clearview's sewage department and a powerful political figure in town. While I was organizing his agenda, I got snoopy, and started prying into his private life, and I noticed one unusual detail. 

Mr. Ferguson had evidently been having an affair with none other than Celia Hammond, Amanda's mother! This explained his change in mood, his grief, yet there was more to this than just silly neighborhood gossip. On the day of her suicide, he had planned a ""visit"" to her for 4:30 PM, and probably kept it. That would mean something very creepy, because according to the medical evidence, Celia Hammond had been dead since three in the afternoon, meaning that Rufus Ferguson had not seen his lover but rather her corpse. That's when I noticed a pattern.

Old Mrs. Leverett was crazy. Then, one day, she killed herself, and the first person to see her corpse was Edgar Leverett. Then, Edgar went completely insane, prowling around town mumbling and sputtering. Then he himself was killed. Amanda Hammond was the first person to see his corpse. Then, Amanda fell into a comatose state and died under her mother's care, meaning that Celia Hammond was the first to see Amanda's corpse. Then Celia Hammond loses it completely: she can't speak, can't talk, ignores everyone around her and stumbles about blindly. Then, she shoots herself. The first person to see her corpse was Rufus Ferguson, and now Mr. Ferguson had sunk into a deep depression. 

I quit working for Mr. Ferguson right there and then, knowing what would happen if he killed himself in his office and I stumbled upon his body. Sure enough, my successor--a kid in my grade named Daniel--found him in his office. He had hanged himself with a rope made of several ties--again, a complicated, improbable, and weak suicide. 

As if this wasn't all creepy enough, Clearview has now been completely erased from all maps. I can't find it anywhere. 

I have no idea what's going on, but whatever it is can't be good. I have to figure out if Mrs. Leverett witnessed any death, since she was also ""crazy."" Some kind of chain is going on here, and I can't explain but I will discover it. 

I'm going to try and get to the bottom of this, and if/when I do, I will try to update. "

If you get this, I am working at the radio station outside Maidstone, Alaska.  It's a small town, there's only one station.  I'm just an intern, I keep the station open at night--they let me do a show and I can put it on my resume.

About a week ago I was in the station doing my show, and had wrapped up for the night.  I shut off all my equipment, and set up the computer to play enough music on its own to last until the daytime folks showed up.  But when I tried to leave, the door to the building was locked.

I tried using my key and it didn't work.  I tried every other door in the station--locked.  So were the windows.  My phone didn't get any reception, and neither did the station's landline.  At that point I was more annoyed than scared, and decided to just wait for my daytime counterpart to let me out.

They never showed up.  I was starting to get freaked out, so later in the day I got on the radio.  I figured somebody had to be listening, and it was the closest thing I had to calling 911.  But, when I tried to use the microphone, the only thing I heard in my headphones was static.  No matter how I adjusted it, nothing got transmitted.  I was speaking into the void.

By this point I was freaking out, but I still thought I could get out.  I tried breaking open the windows, but they're all too small or too high for me to use.  I tried breaking down the door, and that didn't work either.  I went at the front door with a chair for more than an hour.  The chair broke.  I don't think the door even dented.

By the first night, I was exhausted, and starting to get hysterical.  The last thing on my mind was my job.  So, when it got to 10:00, there was no way I was going to worry about starting my scheduled radio program.

I didn't have to worry about it, though.  It started without me.

There was a crackle of static, broadcast on speakers throughout the whole building.  No matter where I go, I can hear it.  My program started without me.  Songs get played--weird ones, ones I would get fired for using.  And then there are comments.  In my voice.

I can hear myself talking on the radio, saying things I never said.

I ran to the recording room, the one where I normally do my shows, but the door was locked.  I didn't hear anyone talking inside, but my voice kept playing on the speakers throughout the building--and I guess on the radios outside.  To the rest of the world, I was doing my show like normal.  I was the only who knew that it wasn't me behind the microphone.

I've been in the station for almost a week now.  I broke open a vending machine for food, though I'm getting sick of potato chips.  There's still water running in the sinks.  I'm not too worried about sustenance--but I am worried about the voice.

It's started talking to me between shows now.  In my voice.  During the day it will whisper, throughout the whole station.  I can't tell what it's saying, but it's my voice.  It isn't right.  It's not me, but it sounds like me.  I don't understand it.

I was able to get on one of the station computers in another booth.  It seems to be working--but so did the radio equipment, so I don't know if this will ever get through.  Either way, this is my last attempt to contact the outside world.

On the way here, I had to pass the door to my recording booth--I've been avoiding it since that first night.  Today, though, it was cracked open.  I was too afraid to look inside, but now I don't think I have any choice.  The voice has been calling to me.  It knows where I am.

After I write this, I'm going to go through the door.  I need to find the thing that's been using my voice.  It's almost time for my show to start.

Showtime."

I recently started my CS degree at Newcastle University after being rejected from Glasgow because of my chemistry degree (international student, weird acceptance criteria). While I'm happy with my course and the way it is structured I'm concerned as to whether Newcastle uni is prestigious enough to garner an interview at a big game-changing company (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft)


Just to add I know JUST a degree isn't going to ensure me anything. I'm first year but I'm planning a spring few day internships, applying for summer internships, looking for undergraduate research assistant spots and just reading programming books to just develop my own knowledge of the field. (anything that will make me a better developer and that will look good on a CV) Also I know I probably sound a bit naive (hur,dur, I wanna work for Google), but, hey, I'm young so bare with me.  


So, my question is will my university degree hold me back when looking for a job/internship/placement (I'm on a sandwich course, so I have to organize it next year)? Any other advice would be much appreciated. "
1pcg67,1,2013-10-27,What should I do for the future-- Film? Engineering?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pcg67/what_should_i_do_for_the_future_film_engineering/,"I went to one of the top schools in the country-- for science and engineering. I decided to major in film during my junior year and didn't really get the chance to do many internships. I left, moved to Los Angeles, and am barely making a living. I haven't got a job in the industry (I've been out here coming on 3 years) and I feel mentally beat down. I work 40-80 hours a week and can barely survive. I have lost the motivation I originally came with-- I rarely write screenplays and I haven't made a short film in the 3 years since I've moved to Los Angeles. 

I'm not sure what I should do. I see most of my friends from college being ridiculously successful (making six figures, going to great grad schools, etc) and I'm envious. I'm not sure if I can get my motivation back to get in film or if I should give up. I can't see myself being happy doing anything else (sometimes doing anything at all), but I don't want to be broke forever. 

I was told that I could return to my school and major in Computer Engineering. I don't really want to leave Los Angeles, as I have a wonderful boyfriend, but as it would be temporary, I could do it. I've also looked at schools in LA, but none of the local schools offer a second bachelors, which I've been told is needed when moving from art to engineering. I also would have to take math and science classes, which I haven't taken since I was 20, as well as getting back into the school thing in general. I did take through Calculus 2, though, so my school would want me to start with Calc 3 as well. 

I know engineering is more profitable and I have always loved computers. My mother used to build computers during my childhood, and I do have a fascination with gadgets, though I've never built any. 

I do like the idea of a structured work schedule and being to support myself comfortably but some part of me wonders if I'm giving up too soon or if I'm already a failure, I guess. I'm 24 years old and I feel like I don't have the first step towards any career. I just don't want to be a failure and I don't want to spend the rest of my life regretting not going into film or not going back to school. Or

:/

TL;DR: I'm losing motivation for film and wondering if I should go back to school for engineering. "

1pay8b,1,2013-10-27,[Serious] What things do I need to know before I start considering getting a PHD (after getting my MPH a few months ago)?,brighterdaze,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pay8b/serious_what_things_do_i_need_to_know_before_i/,"I graduated in August of this year with my Master of Public Health in Florida. My undergraduate degree is from another university in Florida,completed in 2009, and is in education. 

I was just talking to a good friend of mine (who coincidentally was the same friend I talked to and who encouraged me about going back to school for my Master's like 2 years ago). He recently finished his PHD in Biomedical Engineering and is now an AP at a decent school in Florida.  He was able to fill some gaps of understanding I have had about the Doctorate process and also served as a major help for applying to grad school when I went forward with it in 2011. 

I am from an uneducated/poor family background and it took a long time for me to get a grasp on how these degrees work, how the processes work and what exactly they mean. For instance, when I graduated high school I thought that if you didn't have good grades you could never get into a University. I didn't know until a few months at a community college that I could transfer to a U. This is how little I knew and so I am genuinely asking what other PHD/Doctoral students can tell me to point me in the right direction if I decide to make the choice to go back to school, yet again.My understanding of college and grad school are obviously a *little* (haha) better than they were now but I still feel like I don't know anything about all of this. What should I know before I start setting my sights on this goal? I am not 100% sure yet that this is something I will move forward with but I am trying to gather as much information I can about it to make the right decision for me.

**Some additional info about me that might help your advice to me**

**My passion:**
Due to a lot of my family history I am very interested in research in the RX addiction field. I developed a RX prevention program for my university as my graduate internship over this past summer. The program consisted of doing a complete literature review on youth/college age non-medical prescription drug use (NMPDU). I used this information to develop educational and evidence-based presentations and strategies to target this issue. I live, eat and breathe this stuff as it's is something that has affected me in various ways and I feel like I have the passion to really build something there.

**Current situation:**

I am starting a decent ""adult"" job in public health in a few days, which will be my first career-related job. My work history isn't that impressive (nanny for an NFL player doesn't exactly do anything for my resume, even though I wish I could add I took the job because the pay was great and it helped me pay my bills through school). I have some other random job experience (real estate data company 2+ years fulfilling a number of roles in a few different positions). I am currently volunteering for a breast cancer support organization as well as another social service organization that focuses on victim advocacy. 



My husband is military and wherever we end up March will be where we stay for 4 years. This obviously plays a HUGE role in what my plans are and so I am having to really use the next months to determine exactly what I can do if I decide to go forward with my PHD. I am 26, have a few more years that I would be willing to wait to start a family and so getting a PHD and getting situated shouldn't interfere as long as I get through the program within a reasonable amount of time.



**With that wall-o-text I seriously hope you're not asleep on your keyboard and that you might have a word or two of advice for me.**

**Where do I start? What questions do I need to ask myself about this to determine if I can do it? What precautions do I need to take? *Are the only PHDs worth earning the ones that you don't go into debt for?* , How do I know I have what it takes? How did you know? What was your experience?**

I appreciate any serious feedback that you guys have. I feel like a professional student. And I love learning. My background and feelings of lack of knowledge and experience brings me down a few notches and I don't always believe in myself. Helping me realize whether I have the potential or not would truly help me move forward in whatever direction is right for me.

**Sorry if this is jumbled and nonsensical, I should've been in bed hours ago but now I am thinking about school again and here we go again**

TL;DR: Recent MPH grad needs your advice on whether or not a PHD is for her, and what she can do to decide on that.

In the great state of California, we have the finest collegiate educational system in the world.  With our UC (University of California), CSU (California State University), and CCC (Caifornia Community College) systems , we provide top notch educational opportunities.  Also, our Computer Science programs in our schools are among the worlds best.

I want to leverage our educational system to help California redefine our interal Active Directory infrastructure for our schools.  Today, our schools independently create Active Directory domains which are not connected.  Therefore, we as a state loose opportunities to share valulable resources for students.  To combat this, I am accepting proposals for an Active Directory design which links all of our collegiate school system together.

All porposals must clearly show AD forest(s) and account for each of the different school systems.  They can be geographical, per system, or combinations of both.  There might be other logical seperations which are innovative and make sense.  Any separate Organizational Units must also be identified.  Exact numbers (especially with community colleges) are not needed but groups of schools must be clearly identified.

Proposals can be from single individuals or teams (up to three members).  Winning entries will get school credit and fly to Sacramento to meet with our IT team.  Winning teams or individuals will also have summer intern opportunities for further design or possible implementation of the design.

We need all entries by Oct 22nd at 6:00 PM in room 1432 at NVC in beautiful Napa.

Good luck!

Governor Jerry Brown""

1pfaid,1,2013-10-28,"My girlfriend of a few years didn't get her ""dream job"" and is now super depressed. What can I say / do to make her feel better?",Overheadsprinkler,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pfaid/my_girlfriend_of_a_few_years_didnt_get_her_dream/,"So my girlfriend of a few years has a long history of depression, sometime bi-polar issues, has contemplated suicide, has been on anti-depressants and has been to therapists. I've helped pull her up and she's been in a much better place since she and I met. She's told me that I am what keeps her going, and I love her very much and would do anything for her. But now... she's spiraling downward, and I don't know where to turn. So I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

**The setup:**

About a year ago, she took a year-long internship at her ""dream job"" on the other side of the country. After several months of doing long distance, I packed up and decided to relocate and join her. She and I both left our jobs back home, along with our family and friends, to try something new and exciting. And while the first few months were hard on both of us while we settled in, I found a great new job while she loved interning with her ""dream"" company.

**The problem:**

As the internship came to a close, she interviewed for a full-time position. There were quite a few other interns applying for the same position, and she felt like she ""bombed"" the interview (which for her, is surprising because she's so good with people). She just found out that she wasn't offered the position, and has hit a depression I've never seen her in.

The first reaction was crying. She bawled into my arms, and still does when she thinks about it. There are times when she just lays there, in silence, staring at nothing. Then there are times where she will get extremely angry, yelling at me for even trying to give her words of advice. She then goes back to crying, or laying in bed in the dark for hours, it seems.

**A little more info:**

Her whole reason to move here was to work for this company. This company specializes in a very particular market, one which doesn't have many competitors (or at least, doesn't have many competitors that do as 'good' of a job as this company). She misses her family and friends back home constantly, and she hears about all their good news all the time (""Soandso got a new job!"" or ""Soandso got engaged!""). Even I recently got a great new job at a company I really admire.

She feels like moving here was a mistake. She feels like she's let everyone down (including me), by having us move here and leave everything and everyone behind. She feels incredibly alone, even when I go to console her. And I feel terrible because I simply don't know what to say.

**What I need from you, Reddit:**

I need to know what to say or do in this situation. Regardless if moving here for her ""dream job"" was a good or bad decision, I need to know what to tell her. What should I do? How can I lift her spirits and give her confidence? I want her to feel like there's always another way to reach her dreams, even if it isn't with this company. *(Note: I did just find that there are some part-time jobs her ""dream"" company offers, so I could pitch that idea to her. But they pay significantly less and don't have much in the way of benefits.)*

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

-----

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I moved across the country for an internship with her ""dream job."" Meanwhile, all her friends got hired at great new jobs (even I got hired by a great company). So my girlfriend also wants to be a part of everyone's good news, and make her friends and family proud. Her internship with Dream Co. ended, she interviewed for a full-time slot, and didn't get it. Now she feels like crap for having moved all the way here, only to not get the job she was so passionate about. She feels like she's let everyone down and has made a big mistake by betting everything on this. Regardless if that is true, what can I say or do to help her?

I think everyone is still proud of her, I know I am. But what else can I do or say to cheer her up?

Thanks."

I am very sure of my abilities to manage, organize, initiate, and accomplish a lot by working efficiently when it comes to non-coding tasks or projects... but I want to go into software engineering. I want to pursue a technical career not because of money, pride, or title, but because I am truly interested in building and its use to serve others. However, I am very self-conscious when it comes to my cs skills… to the point where I want to do companies a favor and not work for them as a software engineer because there are plenty of better coder than me.

My success rate in finding my first full time software position has been 0%. I also applied to other technical positions--from build engineer to project manager--but none of them worked out. I’ve interviewed with so, so, so many companies and teams, but I froze and failed each interview. I must be a shame to my school's cs program and previous employers (for my internships). I want to comfort myself by thinking, “I don’t do well in interviews, and they can’t even accurately measure someone’s skills and potential anyway,” but I would be choosing to be blind to my inadequacy. I should have been able to answer all those questions if I really knew my CS. These coding questions are asked under pressure for a reason. Is it time I stop trying to be what it seems like I am not meant to be? Should I stop clinging onto my dreams so tightly?

I'll be moving in from out of town for the summer. I have heard loads of good things about Epic, namely that the campus is fantastic and they are one of the industry leaders in HealthIT. However, I have heard a few negative things too, such as the high turnover rate, the sometimes unreasonable hours, and the lack of industry standards in some aspects of their systems (cache, Visual Basic). I think some of the negatives won't apply to me as I'll only be there for the summer. Can anyone provide any additional input or comment on what I've said? Much appreciated"

Some background info is in order though. I have two B.A in Sociology and Political Science and little previous work experience. My work experience includes customer service type jobs and two stints in a book bindery. I regret not using my time wisely and not taking part in an internship; I tell every college student this now. This has led me to my current predicament. 


I have been applying for both temporary get on my feet jobs and more career oriented jobs. I get interviews for the temporary jobs and no call backs from the career jobs. I am noticing that with regards to the “jobs” a common question of theirs is my holding of two degrees and my commitment to staying with them. Without any type of feedback from the “career” type positions, my best guess is that I am either automatically screened out of the position by the application software or by a person given my lack of experience. 


While I know I am qualified for the positions or willing to give them a commitment if I am able to move up it seems I am unable to convey this in a manner to assuage their misgivings. I am happy to prove myself and start work at the bottom. I just need a chance at the opportunity at this point. With the “career” type positions I would be happy to get an in-person interview at this point to boost my moral a little. 


The question is how best can I address this situation, and what steps do I need to take in order to achieve my goal of meaningful employment?


On a related note, how best can I inform them of my informal computer experience? To illustrate, I only took a single Computer Science class in College, and yet I have looked into/learned about setting up a Windows Domain when I lived alone. I thought it would be fun and a cool thing to do. I still want to do it, so I still think it would be fun I just need the money to build a server since I would probably try and go with TurnKey Domain Controller.

Finally got around to building a computer (which I've wanted to do for six years now) now that I've got a paid internship and thus, some spending money. I was convinced to buy the unlocked i5 by /r/buildapc but at the moment it's running at the motherboard's automatic 4.0 Ghz overclock (I'll give manually tuning it a try next weekend).

I'm really happy about the 7950's performance - I've got it overclocked to 1045MHz and it's still running cool and stable. Unfortunately they'll probably be impossible to find when I try to crossfire in a year or two but one of the benefits of going to AMD is that I'll be able to throw in a 280x and they should work together without giving me any problems. 

Only trouble I ran into was an improperly formatted Windows install the first time, so I had to repeat the process (and redownload everything) the next day.

I graduated from college 3 years ago, and though I was an Electronics major, I went into a start up in the power/energy sector in Asia. I came back to the US a few months ago and want to switch to a programming career. I'm brushing up on my Java and trying to make a small web app using Ruby on Rails. I don't have a Github. I have had  2 internships in college in IT but it has mostly been QA/System Testing/UAT Testing, and I worked on some Visual Basic code with one of the managers and run MS Access queries with another manager. But I barely remember what I did in these internships it was 5 years ago. I am trying to look up any code/details I have from those internships so I can talk about them more, because whatever phone interviews I have had they have asked about it. 

I'm don't want a front end job, I want to work back-end. I don't think I could even get a full on front end job anyways since I have no experience in that apart from writing some very basic html/css. I have had one interview for an entry level position where I feel I did decently well, but they also asked really simple questions. 

**My question is, what should I be doing to learn and showcase what I've learnt, and is there any hope that I would even have a career in programming now**. I see kids who are graduating making apps etc. for classes now. i don't have a github yet. My web app is very very basic write now. i thought since Im brushing up on Java i should also make an Android app. But I feel it'll all be too simple to put on github. It is also not that I want to do only Java and Rails, but I feel it gives me basics for OOP and MVC structures, and job descriptions for entry level seem to ask for understanding on any one of the languages/frameworks. 

It's also highly discouraging when I see my friends who graduated with me 3 years ago are either making or close t making 100k+ by now while i'm just looking for an entry level job. "

My main concern is the working environment in a company like Oracle. Despite the poor career development in my current workplace, the environment is amazing. Very open and relaxed with great peers and honestly besides the paycheck it's what's keeping me here.

As per Oracle, looking around Glassdoor returns not so stellar reviews of the work environment. Also talked to a friend who did a 16 month internship for them who agreed that its rigid corporate structure wasn't so exciting and was rather suffocating.

My main appeal for Oracle is the possible rich career development it may offer as Java is my forte. But outside of that I'm not too excited from what I've gathered so far.

I have a meeting with a campus recruiter I reached out to on my own within the next few days from a Canadian Big 5 bank. I want to get into the trading division of the firm. Fortunately I’m also visiting their trading floor/meeting with traders in a week, but after my visit with the recruiter.   What are general good things I should talk about with them? The markets? The company? Myself? Their summer analyst program? This is my first time doing this.

Bit of background: 
I go to a decent school in Ontario, in my third year of a 5 year program. I had a 3.7 in first year, placed at the top of my class in a summer abroad to a very ‘top’ university. Unfortunately I bombed second year (~2.5 gpa, 2 fails in pretty key courses) after a childhood friend passed away and my academic life turned to trash. Since then though in the past 6 months I’ve really gotten my shit together. This summer I had an internship at a top boutique consulting company and did good work for a few really recognizable names. I didn’t like the field though, and am writing the cfa L1 exam in December (Confident I’ll pass, and yes I have been approved to write it). Over two courses in the summer and this semester, I’m pretty confident I’ll average about a 3.8-3.9 (I’m repeating two courses and taking a lot of really heavy econ/finance courses).  I also have a lot of finance related extracurriculars (strong competition placing, active involvement with an investing club, econ department president) and would rate my interview skills and technical abilities (ie following the markets, problem solving questions, trading strategies knowledge) to be at least a notch or two above my peers. I’m mostly worried about passing the gpa hurdle (I’m at a 3.2-3.3 right now) to get an interview. 

Any advice about anything at all would be really appreciated.
Thanks everyone.

1pi0jv,3,2013-10-29,The man with me,MollsVMK,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pi0jv/the_man_with_me/,"For as long as I can remember, I have felt a presence with me. When I was younger, it took two forms: one as a thin blonde woman who had the body of a ballet dancer and the other was a tall man in a black trench coat and some kind of hat shadowing his face. 


As a child, I never thought much about them. I could always feel when they were there. I would see them out of the corner of my eye. Most of the time, the feelings took place at home, but occasionally I would see them when I was outside. 


One night, when I was about 9, I heard sirens outside. I figured it was just a cop pulling someone over because it was common for people to blow past the stop sign by my house. However, when I looked outside, there was nothing there and the sirens stopped. My sister and I shared a bunk bed so I glanced down from my top bunk to see if the sirens had woken her up. Nope. She was fast asleep.


I tried to go back to bed but I heard the sirens again. I looked outside and still nothing and once again, the sirens stopped. I lay back down but heard the sirens and this time, there was a man’s voice talking. It sounded like he was speaking through a megaphone but I could clearly hear him saying, “Come outside! Get out now!” He kept repeating this. I was finally scared by the sirens and by the red and blue lights that were now flashing into my room… But there were no police cars outside. 


I began to sob, terrified, and my sister finally woke up. She went and got my parents. There was never anything outside and no one else in the neighborhood had heard anything. I tried to brush it off as a dream but I knew it wasn’t a dream. I’ve always been very good at knowing the difference. 


About a year after that experience, my family moved to a house that was alone on top of a hill. It used to be a farm but the property was donated to the city to be used as a park and my family moved there so that me dad could be the park ranger. 


I would still see the man out of the corner of my eye form time to time, but the woman never came back. For a few years, I didn’t even see or feel the man’s presence but about a year ago, I started to feel it again, this time when I was in bed alone. I would be on the edge of sleep when I would suddenly feel someone watching me. It would happen all the time, too. His presence gave me an overwhelming sense of dread and terror. I don’t know how to deal with it. I would even feel it when recently when I slept at my boyfriends apartment or at my dorm. My university is only a 40-minute drive from home so I figured the close proximity is what kept the figure near me.


Now, I am on an internship in a state halfway across the country and I have not felt the presence since. However, I am dreading going home because I don’t want to feel it again. I am also transferring to my sister’s university, which is in the same town as mine. I say this because her school is famous for its haunts and she has had her own experiences. She even had experiences in our old house as a child.


I never felt in danger until the time with the sirens but now, whenever I feel the presence, I just feel like I’m surrounded by evil. That man in his long coat and hat. "

Would have to pay for all my own food and extra expenses though of course compared ot being home.

- current internship is at at a research lab. 15/hr. They want me to stay for the long term and will pay for grad school but its more QA and not want I want to do. I work there full time for summer and part time during the school year.I think the best decision would be to quit now instead of staying another semester.

EDIT: 
JPMorgan is in Houston, Bloomberg is in NYC

I talked to two people from my school (UT Austin) who already interned there and said they liked it alot. They were given 2000 stipend for housing (covers nearly half for housing in manhattan is you are lucky) but that they said they were trying to provide complete housing the next year in NYU dorms.

It is my understanding that Bloomberg would be more prestigious perhaps? One of them worked at Microsoft right after Bloomberg. I am thinking of extending my jpmorgan decision deadline if possible.

If you are interested in an internship at Microsoft, they said now is the time to apply as they are looking for their next round of interns now. They said that around January or so they're usually full up so now is the time to do it!

If I remember correctly, they usually do something along the lines of 6 to 12 month internships, and are especially looking for students who are ""a summer away from graduating,"" which means Juniors at a minimum.

Am I correct in thinking that there are a lot more fresh-out-of-undergrad positions for molecular biology than there are for computational biology?

It's now almost November and I still don't have a lab position since graduating in the spring. I've been applying to research assistant wet-lab positions at biotech companies/labs I found on craigslist and a couple other job sites, like [GenomeWeb](http://www.genomeweb.com/careers). I am in the Seattle area but am not opposed to moving if the position is full-time. I am wondering if I should reach out to UW professors, perhaps even volunteering my time. Am I just not hirable or am I looking in the wrong places or just not trying hard enough?

(I know [a similar thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/1p3gls/companies_or_internships_in_the_seattle_area/) was posted a few days ago, but I guess my situation is a bit different.)  
Thanks for reading and the advice!"

I am a new graduate (I graduated last December 2012) and I'm flummoxed by the difference between my salary and many of the salaries I see here. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA from a semi-decent school (UCF), I had internships with NASA and Lockheed Martin as well as a year of research experience in a robotics lab. I'm very confident with multiple programming languages including C#, Java, Python, PHP, JS and I'm very adept with MySQL, memcached, mongodb and MVC . I love to program and I work 40-50 hour weeks at my job, which is for a 8 person company.

Unfortunately, I'm currently making $50k a year (in Florida). I would be happy with this amount, but I see other people in similar situations getting big salaries like $80-$90k a year. How can I get there as fast as possible? I interviewed with multiple companies in Florida before accepting my current job, but none of them offered more than $55k. 

My current plan of action is to enroll in Georgia tech's online masters of computer science, in the hopes that I can get hired on by a bigger company at a higher price point afterwards (my goal specialization would be machine learning and scale-able web architectures)"
1pkde2,4,2013-10-30,Bombed the interview and rejected - what now?,the_regex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pkde2/bombed_the_interview_and_rejected_what_now/,"I'm a transfer CS student to CSULB. This is my first semester here, and I was looking for internships earlier.

I went to a job fair, and a few weeks later I got a call for a Western Digital internship.

I met with four engineers for thirty minutes each, answering programming questions and questions on my resume. There were a few problems...

1. They had an old high school resume that I accidentally uploaded. I reuploaded my new one, but they brought in my old one. My fault for not bringing extra copies.

2. I was not really expecting anyone to call me since the job fair was over a month ago. They scheduled the interview the very next day, and I did not prepare myself well enough because I had homework and studies.


3. The engineers did not know much Java, which is what I'm learning. They only knew C and C++. They are similar, so not much problem, but I thought it was worth noting.


A lot of questions were asked that I honestly did not know for some reason. They asked if I was familiar with compilers, embedded systems, or operating systems, but I was not... They are all upper division classes that I will eventually take, but not for another year.

So basically, I bombed the interview. The head engineer asked me to write out code on the whiteboard for an entire linked list class, and I just froze and my mind was blank. I was making stupid mistakes everywhere, and I cringe looking back.

They emailed me today saying I did not have the required programming skills to be an intern.

The HR specifically said:

"" You just didn’t have the required programming skills required for their particular role, but the team did enjoy meeting with you and would love to consider you in the future once you gain some of those skills.


Please continue to apply to any positions that interest you on our website.""

Feels bad...

So what now? Should I just quit looking for internships and focus on schoolwork until I'm ready?

They asked me a lot about projects - should I just focus on a project outside of school?

I would have really loved to work at WD... I feel so stupid. I constantly get the highest test scores in my programming classes, but when I'm on the spot I just freeze up. Any advice?

All your contacts from the job etc.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1pk8tk/psa_remember_to_save_your_w2s_all_your_contacts/,"I recently accepted an internship offer for one of the largest companies in the world (Fortune top 30) and I failed the background check due to them not being able to verify my previous employment. 

They use a 3rd party company to do all of this and the 3rd party didn't call those numbers on the application, they just looked for W2s in my file. 

* One job was with a government department and my W2 was technically under a different department from the same county, I failed with that company.
* Another company outsources their IT so I was paid by a different company than what was on my application, I failed with that company.
* Another company never sent in a 1099 or W2 because I made $598 and the cutoff is $600, so I failed with that company as well. 

SAVE YOUR W2s! Also when it gets this far, give them the exact number of your manager (including work cell phone) so you are completely open about it. Explain the situation and turn in your W2s. 

I didn't have my W2s readily handy because I go to school outside my home state so I then had to drive 2 hours one way to an IRS office and get my tax transcripts for the past 5 years or so. Save the trouble and save them in a safe place that is readily available. 

Hopefully none of you have to deal with this and once you get to certain sized companies they actually do verify every little thing you put on that application so never ever lie on it!

I just emailed the Security Background Officer at the company with my W2s so I don't know how it will turn out but I feel way better about this now than when I received the call and was freaking out about not having an internship for this upcoming summer (I previously called my 9 other offers to tell them I accepted somewhere else)."

*Visual Analytics

*Visualization and Visual Communication 



My adviser suggests this track **'Computer Systems'**, he just said 'it's the best one'.


*Compiler Construction 

*Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems 

*Operating Systems 

*Introduction to Computer Networks 

*Parallel Computing

*Microcomputer Interfacing 





And this one **'Networking and Distributed Systems'**, seems like what would be most helpful for my internship.

*Computer Organization and Architecture 

*Parallel Computing 

*Grid Computing 

*Introduction to Information Security and Privacy  


Any advice? Since these classes will make up my last year, I'm very nervous deciding on them. Thank you.


edit: Added based on TheGSwat's suggestion- I would like to go into making web applications. The picture I have in my head right now is a job with a big company where I go in every once and a while, but mostly work at home supporting/creating their applications. Also I'd like to be able to put out websites and apps on the side. Idk how realistic that is as a goal...I'm a girl so being able to work from home without damaging my career path is something that's important to me, since someday I'll probably be stuck at home with a kid for a while.

What kind of answers do you guys use for this question? I'm not trying to use your answers (because obviously that doesn't make sense), I'm just trying to see what you guys say to potentially help pinpoint something in my experience.


For a little background, I'm a CS junior, had one internship. The internship wasn't particularly challenging. I've had some project classes, but most of those big projects were directed, with next to no design decisions or technical challenges being had.

Always a good thing?,SpectralCoding,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1piopd/young_and_my_career_is_moving_up_fast_always_a/,"I graduated from the university a year and a half ago and during my senior year I got a rather prestigious IT internship in my town: Datacenter Intern. Upon graduation I was immediately hired on in an automation position building installations for ZCM (an SCCM equivalent). This in-itself is rare as most people work up from the help desk, to desktop support, then to a position such as mine. After being in this position for a year and a half one (of two) of our Linux Administrators left for personal reasons.

I applied and beat out two internal candidates and one external candidate. Today the lead sysadmin offered me the position. I respect his opinion and told me that I should think hard about accepting the position. Nothing-to-sysadmin in two years in this company is unheard of and they're expecting some back-lash from some people who have been in IT for a while. They're prepared to handle that and stand by their decision.

He basically let me know that moving to what some consider to be a more senior IT position so early in my career can inhibit my success to an extent. We talked about my long term career path (specialization in a certain field and perhaps consulting eventually). He mainly cited that being members of ""lower"" teams (such as my current one) for a few more years could definitely benefit me in the long run. I told him I would think about it and I would let him know.

Any insight into those of you who moved up the ""ladder"" faster than normal? Any suggestions? The company is amazing and I couldn't imagine working anywhere else.

**TL;DR Zero-to-sysadmin in two years in a company where that type of movement is unheard of. My skills make me the best candidate for the job. Current senior admin urging me to think hard about accepting because it may not always be the best career move.**"

I just graduated and finishing my internship that focuses on ASP.NET MVC. I've been interviewing around and I'm given two options right now. A Jr developer at a financial investing company or (being from San Francisco) work in a startup company. 

Things that I have thought of. 

**Corporate:**

**Pros:**
- Probably higher pay

- Learn finance and investing

- stability

**Cons:**
- may be too formal

- C#, ASP.NET, Microsoft software. doesn't interest me that much but I guess I'll do it. 

**Startup**

**Pros:**
- much more laid back. (Vacation/sickdays. Coming into work late)

- pay could be okay
- probably uses technology I'm more interested in (python/ruby/Django framework)
- Possibly take on many roles exposing me to learn many things

**Cons:**

- might not mean as much if startup fails

- too stressful

- possibly low pay

- job insecurity? (Read online I could get fired whenever if startup is doing bad, not sure though)

Could much wiser, more experienced developers provide me with input on your life experiences? Thank you!"

Instead, they told me that I'd have to give up the position with A if I want to intern at B, because if A finds out, it will make the school look bad and it's a shitty thing to do overall.

I understand where they're coming from... but isn't that how job hunting works?!  I found a way to intern with B without missing class (which means I don't need the permission forms), but I feel like I'm committing a terrible crime or something...  

I really don't want to give up my position with A unless B guarantees me a job, but I also feel really bad now.

A tech told me that they already ran MalwareBytes and it reported ""PUM.Hijack.TaskManager"" and that the issue would come back after removing it through MBAM. I was also told that the issue isn't present in Safe Mode or with the system detached from network. They were able to load another process manager software to view the running processes and didn't see anything abnormal. 

Today I was tasked with getting the issue resolved. I disconnected a known infected machine from the network and noticed on login (local admin) that I could get into Task Manager just fine. I did an MBAM scan anyway and it reported 3 unrelated PUPs that I got rid of. I restarted the machine and redid the scan and it came back clean. After plugging it back into the network and logging in with my intern admin account, right click taskbar &gt; Task Manager was greyed as reported and manually starting taskmgr reported that it was disabled by the administrator. One of the sysadmins had previously logged in with his domain admin account and got the same error so it was definitely a problem. 

With the machine on the network, I ran MBAM again and got the PUM.Hijack.TaskManager as reported and noticed the ""HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System|DisableTaskMgr"" registry key was referenced in the log. I went to it and the value of DisableTaskMgr was set to 1. I changed it to 0 and PROFIT! Task Manager was available again and it stayed available across reboots and logging in with local admin/intern admin/student accounts. I repeated the same process on a couple other machines with the same results. I felt great until later on when I really got to thinking about it. It was too easy. Yes it was just a PUM (Potentially Unwanted Modification) but *why* was it set? Scans with Security Essentials came back clean (even before the reg edit) and after I modified that registry key MBAM no longer returned any threats so I thought all was golden. In the back of my mind though I'm thinking a simple registry edit can't be the fix. What else can I run besides MBAM and MSE to confirm there's no infection? 

Ninja Edit: I would like to add that the virus is isolated only to the computers in this lab and these computers have been connected to the network for some time with this issue so it's not spreading. "
