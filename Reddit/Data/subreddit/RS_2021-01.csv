I asked out few girls since 10th grade, but nothing happened. Well, to be fair in highschool I didn't have a car so I couldn't date. And in college, I still lived at my parent's house to save money. 

Eventually, I became resentful. And I used that resentment to focus on my career.

By Junior year, I landed an internship at a decent tech company in Seattle. There was a girl in the same team who liked me but I really wanted to get back to that company after graduation and didn't want to take any chances by dating her.

When I came back from the internship, a girl who I asked for prom and rejected me in high school told me she had a crush on me but was too afraid to be in a relationship with me. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Be in a relationship with her when I know for sure that I'll be moving to a different city as soon as I graduate? So I turned her down this time.

There was another girl I really liked and wanted to ask her out but rich Chinese guys were hitting on her, which discouraged me. Also, I knew I'll be separated from her after graduation even if I end up dating her, so I never asked her out.

So I graduated in 2020 and it was a bad year to graduate. Career was everything in my life me and not being able to find a job after graduation was extremely painful and had no time to think about this issue. But eventually, I found a job at a decent company with a decent salary. 

Now that I have a job and moved out of my parent's house, this problem resurfaces.

I open Instagram and see my friends still in school or looking for a job yet looking happy with their bf/gf or husband/wife. I have a job that pays well, yet alone and lonely. Maybe I am being ungrateful for what I have, maybe it was a trade-off. But maybe my life holds no meaning other than who I am as an employee. 

Honestly, at this point, idk how to be in a relationship since I moved to a new city. And Covid doesn't help either.

Sorry for the long read, I just wanted to vent this on somewhere."
ko2w3d,2,2020-12-31,which schools should I apply to? (PhD in computer science),emshiz,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ko2w3d/which_schools_should_i_apply_to_phd_in_computer/,"Hi!

So I am interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. I was mainly interested in using AI in computer science education research. I was looking at a few schools with programs I like such as UCSD, UC Berkeley, Stanford, University of Washington in Seattle, UIUC, U Chicago and Northwestern. I didn't know if these choices were right for me based on my stats.

GPA: 3.7 / 4.0 (I think by the time I apply it will be around a 3.75) at a top 40 university and for computer science top 15

Undergraduate research: 2 projects both within computer science education. Published as first author in one and currently writing the second. I am planning on doing another research project probably something in AI but probably wont have a paper written for that project

Work experience: 2 software engineering internships (not really in things I want to do) and I am a TA for an intro to CS class

Extra curricular: I am in an org that focuses on teaching computer science more equitably and I also mentor first generation students on ways to navigate through higher education. 

Letter of Recs: I haven't asked for any yet but I am confident that 3 teachers will write me okay ones"
ko389c,1,2020-12-31,Is there any way to repair a 2 year gap? Or should I go back for a bootcamp at this point?,Melodic-Equivalent-2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ko389c/is_there_any_way_to_repair_a_2_year_gap_or_should/,"Hello all on CSCareerQuestions and thank you for all the advice and thoughts.  I'm a frequent lurker who is now looking for advice for the first time...  Hoping that I can be offered some insight or advice.

BACKGROUND:  I'm a junior-mid developer in the US.  I have a bachelors in computer science from a good school with decent extracurricular.  I have just over 2 years of professional experience from internships and job out of college, mostly in Java and C#, plenty of SQL, along with some web development (jQuery, Razor syntax, vanilla javascript, AJAX, etc).  Good breadth of technologies and overall understanding of the tech ecosystem, and spend a lot of time studying new things (YouTube lectures).

I left my first job out of college due to it not being that closely related to development, a toxic culture, poor infrastructure which prevented my progress significantly.  Overall most days I was not getting a chance to look at the code at all.  This ended up being probably a mistake and I should have stayed for a while longer, but only because I didn't apply for jobs quickly enough after leaving, and then COVID struck.  Kinda unlucky, but that's what happened.  At this point I have been underemployed for 2 years, taking various odd jobs part time, but basically bleeding savings overall.  I have applied to around 350 jobs over the time period (spread out over a period of 2 years, so not that much really).

CURRENT SITUATION:  I have kept up with my coding and have done a lot of studying over the time period, and learned at least the basics in Java Spring, .NET 4+ and Core, React, and Angular, and refined my knowledge over OOP and design patterns.  Basically all I do each day is listen to YouTube lectures and follow along with them.  Basically, as much as it sucks I don't have a lot to SHOW for this time period, although my understanding over trivia-like questions and concepts in the various different languages and frameworks has improved massively from where I was (I can verbally explain things excellently compared to where I was, and have a greater understanding of the overall ecosystem and how everything fits together).  I am working on sizeable personal projects to put up on GitHub such as eCommerce sites (REST API + Javascript Framework), games, and sizeable desktop applications, and also have some decent ones from university.  LeetCodes I feel that I can ramp up quickly (within about a month) and have been doing a few throughout this time period, currently trying to crank some more of those and memorize the syntax of one language (Java) right now.

I am applying for jobs in the midwest and south, and shooting for uncompetitive regions and small-medium sized companies.  Tailoring resume for each position, without spending too much time on each application, following the general advice on here.  However, despite that I am not getting nearly as many calls back or email responses as I was a few years ago.   I believe this is due to both COVID as well as the increasing gap on my resume.  I have gotten some phone screenings and also a contract job which lasted a month (was a low pay rate), but was over a year ago.

QUESTIONS AREA:  Should I go back for a bootcamp at this point in order to close the gap on my resume, get personal projects, and get networked with some companies?  Or just continue to apply on my own and study at home (which, at this point, I have to admit is not going great).  I can pull the money out of my 401K and have enough to do so, but am wondering if it's worth it.  (If I am going to do the bootcamp, I need to decide SOON and start in February, as I am bleeding savings.)  Most people on here usually suggest to NOT do a bootcamp if you already have a degree, let alone industry experience, but I feel like it fits in my situation with the gap and current career goals.  It would surely guarantee me a job (I feel that I would be a competitive candidate coming out of the bootcamp with degree and work exp, plus bootcamp certification) and get me out of this slump I am in paying rent at home and living in a place that is not good for my mental health.  My hope is that it would open up opportunities to either relocate, or work remote and relocate on my own.  The other option is just continue to apply to jobs and study code for 10 hours a day, and perhaps pick up a part time job 3 days a week otherwise.  This hasn't been going well and I'm getting almost no responses nowadays, but that may be largely due to COVID."

I often hear in this sub a bunch of new grads are having a lot of issues with finding a jobs and how they have to stay with there parents for 5 months. This all sounds really disheartening because I would really like to have a decent job when I graduate (60k+ a yr).

Happy New Year!

I hope you all have had an enjoyable holiday season so far. As some of you may have noticed, I recently joined the r/internships moderation team. I've been spending the last few days cleaning up posts and comments from the recent history and I thought now would be a good time to officially announce it.

I've also expanded the options for post flair and made post flair required for all posts moving forward. This should help make it easier to filter through posts on the subreddit and find what you're looking for. Post flair is just the start when it comes to improvements to the subreddit, as I'd love to see this community thrive and grow with meaningful discussions. 

As such, I'm opening it up and asking for your help with suggestions. What improvements would you like to see? What do you like about the subreddit and what do you not like?

Some potential ideas I have include but are not limited to: a sidebar/wiki that links to various related subreddits, a recurring post to consolidate all of the ""have you heard back?"" style of posts, user flair for indicating past internship experience, and a sidebar/wiki to list best practices / tips and tricks for the internship process. None of my ideas are concrete, so I invite you to chime in on how you feel about them or suggest new ones.

\---------------

Beyond improvements to the subreddit, I have to make a reminder about the rules.

1. **No spam or self promotion.** This means no affiliate links and no advertisements whatsoever.
2. **No unpaid internships.** Promoting unpaid internships is not allowed.
3. **This is not a job board.** Hundreds of sites existing for posting internship positions, but this subreddit is not one of them.
4. **No low effort posts.** Please take the time to search the subreddit's history and see if your question may already be answered in an existing post or comment.

Thank you so much to everyone who reports any posts or comments that seem to violate the rules. Reporting is one of the best ways to help out the mod team, since things are always bound to slip through the cracks at some point or another.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the rules at any time, I highly encourage you to use the ""message the moderators"" feature. We're here to help.

\---------------

Thank you to everyone that read through to the end. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts suggestions. If you're still searching for an internship, keep searching and good luck! For those that have secured one, congratulations! Here's to a new year that will hopefully be better than the last.

Cheers,

\-- Kawalao"
ko8e24,7,2021-01-01,What should I know about Harvey Mudd College,ldiotSandwich,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ko8e24/what_should_i_know_about_harvey_mudd_college/,"I'm a junior that has been doing college search as a part of our college counseling class. I plan on applying for a Computer Science major, so most of my peers and counselors have advised me to  apply to prestigious universities such as Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, and University of Michigan. However, my one of my counselors has pushed me to explore Harvey Mudd College, a liberal arts college that is part of the Claremont Colleges System. 

I haven't really been considering liberal arts colleges for a CS degree, but I soon realized that Harvey Mudd is a very unique liberal arts school. It only provides STEM majors, and its graduates receive very high salaries according to [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/School=Harvey_Mudd_College/Salary), ranking its [CS graduates' early career pay above several Ivy League schools and their mid-career pay above most schools](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-majors/computer-science).

I've done some further research into this school, but please tell me about other pros or cons that I should know about when considering whether to apply to HMC or not. Here's what I know:

Pros: 

* High graduate salary
* High student-faculty ratio (8)
* Students can take classes at the other colleges of the Claremont College System
* The lack of graduate programs allows professors to focus on undergraduates
* Well-rounded education (approximately 1/3 core curriculum, 1/3 humanities, 1/3 major-related courses)
* Clinic project (senior students working in groups to create projects for companies)
* Internship opportunities from prestigious tech companies (Apple, Google, etc.)
* Students and teachers are close (getting academic help, doing research, knowing each other personally outside of academics)
* Comfortable and warm weather (I come from Taiwan, and my peers who've been there agree that the weather is enjoyable)

Cons:

* High annual cost
* Travelling out of campus is difficult without a car
* Academics take up a lot of time
* No score inflation (may be difficult to get into a top graduate program)
* Exclusive dorm culture
* Less focused on athletics
* Suburban campus
* Low ranking (I understand that rankings are not nearly capable of assessing a school's value, but I'm puzzled by why Harvey Mudd has a low ranking according to most college ranking websites)

Others: 

* Rigorous core curriculum
* ED acceptance rate is similar to RD acceptance rate"

1. I have a few hackathons coming up (mid - late Jan) and am planning to put those projects on my resume, but I would have to wait to apply to some already-open job postings. So if I see a position I am interested in but it shows no application deadline, should I still apply now or is it worth it to wait until I update my resume with those hackathon projects? My CGPA is 3.8 but I only have some class projects right now 
2. Is cover letter necessary for every application if I am planning to send out a lot? 
3. Should I tweak my resume for different SWE internships/companies?
4. Is anyone willing to look over my resume and give me some tips? I will PM you

I am pretty new to this job search process so any help would be appreciated.

Currently 23 year old active duty USAF as a c-17 electrical and environmental maintainer (2A6X6). I have 3.5 years left of 6 total and thinking about my future. Tried the programming side of computers and don’t really find code able to hold my attention. Maybe I wouldn’t mind minor coding but I can’t see myself doing it for 8 hours a day in a career. 

Now I’m looking at the other side of computers, IT. Network admin/ sys admin seem very interesting to me. I’ve been involved with computers my whole life and always enjoyed working with them. I don’t know much about IT but would like to get into it and jump into a career after the military since I am not going to re-enlist. 

What would be the best course to getting a career in IT? I don’t have time for an in-person internship or any physical job since the military takes 100% of my time. I would also like to start earning a degree towards something IT related but not sure what school to go to. I’m located in Charleston, SC. Would prefer an online degree but can try at going to an in-state school.

If anyone could give advice on best route to learn IT/ gain experience and school to go to, that’d be great. Thanks anyone who comments."
kof962,84,2021-01-01,"Laid off about 6 months ago, after only having about 1.5 years of experience. Now can't get hired for a job. Feel like I have fallen through a crack in this industry and don't know how to fix this?",wtfnowdoIdo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kof962/laid_off_about_6_months_ago_after_only_having/,"So, basically, I graduated with a CS degree and worked as a developer for about 1.5 years. Before this, I worked in another industry for about 5 years (worked their while paying for my degree). Due to working full time, I couldn't get internship experience because I had to pay for housing and other things with my job.

After graduating, I got hired as a full stack developer. Worked there for about a 1.5 years and got let go mid summer 2020. I took a few months off due to some personal things I wanted to take care of, also got a couple certificates that I thought could help get a job. Also, worked on a major project as well.

Since then, I haven't been able to get a job though since I have recently started reapplying (started again in early October/November). I have had my resume looked over by people in the industry and they say it looks fine, so it is not an issue with my resume.

I am studying leetcode and working on projects, so I have that covered. Also, 1.5 years of full stack development experience should count for something I would think.

But, it is extremely hard to even get an interview. Again, YES, I have had my resume looked over...it is not that.

I feel like I am just in this odd position right now. I am no longer considered a ""new grad"", so I no longer qualify for those ""new grad"" jobs (yes, the ads specifically say they only want people who graduate between a certain period to apply for those jobs and auto reject if you don't meet that criteria). Yes, I have even tried anyway and got auto rejected as I predicted.

But, I also don't have that magical ""3 years"" experience to be considered a experienced developer, so I get rejected from those due to not enough experience or match.

WTF am I supposed to do, just go homeless at this point? I'm sorry I was the person who got let go because I was newest on the team and they made cuts due to the economy. 

I feel like I am in this weird position that this industry seems to not be set up to handle and seems to ""shun"". AKA, I am not a new grad, but I am also not someone with 3 years experience yet. It feel like this industry is just set up to make people in my position just ""go away"" and don't give them a shot at a job.

What is someone like me supposed to do to get a job? I'm just at a lose at this point."

So I recently started to work at this Lowe’s not to far from where I live. The stores management is all over the place, we have very rude customers each and every day (I work in customer service/cashier), and it is extremely unorganized. However, I am extremely thankful and blessed to have employment during these times (Also, I do know that each job comes with different issues and duties). I was gonna just stay working here (approx 3-6 months) until I find a internship in my career field but I recently found another job that pays more ($15.50 vs $11.99 at my current job), I would only work 4/7 days out the week,  better hours, and it’s weekly pay. I also live on my own and pay over $1,200.00 plus in bills and rent each month with no help from my family. Also, I am in a senior in college so those 3 rest days would be great for me and completing assignments. My only thing is that I feel like my family will judge me because I have already left another job in October bc I was calling out to much due to me having several anxiety and panic attacks at the time and my mental health was horrible. However, since then I have gotten extremely better and I passed all of my classes for my fall 2020 semester. Do you all think I should make that move to the better job that pays me well and not to mention, I would be able to save more money and pay all of my bills on time without asking for any assistance from anyone. I would also be allowed 3 rest days where I could catch up on school work and I could take days just to rest and care to myself. I am kinda hesitant because my sister said I don’t want to be seen as a “job hopper” and I feel like I would be judged. 
Any advice will help. Thx"

Up until only a few months ago, I was sure I would go into industry after my undergrad. As a result, I have not been gearing my undergrad towards grad school (eg establishing connections with profs, going to office hours, etc) and do not have much time left until next fall.

I did do one part time research this past term and can get a letter out of that. But, since it was part time while I was taking a full course load, I did not do enough to get a paper out of it, let alone a publication. Still, the prof I was working with said he would be happy to write a letter for me.

I will then need two more letters. I think I'll get one from a prof I took 2 courses with and got great grades and she also did her PhD at Harvard, which is my top choice, so hopefully that helps.

And I'm not sure what to do for my third letter. My options right now are:

1. I am doing an internship in industry next summer. Get a letter from my manager.

2. Get a letter from a senior class I did well in. Since it was online, I did not meet him in person and go to office hours. This will certainly be a weak letter.

3. Do another part time research next fall and get a letter out of that. The problem is that I will also be applying to grad school next fall, so the person who will write a letter for me will only have worked with me for a few weeks, part time.

Idk what to do!"
koi4yz,29,2021-01-01,Any advice for a fresh grad to boost employability?,0800happydude,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/koi4yz/any_advice_for_a_fresh_grad_to_boost_employability/,"I graduated from a conversion MSc course last September and have been trying to secure my first position in tech, without much luck.

Since it's just past the New Year I am beginning to get increasingly more worried as the gap in my CV grows bigger.

Currently I am:

* Doing two voluntary roles. These don't amount to very much though, at most maybe an hour a week and consist mainly of very basic tech support like resetting logins.
* Building projects, although they're not particularly impressive at the moment I'm doing as much as I can to make them better.
* Doing hackerank and other coding problems.
* Applying to internships as well as jobs, both paid and unpaid.
* Even had some interviews for some tech support roles, though I don't really want to do this.

Is there anything else I could be doing?

How badly is a gap in the CV viewed by tech employers even if it's filled with volunteering/projects?

I haven't been able to secure that many interviews as it is so I'm getting concerned that at some stage people will just see the gap and I won't be considered for interviews at all.

Any advice greatly appreciated."

I was able to my RHCSA yesterday.I got comfortable with Ansible, docker. 
I started Kubernetes, somewhat comfortable with it. I'm starting to doubt my learning path. I'm thinking I'm shooting to high for the level I'm at.

I speak English. I’d be willing to learn something else but I’m not sure if I’d be able to get a job before knowing the country’s language. 

I really want to work in Europe and be able to travel to nearby countries. I know it’s not a good idea with covid but I would like to start thinking about it so I can do it when covid gets better. I want to preferably go to a country in the EU. 

I’m not sure what the job prospects for me are like, because I think the employer could hire someone equally or more qualified for jobs. I would probably have to be more experienced before being able to get a work visa to Europe. 

I’ve heard about a working visa for travelling which allows you to stay in the country for two years. But honestly I’d be kind of concerned about that. Because I would like to get married and I don’t think it can happen within two years. 

Also, what are the ways of staying in Europe long term? Would I apply for PR or citizenship? I think the options are to apply by myself or get married to someone who has an European passport. 

Lastly, what’s the cost of living/healthcare options/retirement plans like? For someone who’s not a citizen. I heard it’s very hard to get citizenship even if you’re married. 

Could someone please give me some advice?"
kokdb6,4,2021-01-01,What does it take to be considered above average and receive offers from top companies?,Roo_ooky,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/kokdb6/what_does_it_take_to_be_considered_above_average/,"This might sound like a humble brag but I really need your help to assess my level for the tech market and adjust my expectations. This is my 2nd year of the master's degree in CompSci I'm doing at one that can be considered the best university for studying CS in Italy. 

My current weighed average mark is 29.5/30. I would describe myself as a hustler and really passionate about this field, surely I haven't chosen it just for the well-paid jobs like many others do. When I have time, I often study new topics on my own. I've been leading in all the group projects until now and I'm quite confident on my soft and hard skills, even though the more  I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. Before finishing my bachelor's, I've done an internship with the same university and developed an application that is currently in use by the secretariat. Side projects aren't missing as well.

Sometimes I feel optimistic about my future job(s), other times instead I think that all of the above are not enough to make me become ""above average "" once I get out of school. I would like to move to Zurich after graduation but after reading some posts here and the other subreddit I feel like I'm still not enough and even with a good gpa, the competition is still very high. I don't want a FANG job, but I'm surely interested in one of those top companies and one day to advance into the architect or management positions. What should I focus on in order to attract recruiters and good offers? How far I am from obtaining a job at an unicorn company or a bank?

Thank you all and happy new year!"

So I recently started to work at this Lowe’s not to far from where I live. The stores management is all over the place, we have very rude customers each and every day (I work in customer service/cashier), and it is extremely unorganized. However, I am extremely thankful and blessed to have employment during these times (Also, I do know that each job comes with different issues and duties). I was gonna just stay working here (approx 3-6 months) until I find a internship in my career field but I recently found another job that pays more ($15.50 vs $11.99 at my current job), I would only work 4/7 days out the week,  better hours, and it’s weekly pay. I also live on my own and pay over $1,200.00 plus in bills and rent each month with no help from my family. Also, I am in a senior in college so those 3 rest days would be great for me and completing assignments. My only thing is that I feel like my family will judge me because I have already left another job in October bc I was calling out to much due to me having several anxiety and panic attacks at the time and my mental health was horrible. However, since then I have gotten extremely better and I passed all of my classes for my fall 2020 semester. Do you all think I should make that move to the better job that pays me well and not to mention, I would be able to save more money and pay all of my bills on time without asking for any assistance from anyone. I would also be allowed 3 rest days where I could catch up on school work and I could take days just to rest and care to myself. I am kinda hesitant because my sister said I don’t want to be seen as a “job hopper” and I feel like I would be judged. 
Any advice will help. Thx"

**TLDR: I'm a recovering heroin addict who went back to school full time to pursue a degree in CS. I completed my first semester, now I am looking for advice on what to do next.**

I came to this sub over half a year ago looking for advice on getting into computer science, more specifically a 'prestigious university' (lol). After some time, I realized this might've been asking for too much. I managed my expectations and now am attempting to transfer into a decent Cal State or UC school once I finish my general education at community college.

I completed my first semester of CS a couple weeks ago with a 3.7ish GPA. I learned a lot from my intro Java class and came to the conclusion that programming is something I really enjoy. I think being sober is what made a huge difference this time around in trying out CS.

I've been a bit overwhelmed looking at all the posts about people getting into FANG, scoring all these sweet internships, or building superhuman resumes. My questions is, what should I do next with where I'm at? I really want to try to get an internship this summer if its not too late. I'm not looking for a Big N company either. Literally any company I can intern for so I can began to put experience on my resume early on. I just got cleared by my GM to create an app for our retail company, so that is my first real project I'll be starting on. Hopefully I will be able to create it soon so that I can put it on my resume.

As of now, this spring I will be taking a second installment of my schools C++ class, an intro to Computer Architecture, Calc 2, and Physics: Mechanics. Fall 2021 I will take Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures. I've read that I will need to know this topic before applying for internships which is why I'm beginning to self learn it. I know I need to add projects to my resume, just not sure what besides the app for my work. Should I learn more languages like Python? Or take courses for web dev, machine learning, or other CS related subjects?

Thank you in advance to anyone who happens to read this. Happy New Year!"

I am a back end developer and from the sounds of it will be working on a very small team. I will be working alone for the most part, discussing in general what we want to do, but provided the opportunity to implement a lot of features. This is a change from other co-op positions I have had where I would be told to add a small part of a system, or fix someone's bugs... I actually get to write a decent amount of code!   


Now my questions is if anyone has worked in an environment like this or if they are industry veterans that can provide some pointers in avoiding making too many mistakes. I am definitely nervous as I have been pretty micro managed (former internship was for the feds) in previous work and really just want some advice and pointers!

kooot3,48,2021-01-01,"""Every day, I pass by the same homeless man who rattles the same cup at me, and every day, I drop a few coins in it. He terrifies me. What happens when I forget?""",YonaHuski,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kooot3/every_day_i_pass_by_the_same_homeless_man_who/,"Every day, I pass by the same homeless man who rattles the same cup at me. He holds the same sign, he wears the same clothes, and his matted hair never changes.

There on the corner of Thirty-Fourth and Little St, when I’ve passed through with my briefcase to my job at the local paper downtown, I’ve seen him (and smelled him) every day since the first day of my unpaid college internship that eventually landed me the job. I remember my college buddies and I went onto *Google Maps* one time to look for him on *Street View.* Sure enough, even when my friends and I were Freshmen in high school, he was sitting there, rattling the same cup, holding the same sign, wearing the same clothes with that matted hair, a mop atop his greasy scalp. His face was a dark blob, blurred out by the camera on the Google car. No one knew his face anyway. No one knew his name either. He was like a ghost frozen in time, a hologram, a glitch in the universal matrix.

My dad told me when I was very little that giving a homeless person money is like feeding a stray cat: if you ever stop, there will be problems. For the most part, I always believed him. Regardless of my intensive Liberal Arts education for my Bachelor’s of English, some prejudices are hard to shake off. There was something different about this homeless man though: more than usual, I was scared shitless of him. Maybe that’s why I started giving him money. Did I feel bad about seeing him there, knowing he had sat there since *at least* my Freshman year of high school (*That freeloader should get a job!* my dad would say), or was my instinctive monkey-brain afraid that a suspiciously large man, regardless of social status, was capable of hurting a scrawny journalist like me if he wanted to? I don’t know. What I do know is this: it made my skin crawl to see him sitting there as I rounded the corner each day; to listen to him rattling his cup each day like a metal waterfall--*Ka-Chink Ka-Chink Ka-Chink!*\--and see his sign, the back of a pizza box with a crease down the middle, with big oafish block letters on it spelling two simple words: “GOD BLESS.”

So yes, eventually I caved. It was a temporary relief from my fear, and each day when I passed and dropped my money into the cup I felt like a store-front mannequin, stiff as a board and white as a sheet, with a sweaty sheen glossing over my face like a lacquer.

For months, I gave that man a dollar, spare change from my pocket, *something,* until one day, I didn’t have anything to give him. Against the loudness of the urban ambiance, his change cup rattled harder and harder--*Ka-Chink, Ka-Chink, Ka-Chink!* A lump swelled in my throat the first day I passed him with nothing to offer, and I took a wider berth than usual (too obviously) as I was terrified what he could do once he realized I had no handout, no crumpled up dollar bill to put in his filthy hand.

As I passed by him that day, I refused myself the opportunity to steal a glimpse at his face. Still, I felt his eyes on me. I expected commotion behind me, maybe he’d get up and go after me, a grubby hand on the shoulder of my freshly pressed white button-up. Maybe he’d yell. I imagined that his ragged voice must sound like gravel under a boot, a rusty tin can, a three pack-per-day habit for forty years. As I reached my hand out to grab the door to my office, ten feet from where he had sat since I was a kid, I finally allowed myself a glance his way. He hadn’t looked up. His eyes were sunken; his features were dark, sharp, and gaunt. He was more like a zombie than a man, like he had died years ago yet was still alive. I slipped inside with my briefcase and fixed my tie, taking a deep breath. The office almost felt as safe as home.

Amidst the interior of the entryway, there were a variety of plants that the secretary, Charlotte, thought really livened the place up. Although, everyone who worked there thought *she* livened the place up, not the plants. Charlotte was a southern woman from Tennessee whose family, due to various circumstances she loved to talk about, had been transplanted to Florida. She was blonde, fifty, always rocked ruby red lipstick, and had watermelons for breasts that reminded everyone of Dolly Parton. I don’t think the tits were why she was hired. In her case, it really was her personality.

“Good mornin’, sugarbug! How’re you doin’?” she beamed, our morning routine. She was always a ray of fucking sunshine. The light coming in through the massive front windows might as well have reflected light off her veneered teeth and straight into my eyeballs.

I replied meekly: “I’m fine, Charlotte, thanks for asking.”

Everything about that day was normal. Leaving, however, was tricky. As the day flew by and came to a close, I grew concerned about how I could avoid this man. More than ever before, I never wanted to see him again because I was afraid, for whatever reason, of what he might do to me. I exited out the back of the building so as not to cross paths with him, thinking about his jagged, dirty fingernails ripping into my skin like a werewolf, thinking about what kinds of cutaneous diseases I could get if I didn’t have access to vaccines and modern medicine.

That was the first day in months I gave the man nothing. I refused to forget again.

The following day, as I left my third floor apartment (I liked the security more than the view), I checked my wallet to make sure I had money this time. I thought, maybe after yesterday he’s going to want to talk to me some more, get to know me on a personal basis--just like Dad said: a stray cat who wants to be let inside the house. As I walked to work, I ran through every possible thing I would say to say to this man who I was absolutely terrified of for no reason at all.

And as I rounded the corner of Thirty-Fourth and Little Street with my briefcase, and I had prepared every possible apology and rebuttal as I gave him today’s rations, I noticed his usual spot was unoccupied.

For the first time ever, he wasn’t there.

For the first time ever, I stopped on my route in front of where he sat, which still had all his things, few as they were, and I looked around cautiously to find him. My chest ached. I looked through his stuff, thought about leaving a dollar in his cup that still sat there, but decided against it for fear that someone else may come along and think they found free money.

So for the second day in a row, I gave this man nothing. My anxiety told me that he may come back at some point in the day. Again, at the end of the day, I left out the back door of the office. I stopped by the ATM close by my house and withdrew a twenty dollar bill. I never carried more than twenty in cash for fear of being robbed, and although I had never been robbed before, the possibility always scared me.

That morning, with extra cash in my pocket, I came prepared to ask the homeless man where he was the day prior before delivering my rehearsed apology as well as a more substantial monetary one. This would have been our first exchange of words throughout the months I had been giving him scraps. I was no good at small talk, but I felt obligated. As I walked up to the corner, money in hand, I expected to see him at his spot but again, he wasn’t there. It looked as if he hadn’t returned since he left the day prior.

Just like the previous day, I looked around to try to find the man. Standing in the middle of his belongings, glad that I had not left the dollar in his abandoned cup the previous day otherwise someone *definitely* would have stolen it from him, I first looked back the way that I came and saw nothing but cars bustling about the city, a couple walking hand in hand, an old lady waiting at the bus stop. Slowly, I turned and listened to the symphony of the city. The bullet train above the street, zooming past, rumbling. The sound of children laughing as they played at a local daycare that was a few buildings down from the office. The sound of a man’s heavy breathing behind me.

*Wait, what?*

I whipped around just as I felt hot breath on my neck. It left a noxious odor of rotten teeth and malt liquor, but there was no one there. Immediately, my stomach began churning, almost enough to elicit a gag from the very back of my throat, where a wet frog sat. I tried to gulp it down.

After that moment which felt like a century (*come on, hurry up*), I fled as quickly and calmly as I could, closing in on the remaining paces to my building and escaped inside. Just as the door was about to close, I stole a glimpse of a dark figure standing across the street from my building, and I was *sure* it was him. From inside the building, Charlotte looked at me wildly from the desk.

Determined to break the stale air, I offered our usual routine: “Good morning, Charlotte!” I was surprised my voice didn’t shake. I noticed sweat was drenching my face. I turned to look out the front window to verify if that had been the homeless man, standing across the street. There was no one there. I left out the back door that day too, and an unnatural urgency carried me home. I broke a sweat as I stood at the ATM, and I withdrew another eighty dollars.

For the third day in a row, I gave the man nothing.

I laid in bed that night, thinking about what I might do if I encountered the man, I could not drum up anything to say. Everything about him terrified me. In my mind, I heard the relentless jingle of his cup. I thought of his matted hair and the lice that likely live on his dirty scalp. I thought of the hot breath on my neck, the stench of it and how I was *sure* that somehow it was him. I let that fear consume me as I attempted a restless sleep.

When I awoke, for the first time, I was terrified to go to work. My heart pounded like a prisoner rattling bars as I walked my normal route to work that day. I was sweating again, and I was sure Charlotte and everyone else would notice. As I rounded the corner of Thirty-Fourth and Little, mere feet from the man’s camp, I started at the sidewalk. I could not look up as my mind screamed at me to turn around and sprint back home. The hundred dollars did not make me feel better. I grew queasy again, and I was sure if I opened my mouth to speak, my voice would crack like a whip.

As I hurried toward the door, I noticed all of his things were gone. He moved somewhere else, I thought (*probably closer to my house!*) The only trace he left behind was his sign, lying face-up on the street. *GOD BLESS,* it read. Litter.

I approached the building, I was acutely aware of everything but I noted nothing out of the ordinary aside from the sweat which soaked my fresh button-up shirt and the dampness of the twenty dollar bills I gripped in my right pocket. Still, just as always, there were people bustling to and fro on the busy streets, cars honking and the bullet train roaring, children playing (screaming?) at the daycare a few buildings down. I took a moment to pause beside the door of my building and look across the street to where I had seen him the day prior, and there was no one but a couple sitting on a park bench across the street. I heaved a sigh of relief and a grin cracked upon my face as I swung open the door to the building and walked inside.

“Good morning, Charlotte!”

Yet still, for the fourth day, with all the money in my pocket, I gave the homeless man nothing. And I had the best day working at that paper than I’d had in a long time.

As I left (through the *front* door this time) and walked home with the sun falling across the horizon, an ocean breeze blew in, a zephyr from the sea. I felt bubbly as ever, with the chipperness and optimism that I had previously only seen in Charlotte. Like a schoolgirl, I wanted to skip all the way back to my apartment that evening, briefcase in hand. Yet, commingled with the salt of the ocean and the salt of the morning’s pit-stains, there was a lingering stench of something familiar. It grew stronger as I closed in on my apartment building. Stale malt liquor and piss.

Snapped out of my schoolgirl stupor, intense paranoia crashed into me like a tsunami, and I ran the few remaining blocks to get to my building. I couldn’t stop even if I saw him on the sidewalk in front of me. Breathing through my shirt as if to stifle the odor, I flew up the stairs and slammed the door behind me; I locked the doorknob and the deadbolt, slid the chain, and took a deep breath.

I felt safe in my apartment. I poured myself a glass of water from the sink and drank the whole thing. As I stood there, I talked myself through my panic attack. It was easier to do here, at home behind a securely locked door high up above the street, where no one could break in through a window. I couldn’t relax. I stayed in my living room all evening in front of the TV, flipping channels, unable to break out of my own obsessive thoughts. Eventually, when fatigue overcame anxiety, I retired to bed.

Cautiously, I slipped into sleep only to awaken in the middle of the night to pitch blackness and that putrid garbage juice cocktail that I smelled every time I rounded that corner and on my way home. The odor of dirty copper drifted through the air. Fear paralyzed me in a way it hadn’t before. I couldn’t move. My eyes cracked open in the darkness, and across the room, I saw it: a tall, lanky, dark figure in the corner by the curtains. The whites of its eyes floated like moonlit clouds.

I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move.

I am going into my second semester and towards completion of my first year of 4. I was thinking of maybe applying for an internship for this summer 2021 to gain some experience but my question is am I still not experienced enough in my schooling to be applying for an internship right away. Some of my friends applied before even starting the school year and they got interviews but the interviewees told them that they are still too fresh into the program and to come back when they have more experience and semesters completed as they haven’t even started yet. I have done only one semester now but I really want to work in the summer as I have no job as of right now and I would really like to work in the field of my future career. Will they most likely say the same thing to me since I don’t even have a year completed yet? Also, usually we apply for internship at least 6 months prior but sometimes it could be done in less time, however would it be possible to apply for one after my next semester. Next semester finishes in April, is this too late by then to apply for something for the summer 2021 for an internship or would it be too late? If so, should I just wait to apply till next year after the fall semester is done (which would be my third semester completed) for the summer 2022? 

I am sure many people could help me with internships application and how it works really!


Thanks for the help!!

I have been offered a position at a well known company. The position isn't exactly what I studied (more business, I am more alongside the creative/UX route, however I have taken multiple courses in business pending an it minor I will be one class shy of). It has okay pay (I looked it up and it is smack dab in the average for my school for expected salary, higher for my specific college). The location is okay, but I'll be able to transfer in one year to anywhere. The hours are pretty long, I heard while employees in this position are rarely fired (except for what seems like liability issues like sexual harassment), some do burn out. I'm not opposed to hard work, and it has great insurance, which is great, as I'll probably need a specialist for a condition (migraines, which I'm worried about in the working world, but they seem to be responding okay to a new regime).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. I stalked the people who graduated last year and from what I found, a little bit more than 40% of them were able to land jobs outside of their previous internships from the university they had before they graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still in contacts with a recruiter who said I'll be a great fit for a temp to hire position in my field (well know company and the company that'll be temp to hire is one of the biggest employers), but I won't know anything until around april and we haven't talked in around a month.

I am also still getting leads for jobs that match a bit more closely to my desired position from a recruiter who forwarded me this position, but all the ones I have interviewed with so far (around 8, 3 final rounds, 2 if not including the current job offer) have rejected me. I have until Monday to give them an answer, so I'll be back on the ""grind"" all over again if I don't take it.

If I take it and then take it back, my university has a strict policy about that, especially because the company is one that frequently hires grads from my school(as in they'll blackball me from their career services) So, that'll be it.

&amp;#x200B;

I  also don't have the typical support of a college student. I pay rent. Going back ""Home"" is a messy situation, as technically I can't live with my mother because of her building codes, my father already has family living with him in his one bedroom, and yeah. The place I'm currently staying at requires twice the rent, and I won't have a guarantor (I have enough in my bank account to pay it for a year, but that doesn't really matter to apartments around here) and no job other income because my income is tied to fin aid and my internships end in spring.

So, I'll have to be confident that I'll be able to land a job by april-july 100%. I know first jobs can set up trajectory for the rest of your career (various professors have said this, especially concerning salary), so I just want to make the right decision.

I got my first, and hopefully last, DUI offense on New Years. I was pulled over for speeding for going 33 mph in a 25 mph zone. The police officer put on his sirens approximately 1,000 ft from me reaching my residence. I proceeded to go to my residence and parked my vehicle on the street outside my house. I provided a valid driver’s license and insurance card. I admitted to drinking earlier in the night. I was asked to conduct a field sobriety test and failed and was read my rights. I was asked to take a breathalyzer test and obliged. I blew a .183 BAC I was then placed under arrest and was taken in for booking. I was later offered to blow again twice and was told the lowest BAC would be used in court. The lowest I blew was a .15 BAC. My bail was set for $1,020 and made bail 7 hours later. My hearing is scheduled for 1/11/2021. Previous to this offense, I had received an MIP and blew a .17 BAC. 

Questions:

1.) Will bail be returned after my hearing or after my court date?

2.) What is the likelihood of the following:
- Jail time
- License suspension
- Aggravation  

3.) Will my previous MIP have weight in determining my sentencing?

4.) I have an internship in Seattle, Washington for the summer. What is the probability that my sentencing will interfere with my ability to intern? Is there a possibility that my situation will be considered? Is there a likelihood that I will lose this opportunity as a result?

5.) What ballpark dollar number can I expect for fines and court fees?

6.) Given my situation, is it worth considering a lawyer or will a public defender suffice? Is there any potential in my case for a reduced sentence?

One university in my state, Stony Brook, has two masters programs Statistics and Quantitative Finance, both in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics School. They seem to take a lot of pride in their Quant finance program which they make clear is very popular/competitive and of their ability to place many of their QF students in **internships** at hedge funds and major investment companies. Few other QF programs offer internships. And they even talk about how Stony Brook is headed by Robert Frey, a Stony Brook Graduate who was a ""Key creative mind"" at renaissance technologies (he had an early retirement from there). Some of their core classes are Portfolio Theory, Financial Derivatives and Stochastic Calculus, Computational Finance, Quantitative Risk Management and quite a few more. 

Now this program sounds great, but I feel like a statistics program is arguably better in general. Its more flexible in the case that I want to work in tech or even the careers I mentioned in the title, quant and algo-trading. And its also probably less competitive. I dont know, what do you guys think. The careers Im interested in tech are data mining, AI, and recommender systems which happen to fall under data science and machine learning, already popular fields, I know"

kotyra,1,2021-01-02,Exploring career paths,ILikeKnowingStuff,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kotyra/exploring_career_paths/,"For context, I'm a sophomore computer engineering major expecting to graduate in the spring of 2023, possibly a semester early, but not sure yet.

I currently have 3 main paths in front of me that I find very interesting and I could see myself going into any of them.

- Software engineering 
- IT/Cyber-security 
- Embedded systems or hardware engineering

I understand that these are extremely broad categories themselves, but I think they are good generalizations for what I am thinking of. There are a lot of things in between, but the categories are essentially: developing software, managing or securing computers and networks, and developing hardware and lower-level computing. I went into comp eng because it gives me the opportunity to go into any of them.
These paths are different enough that they have some different skillsets, requirements, and knowledge needed to go into them. The IT/cybersecurity route needs certifications and experience in things like linux, whereas the hardware/embedded systems route needs more computer logic and architecture knowledge and low-level stuff.

Any advice on how I should go about choosing which path to take and what to learn?

I know I like coding and I really enjoyed my programming classes, the one in C was great. I'm currently exploring software dev mainly, learning web development and doing small Javascript projects on my own. I'm also learning linux and a bit cybersec here and there, and I might dive deeper into that world later. I haven't really taken any hardware-focused classes other than the first class on computer organization, so I was going to wait till I get to them higher level classes and electives to really start diving in.

My problem is that I don't want to be stuck not knowing what I want to do come senior year. There's quite the electives list with some classes that could be categorized into the 3 paths I listed, and i have no idea which ones to take, I can only take a few. 

I want to hopefully get internships as early as possible, but I'm not sure what kind of internships to pursue and what skills to build. Since the skillsets are different, it would take a lot of time to build skills in each area, and even then, the things I may learn will only be surface level and maybe not representative of what the work is actually like.

From my understanding, I need skills to get internships during college and jobs after, but if I'm in this limbo not knowing what path to take, I feel as though I can't be focused in pursuing a certain skillset and tailor my resume and skills to that certain career path. I'd kinda be all over the place with barely any skills in any of the three paths. Is it ok to be exploring for a while? To me it feels unproductive not knowing what in doing. I've also heard people tell me ""why are you doing web dev if you're computer engineering?"" To which I have no response other than idk what I really want to do and I'm exploring. External factors and what people say I should or shouldn't go into due to x or y reason might also pressures me. People say hardware is dead, or there's no money in this or that field, which I don't really want to affect my decision because they're all pretty well paying imo.

Any help would be greatly appreciated"

My stomach dropped.

I don’t have a math or science recommendation.

Now I’m scrambling to get one of my math or science teachers to write me one.  I can’t believe I missed this detail.  Do you think it’s a big deal if my application is missing a STEM teacher recommendation?  Do you think Brown would look past that deficiency since I have a recommendation from a professor when I did a scientific research internship?  He obviously didn’t teach me for a class, but he mentored me.  Also, if I get a teacher to write it for me but it’s not submitted before the deadline (which is in three days), how much time does that teacher have to submit the recommendation after the deadline?

*I’m freaking out.*

I really hope I didn’t write four supplements just for them to throw my application in the trash because I don’t have a STEM teacher recommendation.

Update: Okay, I’ve reached out to two teachers.  We’ll see how this goes...

Update 2: One of my teachers responded and agreed to write me a letter!  I’m saved!"

Demographics: White, homeschooled, male from Mississippi. I come from a fairly rural area. (Not sure if that makes a difference though) 

Education: This is the part I’m the most worried on. I can’t taken any AP classes because I’m homeschooled and I can’t even take the AP exams because of COVID-19. To compensate for this I have taken dual-enrollment classes at a local community college and I plan on having taken a total of 8 classes there by the end of my senior year including Calculus I, II, and III, Physics I and II, Computer science, English comp, and maybe a few other classes. I didn’t have many classes during my sophomore and the beginning of my junior year because of a legitimate medical condition. I’ve also taken quite a bit of EdX courses on physics. 

Stats: 1500 SAT, I plan on taking the Math II Subject test and the Physics subject test in the future. I’m pretty sure I can do well in the Physics subject test since I’ve already taken the MIT ocw on physics and take many AP physics practice tests in my spare time.

- Performed my own research projects at a local college and published papers on them. 

-I created a website to help high school physics student visualize physics and the math behind physics better, which I have struggled with in the past. 

-I wrote a fun book that had cartoon pictures for the purpose of helping physics students visualize calculus/physics. 

-Captain of my track and field and cross country team. (In case your wondering there’s a local track club for homeschool where we run against other school or other homeschool clubs) I was ranked the best middle distance homeschooled runner for my age group in the nation a couple of years ago. 

-I’m thinking about working for the Army Corps of Engineers (someone told me they had high school internships) over the summer but not really sure at the moment. 

-I also play guitar and most of my community service comes from playing the guitar at local nursing homes or churches. 

-30 plus ACT club. We met and we basically just help each other with standardized testing strategies and more. 

I’m also planning on starting a science Olympiad team next year, but I’m not entirely sure if that’s a good idea or if I should focus on something else. 

Awards: 
I don’t really have many awards but I’m gonna list all the one I have. 

-I won a math and science competition at a local college and an $8,000 dollar scholarship. 

-2 National Latin exam gold metals

-I’m taking the PSAT in January and I’m pretty confident in qualifying to become a national merit scholar. My state is one of the easiest to do so. 

-National Honors society. 

-Math National Honors society. 

-I also want to enroll in a science fair to possibly win another award to put on the common app because I feel like I’m having a hard time expressing to college that I’m capable of attending their college but I’m having trouble finding a good science fair because of COVID-19. If anyone knows any, please reply with the link. 

Letters of Recommendation: 

I have pretty good letters of recommendation. One is from the professor I worked on a few research projects with and I’m still trying to decide between a few other people for my other letters of recommendation. 

More information: 
I was diagnosed with POTS which made it pretty hard to do really anything. One of my essay ideas was to write how I overcame the restrictions of POTS. I’m also homeschooled and I’m worried about a college rejecting me because of that. It made it difficult to do any extracurriculars or compete in competitions because I don’t have a school to help with that. I feel like being homeschooled during the corona virus has placed a lot of restrictions on me but I’ve done all I can really think of and tried to take advantage of every opportunity that I’ve been given. I’ve emailed colleges in the past about this and they said they had a holistic approach where they look at how well you take advantage of the opportunities you’ve been given. They also said that they considered dual enrollment classes to be the same level as AP and they wouldn’t hold me at a disadvantage because I haven’t been given the ability to take any AP classes. So I’m a little less worried about that now. I’m still a little worried about not having many awards though and I’m not sure how well this will play into the admissions process. I still feel like I’m missing something in my application but I’m not sure if that’s because I’m comparing myself to other students who don’t an untraditional eduction like I do. I have an obvious passion for physics which I hope the admissions officers will see. :) 
I’m also planning on applying to many other schools like Georgia Tech, Vanderbilt, Washington University in St. Louis, Duke, Carnegie Mellon, and a few more. I’m not really sure if I have a good chance at any of these schools."

I've sent hundreds of applications and I've even emailed some local companies kind of implying that I'll work mostly for experience, but no luck. I have not limited myself to aerospace, but I'd really like to get a job in that industry as I feel that the technical nature of a lot of that work would suit me more. Is there anything that I can do or learn to try to stand out more? Are there any skills that would you would like to see on a resume, maybe with an accompanying project? Should I try to go back to school and hope that the job market is better in a few years?

I am currently a student in pharmacy school and have had huge struggles with my sleep, and am looking to see if anyone has tips or tricks to make their lives a little easier

So as backstory, I got diagnosed less than a year ago at 22 with inattentive, and it’s been a wild ride! I tried multiple medications, but found that a short acting stimulant was my best bet, as my schedule is not consistent enough to regularly take a long acting, and my body metabolizes the long acting meds faster than it should (mydayis only lasted 10-12 hours, if that). Currently taking Adderall IR 30 mg three times a day, and while it definitely works, I don’t ever get a buzz, or a “zing” and can definitely sleep on my meds, which shows how severe my adhd has been! 

So I am currently in school which is online and has no consistency (classes are the same time each week, but not each day and exams and work load varies from week,) and also have 2 pharmacy jobs where I am an “as needed” intern, meaning I have literally no semblance of consistency or a schedule. One job has me work anywhere from 8-5:30 (and lately it’s been purely at 8am which is torture) while the other can have me work anywhere from 6:30-3, 1-9:30 Pm, or even 3-11:30Pm. To make matters worse, I have always been a night owl, and I have no problem functioning on little to no sleep (my symptoms get worse, but I am able to still be ok, once I get awake of course). So all of this added together, plus some really nasty delayed circadian rhythm disorder, has made me average 4-5 hours of sleep a night, and then 12-13 on my few days off. My question for everyone is, what do you do to be able to get to bed earlier? My problem is not falling asleep, but rather actually having enough executive function to go to bed. My brain would rather stay up to play video games (my main form of relaxation) or even scroll on TikTok in bed rather than go to sleep, which while stimulating in the short run, has been affecting my overall mental health and well-being in the long run. I thought that trying to allieve time blindness would help, so I put up clocks where I can see them, but all it did was make me painfully aware of how late it is getting and I still choose to keep going despite the small amount of sleep I will get. 

I’ve been running late from work, waking up for alarms and then going back to sleep, which has me oversleep for work, and sleeping until 6pm on my day off, which sets my circadian rhythm back even worse. I seriously appreciate any advice or tips or anything you guys have, because actions suggested in therapy haven’t been super successful so far."

I realize that if all you do is worry, you're just setting yourself up for failure, so heres something I wish I would've read first before getting worked up over the legitimacy of a computer science degree:

\- My dad graduated in finance and accounting way back when. I don't even think he worked in that field but instead has been working IT for 20+ years for the same company. Everything he does today was self taught and he makes six figures. Not to mention, this dude has an iPhone 5 *still.* All of his colleagues graduated with some form of computer technology, but my dad is one of the more respected employees. He has a C++ book from when he started his job (1990s) and thats how he learned to do what he does. He fixes codes and even writes funny messages into them to see if anyone notices. (They don't because they're all too focused on petty tasks instead of the big picture)

\- My brother graduated a couple years ago in MIS and has a great job that loves him. Although I haven't even dipped my toes in CS compared to most of you, he doesn't know much about what I'm learning either. He has a more than livable wage and is happy because he enjoys his career. He's friends with CS majors who never had issues getting jobs, whether it be a huge company or a lowkey gig that still pays more than your average college grad.

\- Lastly, before I switched from ***general studies*** to computer science, I had to participate in a career leadership program and interview someone in an industry that I wanted to be in. I chose NASA. NO computer background other then freelance web design/development, but I still had a good attitude. I talked to a recruiter who told me to contact him when I had 30+ credits for an internship in their technology department because he's hip-to-hip with the internship director. Needless to say, my brain couldn't form a sentence after he said that.

Anyways, my naive point is... I think career opportunities depend on willingness to learn and your ability to keep on keeping on (despite the intense competitiveness). A professor once told me, ""Think like a child and execute like a professional"". So today, I am picking up my first C++ crash course book and starting this rollercoaster of a career. Nonetheless, I wish there were more posts about staying positive because after 10 minutes of reading this subreddit, I was convinced this major was equivalent to a degree in dance."

I've seen some posts regarding how to invest 100k as well as what to do with your assets before moving down to the US for work as a new grad, and have created a rough plan on how to invest my assets. 

I created this post to ask for some advice regarding this plan.

Context:

\- Canadian Citizen 

\- Graduating in 2021

\- Have roughly 100k CAD sitting in HISA across multiple accounts (made from internships throughout university)

\- Have around 30k in OSAP loans

\- Will be moving to the US in August 20201 (Not California, New Jersey or Georgia)

\- I currently plan on eventually returning to Canada in 5-10 years

&amp;#x200B;

Current Plan: 

\- Paying off all of my student loans

\- Not opening a TFSA given that the IRS does not grant tax-deferred status to the Canadian TFSA

\- Opening up an RRSP and maxing that out. I'm planning on maybe starting with a RoboAdvisor or self-directed with XGRO or VGRO.

\- Transferring some money to USD to help with expenses in the US (maybe around 10k)

\- Leaving the rest in an HISA in Canada

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how I should adjust my plans are greatly appreciated, thanks!"

Major: MechE


Demo: White, Male, NJ


GPA: 
Weighted - 4.11
Unweighted - idk where to find it but probably 3.9 since I had a couple A-‘s and one B


SAT: 1450


Workload:
All honors classes since freshman year aside from electives
One dual-enrollment


Essays:
I would like to think they are pretty good. Not too out of the box but I didn’t want to make anything up since I’m kind of boring.
My main essay was about my family business and how much it meant to me


APs:
Calc BC
Physics C
Human Geography 
Environmental Science
(No scores since I’m taking them this year)


ECs:
1. Family Business - 40,000 hours maybe? 
I have been working there my entire life. Both my parents work there so until the age of around 13 I had to be there any time I wasn’t in school. Basically all my free time goes here because I have to help since finding good employees that want to work for minimum wage is impossible.

2. Soccer - club and high school
County and state awarded for high school. I was also captain senior year. Successful club team but not an academy.

3. Music - Trumpet 9 years
I played up until 11th grade when I wasn’t enjoying what the atmosphere was like at my school band. I was an above average player and did some solos at town events.

4. Science National Honors Society - Member
Only 12th grade but I don’t think you can even get in unless your a senior. Does someone else know about this?

5. Engineering Competition Leader in 11th grade
Not much to say. We got 2nd in the district though so not bad.

6. Reglious - Church studies as well as a bit of volunteering through the church.
I’m not sure if I should include this one since it seems kind of weak


Just for some extra info:
I was offered admission to every honors society but had to turn them down since up until this year I never had the ability to put in the required hours after school.

I decided to apply to primarily T20ish schools because if I am going to end up going to a state school then I might as well transfer there after going to community college for free for 2 years. (State program since I am in the top 5% of my class) Also I needed to go for schools with good financial aid since my family can’t pay anything towards my tuition. If I don’t get it then I don’t lose anything but if I manage to get accepted to one, then it will be worth the effort.

Applying to:
Georgia Tech
Carnegie Mellon
Johns Hopkins
University of Michigan
University of Notre Dame
New York University
Stevens Institute of Technology (safetyish since I have been in contact with the soccer coach about playing there)


After seeing some of the EC’s of other people applying to T20s like internships, countless hours volunteering, and starting businesses, I feel like I’m really behind. I think aside from my EC my application is potentially competitive but I honestly have no idea. I’m not expecting to get in based off accomplishments but hopefully they want some hard workers with different experiences maybe?

I'm at a point in my life where I feel just completely lost and every day that goes by I feel like I'm doing absolutely nothing with my life. There's no sob story; I don't feel like I have depression or anything, but I do feel like the more time goes by where I can't figure out what I want to do the more meaningless my life feels.

Here's some backstory:

I went to a pretty decent university for information systems and I did a dual major with business management. I graduated rank #1 in the business division and top 1% on campus as far as GPA went. The student organization that I was president of was Student Organization of the Year and I was also the recipient of Student of the Year award. I also had so much scholarship money that I went to school on a triple full ride scholarship.

My goal was to get into IT, but after 4 IT internships (and nearly upon graduation), I realized that I absolutely hated IT so I feel like I essentially scrapped my Information Systems major.

I'm not someone who is motivated by money and that isn't necessarily the end game. Being that I'm not in any debt, I'm okay with something that's more fulfilling or rewarding to me intrinsically, but money would be obviously be okay too.

Other information that may or may not be useful:

MBTI personality type (officially proctored exam - not some random online test): ENFP

I love helping others grow and reach their goals.

I love working with other people.

I love being in a leadership position.

I want to be in a position that has upward mobility.

I really enjoy constantly learning, however I am incredibly quick to get bored with one subject and quickly be moving on to another. I try to control this urge as much as I can and grind through learning when I have to.

My management advisor (one of the smartest people I know) told me that they think I would be an incredible politician. I don't have any interest in being a politician.

My information systems advisor said that I should just suck up how I feel and become a business analyst.

My wife said she doesn't care what I do as long as I'm happy.

Young 20s, male, live in a rural town with limited job opportunities (wife is doing well at her job and works in the area so moving is out of the question unless she gets transferred)

To be honest, I don't even know where to begin and I'm looking for people to ask questions in the comments and help me talk this out. I genuinely appreciate anyone who takes the time to help me out."

I graduate in December 2021 (2 more semesters). I have a 3.45 GPA, my school is good, but it’s not a large name brand school live harvard, princeton, etc. it’s just a normal school. I live in Chicago and plan to work here after school. I do well in classes but I haven’t been able to land an internship. I didn’t look much my freshman year summer, my sophmore year summer I looked but never found one. And my junior year summer (last summer) covid hit and most internships canceled so again I couldn’t land one. I’m going to try to get one this summer but so far everything I’ve interviewed for has been a no. I’m doing okay in coding challenges, I’m getting much better at technical interviews. I’m really trying here and i still have 0 relevant experience on my resume. I’ve had a full time job for 3 and a half years now and that’s on my resume but that’s about it for my work experience. As i get closer and closer to graduation i just feel more and more like I’m screwed and my lack of experience will hurt me. I would like to pursue some sort of software development but I don’t know much beyond that in terms of what I’d like my job to be. Any help, advice, similar situation outcomes and really anything would help at this point. Thanks in advance."

kphdc6,0,2021-01-03,Grad school/general questions,overkill_please,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/kphdc6/grad_schoolgeneral_questions/,"Hey everyone, I am currently a senior in my undergrad that is graduating next spring semester. I'm in the process of applying to multiple grad schools for a masters in bioinformatics, biomedical data science, or similar departments.

First of all, my GPA isn't that great. It was as low as 2.7 going into last fall semester, however I've made a good recovery and it is at a 2.95 now, and I most likely will get it above a 3 by the end of next semester.

My questions are:

1. I am a genetics major and a computer science minor, and my main interest is combining comp sci with anything biology related. I've seen some people on here express regret in choosing bioinformatics as their field even after spending so much time in it. I'm afraid I might be specializing too much if I go forward and lock in doing bioinformatics. Are there any broader alternatives that might be safer than doing bioinformatics that I should consider?

2. Given my GPA as bad as it is, how important is it that I get it above a 3 this next semester, and how many schools should I be thinking about applying to in order to at least get into one? I'm thinking around 10 would be the best option.

3. I'm assuming the worst case, where I don't get into grad school. What should the next option be? Look for a internship at either a company or lab, work for a couple of years, then re-apply to grad school?

4. What should I be doing in my free time to polish up on coding? Are there any resources out there that I should be looking at? This past semester I took a bioinformatics class that revolved around python. We coded for things like euler's assembly, branch and bound to assemble phylogenetic trees, the baum-welch algorithm, etc."

kpke82,5,2021-01-03,Thoughts on 2nd semester deferral?,DrafteeDragon,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/kpke82/thoughts_on_2nd_semester_deferral/,"I’ll try and be as blunt as possible to keep this short.

I’m a 2nd year student studying STEM. My holidays were shit, a family member died and I essentially helped take care of all the technicalities that come with a recent death. Along with that, I can’t go back to the UK because of this new mutant covid strain (I’m at risk) and I have exams soon. I’m not ready for those exams considering my mental health has plummeted to the center of the earth and I feel like I know absolutely nothing of my degree. I’m also stuck at home where I can barely concentrate due to how hectic everything is.

Here comes the catch, I was hoping to defer my 2nd semester and start my second year again fresh next year. I’ll keep studying during those months but it’ll be at a pace where I don’t feel like I want to disappear everyday. I have a friend who already deferred so I won’t be alone next year. Moreover, with the current vaccine situation, it’s not too far fetched to believe face to face teaching will be back. If I do decide to continue and finish this year with mediocre results, I’ll have done 1/2 of my degree online. While not a foolproof plan, I can still take time to study and get good results next year instead of settling for a low 2:1. 

Important info: Not on a student visa, I started my degree in sept 2019 and I live in the EU. My first year result was a 2:1 but doesn’t count towards my degree. I might also get an internship during the time where I don’t study and I’m an athlete so I’ll have more time for personal training. Right now, I’m averaging a low 1st for my second year but that will change soon. 

Thank you for your time and help in advance"

kprpds,7,2021-01-03,I got my degree in secondary education in May and I have no intention of using it. Am I making the right call?,difficultAmoeba,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/kprpds/i_got_my_degree_in_secondary_education_in_may_and/,"Hi! I'm a 20 something year old straight out of college and I have no intention of using the degree I just spent four years working on! Now I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. Here's why...

1. My student teaching internship was cut a little over a month short the day I was going to start my solo unit (thanks to Covid-19) and I didn't wind up applying for my license after graduation because I was filled with doubts about my ability. 
2. I am endorsed in a different state than where I am living and working and that state has a VERY different way of teaching. I was trained using Proficiency Based Learning (which was horrific to watch in action during my internship) and my state has a traditional approach to learning. I am nervous that I do not have the knowledge and experience needed to work here and I have no interest in struggling to teach in a proficiency based school system. 
3. My friends that are teaching currently HATE it. They are feeling used, abused, and underpaid and it's deterring me from trying. 
4. I feel too young to teach in a secondary school. The small age gap is daunting. I had VERY combative students in my internship and they made it known that they did not respect me because I was only 3-4 years older than them. 
5. I don't want to start my career over Zoom. 

Now, my internship was awful, but it's not like I didn't like teaching entirely. I did enjoy lesson planning and seeing students improve based on my actions. I just don't know if I'll be any good at teaching or enjoy my career. I'm not particularly thrilled by my concentration and I feel like I made a huge mistake choosing this path. 

I am currently the director of an after school program where I assist children with virtual learning and create/schedule/lead activities for them in the afternoon. It pays well and I am technically using my degree, but this job is not fulfilling in the slightest. 

I don't know what I'm trying to get at my making this post... I just don't know what I'm doing and everyone in my family has pursued very different career paths so they have no advice. Any thoughts?"

First of all, happy new year to everyone :)

After months and months of trying, i was able to land some internship interviews. I have a question regarding this one in particular (let's call it X), it is not a FAANG company. 

I am a 3rd year CS student with no prior experience and i plan on wokring as a Software Engineer, my other interviews (one at a FAANG (Y) and another at a non FAANG (Z)  ) are ""software developer/engineering jobs"" (these haven't happened either).

For company X, the pay is better and is a ""bigger"" company than Z, the issue is that the title of the job is ""Data Warehouse Developer"", i will ask the interviewer about the roles and responsibilities but  i am no sure about what do you do as a Data Warehouse Developer? 

I read old posts here but those didn't answer my question. For someone who aims to become a software engineer, should i accept this job if i get it? Would it help me advanve in my career or not? 

My priority is company Y but if not, i will have to take either of X or Z

Another issue is: Z (software developer) is a 4 months long internship meanwhile, Y (database warehousing, is 16 months long)

If i don't get into FAANG, what job would you recommend me take (if i get it of course), at company X or company Z?


I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, my sincere apologies, i am really confused and not sure what to do 

Thank you for taking your time to read my post!"

kpuwo9,82,2021-01-03,Review of Rutgers CS - Part 1: My journey and questions,alphacentauri3,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/kpuwo9/review_of_rutgers_cs_part_1_my_journey_and/," Since there was a lot of interest, here is my experience of being a CS major at Rutgers and what I’ve learned in general. I’ll split this into two posts; one post will be my experience and answering general questions and the second will be geared more towards classes. So, let me start this off with my journey. I started out in Rutgers as a mechanical engineering major and after 2 years, I realized I wasn’t really interested in it. In my attempts to find a new career path, I found this online course called CS50, Harvard’s Intro to CS course. It covered topics ranging from C to data structures to web development to SQL. It was pretty advanced, especially for an intro course, but I really enjoyed it and decided to dive in and pursue CS at Rutgers. Overall, from the first CS course to the last, it took me 4 semesters to complete my CS degree. I ended up doing a BA degree instead of a BS (reason explained later). I’ll breakdown each semester to give you more of an idea on my understanding at each time period and list the CS courses I did that semester. Since I started doing CS off semester (Spring), I had 2 summers to do internships.

&amp;#x200B;

**Classes I took:**

**Core:**

CS111 (Intro to CS), CS112 (Data Structures), CS205 (Discrete 1), CS206 (Discrete 2), CS211 (Computer Architecture), CS344 (Algorithms)

**Electives:**

CS214 (Systems Programming), CS336 (Databases), CS416 (Operating Systems), CS419 (Computer Security), ECE 424 (Cryptography)

&amp;#x200B;

**Semester 1: The jump in**

I only took CS111 this semester. Since I had already done a majority of CS50 by this point, this course felt really easy for me. It felt more like a review and I made sure to get more comfortable on concepts that confused me, like recursion. The projects weren’t too bad – at most, it took me about a day to do them. Since I didn’t have much going on this semester, I started to learn data structures by myself. I would typically just google data structures and watch videos about them, i.e. what’s a stack, how’s it used, how it’s implemented. This is the semester I also learned about leetcode.com, a site which gives you coding problems that you’d typically see in interviews. I jumped in and got more comfortable working with various data structures and problem solving. I chose Python as my interviewing language, which is still my most preferred language for interviewing, since it’s easy to write and very easy to implement most standard data structures/algos.

At this point, the only project on my resume was a stock trading web app created with Python/Flask/SQL. This project was actually one of the assignments from CS50 that I felt was complex enough to put as a resume project.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer 1: First “internship”**

By this point, I had only taken CS111 so I really didn’t know all that much. I realized that this summer I probably wouldn’t get an industry internship. However, this didn’t stop me from applying. I applied to several places like AT&amp;T, UHG, etc. I tried targeting places that primarily did behavioral interviews because my grasp on data structures was fairly limited. I ended up getting a few interviews, but ultimately didn’t get any offer. So, I looked to the next best thing: research. I went through the list of professors for CS, ECE, and even for Neuroscience. I ended up sending out emails to the professors whose research I was interested in. Most of them were extremely nice and willing to let me a part of their group, despite my limited knowledge. I ended up working with a professor in the CS department on machine learning algorithms. I ended up doing about 20 hours of (unpaid) work during the summer. From having no idea what machine learning was, I got introduced to the entire field and got my feet wet with learning Python, Numpy, Scikit-learn, etc. The next summer, I really wanted to get industry experience. As such, I started applying very early to internships – I probably started applying in July 2020 for Summer 2021.

Since I was only working 20 hours per week, I had a lot of time to prepare myself more with data structures, so I continued doing light prep. I also created a more comprehensive web app with Python/Flask that gave users information about popular tourist sites around the world. I also deployed this app so others could see it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Semester 2: Finally learning data structures**

I took CS112 and CS205 this semester. Data structures is the single most important course for doing well in interviews, so I focused all my energy on making sure I understood every possible concept in data structures. I would also spend some time doing Leetcode this semester since my schedule was pretty light. After taking data structures, I realized I really enjoyed it. To me, it was like solving a puzzle, but with code. I also became an LA for CS111 this semester and got more comfortable with solving problems in front of people and being able to explain my thoughts in a clear and succinct way.

I also continued to apply to internships for the following summer. I was able to get a few interviews and ended up getting 2 offers.

*Lessons learned:* I’ll describe what I think was most useful in getting an internship. My resume had 2 pretty simple projects on my resume at this point. Both projects were done using Python/Flask (learned from CS50), with one of the projects being the same project as given in CS50. I also had my summer research experience on it at this point (which wasn’t all that impressive because I barely knew what ML was). Apart from that, just being comfortable with data structures was super important in interviewing. I definitely needed to practice a lot on Leetcode to be somewhat decent at problem solving. I also got a whiteboard and practiced doing problems on that, instead of on the computer to better simulate an interview setting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Semester 3: Dying from CS**

Now that I had an internship fixed for the summer, I decided to focus more on classes. This semester I took CS206, CS211, CS214, CS336 and a non-CS elective. I also continued to LA for CS111. This semester was a struggle – as soon as a project from one class would end, two other classes would give out their next projects. I only took on such a schedule because I was trying to finish my degree by my normal graduation date. This semester, I focused solely on classes and didn’t do any extra projects or work on my interviewing for obvious reasons. CS211 difficulty wise and time spent was on the same level as CS112. CS336 wasn’t difficult and only got time intensive towards the end when we had a group project, but even that wasn’t too bad (took about 20 hours). CS206 didn’t have any projects so it was just occasional homework. The backbreaker this semester was CS214 since I had the misfortune of getting insanely long projects and the misfortune of having a partner who didn’t code a single line.

*Lessons learned:* Do not take this many CS courses at one time. People said it was a bad idea and I can unfortunately have the pleasure of being able to confirm that. I did it out of necessity, but if it can be helped, please don’t do this to yourself. Classes are meant for you to learn something interesting and gain valuable knowledge. Cramming this much information into your head in such a short period of time doesn’t bode well for understanding all of it. To be able to fully understand all of it requires an even greater time commitment. Passing a class for the sake of passing is very different than truly understanding the material.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer 2: Real world experiences**

Being at a large company, I finally got a chance to see what codebases look like in a professional setting and what software engineers do. My project for the summer was working with a modern web development stack (React, Node, Go) and implementing several features across both frontend (UI) and backend (business logic). This was my first real software engineering experience and despite not knowing any of those technologies before, I learned it on the job and honestly had a lot of fun.

To get more familiar with React/Node, I also worked with a couple other friends to create a web application game. This project taught me so many new things – from working in such a close team to getting a product from the first line of code to deploying it and having it be played by all our friends. There were definitely many struggles along the way, both in terms of teamwork as well as technical challenges. Not having initially planned for it, I got to learn things like Socket IO, Redis, scaling and distributed systems for this project.

Also, since the upcoming semester was going to be my last one, I devoted some time to practicing for interviews. I tried to solve 1 Leetcode problem every day during my internship and while I started out strong, about halfway into the summer, I just got exhausted and ended up doing more like 1-2 problems per week.

*Lessons learned:* I was probably coding 10-11 hours a day this summer – including work/project/interviewing practice. After a while it got extremely tiring, but I learned so much about how to work on large codebases with many team members. I got super comfortable with using Git and learned how to write more modular and cleaner code. I wouldn’t recommend doing this much coding unless you have a true passion for what you’re working on. I definitely liked coding, but I didn’t want to make it my entire life. Like I mentioned, about halfway in the summer, my coding time shrank pretty significantly, and afterwards, I mainly just focused on work. I tried to go out more and hang out with friends towards the latter weeks of the summer.

By the end of this summer, I felt confident in my ability. I had created several projects by this point and had written each one from scratch. I was also able to learn completely new technologies at work and even used them to create another project. And while I hadn’t done as many interview prep problems as I would have liked, I felt that my knowledge of data structures and problem solving were good enough. While this summer was definitely exhausting (especially in the beginning), the end results were definitely well worth it!

&amp;#x200B;

**Semester 4: Almost at the finish line**

This semester I took CS344, CS416, CS419, ECE424. I continued being an LA for CS111 and was also a TA for CS112. I became a CS112 TA because I really enjoyed the course when I took it and I figured it’s the best way to prep for interviews. This position felt like a great review of data structures and it also helped with my ability to problem solve in front of people and explain concepts to them in a clear and succinct manner.

My favorite class this semester was CS416. I loved understanding more about how computers work and what an OS actually does. I would say this semester was fairly busy, but the workload for everything was definitely pretty manageable. CS419 and ECE424 weren’t difficult or time intensive at all so this made up for being a TA for 2 courses.

I was also interviewing for full time positions this semester. Due to Covid, hiring had definitely slowed a bunch. Places where I was getting interviews last year were flat out rejecting me, even though I probably knew 10x more than I did at this point in the prior year. I ended up only getting 3 interviews and out of that, I ended up getting an offer from a company I had wanted ever since I decided to switch into the field and after so much work, I had finally done it! It was a breath of relief and triumph that I had finally finished what I had set out to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I’m also going to answer some expected questions that might come up. These are just my opinions

**1. How much does GPA matter?**

\- It depends. If you’re targeting industry, you’ll be fine if you have a GPA above 3.0. Of course, if you have a 3.9 GPA, that will certainly enhance your resume, but the 3.0 limit means that if you’re hovering somewhere around a 3.1 – 3.3, GPA won’t necessarily be the limiting factor in terms of you getting the interview. There are some exceptions to this. If you’re targeting hedge funds and the sort, I think having a GPA above 3.7 would be ideal. If you’re targeting grad school, I’d say having above a 3.5 would be ideal

\- These are just rough limits in terms of what you should try to aim for. Most of you are probably targeting standard industry positions so all this is to say that don’t beat yourself up over getting straight A’s in every single class. In reality, it really doesn’t matter all that much as long as you’re above 3.0. Try to have fun with your classes and learn the most you can out of them. Your passion and thirst for knowledge will take you much further

\- Lastly, going with this theme, it’s completely okay to have a couple W’s (withdraws) on your transcript. No one will question you about it. It only becomes a concern if you are routinely doing this, i.e. 1 W every single semester might start to raise concerns. For the most part, don’t worry about this. I had 2 W’s and it was never even brought up in any setting.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. How important are hackathons?**

\- I personally never liked hackathons. I don’t like the atmosphere of having to work on the project for 24 hours (sometimes more/less) and eating junk food for fuel. I also get incredibly bored after doing the same thing for more than a couple hours. As such, I never attended a single hackathon. I also don’t think they would be that useful for me. If I want to learn a new technology, for example, let’s say I want to learn iOS development. I find it more useful to take my own time to learn the general details before I start a project. Hacakthons seem too rushed for me to gain anything valuable out of them.

\- Also, often times, you probably won’t build out a complete project and several things don’t work. I find it more meaningful to finish projects in their entirety so I can show off a fully featured project. Of course, this is just personal preference. If you want to just expose yourself to the technology and don’t want to put in that much time building it, hackathons can be good exposure. Also, you can put in however much time you want into hackathons. If you get tired after a couple hours, you can just stop; no one is going to force you to build the product to its full capability. I would say go to one just to try it and make your decision to go/not go after that.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Is there a difference between the BA/BS degree?**

\- This was a question I struggled with when I started doing CS so I thought it’s worth mentioning. The BS degree has more science/math requirements, as well as 2 more CS electives compared to the BA. Since I was trying to finish CS in a relatively short period of time, I elected to go the BA route since I’d have to take less classes. The good thing is that it doesn’t really matter which option you choose, at least for the industry route. No employer is going to turn you away because you have a BA instead of a BS. For instance, some colleges like Harvard only give out BA degrees and very few employers are going to take the time to search through if your school offers both, so choose whichever you feel most comfortable with. What’s more important is the reason you’re choosing to do a BA degree.

\- If you’re simply choosing it because it’s less work, that might not necessarily be the best approach. Remember, all your classes are a way for you to learn and get the most out of your degree. Don’t get a degree just to get one; ultimately, you should be taking classes so you are able to learn fundamental concepts in CS so you can do something interesting and worthwhile later in your career.

\- A BA degree might be useful if you’re in a time crunch and need to finish the degree quickly. It could also be useful if you have experience from several internships and you feel that your learning during those will be better than the learning from the actual classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Are there any teachers to stay away from?**

\- I’ve had a good experience with almost all (but one) CS professors. The only one I would be cautious of is Francisco. His teaching method is to spend half the class talking about the material in the previous class and the remaining half on new material. I actually really liked this method initially, but after a while it starts to feel really slow and dragged on. He also just writes notes on notepad and paint, which isn’t really the most useful. However, my main fault with him is not his teaching methods necessarily, but his lack of organization in projects and the class.

\- The projects (at least in my experience) were unnecessarily long and I wasn’t even learning anything after some time working on them. The project descriptions were really poor, and you had to always have to take time out of your day to ask him clarification and half the time, he would give contradictory statements on what he wants you to do. If you have the time in your schedule, I’d say avoid him. However, if you have to take a certain class (i.e. Systems, OS, etc.) by a certain semester and your only other option is to not take the course, I would say take the course with him, but try to take one less class this semester in case he’s in the mood for his antics.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Most useful experiences?**

\- I would say my most useful experience during my time in college was being a TA/LA. I was a TA for both CS111 and CS112, but the class you TA for doesn’t matter. I think being a TA is a great experience because 1) it really reinforces your understanding of the subject and 2) gives you great public speaking/problem solving experience. These are extremely important skills in any setting, but especially for interviews. It’s also a fantastic experience that shows that you are able to handle a certain level of responsibility and you want to teach other people.

\- During most of my interviews, being a TA was always brought up and the interviewers really loved that I was willing to go out of my way to pass on my knowledge. It also shows that you are able to explain difficult concepts to someone who might not have prior knowledge about it, another very important skill.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Best way to do well in classes?**

\- This will vary a little depending on the course, but there are many general ways to do well in classes.

\- Always (always, always) start projects early. I generally started projects within the first week that they were assigned (if they didn’t overlap). You will have overlapping projects as you get into higher level CS courses. Try to do your best to manage them. I generally don’t multitask that well so if I had 3 projects given to me, I would just focus on whichever one I thought was the easiest and try to get it out of the way ASAP. Then, I would move on to the next project. You will never know how long a project will actually take. It might seem pretty simple at first, but the more you get into it, you may find out it’s harder than expected. OS projects generally took me 20 hours but systems projects took me 50 hours, on average. Even though OS is a more advanced course, the projects turned out to be much less time consuming. Do your best to plan ahead but try to make incremental progress on projects each day. Don’t wait until the last week unless you’re ready for long late nights of coding

\- Take the right number of classes per semester. I’ll answer how many I think is good in another question, but don’t overdo it or underdo it. If you figure out you can handle 2 CS courses, try to stick to that amount and don’t jump to doing 4 courses. If you’re able to handle more, then do that and stick to it. This is a pretty personal decision

\- Get familiar with Git. It’ll allow you to collaborate with other people on projects. After CS211, you will rarely do projects on your own. Git is also going to be super important once you start working (although there are other types of version control…) so it’s good to get a good grasp of it early on. It’s not something you can really learn unless you actually do it so go try it out and take advantage of it!

\- Find friends in classes and study together. Due to commuting and Covid, I didn’t really get a chance to do this. However, having friends helps you to bounce ideas off each other and have credible choices for partner/group projects. This doesn’t mean that you should copy off your friends for projects. Do all the projects on your own!! It’ll be harder and more tedious, but you will come out a stronger engineer. However, you can and should talk about how you might approach a project and any roadblocks you encounter along the way. You should also join the CS discord if you need any help with any of your courses.

\- Go to a TA if you’re ever confused. This goes for professor office hours as well. Most people don’t take advantage of this, especially in upper level courses. Most, if not all, TAs will be very willing to help and are all extremely nice and polite.

\- Lastly, CS and software engineering are fields where you can only learn from textbooks/tutorials for so long. To truly understand it, you have to just do it. If you keep staring at the code for Dijkstra’s algorithm and you’re not understanding it, it’s not just going to magically happen. Run through a simple test case to see how the code flows. If you’re trying to learn Python, make sure to read documentation for a couple days or watch tutorial videos for a couple days, but you’ll only truly understand it once you start using it.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. How many CS classes to take per semester?**

\- This is entirely up to you. I generally found taking 2-3 CS courses and 1 elective is manageable for myself. I could stretch this to 4 CS courses and 1 elective, but the project intensive courses make this living hell. It’s also important to consider the type of CS course. For example, I would say CS336 was a light workload, but something like CS214 had a very high workload. Try pairing those types of classes together to balance them

&amp;#x200B;

**8. How useful are clubs?**

\- I personally wasn’t too interested in clubs. I attended 1 or 2 meetings and I didn’t really feel like I fit in with the people in clubs such as USACS or RUMAD. However, this was a personal decision. I think they are great for meeting people, but if it’s not your cup of tea, it’s completely fine. While I wasn’t attending meetings for clubs, I would still be on their mailing list. If I found out they had an interesting event, like someone coming to talk about distributed systems or something, I would check it out. So, it’s good to keep some sort of contact with all the clubs at minimum – you never know what kind of events may be useful. I’d recommend going to a couple meetings to find out if you want to take part in it further

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Are personal projects important and if so, what kind of projects should I do?**

\- Yes, projects are important for getting you to the interviewing stage at companies and sometimes, they’re even important during the actual interview. You should try to aim to have 2-3 projects on your resume. Try to use different technologies on each one if possible. I think a breadth approach is always better than a depth, especially early on in your career. I personally started out having 2 projects that had very similar tech stacks (Python/Flask) and gradually as I learned about different technologies, I replaced the lesser of the projects with a React/Node/Redis tech stack. I also added a fairly complex project that I did in Systems (creating a multithreaded Git client/server in C)

\- Starting off is always the hardest part. Pick something you’re interested in and passionate about. I was always interested in finance so doing a simple stock trading app was really fun for me. Bonus points if your project solves a real-world need. For example, during my second summer of CS, I created a game to better learn the technologies I was using in my internship, but also because it was something my friends and I could play during quarantine.

\- I can’t stress this enough, but don’t pick overly complex projects. If your project is too complex in that it’s very difficult to do or it’ll take a very long time to complete, you may end up losing interest in it and you’ll walk away not having learned much. This only goes for projects that you want on your resume. If you have a really cool idea that solves global hunger or something, definitely go for it, but just understand that it may not be the best project if you’re trying to prioritize getting interviews and getting projects on your resume quickly. When I say pick short projects, it’s a relative term. For some people this might mean a weekend and for others, it might mean a semester. It’s really up to you. You should maintain a consistent level of interest in your project. The timeline is up to you.

\- The project doesn’t even have to be an original idea. For example, my project for creating a stock trading app has been done countless number of times (especially since it was a class project), but it’s still a good project because it shows you’re able to work with certain technologies and use them effectively.

\- Lastly, my projects were mostly based of web applications since this is an in-demand area. However, you can choose whatever interests you (i.e. mobile, hardware, ML, etc.). If you’re interested in doing web apps, pick a frontend technology and pick a backend technology. I elected to focus on React (frontend) and Node (backend) since these were the most popular. As you learn more technologies, your tech stack will/should evolve. For instance, if you have one project in React/Node, you might try using React/Go on your next project instead.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Most important electives?**

\- I would say CS214 (Systems), CS416 (OS), CS352 (IT), and CS417 (Distributed Systems) would probably be the best electives you can take. Systems and OS go hand in hand and teach you low level programming and how a computer works. I really enjoyed the concepts taught in both these classes and I highly, highly recommend everyone take both. I was very conflicted with taking OS, especially since I had such a horrid experience in Systems, but OS really wasn’t bad. Both these classes are also in C and I believe that learning to write C well goes a long way. You’re able to pick up other languages extremely quickly and understand them from a deeper level. Also, the topics you learn in these two classes is extremely useful, no matter what type of career path in CS you want. They allow you to connect the dots between how complex systems work

\- I personally didn’t have the time to take CS352 and CS417 but I think the topics you encounter in those classes are also very important for your career.

\- If you’re interested in more machine learning classes, CS440 (Intro to AI) also seems like a good course

\- Honorary mention for CS336 (Databases). While useful, I feel it’s incredibly slow and the concepts in this class you can learn on your own. I also found it pretty boring. If you’re not in the mood for learning SQL on your own, this class is also good to take.

\- Contrary to popular belief, I didn’t find a reason to take CS213 (software methodology). I think this is one of those courses that, if you’ve done an internship, this course won’t add any significant value. However, I never took it, so take this opinion with a grain of salt.

&amp;#x200B;

**11. How many Leetcode/Hackerrank problems do I need to do to become good at being able to answer interview questions?**

\- There’s no particular number. The purpose of doing more problems is so you begin seeing patterns between problems. There may be thousands of ways to form a question which utilize binary search, but if you understand what binary search is and when you should use it, you’ll come to recognize the types of questions that require you to use it. Personally, this pattern recognition came after I did around 60 problems. Your number might be higher or lower depending on how quickly you’re able to grasp these concepts

\- Also, this number vastly depends on the types of companies that you choose to target. If you’re targeting the big names (think Google, Amazon, Snapchat, etc.), then you’ll most likely have to be relatively good at these kinds of problems. Since these companies get so many applicants, this is the fastest way for them to ensure that you understand data structures and problem solving. However, if you’re targeting companies that aren’t as competitive, chances are they’ll have much easier technical questions and some might not have them all. Generally, these companies don’t pay as much which is why they are relatively easier to get in (not always the case).

\- You can gauge the interview process for most companies on Leetcode.com under the discuss section and using Glassdoor. You can also find salary information using a link I’ll provide further down.

\- Lastly, you can do these problems in any language you want. 98% of companies will let you choose whatever you feel most comfortable with. I chose Python since it’s the easiest for me.

&amp;#x200B;

**12. How to get internships and full-time positions?**

\- Apply early. Applications usually start coming out in July/August at the earliest for the following summer.

\- Apply for coops. They’re basically internships but during the fall and spring semesters. These are generally less competitive since less people are applying to them. Taking a semester off school is also a good way to take a break and get paid at the same time. These also give your resume a significant boost because you now have more experience. They’re also really good because you’ll get experience working with multiple companies and all of them will ask you to come back, so you can have your pick of which company/project seems the most interesting/rewarding.

\- If you’re interested in a certain company, don’t be afraid to reach out a recruiter. Let’s say you really want to work at Tesla, just google “Tesla university recruiter Rutgers LinkedIn”. Often, the recruiter will have some association with Rutgers, and you can send them a message saying you’re interested in working there and that you’re excited to apply. You can also email them – their email will usually be [firstname.lastname@company.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@company.com)

\- Have a good resume. An example of one might be: [https://www.scribd.com/document/438925480/JONATHAN-MA-RESUME-docx](https://www.scribd.com/document/438925480/JONATHAN-MA-RESUME-docx). However, the format is up to you. As long a recruiter can see all the relevant information within 10 seconds, you’ll be fine. Put your personal projects, relevant extracurriculars, work experience, and education (include GPA if above 3.0)

\- Have good projects with good tech. Bonus points if your projects solve some real-world purpose. Also bonus points if you worked in a team on them

&amp;#x200B;

**13. Do I have to live and breathe CS to be good at it?**

\- Absolutely not!! This was one of the concerns I had going into CS because while it interested me, I’m not someone who codes in my free time. I don’t enjoy learning about random algorithms or doing interview problems in my spare time (more power to you if that’s you!). It is absolutely possible to do well in the career without coding in all your time.

\- This is not to say that you don’t have to be motivated. It still requires effort to do personal projects. It still requires effort to practice algorithm questions. And it still requires effort to learn new technologies on your own time. However, this once again depends on the companies you choose to target. If you aim for highly competitive places, then of course you will have to put in that effort.

&amp;#x200B;

**14. If I don’t want to be a software engineer, should I still do CS?**

\- It depends on your goal. If you still want to stay in the tech industry, but want to shift more towards management, there are roles such as PM that offer this and, in this case, I would stick with doing CS. However, if you are more interested in doing anthropology, CS may not be the most useful career path. At that point you could think about doing a CS minor or fully dropping. It depends on the career that you want to do and how useful CS will be for that career path. Software engineering is the most common job title that a CS major should expect though.

&amp;#x200B;

**15. General advice for internships?**

\- Projects are basically to spruce up your resume and get your foot in the door. Sometimes, you’ll be asked about your projects in an interview from a very high level. Once you’re at the interview, depending on the company, your behavioral skills and technical ability (data structures/algo generally) will be the determining factor

\- Once you’re able to get an internship, I would say communication, technical competency, and teamwork are the most important skills to have. You must be a good communicator. Make sure you’re always keeping your manager in the loop. They are mostly responsible for deciding if you get a return offer so it’s important to keep a good relationship with them. Your manager will probably schedule a weekly 1 on 1 with you. This is your time to talk to them about anything. Be personable and take ownership of your project. Be excited about the project and bring new ideas to the table. For example, my internship project was a web app. I noticed that under certain conditions, it became extremely slow. I brought this up to my manager and told him how we might make it faster and he told me to go out and try it. This shows that you’re taking ownership of the project and you’re actively working to make it better. Also, if you have any concerns with your project, raise them up to your manager without blaming him, the company, or any teammates. And lastly, ask questions about the project if you’re ever unsure. This doesn’t mean you should ask your manager “how can I reverse an array in JavaScript”. Make sure you’ve exhausted Google/Stack Overflow and even teammates before you approach a manager with questions like this. However, conceptual questions should always be brought up like “do you think we could use MemSQL to optimize our search times”.

\- Technical competency is self-explanatory. You’re at the internship to work so make sure your project is making steps towards completion. Most companies don’t have a strict rule like if you don’t finish the project, you won’t get a return offer and vice versa. Software engineering is complex, and managers obviously know this. You’re also an intern so they realize that it’ll take you time to get up to speed with new tech and learning a whole new codebase, but as long as you’re using your common sense, taking strides to complete the project, being a good teammate, and taking ownership, you’ll be more than fine

\- Teamwork fits into the whole mold of what I’ve already said, but it’s important for you to work well in a team. If you end up not liking your some of your team members, it’s totally fine. As long as you’re respectful and working alongside them, that is the most important part. Your attitude and personal characteristics are just as important as your technical competency. No one wants to work with someone pretentious even if you’re the most technically proficient person. This won’t get you very far, in work and in life.

&amp;#x200B;

**16. General advice for beyond school?**

\- CS is just like any other major. If you put in the effort, you’ll be fine. Don’t stress too much about the future. If you’re making strides to becoming a good engineer and learning from your classes, things will turn out well for you. If you don’t get a position you’ve been yearning for, don’t feel bad – there’s something better around the corner for you. So many times, in my life, when I got rejected from a certain job or position, it has inevitably led to a better path. Just improve your skills and you’ll go far!

\- Surround yourself with intelligent people. I was able to learn at a pretty accelerated rate because I found people who had done it before. These people will be able to guide you and mentor you. You will also learn how to be a better engineer, from learning new technologies to how to write cleaner code to seeing how motivated they are. When you’re surrounded by such motivation and intelligence, you will feel that you will be able to accomplish great things as well

\- Don’t neglect friends and yourself for trying to attain a certain position at a company. Definitely put in effort, but don’t forget about your own health (physical and mental) and don’t forget to hang out with your friends. CS is just like any major so don’t put it on some imaginary pedestal. It definitely has really amazing opportunities, but balance is the key to a healthy and prosperous life.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this was helpful for you all! When I started CS, I was very overwhelmed with everything and there was a significant lack of information. This ended up being much, much longer than I initially planned, but I really hope this helps you all out in your careers and I hope you’ll pay it forward to the next batch! Please remember these are just my experiences/opinions. This is my path and the good thing is there are many, many possible paths. There’s no such thing as you have to do W, X, Y if you want Z. You’ll learn as you go. Listen to everyone’s experience and make the decision that you feel is the best for your particular situation. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I’ll try answer them best as I can."

This is my first job as a software engineer and I had no prior internship, so I'm worried that leaving early can look bad at my resume, I have only worked here for a 3-4 months. However, I feel like this job is killing me. I am the only software engineer and I have to manage the whole backend/server. This really scares me because if anything happens, my boss looks at me all the time. I don't want to complain or anything but it's stressful having this responsibility for me especially since this is my first job ever in this field. Also I have to manage the whole backend code base all to myself, and there is no documentation or anything to help me understand the code base better and I feel that it was poorly written since there are many bugs found from our customers. I also have to talk to customers all the time if they are having trouble, but I get it since it is a start up. But also on my days off or on the weekends, my boss always text me or call me to help the customers, so work is always on my mind even on my days off which kind of sucks since I want to relax too. The pay isn't also great if that matters too.

I wanted to get your guys' opinion on if I should suck it up and stay for a couple of months or just call it quits. Thanks!

edit: this is a throwaway account."

I was offered a position working on IBM mainframe, which I have obviously never touched before but they were very forthcoming in saying they wouldn't expect me to know anything about it and training would be given on the job training and they just wanted the attitude and experience in other languages to show that I could pick it up, plus my grades, which I have.

My question is,  the IBM mainframe seems like almost ancient tech that some companies just haven't got off of yet. Is this placement going to be worth it and look good on me resume in the future? Is the IBM mainframe still something worth adding to my toolbox for a career as a developer/IT professional? ***I guess I'm just asking if this is completely outdated tech that they need someone to look after and I should look elsewhere or is this still worthwhile?***"

&amp;#x200B;

\- Summer of freshman year of college: I realize how much I struggle in interviews and get feedback on how socially awkward I am (I have Aspergers). This sent me into a depression tbh, I ended up not working this summer. That being said, I will admit I didn't put in a great amount of effort this summer as this really impacted me.

&amp;#x200B;

Summer of sophmore year of college: I apply for internships. I did score one. After working at it more, I realized that it was more like a full-time commision door -to-door sales job with ""internship"" tacked to the label. The hire rate was pretty high for this particular job as they were just looking for people open to do this work and see how they did. This was outside my comfort zone and many people quit after after just a few days. I was really commited to see it through though. I stayed there for a month, which was pretty standard, boss was open that they really didn't want employees to stay there super long time. I wasn't very good at sales and was always lower on the number of products sold compared to others. Nonetheless, I was happy to do something way out of my comfort zone (like I said I have ASpergers) and to have a job for the first time since my senior year of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Summer of junior year of college: I worked HARD to get an internship. Like I said, I MAJORLY struggle with interviews yet I was determined to not let it stop me. I was surprised how few interviews I was getting despite applying for such a ridiculous amount. I interviewed and sadly didn't get call-backs  for the few that extended interviews, two of  the three that offered interviews were similar to the internship I had before (basically hire anybody). When it seemed like I wasn't going to get an internship, I started applying for hourly jobs (better than nothing). The way this worked was basically I applied for any hourly job that said they were looking for employees online. I was shocked to only get one interview offer, I didn't ultimately get the job (it was waiting tables job). I couldn't figure out why I got so few interviews and then realized after looking through my applications that I had possibly made a mistake. It asked if I had a disability and listed Autism Spectrum as one of them and I had said yes (you could answer yes, no, or prefer not to answer).

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout senior year, I still kept applying for jobs and attending career fairs at my college hoping to get something for when I graduate and still nothing (honestly, I can't even remember what I said for the disability question at this point). My mom finall told me to stop temporarily as I was going to give myself a heart attack with how stressed I was getting over the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Summer of senior year: Surprisingly, I actually benefitted from the pandemic in some way in that the company my dad is VP for was looking for an intern. This was at the beginning of Covid and when people were still figuring everything out (AKA doing interviews via Zoom wasn't popular yet). Since they couldn't interview, my dad asked the company if his son (me) could do the internship, which they agreed to. I worked that for 6 1/2 months and than the internship ended (ended on October 31st). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been applying for jobs since. I've decided to check the ""prefer not to answer"" on disability questions at the moment and haven't heard anything back, I'm guessing that's hurting me. I tried a recruiting agency and they e-maield back the next day saying they had no opportunities for me currently. I got a ""job coach"" and we got my resume perfected. I've applied many places (all of which require cover letters, I'm not really doing any ""quick applies"").  Still not hearing anything so I think the disability question is playing a big role.

&amp;#x200B;

The next step would be to answer ""no"" on the disability question I guess but I just feel like I'm stooping myself down to the company's immature level by doing that. Like I said, this is impacting all jobs (even simple hourly jobs), they still ask that question. To give more clarification, my first internship was with a consulting group. They have similar groups but they're all sales related and obviously my skills don't lie in that area and they're all commision based so I don't really make money off of it. I'm not entirely sure why these types of companies don't ask the disability question, they're definately not your standard type of company. I'm also not sure why that particular waiting tables job didn't ask the question. It seems for whatever reason commission based jobs don't ask it? For my second internship, my dad did all the work to get me it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of looking into freelance in something, not sure what yet. Just kind of in a bit of a jam I suppose. I'm fortunate to come from a well-off family so money's never been an issue, even through covid. I think that what the corporate world is trying to tell me is that I'm not wanted there and to just apply for disability. But frankly, I'm able bodied and willing to work and have no desire to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any possible resources for freelancing or where I can talk to people about it? I'm running out of ideas. Or anyone know if the way that disabilities are treated is different in other countries (my dad's company is located in London and we briefly discussed possibly moving there but no real plans yet in place). Maybe Europe is more accepting than the United States when it comes to disabilities? Real no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is welcome or if anybody is going through anything similar!"
kpyb7h,1,2021-01-03,"The company I intended to Intern at in the Spring closed shop, need some advice.",kkdelux,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kpyb7h/the_company_i_intended_to_intern_at_in_the_spring/,"Hello [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions)!

As the title suggests, over the weekend, I received notice that the Spring internship offer I accepted was no longer valid because the company was going out of business.

I am a Senior year CS student at a local state university. Unfortunately, I decided in previous years, while I was in community college and my junior year after my transfer, to pursue large course loads and summer courses instead of internships. I had intended to have a light load during my Senior year and pursue full-time internships then. As Covid-19 struck in the fall, I was in an OK spot since I still had one more semester to get some experience.

Luckily, I accepted an offer to intern in the spring at a small local software firm. However, with that off the table now, I am turning to this community for advice.

Most, if not all, of the Spring 2021 internships that I can find have been filled. Since I was just notified of my position's closing, I realize that I am late to the game.

This leads me to some of my questions:
Is it too late to get a Spring 2021 Internship?  Are any companies still hiring for the role? How would I be able to get into these internships so late into the recruiting season?

Thank you to all of you, lovely people who read this post and offer your knowledge and experience; it is very much appreciated. If anyone of you is hiring or know someone that is still hiring for Spring positions, I live in Southern California. I am available to work up to 40hrs a week locally or remotely, and I will be eternally grateful for the help. I can send my resume as requested (I've been told it's a nice one).

Once again, thank you to everyone for the help."

I am a third year undergraduate student who will be applying to grad schools and postbac programs in the future. I am hoping to get into a computational social science program -- or qualitative psychology, or sociology, or... I don't know I'm still deciding. 

Anyways, I am trying to get more experience this summer but I'm not sure if I should be looking for coorporate internships or research opportunities. I've spent the last two summers doing internships in data visualization and business analytics. But I've also been spending the last 12 months doing research in Human Computer Interaction and social psychology which have resulted in 2 co authorships.

So my question is, do I need to get more work experience or more research experience? Any help is appreciated!"

I'll be starting university soon and there's something that's bugging me a lot. I initially planned to do my major in Computer Science and minor in Computational Data Science but now after hearing that a lot of people opt for a second major, I'm wondering if I should go for one too. Is there really any benefit of having double majors for undergrad? Do students who complete double majors gain the upper hand when trying out for internships or jobs over students with just a major or a major and minor?  
Note: My major will require me to complete 48 credit points and my minor will require 36 credit points.

Thanks!"

Engineering obviously isn’t an easy field to get into and be successful however, we see in engineering grad schools how 70% of students come from China or India and most of these guys gain several years of experience in their home country before applying to jobs or PhD programs in the US. 
Now, when you have a kid from India with 2 years of software development experience and you as a young recent graduate, how can you even be competitive ? They are very smart people, I’m not taking that away from them but I think it is really unfair to young graduates coming from US universities. We don’t all go to MIT or Stanford.

I am in my 4th year at my university (#147 in computer science) for a Bachelors in CS. During my first two years I was in a different major and was struggling in general. The beginning of my 3rd year I took a chance and moved to CS late with no prior knowledge of coding. 

Currently I am doing well with a 3.49 gpa and taking a heavy course load to graduate in December 2021. I have no internships due to not being in the CS major for my first two years. 

My plan for summer 2021 was to smash out side projects and lots of leetcode but scrolling through this sub has my worries heightened because I don’t have an internship as I am about to graduate. 


TLDR: wasn’t in CS major until 3rd year. Graduating in December 2021. No internships. Plan is to focus leetcode and developing side projects for my last summer. 

Should I go with my current plan or should I be scrambling to grab an internship (if there are any remaining) for this summer?

I have created an RShiny web app to allow researchers to input their values and receive a predict on the probability of double perovskite formability. 
2. Research in a Fellowship where I built deep learning models to detect tuberculosis, pneumonia, and healthy lungs for chest x rays and compared the deep learning models on their accuracy. Wrote a paper and submitted it for review in a high school research journal. 
3. Internship with Forestry Machine Learning  on building an NLP tool to analyze sessions between a teacher and student for a client. NLP model needs to break down audio into text and form conclusions on the student’s mood and abilities. 
4. President of School's Artificial Intelligence Club: we learn more abt AI and compete at competitions (I started this club recently)
5. Developed a mobile app (currently on the Google play Store) that teaches the basics of Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Nothing special in the app basically just sections that you can click on and read. 
6. Currently working on a research project for my school. I have not gotten anywhere with this project yet but I just started. I am trying to build around six machine learning models to predict cybersecurity risk for autonomous vehicles and then incorporate these into a web app. 
7. UI/UX Evaluator for Trilogy Mentors (Internship)
8. Starting Player (Top 6) on State Championship Tennis team, I've been playing my whole life and its pretty much my favorite thing to do. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to compete in tournaments anymore but when I did I was top 100 in the nation for my age group.

The thing is, I don't really want to stay in the DS field. What I liked the most in my internships were the programming tasks and some of the ops/AWS stuff. Also, salaries for new grads in my country (South America) are shit (think $10k/year, either in DS or development).

I really want to start my career as a remote developer for North America companies, even if I have to make very little in the beginning, but I know the odds are not in my favor. I believe I have a lot of potential for this field, but I have no clue on how to get noticed by the companies.

Maybe learning Javascript and React to have a broader reach? 
Doubling down on LeetCode to increase my chances if I ever get an interview?

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)

c) geography


d) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.

Misusing or trolling the sticky will result in an immediate ban.

**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target program (school + degree where a consulting firm focuses it's recruiting efforts), join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through target program undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  
 * Experienced hires do happen, but is a much smaller entry channel and often requires a combination of strong pedigree, in-demand experience, and a meaningful referral.  Without this combination, it can be very hard to stand out from the large volume of general applicants. 

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

 * [Read wiki on what firms look for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/lookfor)
 * [Read wiki on resumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcresume)
 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the application / interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Time to hear back can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires to never at all.  Asking in this thread will not help.

kqdfqf,2,2021-01-04,Managing Canadian investment accounts before moving to California,Isomorphismz,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/kqdfqf/managing_canadian_investment_accounts_before/,"I've seen quite a few posts on this subreddit and through other sources for people in a similar situation, but even after reading through those, there were still some rules that I was a bit uncertain about.

For context, I'm a 22-year old Canadian citizen living in Ontario that's set to graduate university later this year (2021) and move to California on a TN visa to begin a full-time job around August 2021. My current financial situation on the Canadian side (from internships/RESP EAP payments/OSAP student loan funding) is as follows:

* \~36K in high interest savings account
* \~10K sitting in other chequing/savings accounts across multiple banks
* \~25K contributed to Questrade TFSA, with \~27K of total equity after capital gains/dividends/etc.
* \~5K in Wealthsimple Margin account (should have probably put this in a TFSA/RRSP instead)
* \~27K in OSAP student loans to pay back

Although I've accrued \~15K of RRSP contribution room over the past few years (up to the 2020 tax year), I haven't yet actually opened an RRSP - since I was in the situation where my internship income was expected to keep increasing year after year, so I felt I would get more of a benefit contributing later when my income is higher. My 2021 contribution room should also be at least \~10K based on my 2020 income.

There's a few things around how to manage investment accounts after moving to the US that I wanted some advice on:

1. From looking at other posts/sources, I should liquidate my TFSA since the IRS will tax it prohibitively once I'm a US resident. Since I'm still holding my TFSA and residing in Canada until later this year, what's the absolute latest that I can liquidate my TFSA without introducing extra complications when filing US taxes? I was thinking of liquidating it \~1 month before moving, but I'm not sure if I should do it earlier, or if it would be fine to hold onto it for a bit longer after moving since I won't be a US tax resident in 2021 based on the Substantial Presence Test.
2. I'm not sure whether I may move back to Canada in the long-run, so would it be worth opening an RRSP and maxing out my contribution for 2020 before I'm considered a non-resident of Canada? From my understanding, California does not treat the RRSP at a state level, but as long as I don't realize any gains from dividends/interest/capital gains (i.e. hold funds that don't pay dividends and not sell funds so that all my capital gains are unrealized) I don't believe I would have to pay state tax for my RRSP (please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm trying to evaluate the tradeoff between the short-term reduction in taxable income for 2020, and the tax that would later be withheld when withdrawing from my RRSP, whether it's as a Canadian or US resident.
3. Adding onto the points above, my current plan is to max out my remaining TFSA contribution room (\~9K) up to 2021, and if opening an RRSP is feasible in my situation, then also max out my 2020 RRSP contribution room up to \~15K. I'll also transfer the \~5K funds in my margin account to either a TFSA or RRSP account while I'm still a Canadian resident. I'll then liquidate my TFSA when necessary to avoid tax complications on the US side, and that along with will my HISA/other bank balances should be enough to pay off my student loans. The cash remaining from liquidation would then go into my HISA. Does this sound reasonable, or are there any additional caveats I should be aware of?
4. Since I don't think I would yet be a US tax resident in 2021, would I still be able to contribute to my RRSP for the 2021 tax year (under the assumption that there was a benefit to still contributing to my RRSP, based on the response to my second question above)?
5. Would it make sense to holding some excess CAD funds in Canadian margin accounts instead of keeping it in HISA? I primarily invest in index funds in the S&amp;P 500/US total stock market/International markets, but I'm not sure if the expected capital gains from these investments in conjunction with the tax owed on the US and/or Canadian side would outweigh the interest gains from keeping this cash in a HISA. I also don't think I will have a need to convert any CAD to USD when moving, since I still have enough of a total balance in my US bank accounts.
6. (Not as much of a finance question but it's still somewhat related to this topic) I was initially planning to get my G2 drivers license in Ontario before I move (depending on when road tests open up again), mainly for the convenience of being able to rent a car in California when needed (currently have a G1). I've seen other posts saying that I should cut residential ties with Canada as a part of moving, and that doing so would involve cancelling my Canadian drivers license. I've also seen other sources say that this drivers license is a secondary residential tie and that it likely wouldn't be an issue to keep my drivers license. Would getting this G2 license possibly introduce extra complications, if after moving I won't have any significant residential ties with Canada? The only other secondary residential ties that I should have after moving are holding Canadian bank accounts, credit cards, possibly an RRSP, and a passport.

Thanks a lot in advance!"

So I started an internship with a vc backed startup back around Dec, 21st. It is a software engineering intern position and I've learned and done a LOT remotely (enough to put things on my resume at least). Now, the position is normally until May but starting in mid-February they are requiring me to move to their Texas office and they won't budge, so now I kind of want to go back to school instead for the spring term. This would mean ending the internship with only 1 month worked at the company.

Is this a bad look for employers? If employers call the company for references would they respond with a negative perception of me? Thanks, I'm a sophomore and this is my first internship so looking for some advice from some of the more experienced!

kqeaav,1,2021-01-04,Junior Software Development job ending soon and looking for ideas on the next step.,SufficientBag2789,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kqeaav/junior_software_development_job_ending_soon_and/,"At the moment I work for a small development company and the project we were hired for is nearing the end of the project/budget and will only be able to continue working until around the end of February. For some background I'm 18 and a Freshman in college studying Computer Science (have yet to take any comp sci classes), the reason I've already started my career is because in high school I spent time in the coding club where we developed a social media app, went around our city to tech events and went to investors looking to make something out of it. It didn't really go anywhere but I definitely got to experience a lot and see things/meet people I wouldn't have being from a not so great school in my city. My mentor owns a small development company and hired me last year at the start of March because he believed that I could benefit a lot from working with him and saw my potential from how quickly I picked things up and how I carried myself when speaking to large groups.

I'll admit, I honestly I don't think I'm ready for a ""real"" development position. This job has taught me a lot and was as close to a ""real"" experience as I could get. I am more proficient with Go, learned to integrate APIs from other sites, did a lot of bug fixes/testing, and got to actually implement entirely new parts of the project but there has been some leeway since my boss knew my situation and was more of a paid internship with Jr software engineer as the title IMO. I've also interned at 2 other companies before I graduated and this summer, one being a major tech company but it was more to try something outside of web development since they gave me the option. I was working on a personal project earlier this school year but stopped working on it as often because it was difficult and unhealthy balancing school/work/programming all on my laptop in the same seat for 10+ hours a day everyday.

**So now to my actual questions after telling you all this,** are there any careers or jobs that I could potentially be hired for with the experience I have preferably in tech. or ""What would you do if you were in my situation?"". I'm scared that my abilities won't be enough to go for another, more stressful, Jr. Software Developer position and am unsure where to go next if I'm not kept on for the next project my company is starting. Since I don't have a degree or certifications it's obviously going to be more difficult than the first time around. At the moment only job I think I'm qualified for is the best buy (geek squad) in my area, which I don't mind either. After spending the last 10 months in my room, doing asynchronous classes, and only social interaction being with my boss and my family, retail doesn't sound TERRIBLE.

Thanks in advance."

I just, it's so difficult. This internship had made me grow ALOT but at the cost of my mental health. Never have I felt like such a loser before. I have always gotten good grades, I've never faced something like this before.

It has been nine months, and still, when I'm not able to solve the problem fast or make a logic fast enough, I feel like utter shit. The opposite is pretty true too. Whenever I actually feel like I learned something, or finished the tasks on time, I am seriously so happy. But the thing is, I learn something everyday, even if I get my work done or not, because that's the stage I am in.


I shouldn't feel this upset and anxious right? I have terrible, terrible anxiety when I have to start a new project. This is my third and it just never gets easy. I hate how the feeling of worth depends so much on my work. 

I'm sorry if this post seems like a mess, I was just really upset. I probably could have done a better job explaining my situation. Sorry about that."

I’m currently a student at a tech school that requires one year of co-ops/internships in order to graduate. I was fortunate enough to complete a 6 month internship a year ago, so I only had to do a semester long internship to finish up my degree. However, COVID came this year and I was not able to find another internship. Long story short, I finished up my relevant courses that are needed for me to graduate, but I cannot graduate until I complete this internship requirement.

How should I go about in this situation? Currently, there are little to none internships available for the spring semester, which would mean I would need to wait for the summer/fall positions to roll in. Should I wait until the next season to secure an internship while I use this time to work on projects/learn new tech/grind leetcodes? I was also given the option to find a full time position and use that as credit for my requirement, but how do I go about finding a full time when I technically don’t have a degree? How do I format my resume or let the recruiters know that I am technically a graduate, but I do not have my degree yet? My academic advisor explained to me that they can provide me with a documentation stating I have finished the required coursework for my degree, while my co-op advisor kinda just said “good luck lol.” 

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!"

I payed off my student loans with money I saved from internships through university and just finished building an emergency fund. I'm fortunate enough to live with my parents and can save almost my entire paycheck (about $4000/month). 

Now I'm anxious about what my next steps should be. Should I start maxing my TFSA and RRSP to save for retirement or prioritize saving for a condo down payment so I can move out of my parents house?

My family is strongly pushing me to buy a 1 bedroom starter condo in Toronto that would go for $500,000. Unlike how it sounds, they're not just pushing me out of their house. I've tried to give them rent but they refused it by telling me to put it towards a house instead. They're also against the idea of me renting elsewhere because ""it's a waste of money when you could be building equity"". 

I appreciate that they're looking out for my financial health and are really thinking about my best interests. But even with their help, I don't know if I can really afford a condo in Toronto or if I'm mentally ready to take on that much debt. My parents are fist generation immigrants and don't have a lot, but they put a lot of importance on owning real estate and want to pool whatever money they have to help me buy a house. Even to the point of taking out a lien on their house. 

I feel really guilty about taking money from them but I don't want to let them down.

I've just recently turned 29(F), and am temporarily laid off from my job due to Covid. I've been working as a waitress for the past 5 years, but I absolutely hate it. I hate the sexism, the small talk, the ogling. I've definitely taken advantage of it while I could. The tips were good, the hours super flexible, keeps me active, and it's easy. However, as I'm getting older now and the recent pandemic has proven just how insecure of a job it is, I'm wanting to invest in an actual career, something where I can earn at least 50-100K.

I took a beginner coding class and enjoyed the visual aspect of it. I love creating a beautiful document, playing with words and colors and fonts, so I thought a job as a front-end developer might be a good fit. It seems to have a decent work-life balance, and high job satisfaction, plus potential to work remotely. I also have a future mother-in-law that works in IT at the local college, so a potential connection. When I did some job searching, however, most postings required a Computer Science bachelor's degree. So I enrolled in an online university, but I've become extremely unmotivated. The content is very dry, and it has me questioning whether this is something I can commit 4 years to learning in my free time, while staying in a field that I hate. Unless I could score an internship or something, if that's even a thing.

On the other hand, I've had an idea for a small business over the last 5 years, and I'm wondering now whether I could actually make that happen. I visited South Korea 5 years ago, and I love their version of karaoke. The rooms are private, suitable for small groups of people, while still being a full service bar. I love K-pop, and while I'm not a great singer, the best fun is getting drunk and singing with friends that you're comfortable with, versus a room full of strangers, to music that you actually like. It would fill a niche market in my community, as there is no other bar like it here, plus there are a fair amount of Filipino immigrants that are used to this Asian style of entertainment. It's also relevant to my work experience so far. My problem is, I have no idea how to start my own business, and I'm unsure whether I would need a full Bachelor's Degree for this, or if I could manage by taking courses on Udemy. I'm also unsure of what kind of salary this would even be. 

So basically, just looking for advice from people that have either started their own business, or work in the IT field. What kind of salary do you make, what experience do you have, is your job satisfying, and do you have a good work-life balance? What field would you recommend I pursue? Anything you have to say is appreciated!!!"

kqkjwm,9,2021-01-04,What happens after PwC internship (for me)?,AustinAmighty,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/kqkjwm/what_happens_after_pwc_internship_for_me/,"So I’m graduating in the fall (2021) with my bachelors, with aspirations to get my CPA &amp; Masters.

I’ve accepted an offer for PwC’s external audit internship during the Summer (2021) and from what I’ve read, usually people receive associate positions after their internship.
Is this something I can expect too?

I just spoke with someone at my university and they informed me that I WOULDN’T receive a full time associate offer UNTIL I have my 150 credits and am eligible for my CPA exam.
So basically I’d finish the internship and they’d tell me to come back in a year when I’m eligible to be a CPA.

Does this sound like something I can expect? I was kinda expecting an associate position after the internship, or at least after my undergrads (fall 2021)

Thanks!"

I work with Linux (started with Ubuntu, then arch, and currently run Gentoo on my main computer and arch systems on old laptops) and MacOS a lot (I hackintoshed my Inspiron 5570 and currently contribute to the top GitHub repo for hackintoshing this model). I spend a lot of my time trying to learn more and more about computers and coding and Linux systems. I’m in AP CSA learning Java at my high school (I have a GPA of around 5.0 weighted, and am doing fairly well despite trying to learn at home, making all A’s except for in H French 3 and AP English Language) and am enrolled an online version of Dartmouth’s beginner POSIX C programming class with the intent to move on to the higher levels. I want to start working as soon as possible to gain the most working experience in the field, and I would preferably get a job working with and maintaining Linux systems, as it’s what I do best, but I want to use that working experience to do more in terms of coding and development and eventually upgrade to a job that hopefully makes more, but mainly just is both of the things that interest me the most, being coding and maintaining systems. It’s very difficult to search for jobs in the field while being under 18, and if anyone has advice on getting a job in CS as an under 18 high schooler that’d be awesome. Any other advice is obviously very appreciated too :) I am also on the fence about when/if I should go to college, and I am thinking that if I have enough experience at such an early age, the degree can come later, if it has to. I would much rather get a job and go into the workforce after high school, and go into college part time at any point in my career that it’d be the most beneficial. The only caveat is any job I get now has to be paid, I can’t take any unpaid internship jobs or shadowings or anything like that, for multiple reasons. If anyone who went through the same thing or anyone who has any advice for me I would love to listen and chat with y’all about a plan for the future :) thanks in advance everyone!"

This is my first post on A2C and I just wanted to say a few things. I don’t know if anyone will see this but I wanted offer some advice and words of encouragement. 

I go to a really competitive high school as an FGLI student on a scholarship. I doubted myself and my capabilities especially considering the amount of privilege around me with peers and classmates that could afford to spend thousands on SAT prep, college counselors, and college readiness programs.

This year I was given one of the most prestigious college scholarships in the US and granted a full ride to Emory University. Never in my life did I think little old me would be getting a full merit scholarship to one of the most prestigious universities around. 

I did a lot of EC’s but always talked down to myself because my stats weren’t on par with classmates who spent thousands to take SAT courses since 8th grade. (Not doubting theirs skills, just noting the comparison in access to resources).  

My own journey towards this college acceptance has been rocky. I struggled with poor mental health and depressive episodes, financial instability at certain points of my life, and severe anxiety freshman year that kept me from forming relationships with my teachers. This anxiety also prevented me from breaking out of my shell early on which impacted my ability to get involved in school in preparation for college. 

I have learned a lot on this journey.

I want to leave some tips to those who are worried about the college process:

1. Please believe in yourself: I know it seems very cliche but the amount of people I see talk down to themselves from the beginning and seem to never give themselves words of encouragement really anger me. Even if it’s just for a second make sure to tell yourself how successful you are and how hard you’ve worked and try to believe that it’s possible for you to come out of this process a winner.

2. Start EARLYYY!!!: Join clubs freshman year, talk to teachers, run for student Govt, and fight to take AP and honors classes even if teachers or administrators try to talk you down.

3. Have fun: In order to write college essays you need to have a personality outside of college lol. I regret having so much anxiety freshman year and allowing people I thought were my friends to disrespect me. Although it’s important to focus on school, in order to develop interests and passions it’s important to get out there and have fun.

4. Choose your circle wisely: Who you keep around you does have an impact on your success (your parents were right around this one). Birds of a feather do flock together. When I found people who were focused on college and becoming successful I pushed myself to emulate them and ultimately ended up in the same boat. 

5. Leave Jealous and Competitive people at the door: I had to let go of a lot of people whom I realized did not want to see me succeed in order to get to this point. People who are “wishing on your downfall” are real. So many HighSchool students are infatuated with the idea of prestige and getting to attend a name brand university that they will literally look down on or try to sabotage people they think may get in their way. People may go as far as telling you that you’ll never make it just to discourage you from aiming high. 

6. Stop Obsessing: I never became interested in the elitism and “name” of a university until this year when everyone around me started to be. I think obsession with attending a T-20, Ivy, or just a name brand school actually has a real impact on how we view people around us. It ultimately leads to us internally judging others. If your still preparing to apply to college, worry less about whether or not someone you know is going to a “good enough” school and start worrying about that mid-year report you’re gonna have to submit. 

7. Be comfortable within yourself: Seeing a lot of the people around us and the people on A2C who talk about all of their successes can ultimately lead to a negative self-perception. Please Learn to love yourself. A lot of people end up comparing themselves to these genius kids we see and thinking of ourselves as less than. People only show the triumphant moments. All the people in school or on this forum with 20 million internships are only showing the successes, not the failures or rejections (and there’s nothing wrong with that, they don’t owe anyone their sadder moments). But we have to not internalize these things we see, and realize that there is a lot more to the stories we hear in class or see on this forum. It’s important to have a strong self perception before you embark on this process. Something it took me a long time to develop and I’m still learning to master. 

8. Make a LinkedIn: that’s the last tip! Really helped me rack in the ECs and internship w/o family and school connections or $$$. 

That’s all! PM me if you want anymore advice! I wish all of you the best on your college journey. (ง'̀-'́)ง

I went through my first (obviously shitty) breakup, lost my internship and study abroad program because of the pandemic, went back home to live with my parents and their constant criticism and borderline hatred of me, and just feel like I've been going in circles, trying and failing and trying and failing again.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. Thankfully, my school is opening back up with a pretty solid coronavirus mitigation strategy, and my flight there is in 12 days, but I don't know if I can hold out until then.

kqqp2i,6,2021-01-04,"Should I quit my job, or am I just being a baby about it?",gen_starling,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kqqp2i/should_i_quit_my_job_or_am_i_just_being_a_baby/,"I have no one to talk about this with and the same thoughts keep going through my head. Just need some outside voices to chime in to see how unrealistic I’m really being. It was the first day back to work from holiday break and I’ve already cried, so time to get it out now.

**Background/Context:**

* Graduated May 2020 with a B.A. in Spanish Lit/Culture and a minor in Professional Writing
* Didn’t really want to be a Spanish major. I came into college undecided, thought I might want to be a Spanish teacher and studied abroad, decided it wasn’t for me.
* Tbh, it was the easy road – I already had a fair amount of credit from high school and switching majors would’ve cost me more time/money when I wasn’t 100% set on something specific.
* My professional Writing minor got me an internship my last semester of college, and they hired me for contract work before I graduated, then I came onboard full time (remote) a week after graduating.
* As far as jobs go, I also worked 6 months part-time in a UX Research role for my university’s library, which I enjoyed.
* I’ve had had anxiety/depression (probably – undiagnosed, untreated) for about 7 years.
   * I’m finally looking into therapy, but prefer an in-person experience (live with parents, don’t want them to overhear) so I’m waiting for COVID to die down.

**Current Job:**

* I work for a company that creates eLearning courses for clients (other large companies, schools, organizations).
* The courses are online interactive/guided learnings about whatever topic the client wants their employees/staff to be trained on (anything, from school-shooter safety to distillation processes in a brewery, for example).
* I’m currently a QA (everyone in the company starts at this position) but was hired as a hybrid writer/QA because of my internship experience.
   * Basically, I review the courses multiple times to ensure that spelling/grammar is in check, the voice actors read their lines correctly, all the buttons work, etc. Then I script new audio/work with the dev to enact those changes.
* The reason I’m only doing QA work now is because in the first 2 months of full time work, I got my first writing project (with a super serious, high stakes client) and kind of fell apart.
   * I wrote 2 out of the 4 courses I was supposed to write and then tapped out after working until 1am one night and writing a letter to my bosses explaining how overwhelmed I felt. They were responsive and let me back down a bit, but now I don't feel as engaged in the company.

**Why I want to quit:**

* I don’t enjoy this job. Reviewing courses over and over (clients have multiple revision rounds where they make edits to the content) is so repetitive. I feel like I make a ton of mistakes because I’m just glazed over and don’t care, or alternatively, all over the place when face with several deadlines.
* Speaking of deadlines, I feel like there are an excessive amount, or at the least there’s too much task switching.
   * I’ll start 10 minutes into a project only to be told that another is now taking priority. This derails my focus and ramps up my anxiety. Sometimes I’ll juggle 7 projects that are all due in 2 days.
* No one has told me I’m bad at my job, but I feel like I let my bosses/myself down with each mistake I make.
* I’m struggling to enjoy my life outside of work.

**Aspirations:**

* I \*think\* want to pursue UX research/UX design.
   * I’ve subconsciously decided that I’ll quit in March. I’m heavily leaning towards finding a part time job, taking a UX research course on Coursera (8 months long) and another course in human centered design.
   * While I’m doing that, I want to do writing work on Upwork as well as explore my personal interests/eventually go to UX related meetups, once COVID is under control.
* This is probably the only time in my life where my living situation is secure, and I don’t have many expenses (no kids, no commute, no major bills or rent). This makes taking risks more appealing.
* And my entire life I haven’t really stopped to ask myself what the hell I want. And if I have, I’ve always told myself that it won’t work out in the end.

**Why I’m hesitant:**

* Every job is stressful. Part of me feels like I should just get over it (quitting sounds like a cop out; we’re in a pandemic and I should be grateful). The other part of me wants to quit but is afraid of failing.
* Gaps in my resume – I get that it’s not the end of the world necessarily, but I’m afraid this will affect my ability to get a higher paying “real job” in the future.
* I’m afraid that if I quit and hustle to educate myself on UX/design/whatever, then my lack of relevant education/experience will still come back to bite me in the ass.
* My sister is graduating high school soon and she wants to go for digital art – my parents won’t pay for her college, so I feel like I need to help out.
   * Meaning I need to be an extra source of support for her dreams as well as my own. I would love to help run her Instagram account and get her more followers/possibly start my own to sell prints/stickers, but I need time to dedicate to navigating that space.

TL;DR: I guess what this post comes down to is just me asking whether it's worth it to quit my editing/ writing job and find a part time job so that I can address my mental health and self-study (I have access to free courses on Coursera for UX/design, even though I have a B.A. in Spanish) Or is this just me running away from my problems even more? I know that I’m afraid and that I need to work on it, but any input would be appreciated.

I’ve been mass applying for a couple of months now. Not sure how many exactly but anything I find, I apply for.

I’ve heard nothing back from the vast majority, only hearing back from one startup a few days ago that they would focus on 2022 graduates and therefore I would not be considered (I was projected for 2023 but that changed to 2022 after I applied, so that kinda sucks too).

Although I don’t want to share my resume here right now, I will say I have 4 school projects down, my two last job experiences with more on my LinkedIn due to space restrictions (not SWE since I haven’t interned before), my courses (Intro to OO Programming, Intro to DS&amp;A, and Software Practice, then a bunch of math courses, etc) and my skills which include C++, C#, and Java as the highlights, although I touched on MIPS as well.

Is the pandemic making it tougher? Has it always been so sweaty and competitive? Or do I just suck? I feel like I’m not a genius but at least average enough to be employable by someone out there... 

It just feels tough. I’m trying my best, working hard, and practicing, trying to get better and better, but it just feels like it’s a lost cause. :("
kqs5r0,46,2021-01-05,"Feeling empty and aimless, advice needed",Infinite_Willow,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/kqs5r0/feeling_empty_and_aimless_advice_needed/,"I have been having this feeling for a while.

This has happened after I watched many shows -- definitely too many shows. Just for context, I have not been very active in other activities, I only have a few friends, and even those are more of acquaintances, and have been staying at home for a long time.

Now, this might sound bizarre, but I feel a sense of crushing loneliness and feel aimless, as though I have seen everything and perhaps seen all the sorts of values that drive people, and have felt that everything that these people work for in these shows, in the ultimate end, is for naught, with their efforts likely being dismantled once they are beyond the grave.

I have been having issues with my religion and have not taken it seriously anymore as I am of a sexual orientation that my religion disallows, and thus I find it difficult to turn to it as an island of hope, even if I already don’t really believe in it.

Anyway, I wonder how I should carry on my life. I understand that I should probably tack some values onto my end goal or something, but I find it hard to maintain some values throughout my life, especially since I don’t really have any notable life events or experiences that really stuck with me. For instance, while I experienced elation when I achieved the marks to get into NUS, that was fleeting and after a day I was left feeling empty and aimless. After that, it was replaced with a sense of dread as I heard that Uni was akin to A levels every 4 months, and, now, looking at my planner for my Uni days, all I see are internships shoehorned into the summer breaks, and seas of semesters of suffering with little islands of holidays to catch my breath before I get waterboarded with more content.

And my parents saying that work is even worse is not helping.

I have issues keeping friends. While meeting for the first time is no big deal, it is keeping up with friends that is the main issue. Everybody who met me for the first time always has a positive impression of me, but because I am as bland as a rock -- having no interests, hobbies, things to do in free time other than aimlessly browse the web -- I end up just looking at my phone while others are chatting about topics I am unable to add anything to. At every orientation, we all start out together, and eventually, everyone just kinds goes into their own niche group, and there I am, just a thing that wanders aimlessly from group to group, having an ultimaletly neutral presence, just exitsing at other groups. Because of this, I was never able to have an intimate (in like a friend way) genuine relationship with others.

Anyone experiencing the same thing? I am just wondering what should I do, and how should I look forward to the rest of my life.

My goodness, I sound half-demented after typing all this."

I tried looking at alot of older questions on reddit about the subject but I was unable to find to much clear information, alot of posts just said 'try nepotism' which I have no connections for.  I am a junior in EE currently. 

I have been looking on places like indeed, linkedin, alot of other job posting sites I come across, as well as looking into major electrical companies hiring pages but I seem fairly limited in the number of internships I can find.  I asked one of my university staffers and they even went as far to say that alot of companies are pulling their internship programs bc of extenuating circumstances with the economy and covid.

Honestly, I am really just looking for some kind of advice or tips, I didn't get an internship my sophomore year so I am of course not very experienced in this kind of work.  Any helpful information would be much appreciated, thank you."
kqt50m,1,2021-01-05,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (1/4/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/kqt50m/weekly_job_qa_thread_142021/,"Hi all,

Here is the forty-fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?  

   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

kqtiaa,1,2021-01-05,Not sure if friend has depression or is crying for attention?,burritonugget,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kqtiaa/not_sure_if_friend_has_depression_or_is_crying/,"A friend of mine for several years, broke up with his girlfriend in 2019. He was the one who suggested the breakup, as he felt their relationship wasn't working out. They agreed to keep in touch in case either wasn't taking the breakup well. They both started seeing people and he was even seeing another girl for a couple of months in 2020. 

For some reason, they started talking again when she came back from an internship abroad. He started spiralling into a hole of how much he regretted breaking up with her and he believes that it could work if they gave it another try. But the girl said no as she had already moved on and is happy with where she is. He did not take it well and began to spiral into self-hate and regret. 

At first it did just feel as if he was just trying to get over the breakup, but then he started saying things like "" I can't believe she was the one that got over it, but not me. I was the one who suggested breaking up"" "" or ""I thought she would be the one in this position, not me"".

It made me start to speculate that the only thing hurt is his ego, and his unwillingness to move on because he was rejected. He started telling my friend and that he was severely depressed and that he cannot do anything at all. 

We took it seriously and checked in on him every day, picked up his calls, send him as much support as needed. But we started noticing he would call my other friend for advice, and if it was advice he did not ""need"", he would call me and vice versa. He was turning down the advice we told him because it wasn't what he wanted to hear.

His Instagram was deleted this entire time, but he recently activated it again and started posting posts and stories writing things like ""i want to kill myself"", ""give me a reason to live"". Him and his ex still follow each other. We asked him regardless if he was okay but it would always be ""I'm okay, but kinda sad"" or ""i guess I'm ok, not sure but I'm sad"". 

Then he began tweeting all these suicidal thoughts and scary tweets indicating he is not mentally well - his ex also follows his Twitter. He ended up calling my friend and telling her how he was sad and depressed and hates himself. He told her about his tweets and she asked why he did it and he said I just want her to reach out to me - and she did. 

Anyways, my friend and I are starting to suspect what his real intentions are as everything he says sounds like a cry for attention and how he can't get over his ego. But at the same time, we are concerned on whether or not he is battling depression or a mental health disorder. I know it sounds disingenunine but we've known him for years and he is the type of person who sits high at his ego and often cries for attention when he doesn't get it. 

We feel like its really unfair to his ex as she has reached out to us multiple times extremely concerned about him but there is only so much we can say. 

Has anyone ever had a friend like this? I'm not sure what I can do or say anymore at this point when he is calling me with the same problems at 1 in the morning. 

I am diagnosed with general anxiety and I take antidepressants and have been doing a lot of self-help programs and meditation to keep my anxiety at ease. I understand not everyone has the same willpower to cope with mental health, but it is the intention that I am most concerned about."

kqwj3r,5,2021-01-05,Berkeley MSCS suggestions?,AccomplishedRule0,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kqwj3r/berkeley_mscs_suggestions/,"I'm currently a sophomore majoring in CS+math in a top 15 school in the south and I would like to pursue a master's degree after graduation. I'm wondering about the possibility of getting accepted to Berkeley's MSCS program but I'm not sure what to focus on at this point.

Currently, my C and major GPAs are both 3.81, GRE 326(Q169, V157). I have one summer experience at a tech company as SDE intern for 3 months, 1 semester of TA in an intro level CS course and 1 upcoming research experience (haven't heard of the length of the research yet) in data science on the topics of biomed and machine learning.

I have several questions regarding GPA and rec letters. I've heard that:

1. The usual GPA that gets you admitted in Berkeley is around 3.9+.
2. last two years' GPA usually matters more when it comes to grad school admissions. 

Are these two statements true? People around me are saying things about the insanity of getting into these programs right now. I feel super stressed about it.

For rec letters, since I don't have that many connections, (haven't really done a lot of networking at all tbh) would it be okay if I have someone that is not as prestigious in the field to write a rec letter for me? Like some of my professors are, at this point, assistant professors or lecturers. Would their rec letters be useful or should I just go and do more networking.

Moreover, I heard from someone who got into Stanford from our school saying that he took part in academic competitions like ACM and such. Is this going to be more beneficial to my application? I have not have experience engaging in academic competitions in college. How do you usually prepare for them?

Finally, which is more important, internship or research? Since I only have 1 summer left for me to utilize (apart from summer 2021), I would want to choose the better one that would benefit admissions the most between these two. I understand that grad school don't really care much about internships or just job experience, but the fact that I only have 1 internship and that was right after my freshman year made me wonder if I should enhance my ability of working in the industry, considering that I would still have to look for a job after grad school. However, I don't know if my potentially 1-year long research in the data science field would be enough for me to get into a prestigious grad school's MSCS program like Berkeley.

Besides those questions, please tell me if you have any other suggestions about how I should prepare for grad school application. Thank you so much!"
kqwpol,8,2021-01-05,My life is not moving on but my loved ones' lives are. Am I dragging them down or being selfish or both? Or should I distance myself from them? What should I do to not make them feel unwanted by me but also give them space for their lives?,MrJonDoe297,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kqwpol/my_life_is_not_moving_on_but_my_loved_ones_lives/,"A little about me. I am 20 years old. I was diagnosed with autism and adhd at 2, gods know why. My joint ""family"" was terribly abusive. From physical, social, emotional, sexual and mental abuse, they left no stone unturned. Pushing me off the stairs, throwing me in deep enough ponds, molesting, lying to people about me etc etc for years. 
Over the years, my autism and ADHD got more friends with depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, SPD, DID (10 of us😁), Bipolar &amp; based on common symptoms PPD, CPTSD.....
I'm no expert but my therapist has an extensive knowledge and experience over it due to this. 

When my parents got separated from those people, they still kept up with abuse. What I have told me parents is merely scratching the surface of what is the truth. 
But, I had my parents (overweight, diabetic, suffering from heart disease), 4 older cousins (who're all older by at least 10 years), my therapist (who is a friend of one of those cousins and became a psychiatrist because she saw me since my infancy) and an online best friend who is nothing less than a little sister to me and we're soulmates.

Alright so over 18 years, I have become really damaged. I wanted to commit suicide each minute because of each second's hell. My parents were with me and cousins too and therapist but there's a place outside home too.....
They do all they can but school, society..... I'm from a place where mentally ill cause fear or deep hatred. My cousins and therapist are no less than parental figures towards me. It is because of them I still had some amount of hope towards normal people being kind and understanding. 
I have extremely good drawing skills, painting skills, I work really hard (need to as I am stupid), I'm in my sophomore year of mechanical engineering, keep in top of my class of 1-6 positions. I am skilled at coding and programming because my cousins taught me (it helped focus) and basically an otaku (weeb). I have a lot of knowledge about a lot of things. Sometimes adult things too but eh.
Don't judge but I kind of need to take 6-9 medicines. 

 But by 14 yrs of age, I got addicted to cough syrup and painkillers to let me sleep and not feel arthritis and scoliosis and obesity. But I willed myself off of those as a certain movie in 2016 inspired me to hold on, train my body and be a little selfish. So I physically trained and got really strong and fit, felt suicidal but still went on due to being too afraid of dying.  Then after a year and a half in 2018, I found my first friend, my best friend on Instagram. Let's call her L, though she deserves all W. She just turned 17 last week. She lives in a place 4.5 hrs behind my time.
I don't know if it is okay to share it but she'd been harming herself due to bullying and had been suicidal for long. But she showed me extreme kindness, love and care for no reason. I definitely reciprocated but I don't know if I ever did enough or close. And not only for her but for others too😕.
Now she has recovered tremendously, helped me tremendously too. Progressed, grown and developed amazingly. She is still going on, but it's incredible nonetheless.

Now fast forward to now:
My parents are in and out of hospital, have stress due to family feuds with their parents and siblings. They travel at work to keep the funds coming for my college, therapies, medicines and all. They've been doing so since 2017 and since then I live alone. It's more difficult for them than me.

All my cousins have gotten married, their spouses are loving towards me but I cannot in my right conscience rely on them because they have started a life.

My therapist too has gotten married, I cannot keep calling her in the middle of the night or else it might just cause disturbance in her personal life.

My best friend got stronger and is now healthily dating a presumably good guy and intends to make it last very long. I pray it goes for lifetime settlement. 


So you see. I have reduced my calls to my parents from 7-9 of a minute or so in a day to 1-2 calls of a couple of minutes because they are working, have dozens of people on call and need to file in a lot papers and presentation.

I have reduced my texts, calls to cousins from 10-12 times a day (all cousins combined) to 2-3 at best in a day. That too just memes or just random how are you.
They return it well too but I leave them on read because I don't want to drag on to a pointless conversation

I call my therapist only once a week (30-90 minutes) from  everyday. I mostly ask her how is her life first so that she doesn't feel like she's only a therapist for me. She is always talking about and to me but eventually things are over to talk about and I tell her I got work to do so that she does not feel uncomfortable with ending the call.

I have reduced my texts to my best friend because she could only message during my late night/her evening. 
Since she's also a student &amp; not working, I'd message goodnight, goodmorning and I love you and proud of you everyday. But lately there'd be 0 notifications in the morning or night meaning she only saw them in her late evening. As I have no one else, only DM I get on Instagram is from her. She has all my contacts means to reach me if needed so I know she's well.
So I have stopped sending her messages unless she sends because she's mostly on call with her lover so I don't want to disturb that. She deserves someone who appreciates her like him. 

But I cannot stop feeling crippled and clingy to them all. I am very alone. I have no friends except her. No family except them. 
But I am 20, both my girlfriends either died or committed suicide years prior.
 I am bi and demisexual but now I am probably leading towards asexuality. 
No matter what or how much I plan for my higher studies, internships, this bloody time won't move on. All the skills, hardwork, none of it helps this. No matter how much I study, train or plan or game, nothing in my life is moving on. 
Each minute is a hell mentally. 
Emotionally too lately, I can't help but feel I've gotten colder towards them but if I reach out to them I feel annoying and a baggage. I have talked to them and they all say that I am good and they're the same.
But I can't help but feel a coldness inside and 1000s of voices that they're not keen on keeping our relations and want to distance from each other. 
I don't know what I am, where I am, how I am....

If you guys don't want to help it's alright. I can understand and see why. But thanks to reddit for helping me vent."

I am from Germany, and so far applied to UCL, Birmingham, Queen Mary and probably will apply to Bristol as well.

However, I am also debating the idea of pursuing an online MSc from York or potentially Bath. I really like the curriculum of York but I am unsure if it will help my career in the same way an on campus degree from a university in a similar league (Bristol/Birmingham) might help me. Surely getting accepted to UCL would make it hard to refuse that offer, but i'm unsure.

Corona is a topic that bothers me. I am unsure how well I will be able to socialize and connect if I start an on-campus degree in Sep. 2021. Is it really worth it for the connection/social factor and employ ability ? How important is the social &amp; networking factor for my employability ?

&amp;#x200B;

And the fact that I have to pay like 25-30k £ due to the new study regulations with Brexit , compared to the \~8k£ for an online degree, also make me think. And in case I get accepted to UCL: Living in London... yeah we don't even need to talk about the extra costs on this one..

I am aware of the fact that in CS the projects and practical experience I build a more important than the academic degree I hold, but coming from a non-CS background, I want to make sure I get a solid conversion degree that enables me to break into the job-market. 

If I was going for the online degree, I would probably move to Berlin (I am from Germany)and try to find an internship in CS / Data Science while working on the CS degree. 

Realistically, If I was moving to the UK, I would almost certainly not look for a side-job or internship because I want to make sure I finish the degree in 1 year then.

What do you guys think is my best option ? I appreciate any input :)"

And if you decide to remove it, please let me know what changes I can make. I really need opinions/suggestions/guidance from experienced folks. I don't know if the flair is correct, but a flair is required according to subreddit rules (Please don't remove this post for that and change it to the appropriate one)

I have been looking into various online resources, including this subreddit's wiki pages. It has only proven to confuse me more and more without providing any clarity on this aspect.

Coming to the main point, I want to enroll in a program that helps me excel and prepares me well to take strides in my career to reach top-level executive positions - and enable me to make worthwhile contributions. I want to know about almost everything - finance, general business decisions, leadership, product management, human resources. I feel like ""Executive MBA"" might be appropriate, but what I have read online and seen other folks do is generally enroll in it when they have years of experience. On the other hand, I have been in the industry for two and a half years and plan to enroll for a Master's education next year.

To provide a little background, I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (2018), where I could score 8.51 out of 10-grade points. According to Google, it falls into A+ after conversion to 4 point system. It should be good enough to be considered for a scholarship from a reputed university (combined with a good GMAT score, community involvement, extracurriculars, etc.). After my undergraduate studies, I had decided to pursue an MBA after working in the industry after a couple of years of work to gain some idea about the kind of work management involves. I am from a middle-class family from India, which means I don't have any finance to back me up from family (and neither do I personally want my family to back me up on that, I need them to support me, that's all). I would be completely paying off the education loan I took for the undergraduate degree in the next 5 months, and I want to do my masters' with minimum or no loans. This brings me to a solution to get a (full) scholarship or at least a large portion of the fee. I am also looking into support from my current organization (Thanks to my manager for suggesting that). And I know that if I put all my heart into it, I can definitely land a scholarship.

I have always taken up responsibilities quickly and progressed quite well. 6 months as a developer intern, 7 months as a full-time SDE, 1+ year as a project lead, and now switched from the startup to a corporate for an SDE II role. And I would like to keep progressing at a faster pace. I believe more in learning from others' experience than waiting around for experiences to happen and not wasting any time growing. This is why this decision is crucial (from my perspective), and I want to make sure I'm choosing the right one.  Please, Reddit community, guide me with your knowledge that you provide abundantly to everyone looking up to you for your guidance. I can't explain how grateful I would be."

Because of that i enrolled in Mechanical Engineering and am about to finish my undergrad. In the first year of uni, i tried to switch internally from ME to CS but wasnt able too, so i took a bunch of CS classes as a extracurricular student, i did intro to programing, programing paradims, data structure, data bases, Operating Sistems, Computer Architecture and Software engineering. With all of this i am now 23 and was looking to get into the masters program for Software Engineering, since i have all of the pre-recs necessary.

Im a little concern should i enroll in the masters program, or try to find a job with my ME degree + my github (with all the projects done in those classes) + projects and internship done as a ME, because i would be finishing the masters at 25?

And is my ME degree going worth something in the job search?"

I recently got accepted into comp eng at Concordia and am pretty stoked about it! From what I have heard, it seems that it'd be tough to get a job after graduation without any internship experience. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should really focus on (in terms of programming languages, computer skills, etc) in order to get a decent internship and a job afterwards? 

A little about me: I'm actually super interested in aerospace engineering and hope to have an opportunity to switch to it from comp eng at some point in the future. It'd be nice if I could design some sort of operating system for spacecrafts haha. But other than that, at the moment, I'm mostly interested in game development since I spend an obscene amount of time playing video games. With that said, I'm open to any suggestions as to what I could do with a comp eng degree. 

Thank you!!"
kr1mw0,5,2021-01-05,Advice on switching careers...,ConcernedLitwick,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kr1mw0/advice_on_switching_careers/,"I'm a 26f looking to change careers into CS. Long story short, I'm currently a physician undergoing residency, but have just about had enough. I've always liked the mathematics/CS field and decided after a lot of deliberating that I want to switch.

The only problem is I'm still struggling putting together a viable career path. I majored in mathematics in undergrad that also used Matlab/Mathematica, but otherwise don't have a lot of coding experience. I know I can pick up the material easily enough, but my biggest concern is becoming a viable candidate to get a job afterward. 

My current plan is as follows, but there's a lot of holes that I need help filling in:

1. I plan on finishing my current year of residency (which will end in June) to save up money and pursue CS afterwards.
2. Doing a 2 year post-bacc that would allow me enough time to learn the basics in the a structured way and self-study extra materials on the side. 
3. Building up a portfolio of side projects while I do my post-bacc.
4. Secure an internship or research position at the tail end of my post-bacc to gain some actual experience. 
5. Apply for jobs.
6. Profit???? idk lol

Some things that I need guidance on:

1. Is doing a post-bacc the best way to go about doing this? Other options include doing bootcamps or self-study, but I feel like in my position of having minimal to no prior CS experience, having a 2 year foundation and a degree at the end would help substantially. 
2. If I were to do a post-bacc, what would be a promising one? I've looked into a couple programs online and found University of Colorado's to be fairly solid ([https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/online-program/post-baccalaureate/curriculum-course-list](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/online-program/post-baccalaureate/curriculum-course-list)) or Rutgers University (apply as a second degree student and complete the undergrad CS major without any additional requirements). Are there other programs that you would recommend instead?
3. How to go about networking? Doing CS in this non-traditional way might already make networking difficult, especially if I do online schooling, not to mention COVID making it even harder. I'm fortunate enough to know a handful of people in the industry already, but it may not be nearly enough. 

Honestly, any and all advice would be appreciated! Many of you have worked in the industry for a long while, and would be able to tell me how they'd perceive a non-traditional applicant like me. Or if you've recently undergone the job search process yourself and know what kinds of things companies look for that I may have overlooked. Also, if any of you have switched career paths yourselves and have anything to share, I'd love to hear! Thanks again!"

I wanted to share an upcoming research-based course we are prototyping for the Spring semester: “Modeling Fanaticism Using Machine Learning.” (some details below)  This course is a great way for students to get involved in research, and subsequently internships with DHS/FEMA/etc.  We are looking for a few students to enroll in the course via 4912 Independent Research (0-3 units).

Any interested students should feel free to send a send a quick message to me or post a comment and I will provide contact info.

\-------------------------

**Course**: Modeling Fanaticism Using Machine Learning

**Description**: The course will focus on machine-learning and analytics applied to Suspicious Activity Reporting and Fanaticism.  Throughout the semester students will learning about various machine learning algorithms and advanced modeling techniques using Python  (e.g. SMV, Random Forests, Community Detection using Graphs, Natural Language Processing).  In contrast to instruction-based learning, students will be guided through course material and research projects via a series of lectures, web-based modules, and seminars.

As part of the course, students will be provided with a large dataset to solve independent research projects in the context of homeland security (e.g. radicalization, threat detection, community identification).  The datasets include social media (e.g. Reddit, Twitter, Gab.ai) and forum channels related to extremist beliefs (Iron March). Other previously collected datasets will also be made available to students, these include academic publications, Wikipedia, Foursquare, and GitHub, all which serve as proxy datasets to study language evolution, sentiment analysis, and communities.

The course will include seminars from homeland security experts and practitioners on the project theme to bring real-world relevancy to the research projects.  As part of the seminars students will be able to interact with the subject-matter experts through an extended Q&amp;A.   Then end-goal of the course is to provide students with both technical and domain training in the combined areas of machine learning and homeland security.

**Course Elements: (1)** Videos and web-based modules; **(2)** Regular learning/programming assignments; **(3)** Seminars with homeland-security experts; and **(4)** course research project.  Students will also meet regularly with instructors during mutually agreeable times.

**Enrollment and Grading**:  EIN 4912 (for 0-3 units, S/U or letter graded – up to the student)

**Prerequisites**: Students should have a GPA above 3.3 (Dept. guideline for 4912), and feel comfortable programming or learning to program (if you don’t like programming this is probably not a good course for you).  Besides that previous courses in linear algebra, statistics, and calculus are recommended, but not absolutely necessary."
kr42fe,6,2021-01-05,Applicant With No Leadership Experience?,Onyx_Neo,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kr42fe/applicant_with_no_leadership_experience/,"I'm forwarding a question from a high school junior in the Northeast since I don't know how to answer this:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello \[OP\],

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you're having a great new year so far and that you and your family are safe and happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried about the amount of leadership experience I have ( none? ) and how to make up for it with the rest of my application. 

&amp;#x200B;

My freshman year grades weren't too great ( stuff happened outside of school and one quarter messed up my whole year ) and there weren't really any clubs for computers or engineering that I was able to join, but I did take a course of introductory Cybersecurity that was offered at the school. I transferred out of it because it didn't have much available to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started taekwondo in 8th grade and have more than two years of experience with learning and teaching other students, although no notable volunteer hours could be added since I would've started in June of 2020, right when we were in the middle of the pandemic. I would've gotten my black belt at the end of the 2020 as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my sophomore year at \[new school\], I joined Girls Who Code and attended until the pandemic hit. I didn't lead any projects or anything, just learned along with the other students. I wanted to compete for the Debate and Speech team, but I didn't have time since I'm always studying. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my junior year, I am applying for the TSA Club, Programming Competition Club, National Technical Honors Society, Computer Science Honors Society, Robotics Team, and exploring some internships that will be available in the summer of 2021. So far, I've gotten into the Computer Science Honors Society, as well as Girls Who Code and Women in STEM. Although I applied for the Robotics Team in my freshman year, I only helped in managing the site for a while, so I was never actually in any competitions or working on the robot itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

My lack of experience is also why I got rejected from the National Honors Society at our school, since the only pieces I had was the fact that I lead most of the projects for school since middle school and how I sometimes help people with their schoolwork. Again, no experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

On an unweighted scale of 4.0, I have a 3.85 from my freshman and sophomore year ( is that a good GPA? ). I took AP World History as a sophomore, since that's the earliest AP course offered to us, and am currently taking AP Calculus AB, APUSH, and AP English Language and Composition. I plan to fill my seven slots with five AP courses next year, including Calculus BC, Physics, Computer Science, English Literature, and US Government. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to major in computer science, specifically computer programming and software engineering/development, so I'm going for an engineering pathway. I have also done Java for more than a year and am applying for an internship requiring this. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a miracle that I got into \[magnet school\] with my level of inexperience. I don't know how colleges are going to accept me. Applications are right around the corner. I know that not everyone gets into a top school, but I at least need to go to a school in the Top 40, or a top school in \[state\].

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm a leader, but I can't find ways to actually show it. What should I do before it's too late?"""

I just wanna get my work done so that I can come home and rest. Watch movies, tv, or play roblox.

You know what I like to do once I finish my work? I go for walks. Loooong walks, like I can go outside and hang out alone for 5-6 hours easy. I love it. It calms my soul.

But for some reason I'm shamed for this. Because those 3-4 hours were 'wasted' and could've been put towards doing some sort of 'pRoDuCtIvE' work

There's people who eat, breathe, and live the R logo. People who have no life outside of Rutgers, and people who eat, breathe, and live schoolwork.

I am not one of those people, and tbh trying to be one of these people is killing me.

There's all this unnecessary competition to be #1 on Suitable and #1 on Leetcode and have 3 side projects and found 2 startups. And I just can't live like this.

I couldn't care less about Suitable, and honestly I might have 1 side project max, just out of pressure. I work hard, and I like my time off. But I always feel bad during breaks or when I'm relaxing because every minute I spend relaxing, someone out there is getting ahead.

Ok I just like diverged from the topic.

But my question is, how can I be me ~~without feeling bad or~~ without being behind? It seems like everyone already has an internship locked for next summer, and I'm here struggling to keep my grades up during the pandemic.

And I realize it sounds like I'm whining but I just needed to let it out. Idc if this post dies in new"

This is my first time posting here so here goes.

I am a computer engineering graduate that has been job searching since May 2020. I was recently interviewed and offered a job as an associate engineer to a nuclear firm in Georgia. Everything seems to check out and pay is reasonable. 

There are two problems that I see which is preventing me from accepting right away:

1. My family and I are living in Ohio at the moment and since the job is in Georgia, it is obvious that relocation is a must. The problem is that I would prefer to be living where I am especially in a time of uncertainty.

2. The job description is only vaguely tied to my major as a computer engineer. I am afraid that it may be hindering my chances to do work that I truly care about (mostly firmware). Since this is my first real full-time job, I am worried that I may not like the job and end up leaving early which is a red flag to future employers.(Aside: I do have internship experience) 

Of course, I am really grateful for an offer as jobs are really hard to come by these days. Let me know of any advice or opinion on what you would do in my situation?

Cheers and thanks for helping a new engineer!"

As the title suggests, I'm in a bit of dilemma here, Gate or Campus/Off-campus prep. ?

Gate does seem like a nice Idea, But judging from the competition and the level of Hard work one has to put in, it seems like getting a good score is gonna be extremely difficult. Throughout all semesters I have an average score of 7 CGPA. On top of that, I'm not from a financially strong background, so, I won't be able to afford fancy gate prep. classes.

On the other hand campus placements are mostly service based ( L&amp;T, infosys. etc.) and nearly all cse students get placed in it, and as for preparing for off campus, I think I have quite a bit of a head start as I already have completed 3 Internships (one as campus ambassador, second as content writer and third as backend software dev. ). But, I heard that off campus placements are rare for freshers and campus placements on average provide mediocre salaries. Preparing for Off Campus will require me to learn some skills for eg. :- Machine learning or Web dev.

The question can be thought of this way, If I try my best, and put in a lot of hardwork, which one of these options will yield a better result ?

tl;dr: - 3rd year B.E CSE, should I prep. for GATE or Campus/Off-campus placements, I think I have a bit of a headstart in campus/Off-campus placements, which one is better?"

The onboarding packet says that Graeble will reach out within 60 days Before the start date. This seems a little too soon rushed and I’d like to make housing arrangements before hand.

I’ve seen advice on here from other year saying to look at University summer housing that is available around Seattle. This won’t work for me because my start date is in early May before a lot of the terms are done

Am I just supposed to wait for Grable to contact me before looking for places? Should I be actively looking on craigslist, Airbnb, Facebook groups, etc hoping to find something and book it early? What do I do?"

Deciding I was tired of the crap pay from working in education, I graduated from a data science bootcamp (I won't say which because the higher ups tend to stalk these forums) only to find that their ""career services"", which I was led to believe would be internship-style automatic placements, actually consisted of cold-messaging strangers on LinkedIn. As an introvert who was brought up to believe that that sort of behavior was worse than begging, having to do that often just led me to feel sick and in tears. My parents stupidly raised me to believe that your skills are more important than your network, which was fine with me until reality hit and I found myself without a network to reach out to. 

Almost a year out from graduating/applying, I've only made it to a handful of phone screens at dream jobs and one failed technical (HackerRank, passing only 75% of the code test). I never received a code review on any of my projects, even when the code clearly had issues, and while I use StackOverflow for troubleshooting, I often feel like my work is not high enough quality to secure even a basic position.

Due to COVID, I've been unemployed for six months now and my self-confidence/self-esteem is down to nil. The question that seems to disqualify me during the phone screening is whether I've done data work for any other companies (my own projects don't seem to be enough). I've tried to position myself as a freelancer, doing data projects for the few sole proprietors I know, but that doesn't seem to cut it. All of the internships I've found are for students still in school. 

Any constructive advice is welcome."

(US/GA),1trilliondollars,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/kr710q/legal_ramifications_of_accepting_paycheck_on_a/,"I worked as an 1099 contractor for a small company over the previous fall semester. My fall internship ended in early December, but my last paycheck never arrived. After I inquired about the status of the paycheck, the company informed me that they had to furlough their remaining employees after I had left (due to clients dropping the firm and not paying), and that my final paycheck (for hours worked before the furlough) was late due to that reason. The company was using a paycheck management platform to pay wages, but **is offering to pay my missing wages over a money-transfer platform, not the previously used payroll management platform** (which has all the tax information) while they wait for their remaining clients to pay the firm.

What are the legal ramifications for accepting this payment? If I do, how would I go about legally reporting these wages to the IRS come tax season as a 1099 contractor?"

kr72wb,2,2021-01-05,"Career Advice for an MPH graduate interested in global health, social epidemiology, international work - but with very little related work experience.",mossbottle,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/kr72wb/career_advice_for_an_mph_graduate_interested_in/,"I do apologize, this is a lengthy post!

After graduating with my MPH from the University of Cape Town in 2017, I spent about a year applying to positions (at companies such as Partners in Health, Dexis, Population Services Intl, J-PAL, FHI360, GAVI, PATH, SSI, for example) before settling for a job in the service industry where I became the manager of a high volume cafe for a couple years.

I’ve always wanted to get back into Public Health or any international career, and when COVID closed the cafe in March I dove back in applying to jobs in the field.

I’ve applied to 275 jobs, and have had a handful of unsuccessful interviews. I’m not losing momentum but I’m definitely discouraged and am feeling more and more anxious that it’s been 3.5 years and counting since I got my MPH and have had no related experiences since then.

**My Goals &amp; Interests**

My interests are so wide-ranging, I feel like this may have contributed to my lack of specific training in any hard skills… I really just want to work in an international context, ideally abroad (whether I’m stationed there or can work remotely). Global health, intl development, social determinants of health, ethnographic work, qualitative research - even due diligence, conflict monitoring, etc...

* I’ve continued to apply to positions with the usual intl dev / global health orgs: CHAI, USAID, PHI, PSI, SSI, etc. but again, my interests are so wide ranging I’ve really explored a lot of different roles in related industries.
* I’ve seen researcher positions with venture capital or philanthropy orgs that seek to map out and synthesize existing NGOs initiatives to conduct due diligence to better target their funding - I don’t really even know what this is called but it really interests me.
* Another company in particular focused on using Salesforce to evaluate and better target NGOs efforts, offers a yearly fellowship for entry-level early-career applicants. I’ve applied to 3 times now, after conversations with the COO and attempts to meet with current employees, I’ve been denied each time. If the point of the fellowship is to teach fellows the hard skills and how to use Salesforce, what are the hiring standards? I stalk the fellows on LinkedIn and don’t understand what lands them an interview over me.
* A few companies that monitor global conflicts have sought qualitative researchers, which seems to relate to risk assessment and due diligence again.
* I’ve applied to numerous COVID-19 contact tracing positions without success.
* I was very excited for what was essentially a customer-relations position with a startup focused on expanding COVID-19 testing capacity - had what I thought was a great interview, was rejected and denied any feedback I asked for.
* There are so many Monitoring &amp; Evaluation jobs out there… Frustrating considering the only time I ever heard of M&amp;E before job-searching was during one lecture in an MPH course. Is this something I could be qualified for?
* I’ve seen a few positions for part-time ethnographers or qualitative coders which seem like a great jumping-off point for the kind of career I want.
* I’m trying not to be picky, but I don’t really want my work to revolve solely around administrative tasks or fundraising. Not only would that really bore me, it doesn’t really seem like it would lead me down the road I want to go with my career.

**My Education and Experience:**

Most of the jobs I’m seeing require either a Bachelor’s with 5 years experience or a Master’s with 3 years experience.

I have a BA in Anthropology and my MPH focused on Social and Behavioral Public Health, meaning I really do not have any hard skills in SAS or Epi. I really enjoyed my coursework and was so excited to start a career but I’m feeling frustrated that I didn’t get more experience. Upon completing my MPH, I asked some of my supervisors and lecturers for some career advice, and they all suggested going for my PHD - really?! After 3 years of a masters program?

Believe me, I have milked my work experiences to their max on my resume, using keywords and tailoring my resume to each position I apply for - but if I’m being realistic, my most relevant work experience boils down to the following:

* I have leadership experience from my cafe management role, and a volunteer coordinator position for an education-focused NGO in Cape Town. I find this to be my most valuable work experience - while not really at all relevant to Public Health… I find myself speaking about the cafe more than anything else when I have an interview - always coming up with solid examples of soft skills like leadership, prioritization, conflict resolution, communication, etc. when asked.
* I  have started to place a lot of value in my time spent abroad - 3 years living in South Africa seems to be a topic of conversation that all my interviewers ask to hear more about. And I want to live/work abroad again, send me anywhere...
* I worked as a “research assistant” with an org within my university to write my MPH dissertation (a systematic review - methodologically very simple, IMO). They really wanted it published - there were people who I never even met jumping on to the project as co-authors (I grew to totally despise academia for this reason) - but when it came time for the “co-authors” and supervisors to make edits, they stopped responding to my emails all together. It’s a shame it didn’t get published, but at that point I already graduated with my MPH and moved back to the States.
* A few months of some very basic qualitative coding for a market research company.
* A 6-week contract with a biotech company assisting clinical research.
* I worked as a field researcher, assisting with focus groups and interviews with community health activists. A very cool experience but I really only worked on that project for about a month before it fizzled out.
* About a month of hospital-based data entry and cohort matching for a friend’s paper on PMTCT.

That’s all I really have to show for 7 years of university and two degrees. I know I should have focused in on something more specific during that time and dedicated my time to gaining work experience, but this is where I’m at.

I understand the impact the pandemic is having on jobs, but there seem to be plenty to apply to! And with an education in Public Health, it seems like a global pandemic would be an ideal time to jump in to the field, even as a contact tracer or some sort of capacity building role that doesn’t necessarily require public health knowledge…

**Any advice on where to go from here?**

* Should I be looking into internships? I’ve interviewed for one, and much of the conversation centered on why I would be seeking an internship at 30 years old with an MPH. Weird, but it was a good conversation and I think I still made a good impression (I’ve yet to hear back).
* Should I be focusing on fellowships?
* Are there courses or certificate programs that would boost my resume with some hard skills? I really feel done with continuing my education (the MPH investment has yet to pay off), and I’m hesitant because a certificate still won’t give me the experience required.
* Any companies or organizations that I should look into?
* I hear so much talk and see so many posts on LinkedIn about how 90% of your responsibilities are learned on the job, and how hiring managers should take chances on candidates who are enthusiastic and willing to learn but may not have the experience or education.. How does this stack up in the global/public health field?"
kr74ps,5,2021-01-05,What should be my time frame to find my first full-time job?,ChoryonMega,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kr74ps/what_should_be_my_time_frame_to_find_my_first/,"Hi! I'm a new CS grad from a top-10 university, so fresh out of college that my diploma is still kinda warm from the printer. Though I would have enjoyed staying in school another semester to ride out the pandemic, my college's policy is to get people to graduate as soon as they finish their degree plans.

I've been applying to full-time work since October, after the very large company I interned in last summer had a drastic budget shift as a result of the pandemic and froze all hiring. (I'm in a Discord with about 110 other unhappy interns who have received very inconsistent communication, if any at all, over the past six months, and the prevailing opinion is, ""forget it, they've forgotten about us"" - ah, it's just so depressing thinking about how things felt too good to be true.)

Though I've kept my chin up, it's quite difficult right now. Looks like companies are focused on maintaining their current employees. I've had decent rounds of interviews (3-4 hr blocks interviewing with employees and high-level managers), but no offers so far. It feels like trying to start a fire with sticks after a rainy day: I just need one offer, and my hope is that the rest will follow.

Fortunately, I've got enough savings to stay afloat until the summer, and I'm confident that the job will come, but I have no idea how long I'll be in this limbo period for. It doesn't seem like it's under my control at all.

I'd be happy to post an anonymized resume, but basically bottom line:

- Done 3 internships
- 3.9+ GPA
- Led a software team in a tough aerospace engineering org
- Am lead dev of a fangame with 2k daily players (been doing it for three years now)

That said, what have your experiences been finding a full-time position since the start of the pandemic?

UPDATE 2/19: After six weeks and about 45 good applications, two offers came and I found my match. If you're reading this, there's hope! Don't despair!"

I had no idea what he was going on about, so I asked him to explain.

""Hahaha OP, I know you're just out of university but I didn't think you were this green. Basically, what I'm trying to tell you is that if you want to talk the talk you gotta walk the walk. To put it bluntly, you're gonna have to shit *your* cum into my arse whilst I shit *my* cum into yours.""

krc74d,1,2021-01-05,I was recently interviewed for a job that is quite different from what the ad said. Should I take a chance and proceed anyways?,abacat96,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/krc74d/i_was_recently_interviewed_for_a_job_that_is/,"I have been working for my current employer for almost four years. I started out as an intern, then moved to HR, then accounting, and now collections. I make a very decent wage considering I have a business degree, which are a dime a dozen where I’m from, and for only being 24 years old. However, I recently moved an hour away to live with my boyfriend (who was already commuting an hour in the opposite direction from where we live now) and have been commuting since last June. 

Winter has been rough, and I’ve been feeling the negative effects of not having any personal time during the week. The company I currently work for is also fairly small, so my chances of moving up are slim unless someone leaves or retires unexpectedly. I have no plans to move back to the area in the future, and I also don’t plan on commuting to that area forever. I stayed longer than planned after moving because of Covid, but I decided to start job searching a few weeks ago. 

I applied for a customer service job at a statewide bank that’s throwing distance from my house. I figured that while I might take a pay cut, the work would probably be less stressful and I would save money in gas/car maintenance, as well as have more free time during the week. 

I got an email a week ago saying the position had been filled, so I moved on. But then, today I got a phone call from that bank saying they had to reschedule my phone interview. I told the woman I had gotten an email a week prior stating the position had been filled and I had never been called about an interview (I *always* have my phone on me and never miss a call). She apologized and said she could still do an interview later today, so I figured what the heck. They called again to reschedule... again. But I did end up getting my phone call. 

Fast forward to the interview - I’m about halfway through, answering all of the cliche questions about my strengths/weaknesses and hopes for the future. She then drops a bomb on me that this would be a floater position and I would be traveling up to an hour at times to branches around the state (travel pay included, of course). This was not stated in the job listing. I even went back to read it again and I found nothing. That defeats the main purpose of me leaving my current job. I had stated my long commute as the reason for wanting to leave in my job application. 

I then asked her if there would be opportunities for career growth, as this is a very large bank in my state. She skirted around my question, telling me that new positions open up all the time all over the state and I would be welcome to apply, should I be interested. 

Finally, I asked her what my starting pay would be. I would be taking a much more significant pay cut than I expected, due to me never having worked in a bank before - despite my other experience. It would probably take me at least a couple of years to get back up to my current pay, and I really can’t afford to do that. I’d still be making more money commuting to my current job and paying for gas than if I were to accept this position. 

On the other hand, what if this did turn into a great opportunity in the future? I’ve heard great things from people I know who work for this bank. Maybe they wouldn’t have me working at far away branches all of the time. And I’d be getting paid to travel, at least. My current job has been okay, but there are certainly downsides. Maybe this company would be better? 

I was invited for a second (zoom) interview on Friday. I do still plan on attending, and I do have more questions, but I’m not holding my breath. 

Covid has definitely influenced my willingness to jump ship at my current job. I basically have immunity and know that my job is secure no matter what. I’d be scared to death of losing my new job should my state shut down again. As a newbie who is just a floating backup, I feel like I’d be one of the first people to be let go. 

How should I navigate this situation? Should I wait covid out and just be thankful I’m making decent money and have job security during a pandemic? Should I wait until I find a better fit? Or should I take the chance and try something new? 

TLDR: Job interview revealed that the position is different than I thought; not sure if I should leave my job at my current company"

I’m grateful for the offer considering the circumstances, however, the base salary wasn’t what I expected. 

For background: I was originally suppose to graduate Spring 2020, but that got delayed due to personal circumstances. Immediately before I found out about my delayed graduation, the company actually offered me a position (in August 2019) for a post grad start date (June 2020). 

They allowed me to continue my internship through my new graduation, which was very generous of them. Anyways, they recently offered me a position post-grad ($70,500 base salary), which is lower than their original offer from last year ($72,000). I was expecting something higher than their original offer considering they’ve told interns during summer events that more intern experience within the company leads to a higher base salary offer, but this isn’t what happened. 

I’m definitely gonna take the offer, but wanted to know if any negotiating would be worth it. I understand that with COVID jobs are hard to get, which is why I’ll be accepting the offer, but I was a little disappointed with it considering I’ll have 2.5 years of experience there even before I graduate. 

Any advice or comments are welcome. Let me know if I’m being too greedy :) thanks!

Update: Thank you everyone for the thoughtful responses! I decided to raise the concerns I listed above, as some of you suggested, and my offer was raised to $74,000."

I started a few days ago and my team seems great, projects are interesting. Tasks will involve both front end and backend, and DB, using recent technologies (recent JS framework, and microservices).

I’m burning to get better at my job because I’m just starting to make connections between the different projects, and the different software engineering concepts that I learned at school. I would be a lot faster in-person because I focus and learn better that way, but we need to WFH.

Everyone has been very helpful and supportive but I want to also be able to learn on my own. Sometimes I’m overwhelmed and I don’t know where to start. I really want to produce quality results and be effective at this job. 

I feel like I ask too many questions, but my coworkers explain super well. I just don’t like taking up their time, even though I usually understand way better when they explain it to me instead of me spending more time trying to understand on my own.

Can I get advice on how to improve at my job, and possibly impress my team lead and coworkers? How do I produce good results as an intern? What should I aim for, as an intern?

Thank you."

I wanted to get an approximate salary range a full-time junior software engineer/developer/UX &amp;UI Designer could start to negotiate from. I've competed in several hackathons and won some of them as well.

Before you jump down my throat, I've already checked GlassDoor and other salary tech salary websites, but members of those websites aren't mentioning how they leveraged their internship(s) (assuming they got one) to negotiate a higher than average (compared to people with no Soft Eng internships) salary.

krh84o,1,2021-01-06,Advice for moving for an internship?,jengland16,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/krh84o/advice_for_moving_for_an_internship/,"Hey all! This upcoming summer I’m going to be doing an internship in LA (which is about a 20 hour drive for me). I’m starting to think of the logistics of the move. I’ll be there from mid-May to mid-August. 

It’s a super long drive in my opinion for a three month stay, and shipping my car would be about $2500 for a round trip. Renting a car for the summer is much more expensive. Is living without a car realistically possible in LA? I’ve heard it’s a super spread out city and the public transportation doesn’t seem to be as good as New York or Chicago. 

Advice on renting? Short term leases aren’t always easy to find, and usually carry an up charge. Plus if I end up flying, I’m going to have to buy some basic furnishings (a desk, kitchen supplies, etc.) to get by. Extended stay hotels or Airbnb are other potential options. 

I’ve not hand to move this far away for such a long time period, so I’m just unsure of the best methods to handle this stuff, especially in a city which I’m not familiar with. 

Would appreciate any advice you have!"
krhhvk,3,2021-01-06,Questions about Job title and salary at a tech startup.,HongFu_Magic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/krhhvk/questions_about_job_title_and_salary_at_a_tech/,"Background about myself, I am currently in a weird situation. During covid, after my contract ended at the government, I was desperate for a job so I took this job at this startup as a Software Developer (DevOps) and worked for free for the first two month (did not sign any  contract so it will not show up if a future employer decides to do an employment background check) so I could gain valuable tech experience. After the two months, the startup was looking for a Data Science intern (paid). I end up getting the job but, when I was given the contract, the job title was ""Software Developer"". I am in a 2 man team and my current responsibilities is similar to a 'Data Scientist'. I am grateful for this experience and learning a lot. I was told by a colleague that the employer had plans for me after the project. My problem is that they plan on assigning me another client project and although I am grateful for more related experience, I think I am ready to look for another 'Data Scientist' position. I am not well compensated, I have next to no work/life balance (6 days a week and expect meetings anywhere from 9am to 10pm), and doing all of the heavy lifting (coding/data wrangling/analysis/etc...). My colleague (15 years of Data science experience) is just there to give me daily task, review my work, and give tips (which I don't mind).  I was told I am being compensated a certain salary for a couple of months (24k annually) and that we'll see where we go after it ends (end of January).   


My questions:

1. What am I allowed to add onto my resume? I was told by the employer that I could use any title I want as long as it is related to my responsibilities. I currently have ""Software Developer (DevOps)"" for 2 months and then ""Data Science Intern"".
2. Can I even have the Software Developer title and responsibilities on my resume even though there's no proof other than screen shots and words of the employer? 
3. Can I have ""Data Science Intern"" as my job titles even though the contract says I am not?
4. Should I even bother staying? I asked because I am currently being referred to several companies and it's frown upon to leave a company/job in such a short amount of time. 
5. If I do end up having the talk about the salary, what kind of salary should one expect from a startup? Are Canadian tech companies being self funded?   


Thanks in advance!"

How tough was it to get one? How much did you need to prepare for the interviews? What kind of projects did you have on your resume? What are the general/more accessible cs career paths fresh undergrads go towards? I keep hearing how the industry has a shortage of SWEs but people still have to apply to 100 of jobs to get a few interviews. Although I feel like 90% of classes don't prepare you for the real world, I'd hope having gone to college for 4 years for cs would benefit more than just getting your foot in the door. Granted, I haven't applied to any jobs yet but from what I've heard makes me think the market is pretty competitive. And I'm not talking about the top tier FANG companies. I'm curious in general how difficult  it is to get a swe job with minimum to no prior experience. Thanks for the input."

krlenv,98,2021-01-06,I feel stupid about how I spent my time at UCSD.,[deleted],UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/krlenv/i_feel_stupid_about_how_i_spent_my_time_at_ucsd/,"I know comparison is the thief of joy, but some of my friends are getting job offers in such cool fields. I envy them. It kind of makes sense though, given the skillsets we have to offer AT THIS TIME.

In freshman year, I barely passed Math 20B, despite studying my brain out, whereas other people from that same class went on to use applied integration in engineering coursework. After 20C, I changed majors, switched over to something way easier, and enjoyed my college life.

I don’t feel stupid about calculus. Many smart people have a hard time with calculus, but I feel stupid for not having applied myself in college to prepare myself for what to do next.

I feel stupid for being very short-sighted all along, thinking about grades for “this quarter” or internships for “this summer.” I didn’t spend enough time thinking about how that stuff would prepare me for wherever I want to go after graduation.

If you’re reading this, that’s the one piece of advice I would give. Don’t make the same mistake I made, don’t be so short-sighted, and please remember to think about where you’ll be after graduation.

There is so much that I find interesting in this world like behavioral/addiction research, agricultural finance, UX engineering, and so much more. It’s a real shame I can’t go into those careers now, since my qualifications are exclusively in a field I do not find nearly as interesting. I have instead found a tremendously boring job in press releases, because that’s what my coursework and internship experience have earned me.

I’m fortunate to have a job offer, but I’m not so fortunate to feel like I’m in the wrong place.

To be brutal about it, I could have been in a much better place at this point, if I had studied harder, chosen a more fitting major, and planned my internships in accordance with my long term interests.

At this point, what choice do I have? I could go back to school for another bachelor degree in something I like better. I could try to teach myself employable skills in the fields I want to enter. I could leave everything behind and live in the Alaskan wilderness (Chris McCandless already beat me to that one). I don’t think I could go to grad school in a field that I like, since I think they’d expect a lot more undergraduate coursework.

All in all, I feel really stupid for putting myself in this predicament. I really should’ve known."
krlpln,1,2021-01-06,Is an MBA worth it if you have average work experience and a business undergrad?,lowyams,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/krlpln/is_an_mba_worth_it_if_you_have_average_work/,"I went to an info session for one of the schools I’m targeting. They had two current students come and talk. When I looked up their LinkedIn I no longer felt I had any chances.

I’d like to get into an MBA program because I studied finance at a non target and got stuck in compliance/audit and I’d like a career refresh into PE. 

But I have some things I’m concerned about.

I’m currently 30 which I feel is pretty old when most classes are at an average age of 26. 

My work experience is not prestigious or valuable which makes me worried when it comes to getting internships, and the good stuff is only 2-3 years.

Lastly, Sure getting into a m14 will open doors but I still will have to compete against colleagues with IB, MBB, and unicorn tech firm backgrounds, of which I have none. It makes me worried that I won’t have a chance come internship season, why the heck would any firm hire me when someone already had precious MBB or IB experience. Does this hold true, or am I just being paranoid? 

My last concern is, I’m doubling down on my mistake of going with business when it may be better to gain new skills to add to my career toolbox(data science + finance is hot right now).

I have been working at a small company for a few years now and recently received a job offer from my previous manager that worked with me to join together again as a team with their new company. Overall I am conflicted because if I leave my current company, they would be in trouble since my team is just the three of us. I would be leaving my current employee that I trained up from an intern to now a full time employee. My new manager is fantastic and very supportive. However a lot of the upper management is not supportive of the projects my team wants to work on, so sometimes our work is more maintaining the company vs improving. I have been frustrated here for a while but it’s masked by being around good people. I wanted to get some opinions on if this would be the best move. pros and cons below: 

Current job pros: great work environment! Small team of about 45 people, great new manager and a great employee that reports to me. 

Current job cons: they are owned by a private equity group and I believe they are looking to sell the company soon. I have been told I should be okay and not get laid off but I don’t want to 100% trust that


New job offer pros: much bigger company that could allow for much more opportunities in my young career! A lot to rebuild for the team and reporting into my same manager from my previous role, better pay by 5K, better benefits!"

Hello,

I applied for Amazon's Summer 2021 Software Development Engineering Internship in Canada. I applied quite late, (December 15th), and because of that, I'm not very hopeful for even getting an online assessment. However, yesterday my status changed from Application Submitted to Under Review. Does this status change mean anything?

Thank you."
krpk0g,1,2021-01-06,"Advice needed: My (37m) sister (33f) has been stuck in a extreme rut for years, now creating serious financial trouble.",ThrowRA_Reb_Brown,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/krpk0g/advice_needed_my_37m_sister_33f_has_been_stuck_in/,"**This has become quite the long post, but hope you bear with me (TL;DR below):**

My  sister (33, let's call her Jenny) and I (37m) are close and she is one  of most caring, loving and dependable people I have ever met in my life.  I love her dearly, she is always there fore me and anyone in her life  and I am so glad to have her. But she has been stuck in a very difficult  situation (the aforementioned ""rut"") for years and things are getting  much worse.

Unfortunately she kind  of inherited some very negative behaviour from our mother: Almost  aggressively ignoring difficult situations and taking anyone asking  about it or offering support as a personal attack. Many aspects of her  life are absolutely off-limits and taboo - that applies to both family  and friends. It has kind of become an unspoken rule. Nobody wants her to  pull back or lose her in our lives, so we pretty much just play along.  But she has been in a very difficult situation for years, which is  reaching a critical point - so shutting up and just dancing around it is  no longer an option. I need to help her - very soon. I have already  spoken to my father about it who shares both my motivation and fears. We  are now trying to figure out how to approach this - and I would love  any advice and experience you guys can offer.

**What exactly is the problem?**

In  addition to being loving and caring, Jenny has always been very  intelligent, driven and dilligent. But when it came close to finishing  her Masters she kind of just stopped and pulled back. My father, I and  also some of her friends tried to help and assist her, but this is (I  believe) where the trouble really started. That has been around 7 years  ago. She has never finished her university degree, never held a full job  and is still living with our mother (which in itself is not bad of  course).

I believe that the reason  for her not finishing was the fear of what was to come after. She  needed only to do one more international internship (she already stayed  abroad for a semester and did really well) and her thesis. Unfortunately  she never actively decided against finishing her degree, she just kind  of started ignoring the question.

**Some family background**

I  myself have been in therapy (both sessions and pharmaceutical) for  depression and anxiety for some years. It's something I have been  seriously struggling with, but I've been handling it a lot better and  having a pretty stable life. But getting outside help and perspective  has been incredibly helpful. The reason I'm bringing this up: Reflecting  on my own issues for years and knowing and observing Jenny I recognize  some patterns. Her ""defense mechanisms"" are very different from my own I  think, but the underlying problems seem very similar.

Our  parents divorced when we were young (I was 14, she was 10) and I think  that has been particularly rough on her. We are both close to our dad,  who lives around 6 hours away, these days. And most importantly: Our  mother is and has been pretty sick for a long time. She caught  tuberculosis in the hospital 30+ years ago and ever since then has had  serious lung issues. The recent years saw several infections and by now  one lobe of the lung has been completely removed. She is in early  retirement (at 61), has to go to the clinic three times a week to get  the opening in her chest from the surgery cleaned and taken care of.  Unfortunately this is most likely permanent, since it cannot be closed  due to several reasons. So our mother is doing ok, but she is pretty  weak and especially since COVID she is only at home on the couch.

**The situation**

I  have also moved back to our home town 2 years ago and help where I can  (groceries, getting food, stuff around the house etc.), but of course  Jenny is doing most of the housework (including cooking, gardening,  cleaning) since she is still living there. Our mother is officially  ""severely handicapped"", is not able to do all that much, but is mostly  self-reliant - as in she doesn't need help with everyday things. They  both seem to be doing well with the living situation, which in itself is  great I think! But I have this feeling that this whole situation is  something Jenny is hiding behind - despite all her good intentions and  loving work for our mother. Simply said: Our mother would be fine if  Jenny worked full-time or even moved out. I'm there. My aunts. Very  lovely neighbours. She would be taken care of, no question.

Jenny  worked for a book store part-time until around 4 years ago, but there  have been lay-offs. In addition she works (volunteer) for an Oxfam Store  a few times a week (it has been closed for 2 months now). But that is  it, she never tried (from what I can see) to change that situation. She  is constantly doing gardening, baking and cooking for everyone, building  stuff etc. Where others in her situation might become lethargic, she  always has something to do.

But  still: She is just stuck at home most of the time, kind of living like  someone in their retirement (not to be mean.) As her brother I want her  to be happy, not miss out on anything and live the life she wants to  live. What that looks like is up to her. I also want her to be safe,  self-reliant and taken care of. But I also know that is not it. She is  increasingly unhappy and the dynamic I have mentioned before (of most of  her life being taboo to talk about) has become increasingly worse over  time. She still has some very close friends whom she luckily sees a lot,  but from all I can tell the dynamic is the same.

**Why act now?**

You  might be able to tell: I have kind of avoided this topic after some  attempts for years. I'm trying to be sensitive, not judgemental and  especially not to give her the feeling that I'm trying to tell her what  to do. I want to offer her support. But those attempts - while not  catastrophic - did not end well in the past. I'm afraid of her pulling  completely back, so I've taken the easy way lately of avoiding it  myself.

But the situation grows  more difficult: I have recently learned from my aunt (who still has  contact to someone at the public health insurance she worked for) that  Jenny has not been registered for many years. Matter of fact she has  been put in the maximum default category, since she is neither employed,  student or even unemployed. This is close to a 1000 Euro a month. And  apparently she has been receiving multiple letters over the last year  and just ignored them or never replied. She is racking up some serious  debt and also: She is not insured right now. By the way: We live in  Germany, so not having health insurance is really uncommon.

In  addition to that I have no idea how she finances anything. Probably  with some of my mother's pension, maybe some of the inheritance from our  grandparents - I don't know. But whatever they're doing it can not  possibly be sustainable. I believe my mother wants Jenny there and is  pretty much enabling this whole situation and to the outside (say to  myself, my aunts etc.) is doing the whole ""just ignore any questions""  approach, too.

**What should I do?**

Now  you know most of the situation. I have kind of just tolerated the whole  situation for years, but I have also realized more and more how much it  bothers me and feeds my own anxiety. I love Jenny and my mother and  their both grown women, capable of their own decisions. But the  situation is not healthy and outright dangerous for Jenny's mental  health, happiness and financial security.

After  speaking to my aunt and my father I have decided that I have to do  something. Very soon. Idly standing by is no longer an option. I have  two goals right now, that I think are the important first steps:

**1) Getting Jenny to speak to a professional with an outside perspective.**  I would like to find the right opportunity to share my therapy  experience with her a bit more, showing her that it is not a big deal  and potentially a huge help. I know taking this step is easier said than  done, but I think this would help her a lot.

**2) Putting a band-aid on the financial issues (before speaking of a long-term solution):**  I want her to know that she is not alone with those problems. My  father, our family and especially myself are all there for here and can  help out. At least talking to the health insurance or the unemployment  office would be huge first steps here. I can only imagine how much  pressure this has put on her: Ignoring or probably not even opening  those letters anymore. I want her to see that those are problems we can  solve together. She is not alone with this. And there is no shame in  this.

Like I mentioned before: I  don't want to mess this up. I don't want to lose her. But I have to help  her. I have brought my father onboard, we are trying to come up with a  plan. I thought about talking to her two best friends, but I don't think  this is fair. This would put too much pressure on her and would feel  like I'm going behind her back.

**TL;DR:**

**Sister  (33f) has never finished university, never started a job and has no  financial income or security while living with my sick mother. She is  amassing serious financial troubles among others while taking any  outside attempt of asking about her life as a personal attack. I (her  brother) need to finally help her, but worried about the right approach  and potential outcome.**

Sorry for the long essay. **But what do you guys think? How would you approach this? Have you dealt with similar situations before?**

Thank you so much!!"

I've just applied for the Amazon business analyst internship in London, and am looking for some help/tips. My profile: 

\-Studying Physics, Mathematics and Statistics in London penultimate year (target school I'd say). 

\-On track to earn a 1.1

\-Got good experience in coding: R and MATLAB as part of my degree and Python through  self study (I graduated from the data analyst nano degree from Udacity during lockdown). I also know SQL and Excel. 

\-Was fortunate to get a 1 month internship as a consultant/analyst for Schneider Electric this summer. 

\-Volunteering, and other extra curricular activities.. 

I just submitted my application but need to take an assessment. I was wondering if anyone knew what was to be expected: math/stats questions? SQL questions? It would be great if I could get in touch with people who've gone through the application process or done the internship. 

Any help would be great!"

I'm about halfway done with my bachelors in Computer Science and at this point, I'm unsure as to how much knowledge I should know when it comes to applying for entry level positions.

I'm just not sure how much knowledge I should know before beginning an internship or even a full-time position. I want to be a competent programmer and not look like a fool given my position. Looking for some advice, thank you!"
krqgg3,1,2021-01-06,A slightly different GIS education question + plus some advice for prospective GIS students...,cgort3,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/krqgg3/a_slightly_different_gis_education_question_plus/,"Hey all. I've seen many GIS education questions lately and the majority of the advice has been exactly what I should've done. So now I have a slightly different spin on this question and hope to get some thoughts from others, so I can make the best decision possible. Plus, I can offer some personal experience to help others make better decisions. Skip the first section (advice) for my question. Thank you for your time in reading and commenting.

**Background experience (advice for prospective GIS students):**

I left the grocery business for a major career change slightly later in life and returned to school without any degrees. I went with a new and personally exciting field, Sustainability, for a BS. The program was brand new and by the time it ended, those of us with a singular focus/degree found ourselves with extremely limited critical skills to apply to any specific job/career/field. I needed something to make me marketable to a new job, so I decided a graduate degree would be best at the time. After what I thought was significant research, I decided on a 1-year MAS-GIS program. It wasn't cheap, but it was marketed very well. (I also spoke to the program director, personally, to get a feel for the program.) The program wasn't great and lacked some key aspects to the GIS field, such as intro to any programming language. One class was literally turned into an open lab and no skills were taught, just shared some outdated articles. In the end, it was an expensive certificate! I was able to find a decent job in gov't, where I started as an intern and was quickly hired on full-time. However, I am nowhere near doing what I had originally hoped I would be. And I barely use GIS! There are some tweaks I could've done here and there to slightly help, such as learning some programming skills. However, the biggest wall I'm hitting is the lack of any degree or experience in a specific field. While I have the work and learning ethic to succeed in a new field, I don't have the ""evidence"" to support it. Moral of the story: *Do NOT get a standalone degree in GIS.* A certificate is MORE than enough. Find a field that interests you and dive into that, then learn GIS on the side (minor, certificate, etc). Additionally, programming knowledge is a huge plus too! (\*Also, I do have TONS of volunteer experience on my resume, but not enough to supplement most job requirements. Enough to get some interviews, but not the job.)

**Education question:**

If you skipped the prior paragraph, I'm in an odd predicament. I have two not-so-useful degrees and little work experience, outside of grocery, for my attempted mid-life career change. I work in gov't, not doing as much GIS as anticipated, nor in the field I had hoped for. I'm looking for the best approach to get into the career that I want. I'm broadly interested in most NGO-type work, such as international development, conservation, climate action, etc... My options appear to be one of the following...

1. Return to school for another degree. This time, in a specific field that interests me and will give me the critical skills necessary. However, adding to my student loan debt is not ideal. (i.e., Oregon State's MNR program.)
2. Attend a coding bootcamp for programming or data science skills and hope this will be enough to get me onto my desired career path. I've reached out to a couple bootcamps and have surprisingly not received much info in return.
3. Step down to do an internship for the necessary experience. I could be like Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson! :P (This would be my last choice, but an option.)
4. Find volunteer work to create a proper portfolio. This started out tougher than it seemed, as the same skills were needed that I didn't have. I tried sites like GISCorps, etc. I'm willing to try again, if anyone has helpful leads.

If anyone else has been through something similar, what advice do you have? Or anyone else, I'd appreciate some input on my options or new options. I appreciate everyone's time in reading and offering advice. And I hope my life experiences may help others choose the best path for their career ambitions. Thank you and happy mapping!"
krr0jw,1,2021-01-06,Questions to ask an employer,RaahulPokemon,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/krr0jw/questions_to_ask_an_employer/," What kinds of questions (for the full time position) should I ask an employer if I am looking for an internship this summer and a full-time position in Jan 2022 (both with the same employer and location?

The employer said that the internship would be software development and data science related and that they were looking to have me back as an intern. Last summer's internship with them was mainly teaching kids (ages 8-16) how to program and some basic training with Unity. This isn't for some big name employer. This is a separate division in the university I am currently attending.

I am a senior and current GPA is 3.31 with an overall GPA of 3.06. I have taken Operating Systems and am about to take Programming Languages. I am decent with Python and am about to be decent in C++. Reason for ""about to be"" is because this semester I am building (written in C++) a small interpreter in my Programming Languages class this semester. Language that we will be interpreting is called ""TIPS"". I can't find anything online about it, so I guess it is a language that my teacher developed for the class."

Overall at university I've been working hard and getting good grades, better than I ever thought I was capable of in comparison to my previous education.

During this 2nd year though, despite considering myself capable to do the assignments at hand, I've realised I'm not really passionate about the subject matter at all and it causes me a lot of stress.

On top of that I'm trying to find a placement (internship) for my 2021-22 year as a year in industry, but every test I've done for them has been demonstrably more difficult than anything during my time at university, to the point where I can barely even begin to attempt them.

I am in my last year in Software Engineering, I feel very insecure on the inside and incomparable to any of my classmates. This is the time in which I must have an internship in order to be able to eventually graduate, but I still haven't found any. ~~I have attached my CV in both~~ [~~English and French~~](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cy7_-1OMuAWXuORvMahdqIXw2cUc27bH?usp=sharing) ~~for anyone interested in giving me suggestions for improvement. (Thanks for anyone interested, just don't want any potential employer to read this and know my identity)~~

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is stupid, but I'd like to ask for help with the way I approach learning and programming. In my first year, I did an internship, but because I didn't have internet, I just got a couple of books on HTML/PHP/MySQL, read them and finished my application. After the summer, I met my friends and asked them about their internships, and they were all throwing big names: ""Django"", ""Flask"", ""Laravel"", ""Symphony"" and how much it made their lives easier in the internship. I felt something missing, as if the only idiot in the class. Last year, we had to do a ""PFA"", a final studies project, I decided to do it in Java, looked up a bit and found out about Angular/Spring Boot. And decided to do my work in them. But I was hearing my friends all talking about doing their works with things like ""kubernetes"", ""docker"", ""redis"", ""microservices"", ""kafka""... I was wishing I would die on the inside. My friends seem very knowledgeable, way more than me. But also, there's something else, they just seem to watch tutorials and go practice what they learnt immediately on their projects. I seem to have a kind of paralysis for perfection, kind of like, let's learn everything there's to learn before even daring to write a line of code. I know it's stupid and inefficient, but I don't know how to fix that? Besides, I don't have the luxury to just give up and change fields, I must succeed. It's either success in software engineering, or god forbids, eternal failure. I really need some help, some suggestions, someone to guide me and tell me what to do and learn. There seems to be a lot to learn, and even if you decide to learn something and follow tutorials and books by the letter, just because you installed a new version of the software or something, stuff start to break, the syntax is different, It's just driving me crazy. I just want to know if there's something that's stable in software development (web related) or should I just try out and learn some machine learning and data science instead?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, I know many people probably hate stupid people like me, but I really need help and I don't know where to start. Thank you

TL;DR: I am a stupid software engineering student, everyone in my class is better than me, they're all faster learners whilst I am a very slow perfectionistic student. This is the final year of studies, and I need to find an internship and improve my way of learning and studying; and to make matters worse, many of my friends had an internship last year during the summer, whilst I didn't. This is literally a deep scream for help, because I really don't know what to do."

Now that I have fortunately landed an offer at Microsoft, I realize I'm nothing more but luckier than other people struggling to get an internship. There is no secret sauce, no undisclosed ingredient, and not having an internship doesn't mean that you're less than anyone.

Most of the time, when companies are looking for people, they don't look for the best. They only look for enough good people to do the job. And trust me, if you pay attention in class, have worked on some projects, and care about how to make yourself stand out, you're qualified. There are way more qualified people than what companies need, so they take the first N good people and reject the rest. You can be ghosted because they haven't looked at your application and it's still in the pool. You can be rejected because they have found enough people. If you think it's because you're not good enough, you're being too harsh on yourself.

I was in the same boat with everyone here, from feeling like I want to throw up 5 minutes before my technical interview to being depressed after being rejected. Until Nov, I had nothing but one single interview with a unicorn that I failed. My point is, I feel like the anxiety and depression we feel is the result of the ongoing comparison we make between ourselves and others. Whenever I saw someone posting about getting an offer, the first thing I did was comparing me with that person and asking myself why I was still ghosted/rejected. It's good to know where you are on the map, but sometimes on this subreddit, people have become too critical of themselves when seeing others' achievements.

Your emotions are valid, but you don't have to measure yourself with someone every time you see an internship post. And it's not like you have to be the best to receive an offer anyway. At the end of the day, it's a numbers game, and your goal is to get people to pay attention to your application so it can be processed. That, instead of beating yourself up, is the best thing you can do. If you feel tired, take a break and come back stronger. Remember, you are good enough

tl;dr: what I've learned from my recruiting experience: getting an internship is not about being better than people. you can be ghosted/rejected for various reasons, but that doesn't mean you're not good enough. not having an internship doesn't make you less of a developer/person."

I decided to accept. Now weeks later I am going to the final interview for the Amazon SDE internship. Overall I think the Amazon position (if I can do the interview and get an offer) would be a better opportunity for me: better pay, a company I'd want to get a return offer for, Seattle &gt;&gt; location of other internship, better experience at Amazon, etc. So my question I guess is would you turn down something you already accepted because a better opportunity came up? in the offer I accepted it does say that employment is at-will so both the company and I have the right to ""terminate the relationship at any time,

with or without cause or advance notice"". Any ideas or advice would be appreciated! Thank you.

P.S. any tips for the final interview and how to prep would also be good, I've been doing LC and Cracking the Coding Interview so far with some youtube and reddit research.

But, I started to realize computer was more my thing, and also that I wanted to transfer to another college. For some reason, I couldn't take the CS 1 class fall of my sophomore year (already in my college), until this spring semester 2021. So technically I'm taking freshman courses even though I'm considered a sophomore, and I was concerned this was going to affect internships. People usually start internships around Junior year, but my junior I'll be taking sophomore classes, and from the looks of it I'll be in college for a fifth year. So I guess my question is, should I start doing internships until I take junior level classes, or should I just start when I am junior (taking sophomore level classes)?"

I am a 3rd year junior at a UC college studying computer science. I have no professional experience, however I have several projects which utilize many frameworks, languages and useful concepts. I have been applying to internships since October of 2020, and I have had a few online coding assessments but I have not had luck with a single interview so far so I'm kind of losing hope now. 

I really need an internship as I hear that it is near impossible to get a job after graduating without an internship. And even besides all of that I just really want to do it.

So what do you recommend I do? I have changed up my resume and posted it on a resume subreddit to get some tips, but I've still been getting no responses. 

There is a job fair coming up at my school in a month or so and it is virtual. Does anyone have any tips for how to crush it at the job fair? Any tips specifically for a virtual one, and more info about how that works? I have been to an in person job fair last year, but I had no luck at all, many of the recruiters simply told me that they are only looking for rising seniors as interns which I understand, but I didn't have much of an opportunity to talk with anyone really, so any recommendations?

I grew up in a poor immigrant family in a poor neighborhood.  My parents came here from Asia without speaking a word of English.  They came here to give me a better chance for success in life.

They prized education above all else - growing up, they never took me to the movies, but I could get any book I wanted.  Their dedication to education got me all the way into a top 10 university.

That's also where I promptly ran into a brick wall.  I was a fish out of water - I had trouble connecting with my new classmates, I had to work to support myself, and honestly just got too distracted by the freedom I had never had before.  I played too much video games, I spent too much time chasing girls.  For most of college I felt like I was failing everything - it was just too much and I wasn't ready.  I floated for most of college at a 2.X GPA, and had to use extra semesters to graduate with almost exactly a 3.0 GPA.  I wasn't really involved in extracurriculars - didn't even really know about the professional clubs that were on campus.  I had crappy internships - sophomore year, I ended up working IT support in a company in Asia, but only thanks to a relative.  Junior year, I did a little better, ending up as a management intern at a small retail chain in the US.  I did not have a job lined up by the time I graduated.

I moved back into my parents' place after graduation.  While my friends were starting their new finance, consulting, marketing jobs, I was playing video games really not sure what had went wrong.  At some point, I just got tired of living at home grinding my life away on World of Warcraft.  I ended up applying to everything that looked even remotely appealing.  Places I've never heard of ever again.  I sent out dozens on dozens of applications - most never replied, I bombed a couple, and then I got lucky.

I know Accenture gets made fun of on Reddit a lot, but I'll be forever grateful to the interviewers that saw something in me.  One of the MDs (RIP) even asked me if I had a story for why my GPA was so low, which gave me a chance to share more about myself.  At the end, they said they didn't have any openings in the offices I was interested in, but could potentially find me a spot somewhere else.  Right before the New Year, I moved across the country - farthest I'd ever been in the US - with two suitcases, ready to try something new.

I did fine at Accenture.  The analytical work and thinking work came pretty easy.  The people side was a real work I progress.  Asides my three month internship, this was really the first time I was interacting with busness people.   So it was a real learning curve.  I was a really good Analyst - got promoted to the post-MBA position really quickly.  But it was too early (for me).  I didn't do a good job handling the new level of responsibilities.  I wasn't great with clients.  I was getting pigeonholed into being a modeling guy.  I took on some really hard projects and felt like my managers didn't understand what the hell they were doing (they really didn't).  The last straw was after a tough year, they docked my performance rating a whole grade because I missed 2 or 3 time sheets.  I started looking at MBA as a way out and perhaps try to get to a better place.

After studying my butt off, I got a 760 GMAT - high off of that, I applied to all the top schools.  I probably spent an okay amount of time on all the apps, but maybe I was stretched too thinly.  Still I was hopeful.  I had the GMAT, I had a good career trajectory, I had good LoRs, I thought I had good essays.  I was devastated when rejection letter after rejection letter rolled in.

Ultimately I couldn't bear working at Accenture anymore for all the reasons above - when a boutique consultancy in my hometown asked me to jump on board for a sizeable pay raise, I did it.   I left on pretty bitter terms - my career counselor said some pretty unnecessary shit to me on the way out, but it certainly made my decision to leave easier.  Took a long vacation with some buddies and moved back to start something new.

That next cycle, I applied to MBA again - and was fully rejected again.  I had lowered my hopes even as I was applying - my title hadn't really changed and I was at a no-name place, but I thought that perhaps some of the schools would reward my persistence.  So, I couldn't help but be disappointed in myself again.  Luckily those feelings was cut a bit as it just so happened that I started off a deep, new relationship around this time.  It let the girl and I spend much more time together.  Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise - if I had to move for MBA, the relationship may not have lasted.  Who knows?  We're married now.

The third year I tried applying to MBA, I had just been promoted to a manager position, but I knew that this was probably going to be my personal last shot at MBA.  I just couldn't imagine another year devoting the time to this dog and pony show of a process.  So to try to ""seal the deal"" on this last go, I also hired a MBA consultant.  He was definitely helpful - he opened my eyes to what MBA adcoms were looking for.  He helped me restructure my essays to tell a better and clearer story.

And it worked.  I finally got into an M7.  I actually got 2 acceptances and 2 more interviews that I didn't follow through on.  I ended up struggling a bit with the decision to actually attend as deadlines were nearing - I had to ask myself - did I still really want to go or was this just some kind of unfinished business?  I was comfortable, making good money, and my new firm liked me.  But ultimately I decided the chance to recruit for a top company would open up new doors, and that I wanted to see what that life was like.

""Redemption MBA"" - I only heard this after I had already graduated, on this subreddit.  But that's exactly what my two years at the M7 were.  I ended up graduating near top of the class.  I was heavily involved in clubs and in leadership positions.  I could finally afford to do things like vacation and other events that I couldn't afford as an undergrad.  I ended up getting recruiting for tech and consulting and got opportunities in both.  But after having done consulting at Accenture and then a boutique, I just couldn't turn down MBB.  I wanted to turn it down for work/life balance - but I just wanted to know for myself - was I missing out on something from a top firm?

Twelve years since I graduated from undergrad with an unclear future, I'm now an Associate Partner / Principal at MBB.  Things are pretty good all considered.

AMA.

&amp;#x200B;

===========

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT - so lots of questions about MBB versus Accenture.  I didn't write much about that because I thought people would be more interested about the MBA part.  Caveat though - I was at Accenture when I was younger and quite a while ago now.  And you can probably tell I didn't have a great experience.  But here goes:

\- Solving the problem... this is going to piss off some people, but I just don't know any other way to say it.  When it comes to strategy consulting, Accenture was bush league - Accenture was much closer to my boutique than it is to MBB.  At Accenture, every team it felt it was it's own little fiefdom of people.  Every project was like starting over from scratch because no one knew anything.  The KX was useless.  Research was Google and cross your fingers.  At MBB, we have real thought leaders on pretty much every key topic.  The \*norm\* is to get the right experts involved in every project - there's no turf wars.  There are off-the-shelf frameworks that have been client tested and refined.  People are constantly putting out new thought pieces or the firm is developing relevant assets to be deployed. You \*never\* start from scratch.  You take existing knowledge, apply it to the client, and improve upon it.

\- Projects... at Accenture, there was a \~33% chance you were going to regret your project.  It was always something: shitty MDs... bitchwork staff aug projects... being way overscoped... being way understaffed...  clients being allowed to walk all over the team... it was always something.  I'd say that number is 10% at MBB, and it's almost always the need-to-over-deliver reason.  Which is palatable when it's actually something impactful.

\- People... can be a toss-up.  There's a lot of high performers and type-As here.  The plus with that, is that everyone is excited to do a good job and everyone works REALLY hard.  That can be fun sometimes if you're working on something meaningful.  But I have fonder memories hanging out with the people at Accenture.  Maybe it's because I was younger then, but we had a real tight starting group and stayed close - went on vacations together, timed our trainings together, etc. People at Accenture are just chiller and that helps.

\- Money... the trajectory's a lot better at MBB, no questions asked.  As an aside, it always pissed me off that Accenture paid Consultants much less if they didn't have an MBA, even though we were doing the same work.

\- Hours... MBB is for sure a few hours per week more than Accenture.  On paper they probably look pretty close - the problem is that when you're working so much, every incremental hour you lose is that much more painful

\- The up-or-out pressure is probably the worst part of MBB.  It's a double edged sword - it let's some people skyrocket to partnership in like 6 years.  It also kicks a lot of people to the curb sooner than they may want.  I feel myself falling into the second bucket already.  At Accenture, you could take longer if you wanted - there were some Senior Managers waiting at the door of Partner for like 10 years.  No way you can do that at my MBB."

I wish this info was available when I was applying which is why I'm writing this, hope it helps!

**Quick Background:** From a non-target school. Also I am ironically not a CS major.  

**Recruiting Process:**

\- The first stage is to apply to the website and complete the application and essays.  I submitted 3 essays to the 3 prompts that they required. The word count matters less than the quality of the essay you submit. Facebook recommends just spending a couple hours on it, but I spent days perfecting my essays. I suggest you do the same, as thousands of others are applying as well. 

 To the interview stage! There was a welcome Zoom call before the interviews started where current FB employees detailed their daily responsibilities, culture at FB, benefits, etc nothing about the interviews themselves. During this call, I saw nothing but Harvard, MIT, Yale, and other ivy leagues on the call which did get me a bit worried. I started having imposter syndrome but I seriously hope those of you who get to this stage understand that you were selected for a reason. Use the worry as fuel to study harder if anything

**The interviews themselves:**

 A 'prep' email is sent out that vaguely states two interviews will take place: a technical interview (you can use any programming language), and a product sense interview. 

\*\*Overarching advice for both interviews\*\*: Facebook and really any tech company are looking for STRUCTURED AND SYSTEMATIC thinking. PLEASE DO NOT just jump into the problem and start to bable. Take a minute breath and then structure your thoughts into buckets. 

**Technical Inteview:** Again you can use any langaguge (java, python, SQL). I had limited (and I mean limited) experience with SQL and Python. I found SQL to be easier so I spent the next two weeks taking 1-2 hours every day learning and mastering SQL. So much so that I actually ended up getting the data engineering role rather than the data science one (which is a bit more technical). Honestly only basic SQL is needed so its good to master the fundamentals than go further into concepts like window functions. Again here lay out how you will solve the problem before solving it. I made 2 syntax errors but because I communicated how I would solve the challenge, my interviewer was happy. Do practice problems to study ( I can't disclose specific problems). 

**Product Sense Interview:** Here is where that structured thinking really comes into play. Do NOT just start speaking, take a quick min and structure your thoughts. Then start answering the questions in a systematic kind of flow. I can't even tell you how many product management videos I watched on YouTube to prepare and how much they helped me. Product management exercises is also a good resource. Do a bunch of these problems (preferably Facebook ones). 

After speaking to other candidates you should expect an email requesting a quick phone call with you 3-5 days after the interview. I got mine early, 2 days after my interview. I hopped on the call and that's when my recruiter told me I got in! 

This 8 week internship leads to a return 12 week internship offer and then a full time offer to work at Facebook as a data engineer or data scientist! 

Sorry if this was long, there's just not a lot of info out there on Facebook University in general and I know this would help calm my nerves during the process. If any of you have questions please don't hesitate to ask! Good luck everyone!"

Just wanted to gather advice on applying for an internship. Backstory: I have worked at a notable retail company for over 3 years and was fortunate enough to accept an offer to intern at the corporate office from May to August of 2021(I am supposed to graduate in May of 2022 from business school). There are a lot of opportunities to grow in this role after college and I am very excited. That being said, there is an internship opportunity that sounds very exciting and is in line with my major that starts in January of 2022. Now, I do not have ties to the outside company nor do I think it would be a sure thing of acquiring the position (my chances might even be low, I don’t really know). The gist of what I’m asking is would you think it would sound bad to the company I currently work for that I am applying for internships outside when I haven’t even started the one this summer as I assume they will contact my current employer. Also, would it be appropriate to add the internship I am supposed to be doing in summer to my resume to the new company because they are accepting applications so early in time? I enjoy where I am at and excited for my internship now but want to keep my options open in college to get a more enhanced experience and resume. Thoughts, advice, or questions?"

I'm graduated with a bachelor's in software engineering and thought it would guarantee a job (I had a coop in my school and landed two internships). Well it's been almost 7 months since my graduation and I've applied to over 100 jobs with just 3 interviews, rejected in both. I've been trying my best but am constantly being rejected.  


Recently I had an interview with a company and I'm almost sure that this has to be the one, I'd rather not go into details as they might figure out who I am. Anyway the job apparently required one to constantly learn the applications and software in the job as well as coding. It's apparently very very heavy.  


But that's not even what bothers me. I went on the company's glassdoor and its full of reviews that are either 5/5 or 1/5, there was literally no middle ground.  


Worst of all the positive reviews are so obviously fake because they don't enlist a single negative thing about the company and are constantly praising the company like a god with the cons being ""There are no cons"".  


The negative reviews reveal that the employees are dissatisfied and that there's a huge turnover rate with people constantly leaving and being fired. Every negative review is harassed by the company saying something like ""shut up, you're wrong we're actually good"" along the lines of that.  


I'm torn, should I reject one of the only possible job offers I've received in months or should I bite the bullet and risk unemployment for several more months (don't tell me I'll get a job ""soon"". I've been struggling for too long, I don't want anything to be sugarcoated )  


TL;DR : I'm most probably going to be hired by a shady company who fires people a lot and posts fake reviews to save their ass on glassdoor. I don't know if I should reject it and risk unemployment/homelessness or take a chance and at least make some cash"

I honestly just enjoy the quiet but feel like I’m making people uncomfortable with that awkward silence. And it’s not like I am social outcast as I was when I was younger , I been improving my communication with others since I graduated how school now in my final year of college , also because  in my internship  it’s one of the important tools to have.

ks909s,2,2021-01-07,I’m struggling again,throwawayjobseeker7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ks909s/im_struggling_again/,"It is now January, 2021 and I still don’t have a job. Winter break made me feel happy for a little while cuz my siblings were off from school and I felt comfortable being able to relax. I’ve been a lot happier lately because I finally kept to a workout and have lost about 35lbs so far. I’m also teaching myself Japanese for fun cuz I have nothing better to do. During the break, I just felt like I wasn’t useless and that I wasn’t supposed to be doing other things instead of relaxing and playing video games. The exercise has given me the feeling of doing something progressive or productive in my life. 

But now winter break is over and my siblings are back in school. And I’m back to feeling like I shouldn’t be playing video games or just relaxing and with life in quarantine, I feel like when I want to go out to run, I’m just in the way of my siblings doing school or working. I don’t understand how people search for jobs. I don’t get how you can just apply for whatever. I’ve applied for multiple jobs and 1) I haven’t gotten responses 2) the jobs end up being scams and 3) the jobs I see sound horrible and would never get me to any place I’d want to be. Lately I’ve been regretting not continuing school, especially with a lot of schools being completely online with courses. When I did my bachelors in sociology (Im starting to feel like I wasted so much time since it’s gotten me nowhere) a lot of my courses were online so I’m used to the online remote learning. It would’ve been a nice opportunity to buy some time in trying to get internships and making connections thru school networking while also maybe getting a masters in an awkward scenario everyone is living thru that personally is right up my alley. 

What is it I’m doing wrong? I’ve been looking at jobs in: marketing, pr, social media (all of which I feel like I’m not qualified for) and moreso data entry (most of which are legitimate scams) and even more recently recruiting jobs because my brother suggested that could be good for me which I do agree with to an extent. How do I just drop this feeling of thinking I’m not good enough for any job? How do I make sure companies are legitimate? I want a simple remote job. I don’t want to go out while we are in a pandemic. I have friends who are getting 5 jobs while doing a PhD program, and it makes me feel small and less than. I’m sick of hearing/reading about other people landing the jobs they want or even getting interviews or the ones struggling because their job(s) isn’t enough when others don’t even have 1 job. 

I’m sorry for the rant, I truly am, but this has just gone on for too long. This is the result of holding in what I’ve been feeling these past 2 years since graduation. What is it that’s holding me back?"

How do you guys not get super depressed and feel like such a loser after going on LinkedIn? I know I shouldn’t compare myself to others, but it hurts when all of your classmates found something but you. I have received so many rejection letters that I no longer feel like I have anything to look forward to. 

PS: should I just delete Linkined? 

Backstory. 
I am based in the USA. I have been job hunting 7 months and so far not much luck. I graduated with a dual master’s in management and international management from top foreign university in Aug. My original plan was to find a job in Asia with my degree and I did manage to get 2 offers, but was recalled as they couldn’t sponsor my visa due to local policy changes.  

The university is not one of the target schools in the US. I always get a nice rejection letter without even getting to the interview stage. My bachelor degree is from a US university and I did some internships and have 1 year of full time experience in the US, so it’s not like I don’t have any experiences in the US. I feel like I’m never going to find a suitable job in the US. 

I’m just so disappointed in myself and feel like such a loser. I go on Linkined or chat with my classmates, and everyone else seem like they have something great going on. Urg I have gotta so jealous that I can’t be happy for others. I hate myself so much right now that I even started to cut myself."

A war on scale that never have been seen in the Main World. NoirElDem empire was the greatest Empire that the Main World has seen. Their brethren cousins could not see it sticking to their old ways and could not see the glory of their empire. Sure they had to enslave others, sure they had to use forbidden magic, sure they had to break every rule but they just could not see it. This empire was the last attempt to bring back the mythic golden age for ElDem species as the whole and those fools called in humans for help.

What curious people those humans, so different yet so similar. They had no magic so they resorted to their machines to take them to the stars that was the only thing that made them so different. They just like NoirElDems had ambition, just like them they had imagination and just like them they did not take no for an answer. Of all the opponents NoirElDems faced humans demonstrated the greatest cunning, the greatest adaptability and greatest tenacity. The war quickly evolved and changed over the course of those ten years. NoirElDems would invent new magic, tactics and strategy to use it and humans would always come up with answers of their own. It would go back and forth but in the end Humans were proven victorious.

So here she stood Noctura one of the last of two surviving members of Circle of Dis the ruling matrons of NoirElDem society. Beside her a young witch Lateria though only recent addition to the Circle of Dis and in many ways survivor of cut throat politics of her once glorious Empire. The only reason they both are the last surviving members are because they struck a deal with humans. They saw which way the wind was blowing and they, in true NoirElDem fashion, were salvaging their position.

So they stood at this desert with the giant hole humans made to invade their underground capital behind them and human delegation in front of them. The sun was high up in the air and humans set up a table in front them. What strange thing they were not big on ceremonies but they clearly had some ceremony in mind this time around.

“I General Jake Abramson of Federal Interplanetary Army present you with this document for your unconditional surrender.”

The human in the grey suit with bunch of medals and ribbons pined on his chest spoke sliding a pen and paper to Noctura and Lateria. This human commander was flanked by one familiar face to Noctura, Captain Daniel Farnsworth of those wretched Delta warriors a second in command of her nemesis now presumed missing Major Raymond Crawford. Another face she recognized was the face of High Councilor Miala who sold out this world to humans by calling for their help and led to this war. There was one more face present on opposing side of the table she never saw it before but she knew who it was. The architect of human magic that led to their victory Doctor Mark Stoner and he was sitting in this strange armor surely creation of his own.

“I Noctura the Grand Matriarch of Cricle of Dis submit to your demands of unconditional surrender.”

Noctura spoke calmly as she signed the paper. Then she looked at the paper and saw what she was signing up to. Abolishment of slavery, abolishment of working with their gods, abolishment of biomancy. They would have to give a lot of their holdings and assist intern human government to maintain peace and be subject some of their people to judgment for crimes against sentient beings. A notion never heard before across the Main World.

“I Lateria the Matriarch of Circle of Dis submit to your demands of unconditional surrender.”

Latera spoke as she also signed the paper. Noctura looked at Lateria she knew she would have to give up a lot of her own people to humans to face human justice as did she, that would damage their positions in NoirElDem society immensely but what were the alternatives. Extinction and humans have proven they ability and will to burn entire planets with Fertalia to achieve their goals. She actually wondered if they would judge humans like that for their actions during the war if situations were reversed. Agh well she will rise to the top again. Those humans as smart as they are, they do not live as long as the NoirElDems and in time she will have her glorious empire once again.

“Ok now stand back 20 paces away from the table.”

General Jake Abramson ordered the two Noireldems to what they complied without a question, now they were slaves obeying orders of their masters.

“Doctor Stoner do it.”

General walked around the table so did the Stoner and captain Farnsworth. Stoner at first looked at two NoirElDem witches with smirk of superiority. Than pointed his index finger up into the skies to the left of him as some manner of energy started forming where he was pointing. Then he descended his index finger down and a laser beam of extreme intensity burned the ground. He slowly was moving the index finger across the ground as the laser followed it. The laser moved across the plain leaving the scorched black ground behind it. Noctura and Lateria stared in utter awe and terror as the beam crossed in front of them. Once it was done there was a line of scorched ground left from one side of the horizon to the other.

That’s when general Jake Abramson of Federal Interplanetary Army called NoirElDems closer by the gesture of the hand and just as they approached the line the laser beam stopped them.

“We’ve drawn the line on the sand do not ever cross it. I dare you to try.”"

TL;DR — Building a new kind of applications/development platform, looking for someone who can join me on the business side of things, e.g. help me grow this from a good working-concept to a real life business.

--

When the coronavirus lockdowns began last year, I found myself with tons of motivation and drive to build The Next Thing™️ but without a job after getting back to being employed just three months earlier, prior to which I was building/doing a startup in the Bitcoin wallet space for roughly two years.

The lockdowns started and I was mocking around with ObservableHQ.com and built a neat little [Coronavirus Statistics Table](https://observablehq.com/@elisk/coronavirus-stats) that works according to my desires and needs - it was the early days before the numbers started rolling in...

As I kept working on this little table and improving it, I *naturally* wanted to extend it to the realm of React, my personal favorite programming environment these days. But ObservableHQ isn't built for that. To say the least. Without going into too much details, while it is possible to run and write react apps (or any other javascript framework), many aspects of ObservableHQ are conflicting with the roles and responsibilities of the framework in question. [Observable's not Javascript](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript) - as they put in their own words - can be a great intro into what I'm talking about.

At some point I said enough is enough, I'll go build my own observable with blackjack and... React. or Vue. or Angular of you wish to. Ever since I saw that amazing [Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII) all those years ago, I wanted that experience, I wanted that feeling - instant feedback on every little thing you do. I mean this is one of the reasons I fell in love with Front-end almost 15 years ago specifically.

So I've started building [djit.su](https://djit.su) - a notebook style development platform, that looks something like a google doc (much like ObservableHQ) but besides writing words and adding pretty pictures, one can write real-life code inside these documents and have the platform execute the code in real-time, providing instant feedback, and allows you to quickly publish and deploy your creation as a full-blown app or website, with some modern bells and whistles like SSR built-in for you to enjoy and not to worry about.

I went into a frenzy. You see, I've been fascinated by the power the modern developer has, but annoyed by the amount of boilerplate and unrelated-to-coding work there is. Setup a hosting (even if it's git), create an infrastructure, a build process, decide if it's static or dynamic, if it's static then create a flow to update it (even if it's just pushing to your git repo), if it's dynamic then you'll need some backend, and all You've wanted is to make a small calculator app that calculates your mortgage. I finally saw something that allows me as a developer to sidestep all of that mess. Just write the code I care about. Click publish, and forget about it until the next time I need to do something about it.

After a couple of months that I worked around the clock on this, I got an amazing job at a start-up, managing a small team of front-end devs. During the next four months I continued to work on djit.su at a neck breaking pace, basically getting back from my day job, spending some time with the wife and kids, and once everyone's asleep I'd sit down for additional four-to-six hours of coding.

The more I coded it the more I enjoyed playing with the thing itself. Anyone who had a chance to play around with it during the development stage noted how fun and different experience it is compared to the tried and true ways we all know and love, which gave me the push I needed to keep the pace and bring it to some level of maturity.

Last month I've finally deployed a 'stable' (albeit still lacking in many facets and needs a lot of work) version where people can start working with this, exploring this. Later last month I also released it to the public as an open source project - [elis/djit.su](https://github.com/elis/djit.su). Both of which were major milestones that I was eager to achieve after working on it for almost a year with minimal external exposure.

Right now I'm here - I've just released it, and only now start talking about it in public. Currently we're a tiny team; myself as the main developer and everything else, and an intern I took on in the middle of last year that does some development.

It's very early stages of this project, but I have high ambitions for it. My goal is to make djit.su a favorite tool for developers to use to roughly sketch something down and see how it works, perhaps later down the road completely allow developers to switch to djit.su as a development environment. My aim is to allow the developers, who I see as super-humans with amazing super powers that require project managers, product managers, designers CEOs, CTOs, and what not to utilize that super power, to channel it correctly, to be able to work in the same environment with non-developers.

Right? We write code in VSCode, but we look at its results in storybook, read the requirements form a google doc, report issues in jira, receive assets on figma, and we're basically trying to sort all of that information, all of those pieces of the puzzle that we're required to build and compose them into a coherent code-base that can be executed correctly by an ever growing list of environments (CI/CD, local, mobile, SSR, serverless, embedded, tests, etc' etc'), and can be maintained in the future and hopefully continue to function.

So djit.su's aim is to allow non-developers to compose code that developers write. In many ways I'm planning for djit.su to have the best of: wordpress, gatsby, and wix - wordpress as it allows you to customize everything to your needs and liking, gatsby as a modern environment that has major benefits compared to aging stuff like wordpress, and wix as a GUI for end-users who only want to move boxes around, change some text, select an image, and click ""save"". And I think that both the eco-system and the technology is mature enough to allow such an ambitious goal. It will obviously take time to reach that place, but it's a way that I see how djit.su can not only take but also be highly productive at, given the chance. Even if it won't reach the scale of the giants mentioned above, it's an amazing tool in and of itself that even at this early stage devs and non-devs find useful.

Holy wall-of-text... Didn't mean to ramble about it, but I guess it's required if anyone to find any interest in this.

So currently I'm looking for someone with some real-life business experience in raising funds and approaching potential clients. There's still a lot of work to be done on djit.su to make it the gem I portrayed above, and ideally I'd like someone who can see the potential and understands how to convey it to clients and investors.

A bit about myself - I'm a developer by trade in the past 15+ years. In love with the world of Javascript (and also Bitcoin!). I've been a consultant for five years, and managing small development teams in various companies since. I'm an avid React enthusiast, I enjoy the world of product and UI/UX, and I'm allergic to bureaucracy.

I'd love to answer any of your questions here in the comments or in private PMs, or feel free to hit me up on telegram, I'm @AceHigh there. If you have any comments, suggestions, or any feedback at all (I know the front-page looks like a mess, but it's all written INSIDE/using djit.su! :D working on the content and all) - by all means do share :)"

Need advice on how to leave this job.,myspoonisagoodsize,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ksgof8/ceo_micromanages_and_the_marketing_department_is/,"\[heads up, this is a little bit of a rant as well\]

So this all started last March when I lost a job I loved at a company I adored due to pandemic cuts.

After that, I was frantically trying to find a job. 100s of applications later, I got only 1 interview and I ended up getting this job for a marketing position (social media + trade show focus). I had a weird feeling about this place because of how they handled the interview and the vibe I was getting, but I ignored it and accepted the position bc i desperately needed a job and it paid decently.

Fast forward a little bit, I find out that the job description they put up wasn't even for this position... they copied and pasted it from another company's site and didn't adjust it. I still had a lot of similar duties, but I also had to handle everything else. That means on top of fully managing social media and trade shows single handedly I also had to handle all marketing campaign management + creation, handle all agency relationships we had, design and send emails, work with sales for collateral, project manage our singular graphic designer, own and manage our project management software and also eventually manage a handful of very inexperienced interns. I'm sure I'm forgetting duties, but I'm literally the only marketing person on staff. I do have a boss, but she's been trying to step away from the marketing department for awhile now since she's technically the head of a different department, so most of the responsibilities still fall to me.

And before you say ""oh this is kind of normal for a small company"", it's not a very small company. We're over 100 people and we are by far the smallest department in the company. For reference, other departments have at least 6-10 people minimum and they're all full time qualified people, but for me, it's literally just me and a few interns and i'm expected to operate at the volume of a fully staffed marketing team.

I've tried asking for more staff, but they don't involve me in the hiring process at all and fail to mention anything to me. The only way I know they're doing anything is if I search they're calendars for interviews. They (higher ups) did higher a new manager for the department once, but she ended up leaving without any warning 3 weeks later and I was put in a much worse place than i originally was because now I had to play catch up for items I had already handed off to the new manager.

On top of this insane work load, I also have to deal with the worlds worst CEO. He ""went to school for marketing"" (but has never had a real marketing job and only ever started this company from his daddy's money) so that makes him feel that he can micromanage me on every level and contact me at any time of night. he constantly berates me with unneeded criticism and always demands i push aside other top marketing priorities so I can handle his personal marketing requests (usually to get him on a podcast or go take pictures for him to put in his personal office). my manager is friends with him so she doesn't care, but the CEO is constantly an asshole to me and never stops being an entitled prick. I've worked with CEOs before and never in my life have I been treated so badly by one and with such little respect.

Long story (not so) short, I'm losing my fucking mind. I've been at this job for 8 months at this point and it has taken a huge mental toll on me. My depression has gotten worse, I cry from the work abuse weekly, and I've just overall lost my fucking mind. I have never hated a job more than this. I feel like maybe getting recognition would make me feel a little better, but the only person who ever gave me a recognition and tell me i've been doing so much was the new manager that ended up quitting.

I literally cannot bare the thought of staying at this place, but i unfortunately don't have much savings to go off of since I used it all when i got laid off last year.

I'm so mentally exhausted and beat down from this job I find it almost impossible to do anything post work, including applying for jobs.

I feel so stuck. I don't know what to do. Is this normal in other companies? I just desperately need some advice about any of this. I want to just quit, because I feel like I'd rather die than work another day at this place, but at the same time I don't know what I'd do for money if I just quit... I feel like i'm between a rock and a hard place and I just can't take this anymore."

ksi7nd,1,2021-01-07,Help on internship offer.,Forigma,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ksi7nd/help_on_internship_offer/,"For background I’m a junior. I have one R&amp;D internship experience at my school research institute. Want to shoot for “top” companies full time after graduation (have grinded a lot of LC and will do a lot over the next 7 months).

I got an offer from a ~1000 employee company. It is a primarily software company. My title is SDE intern.
They take on around 30-40 interns each summer. The pay is roughly 18 USD/hr full time. The position is likely going to be in person in some random city and state, nothing special (kind of like Vermont and Wisconsin or something). However they said if I wanted to be fully virtual they would support it. 

For information on the process, I applied online company website on say day 1. I got an email to schedule an interview on day 3. Interviewed with 7 engineers from 5 different teams on a video call. Interview was 30 minutes. Interview happened on day 8 or so. Offer received on day 9.  

Mentor hasn’t been decided, but it would be one of the interviewers. Work, depending on team, could be stuff from mobile development, web dev (angular), Postgres database, standard Java OOP...
Tbh those topics don’t sound bad and i think they are all fairly applicable.

My concerns 
- pay (meh not too important, anyway my offer is consistent with this company’s Glassdoor data)

-offer all happened so fast. From online application to offer was 8-10 days...

-no technical questions (no OA, no data structures and algo style questions). Just one general Java question and one data base question in the interview. Very short.

- have about a week to respond, but I’m currently in the process with 3 other companies, one of which is a really great company, but I’m only in the OA phase (submitted few weeks ago with all test cases passed). One company is pretty good, and the other is on the same tier as my offer.


Any thoughts? The main thing causing unease is the lack of algorithm questions and just 1 30 minute interview. I might have to accept, but still keep my other applications in process and see what happens. Maybe I should negotiate the pay? It’s kinda bad feeling since I made more last summer in a research position haha :/"

I barely even code, I handle mundane busy work from time to time and I’ll listen in on meetings. I’m pretty much delegated an hour worth of work for the week. For awhile I would ask if there’s anything else to do, but that would just transpire into covering paper work for the team lead. 
 
I usually fill my time working on side projects or goofing off. I know I shouldn’t be complaining about getting free money, but I was looking forward to learn more about the cs field in general. 

This kinda fucks with my headspace too, I feel like there’s so much potential to learn but no matter what I do I always end up being pushed aside by the team. 

I think without the office environment my team is having difficulty actually finding a place for me and the other interns.

Anyone else noticing this, or did I just strike out?"

But in general, should you take cs 162 before taking cs 161? I saw in the class description for 161 that it covers OS security as well, so I thought I might need 162 background to understand it better."

I graduated college around 6 months ago with a BS in Computer Information systems with focus in InfoSec. I was also an intern for a IT help desk for around 1.5 years. However, after I graduated in the COVID pandemic in July, my internship ended. I was jobless for right around 3 months until I got a part-time job while I continued searching for around for a full-time IT position. 

Needless to say, I got a full-time IT tech position with a mid-sized manufacturer in my hometown in rural US. So, I am the only IT guy in the whole company both in my hometown and in the company headquarters in Canada. They have zero infrastructure currently as I am having to run the wires and setup all the switches and everything which I know how to do. The major issue I have is the work is continuing to pile up and I have been told they also want me to starting doing not only all the networking but all the system admin, maintenance, user admin and information security as well. This is further compounded by a need to run around 30-40 cameras around the facility along with monitoring them all somehow. I also have to be the help desk for when users sometimes have issues in Canada. It is not like I don't enjoy the experience but the pay (35k) isn't great and the burnout is real. I have only been in this job around 3 months but my workload will continue to increase as the production ramps up and we are potentially moving to the cloud.

Therefore, I am basically using this job only for the experience and am looking to move on sooner rather than later. I really enjoy both info sec and networking and I would like to focus into one of them. So, I was thinking maybe get my CCNA and then once I have enough experience go for my CISSP? Just what I am thinking it might be wrong. I can also do some dev work with like SQL, mvc and C# but it is not really being utilized in a manufacturing environment. I am open to any advice.

Thanks"

I'm in kind of a weird situation with my Amazon interview and would appreciate input anyone has.

I originally applied to the Summer 2021 SDE Internship with plans to move it to Fall 2021 if I got the offer. I ended up passing the OAs and have my interview scheduled in a couple weeks. However, I've been seeing among my friends who've interviewed and on this sub that more and more ppl are unable to shift the their internship from summer to fall. It's also not possible for me to switch my study and co-op terms around so I can accomodate the internship during the summer.

I was thinking I should just withdraw from my interview as in the best case even if I get the offer, I won't be able to take it, and if I got rejected after the interview, I wouldn't be able to apply for another 6 months (and would not be able to apply to the fall posting). So as I see it, there's no point in me interviewing this time.

Has anyone withdrawn from an Amazon interview in the past? What are the consequences? Will I be able to reapply whenever the Fall 2021 posting opens up in a few months?"

Hello, I have been working in caregiving roles for about 3 years, and I’m burnt out. I don’t feel like I’m helping people. I work with seniors usually 80+ doing really simple tasks. Major things I do is make sure their briefs are dry, make meals, and help them with medication. It is a really easy job, but it’s also very boring. I like the people I work with. I can’t be around them for 1+ hours although I am. Most have dementia, so they don’t remember me, and we typically have the same conversations everyday. I can see myself doing this job for volunteer work or even 5 hours a week, but not for 30+ hours. I consider myself not much of a talker. I’m interested in people, but I don’t really like to talk to them. I’ve got to the point where I’m very anxious at my job and I try to stay away from my clients or do whatever I can (sweep floors, clean) to stay busy. 

My other “caregiving job” was working in a school in the intensive learning center. I loved working with the kids. That job was very toxic though. There was not really much support, and no actual trained professionals to teach the kids. I was essentially working in a daycare for kids that had autism and/ or had mental emotional problems. It was very draining, and again I burnt out. 

Outside of caregiving I worked in the restaurant industry too. I liked that at the time because it was stimulating, and the classic restaurant culture. I quit trying to become a server (who can support themselves independently for the most part) because i lack confidence in talking to people. Plus the environment had downsides too, like most co-workers were really extroverted, and I didn’t relate to them much. I was always kinda stressed to have to interact with them. 

According to the internet questionnaire MBTI test I am an INFP and INFJ (I have taken the test a few times) I think I have a desire for deep meaningful relationships than surface level relationships. I like humor, but I really don’t laugh about mundane things. 

I actually got offered a small manager position at my first job (Qdoba) I never took it because the monotony of working in food service. Plus it was my first job and I didn’t wanna feel stuck there, I was ready to leave at that point and try something else. Although I feel like I would’ve been good at leading people. 

College wise I went to tech school right out of college to become a dental assistant. I did it partly because my best friend was doing it, the money, and my mom told me to do it. I was eighteen at the time. I didn’t know much. I finished my internship doing that. I quite hated it, I didn’t enjoy the dentists and also the surface level relationships of working in an office. I received that certification about 2 years ago. I thought about doing that for a job. Although I am fearful of getting the job and feeling that agony once again of working in a dental office. Plus I don’t have any experience. I kinda got bullied by one female dentist, so I am scared of that happening again. 

I feel very, very picky. My mom tells me to pick something and just go with it. Agh I can’t do that though. And this part of me bothers me. 

I thought about going into nursing, so I started my pre-reqs and did a CNA class. I passed the class, gonna take the actual state test next week. Although after my current job as a caregiver, I am wondering how the heck am I gonna feel being a CNA? 

As for college I don’t have a degree and a very small amount of debt. I interviewed a social worker, and I thought I wanted to do that. Now doing research on the actual profession it sounds very familiar to the work I am doing now, and I know there is quite a burnout in that industry. 

I like to help people, I do. But my last and current job burnt me to the brim. 

In all my jobs my favorite moments were: 
Helping a man through a stroke until the EMT’s came. I think it was the adrenaline rush. Plus it was almost as if i got calmer and my I knew exactly what to do in that situation. I drove his wife to the hospital that night and was there to support her. (This situation made me want to become a nurse) 
Also
While working in the school a social worker taught me some trauma therapy techniques to help a child who is in distress. This child was crying and I used the technique. We eventually both regulated ourselves, and he stopped crying. I felt so powerful. 

I also enjoyed when the kids listened to me, respected me, and when I made them laugh. Many good things came out of that job, but I was so burnt out that I actually had a panic attack at the job. Everyday I felt sick to my stomach. I don’t know if it was the job or the environment.. maybe both. 

I am not sure what to do.. any advice or insight?

Edit; please excuse my grammar."

Hi all, I am new to this sub and I was pointed here by a friend so forgive me if this is something that has been asked before.

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2019. Out of college I worked for a company as an intern under the title ""Software Developer."" What I soon realized was this was going to be a few months of building an access database. Wasn't too hard but God was it boring. Following the internship I was offered a position as an associate developer in a far-away-from-home state. I worked that position for a year and then COVID hit and I was working from home. I quickly grew depressed and alone so I sought a transfer to my home state within the company on a new project.

I have been on this new project for about 3 months now and I can already feel the imposter syndrome kick in and I don't even think it is imposter syndrome. I legitimately do not think I can work in coding the rest of my life, I'm not built for it.

I've always had an interest in IT. In college I was a tech support person that did the usual simple tasks of troubleshooting and what not or installing software or helping with network issues--nothing serious but felt rewarding.

At my last job, the first one I took, since I was so junior I was a jack of all trades type that helped basically anyone who needed hands. I absolutely enjoyed my time setting up servers and networking them and getting them all up to the correct security protocols. Even cutting cat cables and making new heads for them was a fun time. COVID hit and I was no longer doing any of this rewarding work.

My question to you all is, is a computer science degree and my history a good enough basis to start looking into a job with IT? I know I don't have a degree in something more dedicated to IT but I've worked a lot with computers and networks since I was young.

Is there a path for me? Or am I bound to be a shit coder the rest of my life barely scraping by and barely understanding what I do?

TLDR; Have spent about the last 2 years in software development as a junior developer, have an interest in IT and would like to know if or what a path forward for me could be to change careers."

So I am a recent college graduate and hold my BS in mechanical engineering. I began to look for positions in my field after graduating in December. Today I was offered a job with a local company that pays MUCH less than I was expecting to make with my degree.

Unfortunately I did not get any internships during my time in college, so my only experience is leading my senior design project, the experience gained in college and my 5 years of customer service and sales. 

The position I am looking at is contract to hire and pays a whopping $16/hour (40 hour weeks) for the first 4 months. Upon hire that gets bumped up to $18/hour for the first year, and works up to $60k/ year after a couple years.

My biggest issue is obviously the pay, but my lack of industry experience is definitely working against me. Is it best to take the position for the experience? Or should I continue searching for companies that better value entry level engineers?"

I was heavily lied to in order for me to take my current job. It is not engineering, there is no chance at a Professional Engineering License, and I’m stuck.

Most times I will get a phone call to set up an interview where they ask what I do, I will explain it and they will cancel the interview saying they need someone with more engineering experience, not drafting and design experience. 

I’m slowly coming to understand that I’ve been out of school so long and having done no engineering work in that time its hurting me as well. I believe this because even entry level positions get me the above response once they learn I’ve been here a year and a half. 

So I think I’ll have to start over, via an internship. I have never done an internship and the thought of no job security really scares me. On top of that I’ve never heard of someone going back to an internship after entering the work force but after a year I think I need to be honest with myself.

For the people who know what I’m talking about, how do you keep up with incompetence, what resources can I use to seriously learn these things without bothering my team too much. I don’t want to let them down, nor do I want to lose respect in the team cause it would just spiral from there...

Also, I am the only intern on this team (surprising ik) so I can’t lean on fellow interns for help. Even if there were other interns I don’t think they would be able to help or even want to help."

My girlfriend has had 3 suicidal thoughts in the last three days and today was the first time she mentioned the method she thought about. I am always available to her on videochat and text when I am not able to be with her, and I do all I can to help her mental health and encourage her to continue with her therapist (which she has one that she sees intermittently), go out and see her friends (which she has very few of unfortunately), and to work more hours possibly to busy herself, which has been good for her in the past.

However, today she mentioned a method. She tells me that she would never go through with anyone due to the pain it would cause those around her, but that's exactly what a family member of mine said when I was very young and they ended up going through with it, shocking everyone.

However, the main problem here is this: She lives with her parents and is still dependent on them (insurance, cellular, etc.), and I don't believe that her parents are going about any of this the right way or understand what is going on with her. Every time she has confessed to me about suicidal thoughts, I have alerted her parents as well (with her permission) and they tell her and me that suicidal thoughts are ""normal"" and are ""just thoughts.""

She can't even go to work without calling me from the bathroom crying. She has very serious highs and lows, and it is extremely mentally and even physically taxing on me. She wakes up during the night and calls me crying. Her and I both do not know why she gets these crying spells and has these highs and lows, there is no trigger that her and I see. She sees a therapist and a psychiatrist but I don't think that either are helping AT ALL. Since she is still a dependent, I don't know what to do as far as bringing her to see anyone or bringing her anywhere because it would be paid for by her parents who don't seem to understand the situation at all.

So my question is this; what am I supposed to do in this situation? I really love her and care for her all the time but it is so hard for me always, especially being busy finishing up my degree and being an intern (totaling full-time). What should I do for her and how should I go about this situation?

Thank you in advance for your input and time."

Coursera:
41/hr + 500 gear stipend per month

Currently leaning towards Coursera; I believe the pay would be similar in the end. Coursera's Internship is 4 weeks longer so I get to dive more deeply on my internship project. Don't know my team for either.  Plz help me decide.

Note: both of these offers are for Canadian office and pay is wrt Canadian dollar.

I basically made a majority of the application. I left when school started because the project came to an end and I was moving on to my senior year.

&amp;#x200B;

Months later, I'm at a new internship and doing school full time, and I'm in the middle of still searching for a job. The application I worked on recently broke because of updates to some of the libraries it uses, and my former boss reached out asking me to fix it. I like the guy, and I'm a nice person so I took a look at it, went back in and updated the libraries and redeployed it, however after testing it further we found some more bugs that I think would take a significant time to fix.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently not employed there anymore, nor do I want to work there anymore at this time, however he's offered to pay me for my time to help him out, so it's not just free labor. I would rather focus on my studies and current work and I want to tell my former boss that I don't want to/don't have the time to fix it. Right now I'm still job searching, and he's offered to write me a reference letter, which I most likely will need. Will telling him ""no sorry I can't work on this right now"" negatively impact my relationship with him, or hurt me later if I end up using him as a reference? What is the best way to handle this boundary if I've already entertained the thought before?"

ksweeh,7,2021-01-08,I constantly feel invalidated by my closest friends and family,metaphysicalgoat,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ksweeh/i_constantly_feel_invalidated_by_my_closest/,"*I have not been diagnosed with ADHD, and I know self-diagnosing and assumptions are dangerous, so please let me know if this post doesn't belong here!*

Edit/Update: I have now been officially diagnosed 


I've been resonating with a lot of posts on this subreddit, and I recently starting going to therapy to talk about the struggles that I've been going through and whether or not it is potentially ADHD. My therapist is pretty certain that there is something going on, and we've established a plan to focus on a potential diagnoses with ADHD, OCD, depression, or anxiety (or whether or not they are comorbid, because we keep swinging back and forth at this point). 

A big struggle of mine has been bringing this up with anyone in my closest circle, and it seems as though the only person who validates how I feel is my therapist and maybe two other friends who go to therapy/have been diagnosed with something and can relate. She's directly stated that she doesn't usually resort to medication until she is absolutely sure someone needs it, but that she also has a feeling that medication might be something we may need to actually consider. This is obviously a long-term process, and nothing is set in stone, so that was more of a potential topic of discussion rather than a ""let's get you medicated ASAP"" thing. I've felt really shut down after bringing this up to my closest friends. 

For context, I struggle a lot with extreme procrastination, to the point where I am constantly sleep deprived, I sleep at around 10 AM if unregulated, always doing work at the bare minimum and BSed high school really really well (missed 40 days of school in senior year, slept 3-4 hours a night from procrastinating but still got straight A's because I know how to cram) but essentially crashed and burned in college. I can never focus on the shit I need to do, but somehow I can be on Reddit/Google rabbit holes for 12 hours straight, and somehow will constantly procrastinate sleep even though I need to get up early in the morning. Doing basic things on the day-to-day overwhelm me (how do people remember to drink water AND do laundry AND brush their teeth AND eat healthy AND socialize etc), and I suck shit at prioritizing unless I have an imminent deadline. Every day I have so many things I need to get done and every day I don't do them and I get so angry at myself because my body just won't MOVE. On the outside, most people just see slightly chaotic energy, and on paper I am ""high-achieving"" (top of class in HS, somehow ended up at an Ivy, managed to scrape by in internships, and didn't fail out because I got carried in undergrad and never really did my own work) but nothing on paper is representative of my day-to-day struggles. My best friend immediately rejected the notion of medication because my ""bad habits clearly aren't that debilitating given my achievements"", my brother and my dad asked me why I can't just set alarms or turn off my phone because it's ""that simple"", my mom keeps telling me I'm lazy, and most other people have this underlying tone of disbelief that there's anything wrong with me. 

It makes me feel like maybe I am just lazy and I am exaggerating my problems, because how do the people closest to me not realize how much I am struggling and how frustrated and angry I get at my own blatant lack of self control? Maybe I am just remembering my past wrong because I was so sleep deprived anyways? I'm not trying to shove the notion of any diagnoses or medication, if anything I just want people to understand that I am struggling, period. I'm feeling so much imposter syndrome because I feel like I'm not crashing and burning enough to be seriously struggling, but I'm also not put together enough to be actually perfectly functional. What if I'm just actually not trying hard enough, or if it's normal to have shitty habits and I am just overreacting? Or maybe I am just very good at hiding my struggles? It's so hard not to fall into that mindset. 

TL;DR I am struggling and in the process of getting diagnosed with something but my closest circle of people seem to doubt that there's anything seriously wrong and probably think I'm in a phase. Sorry for so being so word vomity, I've just been feeling so discouraged and invalidated lately and wondering if it's actually just me."

TL;DR - I want to start making money doing freelance, should I better my average web dev skills or learn data science? 

Hi, I have got a full-time job at MNC but it pays 16k, and no increments till 1 year completion of my trainee period. Good thing is 1 month notice period so I'm thinking I don't have to complete my traineeship here if I get a better prospect. I also had attempted the MCA entrance and got a good rank which gives me the possibility of going to a good government college in my state with good placements. Maybe a couple months I'll be able to juggle work and college because it should be from home for the most part, it might get tricky later on. Also my job won't give me any relief because I'm new which is understandable. My reasoning for MCA is because I can get better package. I am very passionate about programming and learning new things and I believe in a good environment I can achieve good things, but I haven't got the chance yet. Also I had to take the job because my family is not doing good financially and this was the job which had decent pay now and a scope later. I got my results last week which made me want to do MCA even more, it would be a waste otherwise. 
I also am doing a graphic design internship, which is very time consuming. I am thinking of stopping that and maybe start freelancing using what I know or learn something in demand. I think it would be ambitious to think I can earn as much as my current salary doing freelance but if possible it would be great.


Sorry for the long backstory but I'm overthinking about it a lot, if someone could give me any clarity it would be nice.

So coming back to question, I have created projects in React and Vue, there are small fullstack projects too. One thing I've noticed is they aren't good looking, just functional because I was focusing on creating a MVP that just works. I think when employers see the projects they don't feel it appealing. My design skills need a lot of polishing if I'm working on the front end. Needless to say I've tried getting clients for websites and failed.

Second possibility for me is I'm good at python. So I can use it for backend or data science. Data science interests me but Its a bit different than what I've learnt till now. I'm not sure if I should invest the time in this or master creating websites and web apps."

In four years, I managed to complete a dual major and a minor. I have a 3.4 GPA. I have all As and Bs. No failed classes. I have a great internship. I have job offers already. I have spent my free time learning programming languages, basically studying MIS as a hobby. 

I have struggled and stressed for four years of college. I had to do an AA because I wasnt good enough in high school. I have constantly missed classes and woken up late. I have a 3.4 GPA, when I wanted a 4.0. I have Bs. It took me this long to luck my way into an internship. I havent been able to find a job since 2018, and never a good job. I haven't spent as much time on programming as I feel I need to. 

These paragraphs are looking at the same events and expressing them as either a success in the first paragraph or a failure in the second. The second is how I've looked at things for a long time, especially in the moment. I hold myself to an impossible standard, at least impossible for myself. And I love that. 

I've realized that I do not need to do better. I need to change my frame of mind. Instead of goal setting, I'm switching to hypothesis testing. ""Can I, myself, do Y under X conditions."" And then observing the results. 

The reason I am proud of myself for Underperforming is because, I keep doing it. I keep setting these goals, keep striving for the top. And I keep failing (by my unreasonable standards). But I havent given up. Even during the worst times, I dont give up. And I am so proud of that. 

Being diagnosed with ADHD-pi has given me a lot of new perspective. I always set this high standard because I knew I was smart and could do these things, in a vacuum. I just never 'put in the effort.' Now I know my brain is wired differently. I have executive disfunction. So I can say 'yes, I can do those things in a vacuum, but I have trouble with integration of my actions.' So I can reevaluate my standards and be more forgiving to myself. 

So, I dont know if this will help anyone else, but I'm glad I underperfom. It shows that I have never stopped trying. If youre struggling, fighting, and stressing, check your premises. Chances are, you're doing better than you think."

Leaning towards CYSA+, OSCP, or possibly a cloud security cert. Again, I welcome any recommendations."

From quite some time (more than a year or so with inconsistent efforts), I am trying to get progress, however not really something solid occurred. I happened to have started some online courses for self-learning, could finally finish only few of them. I know the value of creating projects and hands-on experience of working with real world data. However, I seem to feel overwhelmed by variety of things to learn and apply, and having quite short time. Since I should start my Master's thesis soon and also I should get an internship to get in-depth applied knowledge from industry experiences. I am considering to go ahead with a paid course ([https://liveai.eu/aaie/](https://liveai.eu/aaie/)) , i.e. 599 Euros for 5 weeks. I know that the most of things to learn all these concepts are available online for free, however I am considering that with a guided and structured approach in the course, I will be able to narrow down my favorite area specifically and I will be able to get good hands-on experience of working on real world data projects.

I would like to get your thoughts/suggestions/experiences of joining this or any other paid course to  get significant progress in ML/DL areas, which will help to find potential jobs. How do you feel overall about the impact brought in your career by them and is it worth the money we happen to pay for?"

I fell into the trap many do of being coarsed into going to college strait out of highschool. I diddnt know what I wanted to do with my life and had no real work experience (fast food pretty much). My first year at college was rough, I went into electrical engineering at my stare university. I almost got a full ride the first year (like 5k out of pocket of the 25k bill), despite this i felt i was incurring massive debt for i has no concept of money really. I was doing poorly in many of my classes due to the transition from highschool into a fairly rigorous curriculum. This led me to consider other paths through college and I landed in mechanical engineering technology in which I did much better grade wise. Despite the improvement I decided to transfer colleges to a maritime academy and major in power engineering technology which prepares students for power plants, mills, and the such. This course also requires you to acquire 2 summer internships after you sophomore and junior year in order to graduate and acquire a 3rd class stationary engineer license. I understood I'd be there anouther 4 years when I transferred but I wasnt aware of the amount of bullshit I'd have to put up with. It wasnt all bad but I diddnt enjoy any of my classes in the slightest and at this point I'm ready to either drop out and join the military, get a welding cert, or simply just drop out and live in my car. I'm currently over 30k in debt and am looking at anouther 15k or so before I graduate. On top of that I wasn't able to secure an internship last summer due to the coronavirus and no connections through family to internships. I'm miserable and the though of school makes me so frustrated, it's not necessarily that difficult (it is more just wading through a shit river at the pace of a snail on ice). I pretty much have to finish up these last 15-16 months or I've wasted all this time and money learning nothing. I'm sick of the education system and the pressure that is put on high school students to get a higher level education. My advice, trade school or take some gap years and figure shit out before you commit your life to 4 years of misery."
ktewmi,1,2021-01-08,I don’t know what job I want,Rissyroo6,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ktewmi/i_dont_know_what_job_i_want/,"I’m sure this is a pretty common question on this subreddit, but it’s just gotten to the point where I don’t know what I want out of my life.

I’m about to turn 21 and I’m at the same job I was when I turned 16...a dog kennel/animal hospital. I love animals, and I used to want to be a vet tech but now I have no interest in the medical aspect of the field. 

I feel trapped. I’m underpaid, only get raises when I practically beg my employer, employees that I’ve worked with for years don’t remember me, one literally tried to lock me out of my job today because she “forgot I worked here”, and overall I find the job tedious. I don’t hate every aspect of the job, but it’s gotten to the point where I dread going to work. If my shift doesn’t start in the morning, I spend all day thinking about how I don’t want to go to work.

I’m also a junior in college but I feel like that isn’t going anywhere either. I used to be a zoo science major, but changed my major to history last year. While I feel like I have much more of a passion for history, I don’t know what I’m going to do with it. I would hate being a teacher, but I know museum work likely requires a masters degree and a BUNCH of writing papers, which have been tedious to me in all my history classes so far. 

I feel like I need something that’s creative, that’s fun, but I have little to no artistic skills. I used to be good at playing cello, but eventually I stopped caring about that too. I know I need to push myself in order to find a new job, and that I need to intern, but it’s hard to push myself because I’m so scared of failure. I’m really bad at getting out of my comfort zone, and I just don’t know how to push myself. Not to mention I don’t have any hobbies and while I have an idea what might interest me, I don’t know how that would translate into the real world because, well, I need money.

What should I do/ how should I push myself?"

ktfe85,954,2021-01-08,I am just a freshman but so over this clout chasing. A short rant,happipenguinn,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ktfe85/i_am_just_a_freshman_but_so_over_this_clout/,"Instead of HYPSM during college apps, now it’s FANG or FAANG or whatever it is for internships, and I’m just so over this clout chase 🙄

During high school I tried so. Hard. For a top college bc everyone acted like the end goal to everything. I thought that being a top school student would be my happy moment. To feel validated for my hard work and feeling smart. And now sure, I’m at a top college. It’s still hard. I’m still not happy. I still don’t feel smart or successful— tbh, I’ve never felt dumber. Not to say I don’t feel grateful and lucky to be at my college, but it was really not what it’s cracked up to be.

And now I’m stressing out over winter break, trying to push through leetcode, finish side projects done, trying to keep up at my internship. All so when I graduate, I can achieve the “dream” of going to work at a FANG.

I just spent fifteen minutes taking a good hard look at my life priorities and it honestly makes me want to laugh how dumb my self imposed pressure to go after these weird acronyms is. 

Is my goal really to live in a tiny apartment in California with a 3k/month rent to go work at a not-so-ethical mega company to devote my energy towards developing a tiny tiny not that impactful part of their code base. Just so I can have “software engineer @ {FANG}” on my LinkedIn headline and hypothetically feel successful and happy, but I’m betting it’ll not be what it’s cracked up to be either. 

I know that this is all self imposed pressure, I don’t need to be trying this hard, I just need to chill out. But that’s much easier said than done. 

Realistically, I would be at the same level of happy living in a mid-sized city, making 80k as a software engineer in a no name company with a good work environment, reasonable work life balance, and friends and family. That’s the reality and I’m trying to convince myself it’s true but that’s not too easy. 

Sorry for the long rant, rant over"

Long term goal aside, what can I do to have things to brag about on my resume in hopes of landing a backend role?

Some things I have in mind that I haven’t done yet:

* containerizing in docker
* use an SQL database instead of mongo so I can design a schema 
* integrate external (third party..?) APIs for external data (eg list of all cities in US)
* implement testing when “finished”

The primary goal right now is to get hired ASAP as I despise my current job. I see agile mentioned in job postings a lot but I don’t think that’s something one does alone. Any thoughts?"

When I first started, people only had good things to say about me. Hard working, motivated, ""self-starter"", and ""great attitude"", are things my manager would describe me as. 

Transitioning from an internship to a more independent role, I'm feeling very lost. I did very well with close guidance and task-based assignments. Through restructuring, a change in manager, a change in team, and the whole ""work from home"" this year, I feel like I'm not doing as well as I should be.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Or, if anyone has tips?

I mostly feel like I am struggling with:

* Communication: How much is too much/not enough?
* Organization: I feel like I'm all over the place.
* Attention to detail: I find myself making stupid mistakes.
* Meetings: Most info goes in one ear and out the other. My note taking abilities aren't great either.
* Overwhelming Projects: I struggle to get ""big"" projects done from start to finish.

I would love advice, books to read, etc. I really feel like I'm struggling and I want to do a good job at work. My poor performance lately is making my mental health worse, which makes my performance worse. Like a big loop.

TLDR: I am struggling at work after moving from an internship position (task work) to full-time position (open-ended projects)"

So I wasn't really expecting an interview from amazon for the SDE summer internship. I did the OA's mostly for practice and to get an idea of what it looked like so that eventually in the future I could put in the time and prepare for it .

Anyways, now I have an interview in about 3 weeks, but I have barely done any ""leetcode grinding"". I have done some in the past but not religiously maybe about \~30 and I have gone through CTCI about a year or two ago.

I remember my data structures and what not but I am out of practice. I keep reading here how most people prepare and grind leetcode for months, but I was wondering if anyone has successfully gotten an offer with 3 weeks or less of grinding. If so, what was your plan to prepare for it on such short period.

ktlx0b,3,2021-01-09,Junior in HS - Proper Stats - Poor ECs - Really need that full ride scholar :(,ngwmeooooo,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/ktlx0b/junior_in_hs_proper_stats_poor_ecs_really_need/,"Hi, I think the title speaks well of my circumstance right now!

I transfered to U.S. High school after attending 9th grade in Vietnam, and decided not to study 9th grade again (my hs starts from 9th grade). Since I came straight in 10th grade, I didn’t really have any proper knowledge of doing ECs (I do now :( ). 

My teacher said I can aim for $20,000 with my scores now but I’m like REALLY?? (Ngl I don’t believe her). I might as well being obsessed with these glamorous stats, but I don’t know. Do I even have a chance to attend college or at least get some kind of scholar? The only thing I worry about is my ECs :( 


ECs:
I’m not an athelete or competitive students, did not win national state prizes or do internships with professor - literally I did zero ECs for my last 2 years. Except for ~40 hours of volunteer, tutor my nieces at least 2 hours a day (yesh no one pay me), 3 months of XC (I didn’t even run cuz I joined too late), a couple of hours doing teacher aide for English classes and helped write ~4ish paper for Yearbook (with no credits at all, voluntarily). I persuaded my school to open a Newspaper club but didn’t work (the only club we has is probably the Anime Club, Student Council and Prom Council, that’s all) 

Stats:
ACT: 22 Composite (Only Science is under 20 but I’m aiming for 30+ before the Early Decision) 
GPA: 4.0 Unweighted 
AP/ Honor: 2 of them (I’ll be taking APUSH, AP World, AP Literature n probably AP Psych in my Senior year) 
IELTS: 6.5 (Taken in 2018, I’m not sure where I’m at right now but definitely improved) 

I’m interesting in the Weslyan Freeman Scholarship (I’m from Southeast Asian), but after watching people having National awards etc., I just feel stupid in 100 ways."
ktmaku,1,2021-01-09,Do I have a shot at getting into a decent graduate school program for data science?,storyofmylyfe,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ktmaku/do_i_have_a_shot_at_getting_into_a_decent/," Hey guys, this may be long but I want to paint as complete of a picture as I can of why I'm considering grad school. I'm a May 2020 Graduate, looking for a fresh page in terms of career and life direction in general. I studied Electrical Engineering for four years during my undergrad and managed to graduate bottom of my class from a top-five ECE program. I failed to land any internship experience in my concentration, signal processing, and never got my foot in the door with the electronics industry in general. I ended up stumbling upon an internship in the Electric Utility industry the summer of my Junior year through hail mary handshake applications.

After graduating in May 2020, I launched a start-up with three of my friends from college through a startup accelerator at our university. Although the startup never impacted its intended market, I did gain technical skills while contributing to product development as an amateur data scientist. I could type a lot about the details of my experience but the short story is that I tried to create a machine learning algorithm that can label sleep stages using wrist accelerometers as the biometric sensor after gaining inspiration from learning about natural language processing technology in school.

I concluded three months of work with this start-up in August, passed the F.E. Exam for electrical and computer engineering, and have been applying to jobs in the Electric Utility industry ever since. Over four months later, I am still without a job. I know that hasn't been a lot of time trying, but it's been long enough for me to consider pivoting.

I learned from a very young age that it is obvious a person can never succeed at something they're not passionate about, and this lesson has only been reinforced harder for me over time. I chose electrical engineering as my major in 2016 because I had a penchant for math and physics in high school. In College, the classes I continued to enjoy the most were mathematics, ranging from vector calculus to engineering statistics, linear algebra, and differential equations. My success in these courses led me to pursue electrical engineering concentrations such as communication systems and control systems. Other topics, such as semiconductors, which are deeply rooted in quantum mechanics, were experiences I'm never planning on looking back on.

After all is said and done, I was a B average, 2.99 GPA (YES ON THE DOT!) student who studied on average 50 hours per week. Given my natural ability to critically understand my curriculum, which I gained a better sense of overtime, combined with the quantitative results of my performance as a student, I probably needed to spend closer to 60-70 hours per week. I was not ""good for the exam"" and able to relax. I needed to take that extra practice test. I needed to review that homework set one more time. I needed to go into that last review session and attend that last office hour. But I didn't and will not pretend I deserve sympathy for the wrong choices I made. I succumbed to pleasure. Consequences followed.

My 2.99 GPA, and current state of unemployment is a constant reminder of every time I chose to sin and not study or apply myself via meaningful extracurriculars. I regret not connecting and networking with my peers and professors more. I used professors and classmates as an educational tool and nothing more. I never pursued research.

I know how to present myself in interviews and create a much more confident and assured presentation of my accomplishments and degree, but my inner soul is screaming that I don't want to devote my life to electrical hardware. I'm much more interested in data science, and would rather see my education as far as possible with this field than jump into a 9-5 as a corporate slave for electric utility. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would've majored in CS and Stats.

Soooooooooo. My question for you guys is do I even have a shot at getting into a decent program for data science given how badly I messed up my undergrad GPA? My advisor in college painted a pretty grim picture for me after being on academic probation one semester. I'd like to talk best case scenario. I study hard and get a 330-340 on the GRE general test. I get two letters of recommendation from the colleagues of my summer 2020 start-up and maybe one from my 2019 internship, write a stunning cover letter, annnddddddddd plop on a 2.99 undergrad GPA. My academic momentum feels like it has definitely plateaued, but I am genuinely confident I can be successful taking master-level data science classes and lead a personally fulfilling career performing my societal function as a data scientist.

My intent for going would be to obtain a more advanced degree that gives me specific credentials to lead a career as a data scientist; my undergrad curriculum exposed me to python, scikit, DSP, etc. however my professional background as it stands is hardware. Given I can prove my academic competence with an out of this world GRE score, would it be any more than a wish for a student with my record to get into a program such as USC (Southern California). I'm using this school as an example of a school I got accepted into as an undergrad but am sitting here post-grad doubting my worth. I am almost certain I would not be accepted into the master program at my alma mater. I'm confident if I see the job search process through, I can land a start as a power systems engineer eventually, but if I choose this route it will be my career for a very long time. So be honest with me guys, should I bother taking grad school into consideration right now? I want to, I have my parent's financial support, I've talked it through with close friends, and I'm screaming out to the internet for one last external validation and sanity check.

**TL:DR**

B.S. Electrical Engineering 2.99 GPA. Limited internship/start up experience. Zero research experience. Failed to network with professors and TAs outside of the classroom. What are my shots at getting into a decent grad program for data science, USC (Southern California) per say."
ktmmaa,1,2021-01-09,Should I quit my job?,Keppclam,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ktmmaa/should_i_quit_my_job/,"Hey y’all, if you’re looking for a long story, take a seat and grab some popcorn cuz I’ve got a juicy one for y’all today. Note- This a 3 month’s worth of anger, frustration, and confusion dump, so I apologize if there’s some over analyzed, long, tedious thoughts in here. I just needed to vent, and this has all been kept within me until now. 

I’ve come to Reddit with a defeating question that has been plaguing me for the past couple of weeks, with hope that someone may be able to help me clarify the muddy thoughts that I can’t clear due to my ordeal. 
 
To go more into detail, I work as a medical assistant at a pediatric clinic which is 99% run by older women (I am a 21 year old F, and the youngest in the office). 
I was hired 3 months ago and I am already at the end of my rope. At first, things were good. I was really enjoying getting to learn more about the job and working with patients. Things started to take a turn when the girl that was training me, who I thought was my supervisor, (let's call her Janie) turned out to not be the actual supervisor. Apparently my actual supervisor had been quarantined due to testing positive for Covid. After about two weeks my supervisor came back, which when we formally met. This is when things really started to go South. 

I got along really well with my supervisor, but started to notice that just Janie and two other girls, Gina and Rachel, were disgruntled that my supervisor had returned. I think it’s important to note, they are all over the age of 30 and have kids and families and such. 
I also noticed that these three had their own clique and made it extra clear to me I was not, nor would I ever be, a part of it. Which is fine by me, but it does make my job harder in the sense that they will cover for each other but the minute I make a mistake it’s 3 against 1. Over the course of working there, I have consistently heard them whine, complain, and gossip about my supervisor, or any responsibilities they have (which they also seem to enjoy taking on more than enough to gloat and brag about how much they do for the office). They always complain that my supervisor is not doing enough (which I think is bs bc her job is different than ours. They expect her to do MA duties when her job demands different responsibilities. She’s also pregnant and MA duties are very demanding, but again, that’s not her position anyways).
Janie also seems to feel she is the supervisor and constantly goes over my actual supervisors head. Just recently, Janie created a log where she wanted all of us to document COVID tests that were being used in house by employees, simply because her, Gina, and Rachel had been accused of “stealing tests” (Janie’s words). But I know she made it as a petty move to stick it to upper management. I also remember when I first started, clearly hearing them joke around about how they wanted to get COVID so they could have a “2 week vacation”. I recall them saying things like, “if this patient is positive with COVID, I hope they cough on me”. 
Which, I get they’re joking, but to me that seemed so insensitive and unprofessional. 

They gossip about everything and everyone, including me. There was an instance I was eating some ramen and cheetos in the break room, which I know is ridiculous and odd, but I was just having one of those weird cravings that day, when Janie walked in and gave my a strange look and asked what I was eating. I was mortified and embarrassed that it had to be her that walked in, but I explained my strange combination to her and told her it was just a weird craving I had. 
She said, “Hmm. I see” and left the room with a blank expression. My stomach dropped because I somehow knew that it would be the next topic of conversation amongst themselves. I dropped it, and didn’t bother to entertain the thought of it and went on with my day. 

At that time there was a student MA, let's call her Russy, who was almost done with her internship there. She was actually super friendly, and I noticed her efforts to get along with everyone equally. There were a few instances I caught Janie, Gina, and Rachel saying some nasty stuff about Russy which just pissed me off and embarrassed. They would even intentionally make her clean all the rooms rather than letting her help out with things that would’ve benefited her education. I mean, can someone explain to me how these GROWN 30+ year old women can still be acting this way? I do not get it. 

Anyways, the day before she left, she told me to be careful because Janie had done as I’d predicted, and talked down about my odd lunch, labeling me as disgusting in the process. That was hurtful to hear because no one likes to hear that about themselves, but I thanked Russy, and the next day (her last) I was the only one who brought her a parting away gift. No one else seemed to care about how hard she worked her ass off without pay or an ounce of appreciation. 

A couple of weeks later (right before the holidays), I caught COVID, and tested positive on site. They made me go home immediately. At the time my two brothers were staying with me, so I tried getting them tested at an urgent care, but they were too busy that day, so I  asked my work if I could get them tested there (since I had seen various employees bring their family members to get tested as well). They said it was okay, so I wore as much protective gear as I could (N-95, and an extra mask) when driving my brothers by. Rachel came out to test them and walked right by us, without even looking out way. She went into the outside shed we have for car visits, and was in there for a while. I figured she was gathering her supplies but she was in there a lot longer than what it takes to do that. I just brushed it off and kept waiting, until she slammed the shed door open and started walking towards my car. She didn’t greet us, she just asked my brother upfront to pull his head back and swabbed him. She starts heading towards the back, where my other brother is, and ignores me as I’m trying to explain to her that my my rear passenger side window is broken, and doesn’t go down. She didn’t give me a chance to get a word in when she just started tugging my back door handle really harshly. My car was locked, so I went ahead and unlocked it and she swabbed my other brother. She slammed my door and headed inside. That was the end of that. My brother upfront even noticed that that was awful. 

I just was able to go back to work this week, but damn, it just made me realize how much I hate being there. Not one of them asked if I was okay or anything, which I expected but it still stung. They didn’t even retest me, they said I had to go to an urgent clinic if I wanted to check my results. Yet, they just received an ungodly amount of boxes, and I’ve seen them test amongst each other all week. 

So yeah.

What do y’all think I should do? Am I being too sensitive? I’m not sure. All I know is that I’m tired of coming home in a bad mood, and that there have been days I literally dread waking up. 

Thanks to anyone who read through all of this. 
I appreciate you."

I worked for them for around 7 months and was working at 50% stipend for the first few months because of the lockdown. They promised that those dues will be cleared later. Now they're denying to do so because they're saying they're shutting down.

The thing is, another intern, who left a few months before me and was working the same position, had his dues cleared. And now I'm being denied for the same thing. 

I understand that they're shutting down but they can't just deny paying me the salary I worked for and was promised. 

Whenever I asked them when I'll get the previous difference I was always assured I'll get it. And now all of a sudden they're denying to do so. 

I have my college fees to pay so this is causing me a lot of issues.

Do I have any options here? Can I file any complaints or take any legal action against them? I have my offer letters (the only documents I signed from them) that clearly state I will be paid this difference.

Edit: Just talked to them over call. They're saying they'll try to pay back the difference by the end of January. (I recorded the call just in case). Hopefully I get it."

ktp0kd,58,2021-01-09,Need advice on what to do after CSE considering my academic qualification 12th- &gt;60 &amp; 2 year gap after 12th.,chhoturamdas,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/ktp0kd/need_advice_on_what_to_do_after_cse_considering/,"**EDIT- It is &lt;60 12th  in the title**

I'm a student from **private college**, currently doing **B-Tech** **CSE** **(3rd year)** will graduate in **2022**. Currently my institute is planning to conduct a coding test (probably around April-May 2021) and they are going to select only  crème de la crème student for sitting in the **product based companies (&gt;6LPA base)**. I have no problem with the test but I have some grave worries about campus placement as my 10th &amp; 12th are below average and I think I won't be placed in these companies or service based companies, so I am thinking of studying master abroad or in India through loan/scholarship but I'm not sure about it. Little bit about myself-

* **10th-77.00%** ICSE
* **12th-59.33%** State Board
* **CGPA-6.95** upto 4th sem (4 non-core backlog)
* I'm currently interested in **Finance, Economics, Geology, Electronics** and  **Physics**.
* I have not won any kind of competition in b-tech till now except one Business Analytics Quiz and  participated in an international competition which was more of an academic practicum and made significant contributions in a particular team project.
* I have **2 yr gap** in between my **b-tech** and **12th.**

Well known companies/ start-ups that comes to my college are **Microsoft, Amazon, Nutanix, Directi, IBM, Informatica, Rapyuta Robotics, Robert Bosch, Deloitte, Accenture, etc.**

I am  confident that **I will get &gt;=9.0 CGPA by the time I graduate(B-Tech). I like Computer Science   ( I don't like competitive programming)** but as my marks aren't exceptional, it is really hard or almost impossible to get into this companies(above paragraph) through college placement. I am currently thinking on preparing for **GMAT, GRE, CAT**(idk if any **IIMs** will accept me) and **GATE(for PSUs)**, also interested in **ISI** Kolkata **MSQE**. I don't know what to do right now nor do I have any future plan. I want a high paying job but I am pretty demotivated after seeing the the company internship cut offs. That's why I am thinking of pursuing a master degree, so I can get a good job in good company after two years as soon as I graduate. (Unless they eliminate me on the basis of 12th again)

&amp;#x200B;

 **I would like your opinions on my decision and if you have better ideas please do tell me. Additional question-**

1. Does &lt;60% in 12th will make it difficult for me getting accepted into UZH, NUS, UoT, grad program etc and  getting accepted into good institutes with scholarships? For example **MEXT scholarship** (Japan universities) where all the fees are taken care of and they pay a monthly stipend for rent. I don't want my parents to pay anything for the graduate program.
2. Is it possible to apply off campus with my marks in  any good companies with base at least 6-10 LPA?

**TLDR, Any opinions on what do after CSE considering my academic qualification. 10th-77 &amp; 12th-59. Also 2-yr gap after 12th.** Interested in **Finance, Economics, Geology, Electronics** and  **Physics**. A high paying job opportunities will be good.

ktqgem,5,2021-01-09,Not sure how to deal with some problems in life,kawin240,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/ktqgem/not_sure_how_to_deal_with_some_problems_in_life/,"Hey all,

not sure how to flair this and stuff, as this is my first post here. I (M/24, Central Europe, Atheist) guess I just want advice from others, as I'm not sure how to overcome stuff or make better decisions. There are several things, I'll just list them here:

Work/Career: I'm studying at University (2) in a higher semester, but I don't see how I can get a degree. I already failed a different degree, though I felt it was not a good university (1) (they failed in their organization a lot, which was why I changed) and therefore tried again.

I tried to apply for jobs and internships before, but always got rejected. I went to training sessions to make better CVs, but still no chances, not even at local bakeries. Now that my (relatively new) friends gave me a lot of tips that I haven't heard before, I gained some confidence again. But still, I have the problem that I don't know where to go: what are my strengths? Where can I be successful? I don't see any strengths in me and I really couldn't say what I want to be, I sometimes feel like I have no will. I just want to be able to finally live on my own and not share a room with my brother at my parents place

Love &amp; Relationship: I've never had a relationship before nor a woman tell me the 3 magical words. I admit, I'm not the most socializing person, but I look for a partner actively, try to talk to women, use dating platforms, but still no luck. I feel I missed out completely on young love (got bullied at all schools so was a loner for a long time) and will miss out more and more. I want the sensation to be in love with each other and not, like until now, to someone. I have the courage to ask for dates or confess my feelings, but got always rejected. Am I not enough? Am I gross? Just extremely unlucky? Strange, or rather surprising thing is, most of the women I fell in love with turned out to be homosexual. Am I somehow attracted to homosexual women? 

Also I'm having a really hard time to get over the girl of my dreams,which turned out to be asexual and of course, I got rejected again. We're still friends and if you ask my conscious self, everything is fine, but it feels like my body is acting against me. I still dream of her, have feelings for her. I never was as atrracted as this to someone before and it's just pain because I know that she doesn't want to engage relationships, and still my emotions don't seem to listen to me.

Health: I have to deal with a irritable bowel syndrome, which was under control for a while. But just yesterday showed me again that I always have to fight against and around it: I got stressed out by a busy week and all the problems with my stomache hit me again at once. Don't know if there's much else I can do against this, I feel powerless and tortured at times.

Lately, I also feel randomly so aroused, that I really can't concentrate at all and sometimes even lay down and can't do anything, even at digital meetings (I could hide it well and it never got that extreme when I had to attend, but it was really annoying). And with this arousal, I don't mean random erections, I really mean that I feel an urge to orgasm (or get to orgasm). I sometimes masturbate (like, maybe 2-3 times in a week, sometimes not at all), but it can't satisfy me anymore. I'm not sure where this is coming from, should I call my doctor? I'm not sure how to describe it to a doctor so they'll understand it

Pressure: I put pressure onto myself to achieve my life goals, stability, success and having my own family. But I'm also being pressured by my mother to have a wife and grandkids. Sometimes, I just can't take it

Worries: I am worrying about my mother. She comes from eastern europe and therefore has a deep distrust to state and authority. She is in various Facebook and Chat groups with other compatriots, and lately I noticed that her views and opinions are drifting more and more to the right. I fear losing her to the ill minded people that have corrupted her country, just because here, in her new home, politics started to restrict the people since we are affected by the Virus and instead of seing it as being protected she starts to believe that she is stripped of her rights (even after the pandemic ends)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm without will or power, overloaded with emotions, overwhelmed by the challenges of life, as if I live in a world that rejects me. If I'm being honest, I imagined ending myself and already planned out how to do it, when, where, how, and wrote my last will, but I decided against it. I think, maybe I can overcome this somehow and if I throw my life away I'll be missing out on better days, though I'm not sure if I'm able to withstand this long enough."

I'm just coming off of finishing my 3 year advanced diploma in Mechanical Engineering Technology and have found myself not feeling fulfilled within that field of work so as of Monday I will be starting computer programming and analysis at Seneca college in Toronto with the goal of getting my degree in software development by the end. I've always found myself drawn into the field of computer science and ever since I was a kid (21 years old now) I have always had a very very deep interest in software and computer programming. Unfortunately for me,  I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career fully when I graduated high-school in 2017 and always found myself in the machine shop so I thought I'd enroll in mechanical, but I've always told myself its never to late to start what you really want to do.

I am very proud to have finished my degree in mechanical but I have always felt as if something was missing. I got a chance to skim the surface in programming while taking mechanical with courses like PLC programming and an intro to mechatronics (we basically just programmed and wrote code for Arduino's for the semester) but I'm happy to say that I have made the decision to change career paths into computer programming and hope to land a solid internship/co-op position in my fourth semester.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read my post if you've gotten this far and I encourage anyone who has a dream of working in a specific career path, but is on the fence about it, to take the leap. I am very excited to start this new chapter and I wanted to say good-luck to anyone starting school on Monday  and to anyone starting their internships/ co-ops!"

During my second and third year I struggled to find internships because we weren't taught any of these and had to opt for more software/IT jobs. And now I'm looking back at my degree and experiences with a bit of resentment because I feel as if our school didn't prepare us for the job market early on. I don't know if universities are to blame fully and maybe it's also companies expecting more. But I feel as the money I paid to set me up for a career in electrical engineering wasn't worth it because now I'm going down a software path."

I took a couple of CS classes before I finished my first degree, and have been programming on and off since. My previous job was completely unrelated to CS, although I did make a program that is still in use by a couple of people in that office (although most people don't use it unfortunately).

I am looking into applying for summer internships, but I can't stop thinking ""Why would anyone hire me over someone with better grades and/or more experience?"". For reference, when I graduated with my biochem degree, my GPA was 3.02, although my last semester's GPA (my first one in computer science) was 3.77 for four courses.

Between the fact that I am kind of late applying for internships, my cumulative GPA is pretty bad, I have limited CS experience and being stuck indoors for the last god knows how many months, my motivation is awful and I feel like the possibility of being hired for this summer is abysmally low.

I am trying to apply for an internship in my city, but I am struggling to stay focussed because whenever I try I get a bunch of anxiety and doubt. Which is ridiculous because I am guaranteed to not get hired if I don't even apply.

My intention is probably to study a master's degree in Data Science or something related, but since I still want to figure out what I like, if that's my correct path, where to study, what specific degree, etc. I would first like to take a ""break"" from studying, get a job, gain some experience, and have some time to think about my future plans with my studies.

But obviously, having only a Bachelor's limits my possibilities, specially with how competitive the market is, and because it's obviously not the same being a Data Scientist, with the master's degree and all, as only having a Bachelor in Maths. However, I do have some ""real life experience"" that might give me some opportunities: I'm working as an intern right now as I finish my bachelor's, in a multinational consultancy, doing some machine learning and neural networks in Python. I also know a decent level of C++, R and Matlab. But still, I don't know if my knowledge is sufficient to get a job. And I obviously have all the math background (statistics, probability, calculus, algebra...) needed for Data Science 

And regarding countries, I'm thinking of going to Germany mainly because of good salaries to COL ratio, and I see more opportunities than in Spain (or most other countries tbh), low unemployment, and I also have a somewhat decent level of German. Like, not enough to actually get a job where I *must* know German (I feel way more comfortable in English), but I see moving to Germany as a good opportunity to improve my German. But tbf I wouldn't mind anywhere else (NL, UK, Ireland...) if I get a good offer. 

So... Is it realistic, or should I just go directly for the master's and get a job afterwards?"

I had a mental breakdown and didnt realized I had ended up stopping all of my meds shortly after they stopped going into school, which made it even worse. It wasn't intentional, just I kept thinking that I already took them when i didn't. 

My fiance noticed this and asked what I wanted to do. If I wanted him to quit one job (which I'd never ask because we need the money. If he decided he wanted to quit, I'd be fine with that because it is ultimately his decision). Or if I wanted to hire someone to come in and help me (which, he knows we can't afford but asked because he knows how important going back to school is for me). Or if I wanted to step back from school and my internship, which, to me, was the smartest choice. 

I was already starting to fall behind and failing one class. So I got ahold of my counselor and talked it out with her. She agreed that my mental health needs to come first. 

The kids go back to a hybrid program on the 19th where my son is back to 5 days and my girls go 3 days. I start school again on the 25th. I've gotten back on my meds and finally got anxiety meds that work! 

I'm just nervous about starting again. All 5 of my classes are online again. Does anyone have any kind of schedule or anything at all that can help keep my stress to a minimum while also being able to take care of everything??"

And was trying to figure out if I know enough knowledge to get a real job. I think I know enough to land a job (internship) but don't know if that's the case.

Here's what I know:

Some data structures like linked lists, trees (only binary search tree), stack, queues etc.

Python - Intermediate to Advanced

C - Intermediate

Java - Beginner to Intermediate

Web (HTML/CSS) and Javascript - Beginner

C++ - Intermediate

Mysql and sqlite - Beginner

Linux - Intermediate

Has also completed CS50 (almost, left that at last assignment)

The biggest problem why I am not trying to apply for a job is that I don't have strong resume. Are there any workarounds(like applying without resume)? If not, what could I do to have a strong resume?

What else should I learn? currently I am learning data structures then I am going to focus on meta programming in Python and maybe after all that AI/ML.

ku4b56,20,2021-01-09,I completely messed up and now I'm a complete fraud programmer and don't know what to do anymore. (Long read..),clock11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ku4b56/i_completely_messed_up_and_now_im_a_complete/,"Not sure where to begin but in short, I am a total programming fraud. CS/programming was never a real passion for me. I actually hated programming because it never made any sense to me especially during my early University days.

I completed my first degree in Chemical Engineering (graduated in 2017). I had some O&amp;G internships and that’s the path I was heading towards, but the Oil downturn screwed me out of luck. I did not find any job and lost my motivation to keep searching for one. My friends with similar backgrounds jumped into their 2nd degree in Computer Science. They asked me to join them but at that time I had no intentions to. After a year with still no luck in finding an O&amp;G job, I succumbed and started my CS journey with the sole purpose to become a student and try to find an internship in an O&amp;G firm and somehow convince them to hire me internally as I have an engineering degree and then I would abandon CS once FT job was secured.

I started CS schooling completely half-ass everything and had my friend carry me throughout all courses. From my years of completing my first engineering degree, I was savvy enough to know what was required to get through these courses. I did not have any clue how to code at all. My assignments/tutorials were done by people I knew and for the exams, I just got by memorizing theory and some code.

After a year of CS, I applied exclusively to O&amp;G internships and got hired by a huge O&amp;G firm as a CS intern. I gambled everything on this move. From May 2019, I started my O&amp;G internship in the infrastructure team which required no coding, but the job was completely stupid (like update PCs to windows 10 and install McAfee…wtf?). 8 months in my term, I convinced my terrible shitty controlling manager (sorry he tormented me for 8 straight months) to shift me to the O&amp;G engineering team for 4 months of my remaining term. These last 4 months, I made it my mission to impress my new team and get that FT job. I worked hard and tried making good impressions, I asked my new manager about FT positions and he said to send me my resume and things looked good. Then March 2020 happened, and oil tanked to -$40/barrel and the CEO sent out hiring freezes and layoffs notices. I was not given the job and returned back home after gambling everything to get that O&amp;G job.

After some summer reflections, I decided that the O&amp;G pipe dream (no pun intended) is over for good. I saw the opportunities of working as a developer, the desirables work locations, work from opportunities, and salaries so I convinced myself this is the path I will take. In the summer, I planned to graduate by April 2021 and in the meanwhile gain developer experience and get an FT job in the government as they are looking to hire.

I applied during June 2020 and got an internship working for the Government as a Java developer starting Sept 2020 even though I can barely program in JAVA. I got through the interview by getting questions from my friends and memorizing common Java concepts (OOP, Abstract vs Interface, etc). I got an 8-month contract from them.

Now I am 5 months into my internship and simultaneously doing 3 courses this semester (did 3 last semester) to complete my CS degree. I realized I am taking a huge workload by doing school and work both full times because everything is work from home and online classes (which I’m not even allowed to but I’m risking it all to save time as I’m getting old and it depresses me how far behind in life I am), so I find myself in a situation where I have no idea how to code or understand it. My school takes so much of my time and I barely manage classes, work, assignments, exams, etc. During my internship, my biggest fear was getting exposed which I did a couple of times but I somehow managed to present myself in such a way where they think I know what I’m doing. For the programming work user stories assigned to me, I happened to make friends with a very senior developer who is kind enough to sit with me and complete my user story and none of the managers nor other developers know it. They all think I’m completing the work myself. It's ridiculous what’s happening, for school my friends helped all the way and now at work, some old developer is kind of enough to take on my work and do it for me while trying to help me understand it. I feel terrible as he has so much on his plate and he’s also new to the team but he feels emphatic to my situation as a newbie as well, so he wants to mentor me which I greatly appreciate (probably should get him a gift)

Like from all my CS schooling years, I know enough to talk my way in a conversation with the technical developer leads to not get exposed. But I have no clue how to even code shit. Sometimes when I share my screen and they ask me to show code and add code, I’ll be trembling in fear and have borderline anxiety attacks. Like I do not even know how to implement the “new” operator in Java. I see the massive amount of code and all the files it's linked to and I get overwhelmed. I have no idea how to debug code, write code from scratch, how the MVC stuff works related to work, function calls, wtf is really a stack or heap, dynamic memory, or any of that crap. I cannot even do a simple if statement or for loop without running into a million errors. I’m completely clueless and it's only a matter of time when I get exposed at work. I’m about to turn 28 this year and I haven’t had a full-time job ever, only internships and this is my only chance to graduate and try to get in as an FT employee at the government, but I am about to completely blow this up. Fuck I’m so stupid with my approach to life, sorry I realized this whole thing was just a rant."

I am currently a CS freshman and applying for my very first summer internship. I've just done a *web-based* to-do list on my own as personal project, half following a tutorial and adding my own touch and making sure that I can explain every line of code.

But I've noticed that most of the to-do lists on tutorials are quite bland. They all have very modern designs, yet my interest in ancient history incites me to create a parchment-style to-do list, inspired by ideas from: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14585101/old-paper-background-texture-with-just-css](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14585101/old-paper-background-texture-with-just-css).

Now, I am very tempted to incorporate an ancient theme by incorporating someone else's code (on the website) with my own. I believe it would be far more interesting than some Google-Docs-style to-do list that can be found online. But I am wondering whether I would be penalized by an employer because I used another person's code *extensively*, although the difficulty of incorporating another's code into mine should present significant challenge to discuss during the interview.

So the basic dilemma is this: should I attempt a modern style for my to-do list (which is entirely within my abilities, more or less) or should I attempt a parchment style for my to-do list, as indicated on the website, and try to *extensively* use another's code and integrate it with mine? Please keep in mind that my ultimate goal is an internship in web development.

I was simply looking to get out of my current company because of how I (and most of the employees) was treated, I worked my ass off during the first half and really carried the company to keep all of the brands afloat and nobody had to be laid off, despite a 30% cut in my salary since February '20.

Even when things started to get back on track during phase 2 and then phase 3, our salaries have yet to be reinstated til now but they've decided to reinvest the earnings into another new business venture. I'd say the experience is unforgettable but whether or not it was worth the insane amount of stress that took a toll on my physical and mental health, that is something I will have to talk to a therapist about.

But I realised I was so sick of working at a job that served almost zero purpose other than to help fill the pockets of my stingy bosses. Granted that we had a really positive working relationship, one of them simply did not understand where their boundaries were (I'm talking constantly forgetting that it's a weekend and texting me to get some work done that someone else could do, it's not something that only I could do) and was simply over reliant on me because during the ""good old days"" I was efficient as heck.

Anyway, I could talk all day and write a book on my 2 years of experience (yes it has only been 2 years but honestly I covered so many tasks that my role was more of a Biz Dev Exec role and not so much a Marketing Exec) having to tank a 3 person job (because 2 people left in 2019 and they never bothered to rehire), but I doubt you guys are interested.

I just wanted to share with this community that I finally got a job offer with a job that met almost all of my expectations!!

\- I can break into tech with this (it's a Software Developer internship role)

\- It's for a good purpose (the platform I'll be building, helps the less fortunate on a global scale)

\- I'll still get to interact with people (I'll have to meet sponsors in the future to share about the platform)

\- The salary is huge leap from my current (it's only an internship position but I'm getting paid the market rate which is at least 20% more than my current where I'm severely underpaid)

The funny thing about this is that I applied for the job by accident, as I was meant to apply for a Full Stack Front End Developer role but it was really late and I didn't read the title carefully. I was very surprised to hear back from the founder herself and I thought to myself ""screw it, might as well attend the interview and see how it goes, I can always reject her offer if it even gets to that point"".

The interview went so well, as I was really interested in the company's vision for the platform/project, as I have always wanted to work a job that contributed in a meaningful way. I didn't hear from her for about 1.5 weeks (as the first interview happened right before Christmas), and then I was scheduled in for a second and final interview, but not before attending a crash course on React.

I didn't like the resource she provided me with (LinkedIn Learning) because I'm by no means a strictly visual/aural learner, my attention span is hella short (couldn't focus on a video for more than 5 minutes), so I took to React's site to go through a tutorial instead and created a simple Tic Tac Toe game. Damn, she was so happy with what I did and offered me the position, and I asked for some time to think about it.

I accepted the offer the very next day and I'm going to sign the contract tomorrow before I tender, with almost immediate effect as I accumulated exactly 20 days of Annual Leave and Days Off In Lieu from 2020.

I'm sorry for such a long post and I could have written longer if I didn't stop myself, but this is such a win that I needed to share with fellow Redditors going through the same thing I was! 2020 was horrible to say the least and there were times I had irrational thoughts because of how miserable I was at my company but I'm so glad I pushed through it and I can finally see the light at the end of this damn tunnel.

**Now for the technical/boring stuff:**

\- If you're Singapore and you're a mid-career switcher like me, you can do what I did and head on to the portal where IMDA lists jobs available for mid-career switchers (also available for freshers)

\- If you don't want to wait like I did, you can apply for government approved courses (they're heavily subsidised, 70% for anyone aged under 40 and 90% for those aged above 40) and they have a program where after you've completed the course, they'll link you up with companies looking to hire (as the salary is also subsidised)

\- If you're willing to wait it out, you can go through the route I took which was to be hired before you attend the training (everything is paid for by the employer and subsided heavily by the government) and you receive a training allowance each month

\- If you're happy to stay in your company but you're just not happy with the job itself, you can write to management to apply for a mid-career switch as well, and the government will be happy to subsidise the training (only applicable to SMEs)

\- One of the reasons why I got the offer was because I have a small background in programming (I have a diploma in business applications) and although my skills are very rusty I still understood the very fundamentals of programming so that helped heaps

Anyway if you've actually read through this entire post, thank you! If you're from where I am, feel free to ask me any questions related to the process and I'll be glad to help in any way I can."
kuayv3,1,2021-01-10,"Should I take out more loans to begin a degree sooner, or wait and pay more out of pocket?",Mencoh-P,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kuayv3/should_i_take_out_more_loans_to_begin_a_degree/,"Questions like mine are probably severely redundant and cliche, but I appreciate bearing with me.

**Me:** American, male, 29.

**The Main Idea**: Do I begin the Oregon State University online computer science post-baccalaureate in September with loans, or do I wait and save to pay more out of pocket?

**Why At All:** I have worked mostly in journalism and education during my twenties and, while rewarding, want to transition into a more results-based career versus one that often hinges on power of personality. While I understand that any job relies heavily on people skills, I've self-studied for about six months through the Open Source Society University curriculum and find that I enjoy the work. I'm also tired of the liberal arts (not knocking it, but what makes me content is changing with age).

COVID, also, made me reevaluate my priorities as I faced some job uncertainty with a lack of specialized knowledge/skillset. A computer science foundation could still lead to teaching or computer-assisted reporting if I chose to do so later in life.

**Current Situation:** Teaching English abroad with $2,000 after rent/bills each month; at least $1,300 typically goes to debt/savings/investments. I am not familiar with CS internships, but I'd estimate a $20 hourly salary with not as much money leftover monthly from living expenses once I return to the US.

I did have several travel plans that incorporated teaching in other countries, but I think I've already decided to sacrifice time in lower-paying countries so that I can fund a new degree easier. This was probably the most difficult decision I've made for now.

**End Goal:** Daily workflow change, more financial stability if I start a family, ability to travel again later or work remote freelance if I desired. Would pursue FAANG if I saw an opportunity, but I don't innately desire it.

**The Details**: I will be $24,724 in debt from my first bachelor's (English) by April after I finish paying off my highest loan group at 6.8% unsubsidized and some credit card debt that accrued during quarantine with employment instability. This consists of three other subsidized loan groups in which $2611.80 interest has accrued since late 2015, though there were interspersed deferment periods and interest could accrue faster onward.

**Option A:** Begin in September this year. Self-studying currently with OSSU until then. Continue teaching abroad, return to the US when I can obtain a full-time internship or job.

* First 48 credits: $11,000 subsidized loans at 4.53%; $14,000 unsubsidized at 6.08%.
* Final 12 credits and miscellaneous overall costs: I believe I can cover these out of pocket regardless.
* Estimated monthly loan payment: $492.50 both degrees combined.
* Total debt: $49,724
* **The Appeal:** With full loans the first two years, I'd be free to save/invest/pay down debt out of my normal paychecks and focus purely on earning good grades without as much financial neurosis. I'd save time and start making progress in a new career.
* **The Cons:** Money.

**Option B:** Begin the OSU online program when I can pay the first $12,500 (student loan yearly limit) out of pocket, whenever that is. Self-study and try to develop projects until then.

* 24 credits: $5,500 subsidized loans at 4.53%; $7,000 unsubsidized at 6.08%.
* Final 36 credits would be self-paid, which is immensely steep out of pocket. Or I could do some combination thereof and maybe only take an extra $5,500 in subsidized loans one year.
* Estimated monthly loan payments: $367.43, or \~$60 higher monthly if I took extra subsidized loans.
* Total debt: $37,224 or $42,724.
* **The Appeal:** Less money owed, which would factor as more beneficial once you evaluated total interest paid. I would have more time to evaluate if this is something I'll truly commit to, with more self-study and actual completed projects. More time spent traveling abroad, but with COVID ongoing... traveling is mostly just sitting in rooms alone, which I could do in the US. 
* **The Cons:** Probably much more time (a few years) with day-to-day work stagnation and plans to ""do that new degree eventually"".

**Possible Alternatives:**

* Don't do a degree at all (viable, but rough and a lot of stumbling around in the dark). OSU also offers internship aid if I'm not mistaken.
* Move back to the US prematurely and try to do some classes through community college. I haven't done the math, but my salary is much better abroad and I don't think that would be offset in tuition saved.

I am new to this forum and please let me know if I did something wrong!

I am an international master's student, and due to the covid I spent my first semester in my country.

So, it is not possible to do an internship this summer.

1. Taking a semester off and restarting the school. (in this case, I can do an internship 2022 summer.) --&gt; The school said I need a valid reason and have to prove it. 

2. Without doing an internship, just get a job after graduating.

Finally, I wonder that an internship is a really needed to get a job offer in CS. 

Thanks for any advice."

The pandemic hit and they cut down the IBL program since many companies pulled out. I didn’t get it. Now my plan is derailed since I have to stay for 1 more year at Uni, doing a project (substitution for IBL) before I can officially graduate. It’s really hard for international student to score internship (beside IBL) since companies require citizenship. I have some side projects (I’m currently working on a crawler on Python), and my GPA is not too terrible (around 3.0). I’ve been working as a technician for the last two years, but I want to gain professional experience as a software engineer (or a developer). Can someone gives me advices, thank you so much."

I'm a CS student at a no-name university in Canada. I'll be graduating in December '21 with a degree in computer science. I have no internships but I do have three web development projects (an asteroids game, a barebones replica of Facebook, and an Etch-a-Sketch clone), as well as a decent GPA (3.85).

I taught myself web dev using [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). I'm also decent at DS&amp;A and LeetCode -- I'm able to solve most mediums in 25 minutes or less.

However, that is the extent of my knowledge. I am absolutely terrified that I won't get a job as a junior dev by my graduation date. I see so many people my age with internships and way more knowledge than I, and I feel bad.

I still have some time -- just under a year -- but I am unsure about what my future holds and what I should do to maximize my job prospects.

Any advice?

Thank you for reading!"

kucglc,5,2021-01-10,Project about electronic load,Ioragi,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/kucglc/project_about_electronic_load/,"Hi!  
Last spring I builded an electronic load (as seen on the circuit diagram) as part of an internship. A year later I'm about to wrap my studies up with my final project, and it have been decided that I'll work more with the electronic load I created last spring.

It might be nerves about starting my final project, and for the first time I have to define the scope of the project myself, instead of getting one handed to me - but I feel really lost, and I do not know where to go from here.

The project revolves around the load as seen from the circuit, but should be controlled through a microcontroller/a PC. I have a lifeline at the company where I work with my project, but I don't feel comfortable asking these dumb questions up front. He gave me the following bullet points that I can work from:

* Microprocessor platform
   * Display and buttons?
   * Interface (USB) to PC
   * GPIO to control buttons, LEDs, etc
   * Peripheral circuits (DAC/ADC/Temp) for controlling load current and measuring voltage
   * Development platform (Java, C, C#, Python)
* StepLoad hardware construktion
   * Interface to Microprocessor platform (Shield)
   * Interface that connects the load (DUT)
   * Målepunkter til test og kalibrering
* GUI on PC
   * C#/.NET med Windows Form
   * Installation method
   * Version control

What I want to ask is, where would you start? How do I get started with this project? My goal is currently to define the scope of the project, I do not think I will have problems once it is defined. I'm sorry for asking such trivial questions, but I know that defining projects is part of being a good engineer, and frankly, school has not prepared me for this.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

**Field:** IT/CS

**Experience:** 4 years of research experience, most of it from a recent PhD in a topic tightly-related to the advertized position and the remaining part from a prior research internship.

**Company:** a multinational (not among the Big Tech companies) 

I searched in Glassdoor, and the range mentioned is 3K-4K monthly, though with low confidence. I also don't konw if that's supposed to be gross or net.

If I don't specify the company in Glassdoor (just research scientist salaries in Germany), I get an average of 58K/year with Min. 45K and Max. 76K.

I should mention though that many of those reported salaries come from academic institutions, where -AFAIK- salaries are set according to public service collective agreements (TV-L), so I'm not sure if the same ranges are applicable within the private sector.

I worry that I may end up asking for too much or too little. So, any useful information would be appreciated.

I majored in IT and minored in CS at a state school. If it helps, I took the most advanced minor path (low level systems, had to take Operating Systems and the likes) available at my university. Some of the courses I took are courses that CS majors actively avoid, so I’m in a bit of an odd position. 

I have released some applications on the App Store that I built alone using a variety of different technologies which I figure could help me. I also have decent experience with other projects and know multiple different programming languages such as Java, Swift, C, &amp; Python. I also have a decent understanding of the more IT side of things such as AWS, as well as a basic understanding of how to manage a PostgreSQL database and server. 

I haven’t started applying for jobs yet but I suspect that I’m going to have a tough time getting a programming job since I’m not a major. I fear that employers might just toss out my application because I didn’t major and not even take a look at my projects. I also have no internships, which I personally feel that I make up for with the amount of projects I have made. 

When getting a job in CS, is it mostly about your skill level? Ideally I’d want a job that specializes in iOS mobile app design, but if there are other options for me I’d be open minded towards those as well. 

How do my prospects look?"

I am a 22M engineering student and soon graduating this coming term. Up until now I only invested in GICs (TFSA) only because I was not willing to take on many risks as a student and I am not well versed in finance and didn't have the time to look into it. I have now gotten serious about investing in stocks as a goal for myself in the new year, so I visited my bank to get advice on growing the money I saved from my internships.

I told them my plans for the future (i.e. purchase RE, pay of student loans, etc.). The investment consultant told me not to pay off my student loans in full and just pay it off slowly since the interest rate is low, while using the money I saved to invest on better things. Everything made sense and before I knew it, they wrote up a plan for me and signed me up for CIBC Smart Balanced Growth Solution (TFSA), Balanced Growth Solution (Non Reg) and Investors Edge. I thought they had made a good plan for me as a starting point, and I was more inclined to go with a professionally managed portfolio as a beginner (Also I don't have much time while studying to actively look at my finances). I also didn't want money just sitting there doing nothing.

That same night I did research on personal finance and landed up on this sub and learned a lot from posts and what other people are doing. Firstly, I didn't realize just how financially illiterate I was. Secondly, it seems like the consensus here is that the big bank products don't look for my best interests because of the MER fees and that the advisors are just sales people. It feels like I made a mistake buying into their products and the questions that are in my head are:

1. Were there better options for me given my situation?
2. If so, what do I do now? Should I just continue with their products until I finish school and revisit mid year?"

I was given a project to redo one of the companies websites (theres 3) and due to my limited experience and overconfidence I gave them a highly underestimated due date. It’s been 4 months since that due date and I’ve been busting my ass often working weekends to get this thing done. I gave them a new due date of the beginning of March but they don’t want to hear it, they want it done by the end of January. I tried explaining to them that my schedule is unpredictable because of also doing help desk full time, which can sometimes take up half of my day, so they said to strip the new site of any stuff that they feel is nonessential to being live at first, then add everything else as it’s live. It’s like they’d rather have it 60% done and live instead of 100% done and live just because.
On top of that the VP has anger issues. I once forgot to set up his new laptop which he drove from work to pick up, and he just completely flipped shit at me yelling and being very unprofessional. I am so fucking burnt out from doing 2 jobs at once. I want to do web dev full time so this place is a stepping stone for now. I am very self critical so I often blame myself for not getting this project done in time. Did I fuck up or is this place just fucked up? Or both?"

I am a recent grad with a bachelor's degree in cyber security. I had a few questions that I was hoping to get some insight into. I started my search into the job market fairly recently, and could use some advice. I'm looking to break into the field in the best way possible.


Most of my experience comes from my internship, which was unfortunately more of a general IT internship with very little security purposes involved. With that being said, I've searched the sub and it seems entry level roles are tough to come by. I've read SOC would be ideal, and eventually want to make my way to security analyst or engineer. If I am unable land an entry level role in security, what would be a good place to start to learn more skills on the job? 


I'm also looking to eventually work towards my certifications, but unfortunately don't have the funds to afford to take them at the moment given the current state of things. As I'm always trying to learn, are there any good places online to continue learning for cheap/free like webinars or practice to improve my skills and keep them sharp while looking for a job? I plan on starting bandit over the wire this week and going from there. 


Any other questions or advice for someone like myself trying to make it into the field would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! "

Basically, I'm worried that it's too early in my degree to take time off for an internship.

I'm doing an MS in electrical engineering. I started in September 2020, so this is my second semester. Master's students don't get summers off at my school and are fully funded through the whole year. 

Last summer, I interned with a great company, and have the opportunity to go back to the company this summer but to a different team. This other team does work that is much more aligned towards my interests, and also aligned with what my thesis project is about (RFIC design). The opportunity isn't set in stone yet, i.e. there's no formal offer yet, but based on what the team told me last year, I should be able to get it if I reach out in time. But I don't want to reach out without the intention of taking an offer if they give me one, so I want to figure this out first.

My supervisor has already told me he's ok with me taking the time off, but he did say it could prolong the duration of my masters, which makes sense. Right now, I don't think I have an interest in doing a PhD, so I'd want to go into industry right after finishing my master's, which is a good reason for taking the internship. But at the same time, I'm just finally getting started on research-related work, because last semester I was taking 3 classes and 0 progress on anything else. I'm worried that if I leave in 4 months for an internship, I could 'lose my groove' and slow down my progress. 

Also, there's a lot I can learn just continuing to do research-related work, because my advisor wants me to get experience designing some circuit blocks, but I also know there's also a lot I could learn at an internship. I know that if I want to go into industry, I should do an internship sometime before I graduate. So, should I wait until I've made some serious progress on my thesis project and try for internships next year, or just do it this summer? Would an internship be more valuable to me after I've learned more at school?

Thanks!"

I wish to move to the UK, hopefully do a Masters degree and get a job, and eventually get the citizenship.

As for the budget, my parents can afford to get me there, and pay for a few months. If I were to study Masters, it would have to be a scholarship, or part-time with a job.

kuzt4x,0,2021-01-11,Prefrosh thinking about switching from premed to CS -- am I fucking up?,lochnessdonuts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kuzt4x/prefrosh_thinking_about_switching_from_premed_to/,"I'm currently a high school senior admitted into a pretty good (think at or slightly below Ivy tier on USNews) private school under a binding ED agreement. I was admitted as a bio major with the intent to pursue premed but I'm thinking about switching into the engineering school (easy to do before next fall at this school) and doing a ECE/CS double degree.

I have a background internship and research-wise in both. I was a good student in HS so I'm pretty sure I'd do well academically no matter what I pick. I'm slightly more interested on premed on pure subject matter alone but am hesitating for a few reasons:

1. Medicine is hard lol. Almost every doctor I've talked to makes the med school to physician pipeline sound like absolute hell on earth -- 80 hour weeks, 3 AM calls, etc. Comparatively, CS seems infinitely chiller, and it looks much more likely I'll be able to work to live and not live to work

2. I'm not hyper-passionate about medicine. I love biology as a subject from the internships I did in HS, but some of these kids I'm in a class with have literally been thinking about being doctors since they were 5. While I think a career in medicine is appealing in the abstract sense, it's not like I pop a stiffy thinking about performing surgery or would be unable to live with not being a doctor, and from what I've heard, that's basically a requirement to not blow your brains out along the way.


However, CS also seems to have its drawbacks:

1. the school I'm going to is nationally recognized as having a great bio program and produces a lot of med school acceptances, but not so for CS/engineering -- it's not bad, but probably like top 50 ranked, which I would feel kinda shitty spending my parents' money on. I can't help but think that if I applied to schools with CS in mind I could've gone to a better CS program, but I'm bound to this school now, and the sunk cost regret kinda sucks to think about

2. CS seems a lot less stable of a job market. My parents are both software engineers and they've been constantly terrified of getting laid off for the last decade or so, while it seems like doctors are basically set until they retire or die. It also looks like even making it into industry gets harder every year, with limited internship/job slots and more and more CS students/grads

3. The salary. I know it's a meme that doctors are in school until they're 35, but a &gt;200k salary as a decent doctor is all but guaranteed, while it seems like CS is pretty hit or miss -- I've seen anywhere from 50k to 250k starting salaries, meaning there's no guarantee I'll have a cushy job right after (or even a decade after) graduating

Of course, I know this is a CS oriented subreddit, so the responses will bias in favor of CS, but I want to know what y'all think (especially those who've had to make similar decisions in the past). I certainly wouldn't be miserable doing either, but I don't want to look back in a decade and regret making a massive life choice, y'know?

Thanks."

It was for a full time position at a relatively well known start up in my City. I thought why not, so had a chat,  which lead to an interview. Which has now lead to an offer..
Here's the thing, I kind of want to take it. Working is so much fun, and to be honest. With my families income being so low. A job that pays this well could really help both them, and me.
But im hesitant. For starters I havent been in this internship long and I think it would be a dick move to just drop them, and im terrified thay of I do this and hold my University degree for longer. They may kick me out or I'll lose the job after a year or 2 and won't be able to find another one..

So am I feeling completely naive at this point in my life. I recently found out my ex-husband still has a joint credit card with both our names that I did not know about.

We married in 2009 and our divorce was finalized in 2013. We lived in Colorado until I moved out in late 2011. The moveout was not officially planned. I had been offered a once in a lifetime internship overseas that started in January 2012. I had decided to go a couple weeks early to get settled and see some of the sights. 

After a few months, I discovered he was cheating. That is a total dealbreaker for me and we agreed to a divorce, which I thought was fairly amicable. He told me he would close our joint accounts. The money in the joint bank account was mostly his as I had opened my own when I left.  Since I was out of the country, we thought it would be easier to wait until I returned.

So, I finished the internship, had a great time and came back to the US. I decided to stay with some family in Kansas during the divorce proceedings. We filed. He informed the judge that there was no joint debt, property, etc between us. Paperwork was straightforward and we were able to get it done pretty quickly.

During that time, I met someone new and we became close and moved in together. We had two sons and were happy until he was killed in an accident in 2016, shortly before our 2nd was born.  So I found myself having to build myself up once again, this time with 2 boys. 

We had a bit left over from his life insurance, which I thought would be good for a down payment for a small home. So I went ahead and began preparing to find a new home for us. That is when I discovered the card.

After checking my credit myself for the first time since my internship, I noticed a joint account that was still open and maxed out. There had been several late payments on it from after the finalization of the divorce. I had no information on the card account or anything. 

I contacted the bank and told them. They claimed they needed a court decision on joint debt. The problem is, according to our divorce certificate there was none. I contacted my ex and asked him to please either pay off and close that account or do a balance transfer. That was almost 3 months ago and he hasn't done it.

I really don't want to be responsible for paying this off because I had no idea it was out there. I have had no access to this card or account. Is there anything that can be done?"

kva8jd,2,2021-01-11,Question about Internship,Kurt_VonneAbs,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/kva8jd/question_about_internship/,"Hi everyone!

So I am currently in school finishing up a degree with a major in Art &amp; Design and minors in IT Management and Digital Media Arts &amp; Engineering (kind of a CS/Art mashup).  My goal is to get into front end web development.  After I graduate this semester I will be attending Galvanize's boot camp in the fall before trying to get a job in the industry.

Since CS is not my major, it's hard to find web development internships.  However, there is a company locally offering an internship I should be able to get that does branding, advertising, website development, and public relations.

Would it be useful to have an internship in more of a UI/UX role that may not have a ton of coding?  Would web dev employers view that as a plus, or should I continue with my original plan of taking my extra time to self-teach and build more small projects?  Especially considering I will probably learn a lot and build projects in the bootcamp itself.  I'm not completely new to coding and I have already taken multiple web dev / coding classes at university and have a few projects (e-commerce site, iphone app deployed to app store etc).  Thanks for the input!"

kvci5z,1,2021-01-11,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (1/11/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/kvci5z/weekly_job_qa_thread_1112021/,"Hi all,

Here is the forty-sixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

It feels like I forgot everything but I somehow managed to ace a presentation / market study.

Here is a bit more about me:

19-25 Worked multiple jobs but mostly QA testing for game companies, got two promotions, left to pursue university degree with company program.

25-28 Got my degree in Econ, company was in early stages of bankruptcy

28-29 Got an internship that turned into a job offer in my field as a project manager.

29-31 Started Masters degree in IT Management never finished it, got hit by a car and was wheelchair bound for months...

31-35 Got a consultant job offer for an African company. They said they would pay me by bank transfer and it sounded sketchy at the time so I asked for way more than I thought was reasonable, they accepted, I did the work for a month while looking for other jobs, half-expecting not to get paid. I got PAID USD6500 monthly for a few years. I also worked for some of their other clients for USD 3600 half month and 2000 weekly.

35-38 Wife got sick, we moved country so she could be closer to her family, main client collapsed during coup, looked for other job opportunities but nothing came through so I opened a small pub near her parent's place.

38-39 Wife got better, started new job, corona fucked us all, pub business went from YaY to NAY!

As a favor to a friend I did a small research for a product the company he works at was developing, convinced them they were targeting the wrong country and showcased different market applications and by the end of the discussion they were impressed beyond my expectations and asked me to please work for them to find them a research partner in said country.

I know they mentioned someone who does part-time consulting for them at a rate of around USD2000 per month but that is for part-time work.

The job in question would have me move country, meet with producers to try and establish a partnership with this company, there is a good chance of more market research and of courting government actors for support. 

Now, I never really had to negotiate compensation properly, should I wait for their offer or send them my ""expected wages"".

What wage should I aim for? 

Can anyone think of a title for this job?

Should I just take anything in this job market?"

I know a lot of tiny engineering firms with 20 employees might have leaky faucets or old drywall or bare bones computers. But I'm talking companies with more than 500 employees. 

Had 3 co-ops. Started 4th rotation last week. 1 and 2 were at different companies. 3 and 4 with same. 

Basically company 3/4 doesn't really offer many extra things in terms of supplies, didnt offer anything for WFH employees, they had to use their home computers. If you have 2 monitors and one breaks for some reason, you don't get a replacement. If your desk leg breaks, you have to find duct tape to fix it. 

Am I being too entitled to want stuff like working monitors and working desk chairs? I haven't complained about this to anyone and just kept my mouth shut because I'm grateful to have an internship right now.

kvey9s,1,2021-01-11,Nihilistic and Hopeless Following Breakup,Business_Coat559,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kvey9s/nihilistic_and_hopeless_following_breakup/,"Briefly,

GF of 5 years, whom I was supposed to propose to on New Years, left me in Mid October. This was following a scandal in which she was hanging out with her old FWB and I raised concerns and frustration about that. I left the house to cool off and think. I came back and late at night that same night, he texts her ""are you sure this is what you want?"" and I exploded. I yelled ""what the fuck is he talking about?"" and she claimed I was being overprotective and jealous and that I should trust her. After talking about it for the rest of the night, we agreed that it wasn't okay of her to be hanging out and spending the night at a old FWB's house. The next day, after I returned from work, she had packed her things and left our apartment empty. (Side note: this is the same way my alcoholic father, who I will mention later, fell into a deep depression. It was hurtful that she would do it the same way that she knew my father fell apart to.)

She said she was leaving me because she hasn't been happy in a very long time, I don't trust her, and she hasn't loved me for a while. She came back as I begged her to explain everything and from there agreed to work on our relationship. She texted me a week later to break up with me over text. Out of complete anger, I drove across the city and demanded her to give me the respect of breaking up with me in person. She did.

The following days, I was completely distraught and blowing up her phone attempting to talk to her because more clues kept connecting and I wanted closure on a lot of elements in our relationship which she gaslighted. She told me I didn't deserve to know and I said ""Fuck you, I can't believe you said that, block my ass."" And ..she blocked me.

A week later, she was already across the state with this guy traveling and he was already posting pictures of her.

To say this has made me suicidal would be downplaying it. I don't have any family. I am an only child. My mom abandoned me when I was young, my dad became an alcoholic because of that and so I lived with my grandmother. I live completely on my own now as my grandmother is constantly in and out of the hospital. All of my high school friends live out of state.

I've been doing the ""self-help"" stuff since she left like going to the gym, talking to a therapist, cutting out cigarettes, drinking, and nicotine completely, picking up new hobbies, and reading, but it all feels like a distraction. And that's the issue, everything is a distraction from the pain of my life. I don't think I've ever felt as if I was genuinely doing something that made me happy or something that I truly wish I could accomplish.

I'm an engineering major. I'm entering my senior year next year so I can't quit now, I've already put in 3 years of hell. I've hated it since I started. COVID made me lose my internship that I had. COVID keeps me at home for long portions of the day. Anyways, these are just the small details but they'll give you a sense of who I am.

I imagine having ""success"" by graduating, getting a nice paying job, making some new friends, but at the end of the day, it just seems like another distraction. I didn't always use to be like this, but the issue is that I am now, and I wouldn't solely put the blame on the breakup. I just know that if this mindset doesn't go away within the next couple months, I will end my life. I refuse to live a life that I deem meaningless.

The one thing that I believe life is worth living for is family and the people you love. I don't have a family. And I did love her. But she's gone. And I am empty. And everything I do seems pointless without someone to do it with or someone to do it for. I am a selfless person, I put others before myself for this very reason. It's an opinion, but it's one that I am stubborn about.

TLDR; I need advice. GF of 5 years left me roughly, I love her still. She was with the guy I suspected she would be less than a week after it happened. She's gone. I'm lost. I have no family or friends. I live on my own. I've done all the self help stuff you can imagine, but it all just feels like a distraction and I don't want life to feel like a distraction. I don't know how to escape this mentality or find hope in life."

I'm starting my last semester in a couple weeks, and I will graduate in May. I want to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Not sure what I like yet, as I have limited experience. The only hands on stuff I've done in school is some penetration testing techniques, digital forensics, and basic network security. Therefore, I don't know what I'd like to aim for in the long run, but I definitely want to get into cybersecurity.

[My resume](https://imgur.com/a/xlqxo5E), if you would like to take a look. I don't have any internships. I have one noteworthy project with five other people in a web development class. It used express, node, mongodb, pug and git. And I presume I'll generate one more noteworthy project this coming semester in my capstone computing class. Should those projects go on my resume in place of something that is on there currently? Resume critiques would be appreciated.

I have read that there are many positions that lead into cybersecurity, from software engineering, to networking, to financial analysis roles. So should I apply to all of these roles? From what I can gather from reading other posts, I am already too late on applying for positions that begin shortly after I graduate in May? Should I be applying right now to get a job as soon as possible?  Also, could someone settle the whole cover letter debate for me: do I write them or not? And how's the job market doing now? I have been very pessimistic about my likelihood of getting a job within six months of graduation. So, I wonder if it might be a good idea to apply for roles like technician at a computer repair shop or help desk roles too? Tips on places to look, services to use, and specific companies to apply to?

TL;DR: I'd like any and all advice on getting a job ASAP after graduation.  I'm very pessimistic about that possibility, so I want to know what I can do right now, two weeks before my last semester. Should I be applying to everything right now?"

I'm not one to reach out for support, but reading through some of the posts here have encouraged me to share, and hopefully get some sound advice / perspective from others here.

Long story short, I had a really hard transition out of university \~10 years ago. I got a generic BA that I wasn't super passionate about, and I walked into the workforce without many skills. I always believed I was smart, capable and competent, but it was clear to me that people who had ""skills"" were going to do quite well in the future. I went back to school (again), studied an electrical engineering associates degree, and with some family connections, landed an internship in the bay area as an automation engineer.

It's been 7 years, and I have seen so many of my colleagues depart from the company, head down, disappointed and not looking back. I stayed on and have been promoted from intern all the way to senior manager. I have had a looming feeling of wanting to depart for YEARS....down and out, not going back, \*\*\*\* this place....you name it. Most recently, I got booted out of my old role because I challenged new management on their objectives and goals, because I understood the state of the organization and what works / what doesn't (I'm a very functional, technical, but communicative guy). They didn't appreciate the dissent, and I was reassigned to my connections organization, and assigned to one of his folks. I'm concurrently doing a masters of data science, and thought that this transition would lead to my director promotion....but my new boss is a vapid, mid-aged, bored and dejected ""VP"". I put in so much work in my first 2 months, putting together pieces to a very broken puzzle....but unfortunately, trying too hard to pursue what's ""right"" has led me down a road where I don't believe I'll be getting my promotion, and moreso, stuck in a deadend role with no goals.

I'm an engineer, robot specialist, I can program, write scopes of work, have shaken hands with multi-national corporate executives. I've been ""that guy"", and have done a tremendous amount of work in a short period of time.

So it seems like I should look forward to a move right? They wronged me, didn't know my worth, I'm studying a masters of data science (super hot field) and I have a robotics/advanced engineering background + I am an excellent communicator. I should feel exhilarated that I am looking for a new opportunity, a director role and will get all the validation i crave once i get my great new role! (I know that is a little immature of me to say....but want to be open here...)

Well, I'm anxious, nervous, and all the creeping voices in my head are telling me that I'll never get a job, and moreso, that I'm not as capable as I think I am. If I was, why wasn't I promoted to director in my current organization? 

I'm having a hard time breaking this anxiety....I worked hard in my life to rebuild my career, go back to school, upskill myself and dedicated myself to a lucrative career for so many years.....shouldn't this be my time to shine and show the world what I'm capable of? How do I break these terrible patterns of self-defeat, so that if given the chance, I can really prove to an employer that I'm worth it?"
kvi1e6,303,2021-01-11,Is there anyone else Who is scared of phone calls?,suman7421,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kvi1e6/is_there_anyone_else_who_is_scared_of_phone_calls/,"I have extreme anxiety for phone calls and more if its video call, I never did a video call, I used to talk to my friends when I was 7-8 years old. But everytime I talk to anyone my parents will try to listen to me. And then I need to tell my parents what I talk about and who I was talking to in details. Sometimes they also force me to on speaker while I talk with my friend so they can judge if my friends r good or bad. One time they also snatched my phone while I was talking with a friend.  
and my mom will tell me my voice is not high enough, my talking pace is not good enough, I am not being polite enough etc etc.  


So that's why I reduced calling friends and eventually totally stopped.   
i am 20 years old now &amp; I have not talked to anyone on phone call since last 5 years except parent and one or two of my teachers. I don't even talk to my relatives or my own cousin brother and sister.  


i hardly find a good friend online bcos I have none in real life, but I lost two good friends bcos I did not talk to them on phone call. now I am about to finish my studies and I have to call and receive calls from companies regarding my internship, I am scared as fuck, Idk what to do:((((("
kvi6nz,4,2021-01-11,Best way to get started in coding/programming/software engineering?,calebbogart7,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/kvi6nz/best_way_to_get_started_in/,"Hi everyone, so I’ve always had big interests in tech ever since I was little, I loved messing with computers. But I never really got into the deeper engineering aspects such as coding, programming, web developing etc. well after I started working in my current job for a couple of years, I realized I was wrong to listen to my family to not pursue a career in tech. I realized that if I’m going to be going to a job for the rest of my life, it needs to be something that I’m interested in. And that would be tech. 

So with all that said, I’m wondering what is the best way to get started? School or self teaching? I’ve done some research, and even subscribed to a pretty cool Instagram software engineer on YouTube, who went to Northwestern and got his bachelor’s degree in CS. But in one of his videos he made it clear that almost none of the classes he took was worth it, relevant, nor really helpful when it came to the real world. And like a lot of people have said, there’s so much resources online you definitely have all that you need to become familiar with all the fundamentals and get started. 

But then again, since my ultimate goal would be having a career change and transition into a tech company (tech giants would definitely be a goal and dream) I figured school would still be necessary. I know with tech it’s different, it’s something that relies on natural talent, experience and the right skills instead of a degree. (Especially when google has over 50% of engineers that doesn’t even have a degree) But then again, having a degree from a top ranked computer science school would definitely make you stand out, out of the other thousands of qualified applicants, it sure can give you a higher possibility of at least getting an interview and be noticed, and have more opportunities on internships and special projects. 

So I’m just wondering what is the best way for me to start out? Enroll in a school right away or teach myself all that I need to know and then get a degree? A degree isn’t cheap, so I wanna weigh everything out. Thanks everyone!"

I am also a player on the women’s basketball team. My junior year finished up by being sent home due to covid, and my internship search was cancelled. I ended up working at a hunting and fishing lodge and had the time of my life, but had to forgo a summer of experience. I have great communication skills, I work hard in everything I’m assigned, am a great team player, and would like to think I am a people person! 

However, I am super torn on how to approach looking for a job. I am admittedly not the best coder, I don’t know if this is due to the lack of practice or if I’m just not good at it? I am almost finished with my major so don’t feel like I am that awful. I am working on Azure cloud cert and my senior project is a pairs trading analysis in Python that might look good on my resume.  Other than that, I have little experience.

Any advice on where to go from here? Do I drop coding and focus on something else? Keep practicing? Get more certifications before applying to jobs? Not really sure what to do.

:--|:--
Space Cadet Pinball, how does it feel to be the most played ""bring your child to work day"" game? I remember it fondly.|The best part is that I used to ""teach"" computer lab when my kids were in K through 6th grades, back when Pinball was still included and well known. The kids could care less about anything technically hard or interesting that I'd worked on, of course, but Pinball gave me instant street cred with them.
 |Especially cool was being able to walk over and enter a secret code that only I knew that would turn on all the cheats, like infinite lives. They thought I was a wizard at that age!
 |The code, by the way, is ""hidden test"" without the quotes! Then various keys do different things, you can click and drag the ball around, and so on. Google it for the gory details!
 |I always like to point out that I was working with a full set of original IP from Maxis, so I had nothing to do with the design of the game, or it's art, etc... that was all done! My contribution was volunteering to port it, including a partial rewrite from asm to C, to work on MIPS, Alpha, PowerPC, IA64, ARM, and so on, which was actually a lot of work. But I got it into the Windows box, which is how and why everyone knows it today. But all credit for the gameplay and so on goes to Maxis, all I did was not screw it up in that case!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
To add a bit of detail re Space Cadet Pinball: we built Space Cadet originally at my company Cinematronics and did a deal with Microsoft to ship it with the Plus Pack that accompanied Win 95 and Win 98. While it technically didn't ship w/ Windows, the Plus Pack had something like a 25% attach rate and pinball wound up on most systems anyway. Microsoft actually had an option in our original contract from 1994 to ship it with the OS itself or the Plus Pack. Maxis was our publisher for the subsequent retail version, and later bought my company. More germane to this thread: I believe Dave's port entered the picture a few years later, after Win 98, and was likely critical to pinball continuing to ship on later iterations of the Windows OS (i.e. 32-bit). I definitely appreciate the time he put in to give the game extra years of life on the Windows platform. Kevin Gliner, game designer and producer for 3D Pinball, and co-founder of Cinematronics.|Pleased to FINALLY put a name to the game design! You should update the Wikipedia article for the game, as I think it lists Matt Ridgway, who might have been sound? I've been crediting Maxis for years, not knowing the role of Cinematronics who was who. One thing that confused me: wasn't there a company that did video games in the 80s called Cinematronics? Any relation? Star Castle, Armor Attack, etc...
 |As for timing, this likely between the Win95 and Win98 Plus! packs. It was very early on at least, and shipped at least in NT4, and perhaps earlier in ""SUR"" release that ran atop NT 3.51, but I don't have access to any source files to check dates!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I keep meaning to fix that wikipedia article, there's a significant number of people that worked on the game and for some reason only Matt (an independent sound guy who did some excellent part-time contract work for us) is listed. There's also a lot of confusion about the timing of various releases and the companies involved, and who owns it now (EA). I actually have all the original source, although no rights to any of it anymore. Hard to say on the timing of the port. I was working in Redmond in '99 when I got word someone had done an NT4 and Win2000 port (I'm assuming that was you), so that was the first time the port showed up on my radar. I have a more confident memory (and contracts, email, etc) of all the events related to how pinball came about and the first couple years after it was released. I like to think pinball was the very first Win95 game (it was fun to watch Gates and Leno pretend to play it on stage at the Win95 launch event), but of course there were other games that shipped with the launch too. You're correct, there was an 80s arcade game company called Cinematronics that went out of business long before we started in 1994, and someone had let the trademark lapse. How we came to be called Cinematronics is a long story for another time...|NT shipped in 96, so the version I did for it would have been done in 95. I remember working on it about the time Win9X was shipping or in late beta. I could be wrong on that part, but Nov 95 would be my guess.

Damn dude, porting assembly? You are a legend!|Thanks - we actually did all of our debugging in assembler. We didn't have any source-level or line-level debugging at all (except as noted below). So you'd connect to a machine through an ssh-like tool and then, if the symbols were right, you could get a callstack and inspect memory, disassemble functions, and so on. But since we spent much of our day staring at assembly, I became reasonably adept at it.
 |I say ""reasonably"" as I was lazy enough that I would compile the components of interest to me with Visual Studio PDB symbols so that, if I could repro on my own machine, I could then source-level debug it. That made me fast at some stuff that others were slow at, but I likely never got as proficient at asm debugging as someone who never had an alternative. I had a developer friend named Bob whom was an ntsd (our debugger) superstar, and he'd write expressions inside of breakpoints to fire conditionally, that kind of thing. So I did learn that trick, but I'm sure there were dozens I just never knew.
 |That all said, we rarely if ever coded in assembly. All coding was in C/C++.
 |In the Pinball case, parts of the original were written in hand-coded in asm by Maxis, like the sound engine, and wouldn't have had a hope of working on anything but an x86. Rather than be lame and not have sound on the RISC platforms, I opted to rewrite that stuff in C so that it was portable.
 |The RISC platforms also bring their own set of problems like 32-bit alignment for data. And being on Windows NT (now just ""Windows"") meant being Unicode, but fortunately there isn't a TON of text in a pinball game!

boytekka: damn, the only time that I did assembly language is when we tried moving a small machine through the printer port.. I miss those days LordApocalyptica: Only time I did assembly was when I wanted to make a game on my TI-84, and decided that I didn't want to. I miss those days too.|First game I wrote in assembly I did in a machine language monitor on my C64. You can't (easily) relocate 6502 so to add code you'd have to jump out, do stuff, and jump back... Crazy!
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
If I can ask a question, how does it feels to go from coding with basically zero help to working with modern IDE and code editors that give you a lot of infos, tips, error notifications and so on? I've started programming like a year ago from zero, and I don't think I could be able to program like y'all did 20 years ago or more. Thanks for doing this AMA anyways!|You're very welcome! The progression in tools has been amazing, really. I remember HESMON and my first machine language monitors for the PET and C64, then really nice ROM dev environments, and CygnusEd for the Amiga... all the way up to PlatformIO and Visual Studio Code.
 |My most recent ""WOW"" moment was adding a line to my lib_deps line in platformio, which magically included the library being developed at the URL on github. So you can link to online projects... cool.

Just wanted to say thanks for the Alpha port!|Alpha AXP was by far the hardest to debug! ""Branch later, maybe""

I just want to thank you for my first experience with pinball. I am now a top 100 competitive pinball player and own 16 pinball machines.|That's cool, which do you collect primarily? I was always a fan of Williams, and am FB friends with a couple of their older devs like Steve Ritchie, Larry DeMar, and Eugene Jarvis (but I should be careful, Bill Gates warned me never to name drop :-) )
 |I have a Black Knight 2000 as my own machine right now!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I have a wide range. Some modern Sterns like Metallica, Jurassic Park, Tron and Iron Maiden. Older Bally’s like Frontier and Fathom. 2 classic Bally/Williams Dr Who and Attack From Mars. Plus a few EMs. I like them all! Attack From Mars was the game that got me into the physical world of pinball. Collecting has been more of a recent pandemic thing since I can’t go out and play. I miss traveling around the country playing in big tournaments. Oh yeah and Steve Ritchie is quite the character. You must meet him some day. I’ve met him a few times and each time has earned a place in my pinball stories I talk about with friends.|Congrats on the collection, that's a nice set! I've never met Steve - I did meet Larry DeMar in vegas. I was playing at a slot machine and he was next to me, and had a name tag, and I was like... ""Excuse me sir, but does the word Robotron mean anything?"" and it turned out to be him!
Asking as someone pretty new in software development, did you experience impostor syndrome? If so, how did you deal with it?|My first couple of years were very productive, so I wasn't insecure about my output, but even so I definitely experienced imposter syndrome. I think most people who achieve aspirational roles do... I have a friend who was in the NFL who describes the same feeling.
 |Being as productive as your peers is sort of the pre-requisite, and if that's true, then remind yourself that when you were in fifth grade, the eighth graders on the playground seemed so old and mature! It's odd in that I started in 1993, but to me anyone who started in the 80s was a ""true"" Old Timer and remains so in my head to this day. And similarly I'm no doubt the grizzled veteran to people I hired a few years later.
 |I know when I started I felt like the dumbest guy in the room, and by the end I felt like the smartest guy in the room, and I don't think I'd gotten any smarter along the way. So it's all relative and perception. Well, that and the stock caused some serious attrition of the ""really smart""!
 |I remember visiting Google a couple of years ago in the bathrooms they had posters that read ""YOU ARE NOT AN IMPOSTER"", and info about seminars and so on about it, so it's very common! I wish I had a concrete strategy for you, but I don't other than ""It's commonplace, and I bet there are a ton of resources on the Web. Don't be surprised you're experiencing it!""
What would you encourage someone to start learning today related to your field?|I'm learning React at the moment. Let's face it, the web development experience is utter nonsense. So I kept hoping for something that would make it clean, and easy to make components, and to work with REST apis. So I went looking for a solution. Then I read about Angular, and it seemed like ""too much"" to learn for the sake of making a SPA.
 |But React seems understandable enough and solves a ton of problems with web development, not the least of which is being able to intermingle HTML and Javascript (via JSX).
 |As for languages, I'd probably start with Python. I prototyped a complicated LED system a couple of years ago and it was admirable what it could accomplish for an interpreted language. And you probably have to know modern Javascript as well.
Now, would you be rather interested in working for windows, macos or linux ?|I work in all three. For my own projects I write to the [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/) Core 3.1, and that's available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. I originally wrote my LED server to it under MacOS, then moved it to Windows with about 5 minutes of changes (related to the consoles being somewhat different). Then I moved it to Linux, where I made it work and then containerized it with Docker. I got it up and running on my Raspberry Pi and in a Windows HyperV and under WSL using Ubuntu. To me that kind of stuff is super cool.
 |Once I had it working in a Docker container I deployed it to my Synology NAS, which is some variant of Linux. So my NAS runs my Christmas lights!
 |I love stuff like that when it works!
 |My main workstation is a Dell monitor that has an internal KVM. I have a 2013 Mac Pro connected to it, which is maxed out and then has an eGPU and eRAID setup via Thunderbolt. And then I have a 3970X Windows PC connected as well, and I can jump back and forth with a button.
 |I spend most of my day in Windows now, unless it's video related, in which case I use Final Cut Pro.
Hi Dave, thanks for the AmA! In regards to task manager - often times I have to click the 'end task' button more than once to get the frozen program to actually close. Why is this? Thanks again.|Remember that, at least in my day, End Task is different than End Process. The former sends a ""Please close yourself"" message to the app, and if it's hung, it should then detect it and so on, but doesn't always. Imagine the app is in a weird state where it's still pumping messages, it's not hung, but it's broken. End Task likely won't work.
 |That's when you need End Process, which tears everything down for you. The substantive difference is that the program gets no choice in the matter and no notification. End Task can be graceful. End Process is brutal.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
What about when the task manager stops responding? We need a task manager manager to manage the task manager. Lol|I've never seen that happen, ever, unless the system itself or the window manager is bunged in some way. Your puny Task Manager cannot save you now.
 |Then again, nothing can, save a reboot.
What cool new tech are you excited about?|Right now I'm actually trying to productize something of my own, a system for doing hidden, permanently-installed LED holiday lighting. It receives the effect entirely over WiFi, or it can fall back to built-in effects and so on. Quick demo from 4th of July here:
 |https://youtu.be/7QNtj2hZtaQ
 |I'm done the software on the ESP32 and on the desktop, and working on the phone app now. So the next step is to find someone to manufacture the actual addressable LED strip fixtures. They'd be like under-counter LED strips that snap together end to end, but weatherproof, and with WS2813 LEDs internally.
 |In terms of stuff that I'm just benefitting from, the latest CPUs from AMD are amazing. I have the 32-core 3970X and the raw computing power is hard to comprehend. That you can buy a 32-core chip for $2K (or 64-core for $4K) amazes me! Now I need to learn AI or something to make use of all of that hardware...

Would you download a car?|My wife's Tesla downloads update all the time. I'm sure they're just as complex as the mechanical components of the car, so in a sense, we already do!

But... why did you keep the email?|I have a folder on my OneDrive called Registrations where I keep copies of license keys and registrations. So it was handy. Looks like Telix is my oldest registration from 1989 or so.
Also what was Microsoft really like back in the 90s? As a user of MS-Dos 3.30 forward till now. I’m assuming there has just been a whole tide of changes. Was double space really as funny on the dev side as it was on the user side with the slowness and the pufferfish as a logo :)|I worked on Doublespace in that I wrote a thunking layer that could live in low memory and then moved the rest of the code into the HMA. I didn't work on the compression, but odds are the guy who did is reading along right now, I bet!
 |I don't really know if it was faster or slower than its contemporaries like Stacker. I wrote one for the Amiga, though didn't get it quite finished before starting at MS, and it's an interesting and hard problem to do well. At least on the AmigaDOS it was, FAT would be a tad easier.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I mean for its time it was great. But back then floppy disks and 10M RLL-MFM drives were more the norm. It was actually awesome to have it included IN the OS instead of having to buy stacker. I think this is why I get so much of a kick out of every phishing AD that says download this to double your RAM. It just takes me back.|RAM Doublers are a whole 'nother ball of wax. Raymond Chen, in his blog ""The Old New Thing"", covers them well. If I understand it correctly, in the most famous case the code to do the actual memory compression was disabled, so it literally did nothing, but did it with overhead.
 |On the other hand, I note that current Windows, the HyperV, and even my Synology NAS offer ""Memory Compression"" now so perhaps there's a time and a place on modern cpus and systems.
I'm an Engineer and regularly use MS Office to produce reports and calculations. Subscript and Superscript are something I use all the time. For at least the last 15 years, in MS Word I can hit ""Ctrl +"" &amp; ""Ctrl Shift +"" to make the highlighted text Subscript or Superscript. But MS Word sucks for calculations, so I use MS Excel. But MS Excel it's about 8 clicks to make something super or subscript, and the hotkey technology hasn't made it in. So my question is, why was MS Office 2003 the best version of office that was ever produced?|I retired in 2003. Coincidence? I'll leave that one up to the scholars.
If you could go back and change anything about Windows without consequences or worrying about backwards compatibility, what would it be?|Format! I wrote that and since I was used to using the Visual Studio Resource Editor for dialogs, but couldn't in this case, I just laid out a stack of buttons and labels, content in the knowledge that a Program Manager or Designer would come up with a proper design for it that I would then code up. But somehow, no one did, and no one has for 25 years! So it's a big tall stack of buttons like a prairie grain elevator.
Ever met Bill Gates or have an interesting personal experience with him or another higher up you can share?|Yes, even when I was a new college hire he had the 30 of us or so over for beer and a burger in his back yard. It was a nice touch and quite informal. Obviously, at some scale, it wasn't 30 people anymore and they couldn't continue it!
 |Ever play the video game Star Castle? It was like that. Concentric circles of people standing around BillG each armed with what they hope is a question or comment so clever they'll stand out in some way!
If every software you need would be available for both systems. Would you use a Linux distribution or Windows 10?|Right now I'd use Windows 10 because, if the same client software is available, I'd do it on Windows simply because I have a new 3970X w/ 128G of RAM and triple RAID0 SSDs plus an Optane stick. All for about 1/10th the price of a Mac Pro. Since the hardware is so cheap and powerful, it's really hard to resist.
 |Even if all the client software were magically available, or Parallels for Linux were a thing, I'd stick with Windows because I haven't seen a Linux UI that I really like. I know everyone has a favorite... if there's an actually good and attractive one that works out of the box, let me know what distro, and maybe link a screenshot!

Give Mint 20 with Cinnamon a fair shot! I have struggled for years trying to like a Linux distro but never found one that felt and looked right which I think had been the reason Linux hasn't been adopted mainstream but Mint20 with Cinnamon is possibly it..if not its very very close.. Has awesome multi-desltop winodws feature and you can make it basically just like Win10.. Would love to know what you think of it! 20.1 BETA just dropped and has a super interesting feature called Web Apps that needs to be checked out asap! Heres a link to the 20 long term support version.. some people do not like the Minto Logos/Backgrounds out of the box..keep in mind there are a ton of nice ones included and many more you can get quickly if that's something you don't like..what is really neat is that you can make Mint20 look like any OS.. there are themes that make it exactly like MacOS I just have not personally tried those out yet. https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3928|Thanks, I'll check out Mint!
I am looking at my copy of Douglas Coupland's ""microserfs"". Although it's fiction, do you think it resembles the Microsoft Culture of the time?|Lord no, that book bugged me. On the one hand, they're a bunch of pretentious and precocious, annoying kids. I worked on a team (NT) where the tone was set by Dave Cutler and the guys he brought over from Digital, so it was rather different. On the other hand, it's such a big company that odds are those four main people DID exist somewhere in the company. Just not around me!
Why was (is) a monolithic registry preferred over distributing the settings in a number of files like Unix? Why did windows remain single-user focused for so long when Unix was multi-user since the 70s? In my understanding, if there is just one user, that user has to be admin which opened Windows up to security issues. (I don't even recall any sudo-like privilege escalation in pre-XP Windows.)|Windows NT was multiluser from birth. And there's nothing about the Windows architecture that requires users to be admin; the reality, I think, is that most apps started out in Win95 land and just didn't work if they were run as non-admin, so people ran as admin because the apps required it.
 |We couldn't just break all those apps and say ""Oh well, get better apps"" so what you got was a convention of people running as admin. But again, there's no need to. Same as Unix.
 |The one exception is that under Unix it's easy to sudo and so admin work briefly. I wish Windows had (or exposed) a simpler mechanism for letting me run as a non-admin credential and escalate when needed. I know UAC does the same thing, more or less, if used cautiously.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Yeah NT did eventually get around to fixing it. My question was really about the earlier systems, because I think you said you worked on MS-DOS? Since there were existing systems with multi-user and privilege escalation even before the first Windows, somebody must have made a conscious decision to not include that functionality.|MS-DOS was only the second or third OS I can think of for a Microprocessor (CPM, SCP, then MS-DOS). What existed for mainframes and minis didn't matter much in the memory limits available on the desktop.
What was the inspiration for Space Cadet Pinball and what is your high score?|I don't know, I wasn't the designer, the inspiration part happened separate, I provided the perspiration part! I was actually pretty good at the game, since I was literally paid to play and test it... but I don't know the score, sorry! I do have the world high score on Tempest, though! But not Pinball :-)
1. What's something super useful within Task Manager you think even seasoned Windows users don't know they can do? 2. What do you think a future version of Task Manager should be able to do?|I think CTRL_SHIFT_ESC is a surprise to a lot of people!
 |I think Task Manager needs Dark Mode, and a way to show who has locked what file or device so you can kill the offender when needed.
Why is it that I can still find dialogs in Windows 10 that were clearly built using 16 bit Visual Studio 97 version?|This should explain it. When you achieve perfection, you leave it alone:

Please for the love of God, use your Microsoft contacts to stop the snipping tool from going away. It's literally perfect but they keep trying to discontinue it.|One Compound Word: SnagIt. It's what you need to make your life complete.
 |After my time, but I heard the new snipping and history that's being built in to replace it is pretty good. It better be if they kill snipping tool!
Thanks for task manager! I use it for so many things. How do you feel about newer versions of Windows de-emphasizing the control panel in favor of their new settings app?|I'm all for it if they made sure they had 100% coverage of all settings. It's sort of weird that in this day and age, with an R&amp;D budget in the billions, we still have a mix of new control panel and old property pages. But I like the new stuff if it covered all cases!
Hello Dave! Why does Windows have such a rough time transferring a lot of small files? Is it a limitation of NTFS?|It's not Windows, it's all operating systems. Part of it is filesystem related:
 |Imagine copying a file takes 200ms of overhead plus 10ms per MB. Coping 100M of large files will take 200ms + 1000ms = 1.2 seconds.
 |Now imagine you have 100M of 1M files. Now you have 100*200ms + 1000ms = 20000ms or 20 seconds. 20 times as long for the same amount of data.
Did you ever get a chance to work in/on OS/2? I stuck with OS/2 until 2005/2006, before moving onto Linux, and would love to hear any opinions and stories you might have.|I didn't! I used OS/2 a bit but never had a chance to work on it. Many of the people I worked with did, though... but if OS/2 were Kevin Bacon, I'm one degree removed.
I had waited more than 20 years to ask this... What the fuck is Trumpet Winsock?|That's what you need to use TCP/IP on Windows before it was included in Windows. You're welcome.
What was the idea behind having ""generic"" activation keys starting in Windows XP that would activate any version, it was said they were for [educational purposes], did Microsoft provide them to 501c3/non-profit schools, or was there a different reasoning?|I'm not sure what you mean by ""generic"". I remember retail and oem, but what was a generic key?
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
There was a set of keys that became public knowledge partway through XP life that appeared to activate unlimited machines as valid, though added a banner ""For Educational Purposes Only"". I remember trying it back in the day and always wondered what the intention was that was important enough the key activations were never blocked. [I did have multiple legal keys, but curiosity killed the cat and I had to swap one to the ""educational"" key to see for myself, lol]|I don't actually know! But I can surmise that if it was displaying a banner down in the bottom right corner of the screen, it knew it was not licensed and was likely limited or time-limited in some way. Unless you could actually ACTIVATE them with that key, which would surprise me.
How does OLE still work? I can't think of anything else that complex and old that still runs. We've got a legacy piece in our application that uses it and I can build against it using .net 4.0, in an Azure pipeline and deploy to windows 10 hosts and a piece of 90s technology still works perfectly. How and why?|It was complex, but pretty well written and very well tested. That's not to say there aren't a lot of bugs outside the common case codepaths, but I bet if Office used it, it's pretty solid, and will be forever.
Other than your personal phone number, did any Easter eggs make it to general availability?|There was one in the Win9X shell, but I think we removed it for Windows XP and later. So not that I'm aware of!
Have you ever wanted to make a ""sequel"" to Space Cadet?|There are actually two other tables available in the original Maxis game that should work, in theory, but I think Space Cadet was the best of the 3, so...
Were there ever any 3rd party edit/change to shell that made you think, ""Why didn't we think of that?""|Not offhand, but ""Stacks"" on MacOS where it tries to rescue your mess by grouping things by filetype (Images, Docs, etc) is pretty clever. So that's something I wish we'd though of!
Have you worked at all with Bryce Cogswell and Mark Russinovich?? Also, what was your initial response to Process Explorer /the Sysinternals stuff??|No, but the SysInternal guys are geniuses of the highest order, so far as I'm concerned (and I say that based on their products, no knowing them). They know their stuff.
What are your best/oddest purchases you were able to justify as a work expense (for example, were you able to get MS to buy pinball machines as an R&amp;D cost)?|I had DirecTv in my office! I was working on the Media Center prototype and we couldn't get cable on campus, so I got the dish installed on the roof, etc....
 |I had a Tempest machine in my Office but at my own expense. I started right around the days of the ""shrimp vs weenies"" memo, so they were pretty cost conscious.
Is it true that you and Dave Cutler got into a knife fight over a hand of poker gone bad?|A broken bottle is not a knife.
Was DoubleSpace stolen from Stacker?|No. As I understand it, DoubleSpace was licensed from an Israeli developer. Then I heard that Stacker had somehow been awarded a patent on using a hash table in compression, which sounds pretty ludicrous if true. There was a trial, and even though it revolved around hash tables and math and compression engines, and no one on the jury had been to college, as I heard it. So the big guy lost. That's the story I heard, your mileage may vary. I'm not a spokesman, etc.

MS-DOS 6.21, the most useless version. I remember writing an extra ""2"" on my 6.2 OEM disks when the update came out (no point wasting disks).|You say ""useless"", I say ""canonical"".
 |I think I actually worked on 6.22, not sure. It was 6.2 something. In terms of usefulness, the *features* I added to it personally were:
 |- Moving Doublespace to HMA to free up a lot of low mem, as noted
 |- Giving Diskcopy ability to do it in a single pass with no swaps
 |- I wrote a new version of Smartdrv that added CD-ROM support
 |- I wrote a special version of Setup that worked via deltas and put everything on a single floppy (no point wasting disks).
 |Mind you, I was just a summer intern when I did that, and it took me about 3 months.
What are your favorite DOS command-line tricks that still work in Windows 10?|doskey!
What actually happens if someone deletes Win32?|Human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria. Do not attempt.
Did Bill ever swing by your cubicle and tell you'd he'd take your assignment home and finish it in a weekend if you didn't hurry up?|Cubicle? It was the 90s at Microsoft! I had a corner office with a table, chairs, a Tempest machine, and a sofabed.
What is the best project you worked on or had friends work on that was canceled, that you would revive if you had the resources?|Windows Media Center, I'd say! And I wish they'd done a great AutoPC that the OEMs could have licensed and made common to most cars.
There has been a lot of hate on Windows / Microsoft from the Unix / Linux advocates. What are some narratives that you disagree / don't think are true?|I used to love the Amiga, so I know what it's like to feel a sense of advocacy for a platform that you feel is superior but overlooked in the marketplace.
 |I think the most untrue narrative I've heard about them is that they all have neckbeards. I think it's only ""most"", not all.
How do you introduce yourself at parties?|""Does anyone here know how to update my Groove subscription on my Zune?""
What OS are you using now? What's your favorite OS of all time? What's the worst OS of all time? What's the worst Microsoft OS (if different)?|The best OS of all time was Windows NT 4.0 with the Shell Update Release.
 |The worst OS of all time was the TRS-80 Model 1, Level 1 DOS that didn't have the keyboard debounce code in ROM yet so you couldn't even type on the thing.
[deleted]|No, I never put a true easter egg in anything. Especially in an operating system, I don't believe in them. You have to be able to trust the OS, and I think it goes against that.
How did you get started in this specific field?|I first wandered into a Radio Shack store in about 1979 when I was 11, where I saw my very first computer. It was not connected yet, as the staff had not figured out how to set it up yet. Being somewhat precocious, I asked if I might play with it if I could manage to set it up. On a lark they said, “Sure kid, have a shot”, and ten minutes or so later I had it up and running. This endeared me to the manager, Brian, enough that every Thursday night and Saturday morning I would ride my bike down to the store: I’d type in my crude BASIC programs and they were kind enough to indulge my incessant free tinkering on their expensive computer. So that's pretty much how I started!
Do you ever have moments where you’re like “they have it so easy nowadays” or do you think that because of the groundwork put in place 30 years ago that systems have become exponentially more complex?|Only when someone spools up an entire docker instance to pipe something to it on the command line... then it's like ""Really? You're basically booting a virtual computer as a command?""
What's the best C++ expert tip you can share for fellow programmers?|If you make anything in your class virtual, make the destructor virtual, particularly if there's any chance that anyone might delete an instance of your derived class through a base class pointer. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined, I think, but even if it works, it's not what you want!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Wow this is eerie. I literally fixed a bug a couple weeks ago that was this specific case.|They can be weird bugs to track down, too!
Tabs or spaces?|Spaces on an indent of 4, tabs set to 8.
How can I open an MS Binder file?|Push down on the metal tabs at the top and bottom of the central spine of the binder. That will release the 3-hole punch claws, and then you can remove your printed file.
""It's now safe to turn off your computer"" Why was this splash removed?|I think most current BIOSes can do it on their own by now!
Do you have any insight as to why MS decided to build Windows 95 from the ground up instead of building off of an existing *nix system the way Apple did with OSX? Was it just for backwards compatibility or were there other reasons? Also, had you gone this way, how do you think Windows, and the industry in general, might be different? I'm asking as someone who thinks that WSL is the best thing to happen to Windows in years.|Windows 95 was not built from the ground up, but NT was. The most succinct reason (and just a guess, I'm not a spokesman) is that even though MS had Xenix on hand, there were fundamental problems in the way Unix handled SMP multiprocessor locks and so on at the time. I presume these have long since been solved in Linux, etc, but not without significant work.
 |WSL is one of my favorite things too, but for the library of tools and software, it makes available to me, not because of some fundamental architectural superiority, I don't think!
What are your feelings about ""Microsoft Bob""?|https://youtu.be/rXHu9OmLd8Y
What did source control look like in the 90's? How did MS keep its code from leaking out to the public? How did you handle versioning and different developers working on the same feature?|We used a tool called SLM, or Source Library Manager. It was sort of available briefly as a product under the name Microsoft Delta.
 |It was OK for smaller teams but did not support branching, so just before I left we moved to Source Depot.
Why was Ctrl + Alt + Delete changed to Ctrl + Shift + Escape?|It wasn't! Ctrl-Alt-Delete raises the ""Secure Alert Sequence"" which triggers the OS to switch to the secure desktop, where you have the ability to click a button which will start task manager upon return to your regular desktop.
 |Ctrl-Shift-Esc is a feature built into Winlogon that launches a TaskManager on the current desktop without switching to the secure desktop.
 |There are theoretically hacks and exploits that can only be caught by switching to the secure desktop, so if you're ever in doubt, ctrl-alt-del is the more secure way to go.
How did DOS ever get away with just pulling device names like ""COM1"" out of thin air when it came to output redirection etc..?|That's for compatibility with MS-DOS.
What are you currently working on?|Mostly on LED and Microcontroller projects that I detail on my YouTube channel, and the channel itself takes a fair bit of my time! If you're curious, you can check out my current successes and failure adventures at http://youtube.com/d/davesgarage
Did you work with Kris Hatleid on Super Hacker and the game Evolution?|I worked with Kris on an unreleased title called ""Commander Video"". That's largely where I learned assembly language, since he did the bulk of the coding, I watched and did level design, etc. 1982 or so I believe!
Got any dev back door mainframe access codes for pinball?|hidden test
Dave, how did you manage to do all that without being able to google everything?|That's one of the craziest things... I got a degree in computer science before you could even look anything up!
 |The hardest part was OLE2. Coming form a different platform (the Amiga) it was a monster to wrap my head around, and the book (Inside OLE2) was not the best for introducing devs to OLE. It scared me, and I sure could have used a YouTube tutorial or two!
Hi Dave! So here's a bit of an odd one. I *loved* your Space Cadet Pinball! I must have spent countless hours on it as a kid, and even now I still occasionally try to find ways to boot it up. A legitimate classic. But lately, the version windows offers just... don't feel the same. They aren't as nice. Is there a game you can name that you would say feels like a worthy successor to Space Cadet Pinball? Or even any more general pinball games you would recommend?|I have a real Black Knight 2000 machine here in the house that I fully restored, so I'm a fan of physcial pinball as well!
 |I think the two best video games are (a) arcade Tempest, and (b) XBox Geometry Wars 3.
 |GW3 is a classic, or should be!
Woah woah woah, University of Regina?!? Are you from here? Cool to see a UofR grad had such a major impact!|Yup! Check out the r/regina sub for a recent article
When working on MS-DOS what did you think of alternatives such as 4DOS, NDOS or DR-DOS, were they source of inspiration for new features or not at all ?|No in general, but Norton had NCD. It was a change folder command that could jump around the disk, so if you typed ""NCD drivers"" from the root, it could go down to ""C:\windows\system32\drives"". Super handy.
 |So I tried to write one for NT, but it meant changing the working directory of the PARENT process (cmd.exe) and I could never figure out a clean and elegant way to do it without modifying CMD itself!
Which is the best version of Windows? (Figuratively speaking).|Windows NT 4.0"

|Summer 2021|CS 162|Out of pocket|
|Fall 2021|CS 261 and any other class|Loans|
|Winter 2022|CS 325|Out of pocket|

Questions:

* Are loans disbursed for the year from the term you begin? Example: If I took out loans for spring, would it hurt my aid for the ensuing year, etc.
* Is it wise for someone new to programming to take CS 161 and CS 225 together? Or better to wait and simply do CS 161 out of pocket.
* Is taking CS 325 as soon as possible a good idea, or are some other non-prereqs recommended first?

I'd prefer to take out loans for Spring 2021 and Fall while I pay Summer and Winter out of pocket (Winter only because I've heard 325 is the roughest course and want to focus on it alone for an internship). If this is a bad idea for financial aid or workload, advice is welcome.

I can't predict my life past Winter 2022 but I'd prefer to stay on a standard two-course track each term. "

Got hired for 3 but (long story) all 3 ended before I could even start. Either due to their budget unfortunately getting cut, or me accidentally being placed in the wrong role. 

Anyways, I’ve been left feeling like a massive imposter. I had almost a perfect 4.0 GPA in college, have a website portfolio that details my home projects and bio, and I feel my resume is solid given that I’ve never had an IT job other than my internship. 

The job I’m being interviewed for is an IT analyst job. The description essentially just says helping out employees and customers with any IT related issues, identify and troubleshoot issues for customers, and recommend solutions and upgrades to the management at the company. Pretty straight forward entry job. 

But my lord, if I’m not feeling stressed OUT right now. I’ve gone 6 months without a job and am about to start driving Uber to keep paying rent. I signed up last week for Uber and just got the call to come for an interview. I need this job pretty badly so the stress is high. 

Good things: due to a delay, the company’s response was 3 months late. So I’d assume many people they contacted have already found another position or forgotten about it. I am also experienced in troubleshooting and being resourceful. 

Bad things: if I don’t get this job I’ll have to drive Uber to stay afloat. If I don’t get this job that’ll be a 6 month gap in my resume. If I don’t get this job I’ll feel pretty demotivated and it’ll definitely be a hit to the self esteem. 

I KNOW I’m capable of killing it at this job. I just need either some reassurance or some tips on how to really make a good impression. This is finally my chance and the nerves are getting to me."

The ""ideal"" scenario for me at this point would be to shorten the first internship to \~8-9 months *and* push the start date to be \~12 weeks later than it is currently. This way, I can do the Big-4 company internship this summer prior to doing the longer one.

Would it be possible to renegotiate the length and start date of the first internship after having signed the offer, or would even asking about shortening it be risky? I'm mostly just worried about seeming untrustworthy before starting the job, as even if they refused to renegotiate the length, I would not be able to back out completely and would still do the full year internship (uni is strict against reneging)."

This is my current situation. I am bringing in 30 times my monthly target as company profit. The management is going nuts over my performance because I take 1/6th the time their senior dev require to complete a project and I am able to do stuff senior devs claim to be impractical.

I asked about extension or full time around a month ago and they didn’t give me a straight answer and said that if I run out of work then I would stop putting hours in my timesheet. This to me shows there’s no extension. 

However I’m seeing that there’s more work and they might need my help. So I might be asked to do an extension. I want to think about this beforehand in case they ask. 

I don’t even know if I would want to do it. Because of the following reasons:

1) I hate the job to begin with. They give me all the bitch work because I’m an intern. There’s almost no learning opportunity, I just assemble/format documents all day. The only engineering related work I do is check drawings (PFDs and P&amp;IDs) for consistency and check equipment datasheets for consistency. I don’t get to prepare any of this. 
2) the pay is awful. Minimum wage. 
3) the fact that they didn’t give me a straight answer pisses me off. It’s like they’re just waiting around and if there’s work they’ll keep me on and if there isn’t they’ll let me go. I don’t feel appreciated. I don’t want to be an intern forever. 
4) even if they gave me full time eventually (which idk if it will happen) I don’t know if I like working here. 
4) I want to find full time work or spend more time figuring out if I want to switch to another field. I’ve been looking into tech more.

I can’t apply for their full time positions because they all require you to be a US citizen. I haven’t asked about it yet but I don’t know if I will. The thing is I don’t know if I would even want to do their full time jobs. Also, I don’t know if they like me and will just use the US citizen thing as an excuse. Their company isn’t great from what I can tell in terms of management and technical roles. (I got my internship through a connection and it was a lot of work to get everything approved). 

I was wondering if anyone has advice on this. Do you think I should stick it out and do it? Im grateful to have a job during covid but I hate it. I’m not worried about the money. Just worried about a potentially large gap in my resume if I don’t find another job soon. 

I know I don’t want to be stuck doing my internship for another few months or be working at this company in the future. And working 8 hours a day at this job gives me less time to do job search and focus on learning new skills. I’m burnt out by the end of the day and I can’t keep going for 10 hours a day plus weekends. 

Also, time is  ticking. I’m not always going to be able to apply to EIT positions. So I feel like it’s a waste of time to continue working here. 

I think I would like to stop working here once my contract is up and focus on finding a full time job or developing new skills and switching fields. Does anyone see any potential problems with this?"

Here are the reasons that I may not want to accept it:

* For my career post-grad, I see myself going towards a normal SWE job (at least, I hope) instead of an SRE position. 
   * I enjoy learning more about lower-level SRE material (that's why I applied), but ultimately my passion lies more with building user products. 
   * Thus, if I really do not accept this position, I will either try for the SWE intern position at ByteDance lol or other companies.
* I am in a current internship with another Chinese company where literally my whole team is mainland Chinese, and I personally find it difficult to really 'fit in' and to build a sense of team-lines, if that makes sense. 
   * It just makes working that much harder for me.
   * For the same reason above, ByteDance is definitely not a company that I will try to get into as my first new-grad position. 
* Not trying to stereotype, but again, my experience I have with my current Chinese company is that mentorship is not really the greatest. This might be because my internship is only for the winter though!
* The pay for SWE is higher than SRE lol, but this reason is more or less trivial to me right now.

And here are the reasons I'm thinking of accepting

* The brand name. 
   * Not entirely sure if it's 100% good lol but to me it's at least quite an accomplished company, and I think it's at least something that may stand out to recruiters.
* On the flip side, I would say that if I actually get a good mentor, I believe the mentorship has the potential to be really useful in the future!

I would totally appreciate it if anyone has any opinion/perspective on this all all!"

However, doing it and looking it up manually for 2500 entries would take me - the intern - an inordinate amount of time and I think it would be folly since you can automate that procedure.

With the API you can access their company data which they got from the commercial register as far as I understood. Can anybody tell me how you could practically crawl for the data? e.g how to acess the API via Python and insert the data I want into e.g an excel table.

I know some basic coding (C) could I teach myself or is it too proficient?

Now, they are asking to add on a store page for their 3 products and I don't really know where to start. I've heard a lot of businesses use Shopify and it seems like that might be the way to go. I feel confident enough that if there is good enough documentation then I can work my way through it.

* Country: Panama (Latin America)
* In my twenties
* Graduated 3 years ago as a Bachelors in Engineering in Computer Systems (the closest thing to Comp Sci I had available)
* Last job was a year ago as a 'Data Science/Analyst'

**The problem**

* Job prospects in software development absolutely suck in my country. Most companies that offer software developer roles are very small (think less than 50 employees) that outsource you to local banks/companies to work on legacy applications. Aside from the horrible hours and low pay, it feels awful that they make free money by just being useless middle man.
* Economic activity of my country is very centralized in working for banks or the Panama Canal. Very few international companies exist and those that do are here for cost-cutting (think outsourced finance departments, call centers, etc)
* COVID-19 devastated the job market. Most companies stopped hiring and unemployment rates are expected to reach %20 because of the pandemic. Despite the horrible impact to the economy, our government decided to lock down again for 2 weeks (our government is as competent as you can imagine for a third world latin american country).
* I decided to leave my barely related to CS job (Data Analyst) to focus on getting good at programming Jan 2019 (Covid hit 2 months latter).
* My last job experience can be summarized as doing Excel and VBA Macros in a Finance Department where everything was done in Excel.

**My proposed solution**

I don't want to seem like a negative nancy, but things are pretty bad in my country.

So I came up with the following plan:

* Study a Master’s Degree in Canada in Computer Science
* Stay in Canada, since immigration is way friendlier compared to the US.
* Work my way up into a Software Engineering role and take all internship opportunities possible while studying the masters.

My doubts regarding this plan is that a Master’s degree is seen as unnecessary for where I want to be career wise (the most I can imagine myself being is a Software Dev at a FAANG).

Also, it would be a big investment, and I'll burn through my savings and a small inheritance.

COVID has also impacted the global/Canadian job market, if the job market doesn't pick up by the time I'm done with the masters (2 years) all that investment would have being for nothing.

So, what do you think? Is it a crazy idea?
Should I just get a whatever job and get good enough to be a remote dev instead of doing the masters?

Thank you for reading my wall of text.

TLDR: Latin america is trash tier, go get a Masters in Canada or get gud enough to be a remote dev?"

kw0d8k,2,2021-01-12,Switching to CS from a (completely unrelated) science degree: feeling lost and in need of advice,Solistial,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kw0d8k/switching_to_cs_from_a_completely_unrelated/,"Hi everyone,

Obligatory ""I've been a long-time lurker of this sub."" Coming from a health sciences background, it's been very informative to read about the experiences of people actually working in the CS field. I just turned 23, and I'm currently in my final year of a health sciences program. I'm feeling very lost about my career moving forward. It could be some existential crisis now that I'm very near to graduating, or the typical ""grass is greener"" attitude or a combination of many factors, but I feel lots of uncertainty regarding my future these days.

For background: I'm in Canada, always had strong grades in school, and after high school, I went to a big Canadian university for 2 years in undergraduate biology, then 4 years for a health sciences professional degree (the 4th year of which I am currently in now). As I'm getting closer to graduation, I'm feeling less and less enthusiastic for the field I'm graduating in.  For one, the job market is somewhat saturated in the area I live. I don't have a full-time position lined up after I graduate in a few months. Also, this job is stressful, being a healthcare job with lots of liability involved every day. I'm afraid of making mistakes in this job that could harm someone/lead to financial liabilities for me/my family. This job would surely age me prematurely due to the daily stress involved, combined with my already anxious personality type. Further, the pay ceiling is low relative to other professions - having me question if it's all really worth it for the stress involved (the pay is decent, but I will *never* be conventionally ""rich""). Based on internships and part-time work in the field, and speaking with those currently in it, I *do not* want to do this for the rest of my life, at all. Conversely, the more I read about CS, the more appealing it all seems. I am good with people (as healthcare jobs require) but I am naturally an introvert, so I would absolutely love a position where I could work from home (impossible with the field I'm currently in). I am in a remote position temporarily for an internship right now and I love not having to leave the house. It makes me less anxious. A CS job would allow me to do this. Also, I am very meticulous and detail-oriented - traits which are important but not as valued in my current field. I have never had issues with working on various projects for school for hours on end - I tend to really get into the groove and don't mind spending extra time perfecting things to my high personal standard. These traits seem consistent with a career in CS as well.  Moreover, the opportunity for career growth seems substantially better compared to my current healthcare field. In my field, I could probably max out at *just* over $100k annually at the expense of a lot more work and liability in a managerial position. Meanwhile, I regularly hear of all the massively high salaries in CS in this sub and personal finance subs on Reddit - salaries that would be virtually unattainable in my field. I want a comfortable life initially, but I would like to have the option of advancing to a high salary at some point in the future. It isn't so much about the starting salary for me as it is about the *potential for career advancement* \- something I  just can't envision a lot of in my current healthcare field (unless I maybe became a doctor, which I am not up to).

Now that you've heard my rationale: the problems with this. There are many. I am fortunate that my parents paid for my college tuition 100%, so I have no debt. But 2 years in undergrad and 4 years in a professional degree at a big Canadian university are ridiculously expensive (think $8-10k *per term*). We are well off, but not so much so to put me through college twice. I am immensely grateful for their help, and they have made it clear that as far as paying for my tuition goes, the funds are gone (which I fully, completely understand). For this reason, they were understandably very angry at me when I suggested I wanted to switch careers to CS (a field which I think aligns much more closely with my values/ambitions in life, and my personality type and strengths). I would have to pay my own way through college this time around, which would be a lot harder, to say the least. Moreover, I have no CS experience. I've barely done any coding in my entire life, so I cannot say for certain that it's the field for me, just that my values/personality/strengths/life goals *seem to* align very well with a career in the CS field. I have always been decent at math, I have always been very good at writing/languages and creative work, and from what limited experience I have with things like coding/animation/creative digital projects I had in a course in high school (does Top Student in Computer Science 9 count? haha), I believe I would be decent at coding, if I really worked at it. Evidently, this is not a very strong argument to switch careers into CS.

That's the basic scenario. I have a meeting so I will be back shortly to read replies/edit the post for clarity/grammar. Sorry if the post was long - I have a lot of anxiety around my future these days and any advice from experienced people in the field would be much appreciated. I know much of what I said is based on theoreticals and extremely idealistic, so I am open to harsher reality/criticism if any.

TL;DR Dreading going into my current health sciences field after graduation, thinking CS would be a good career choice but many barriers (financial) to switching fields this late - any advice?"

It was completely my fault and I left the company on bad terms, my hiring manager even said that he would have to be honest if they called about me.

\- how was housing paid for (in case it's in-person)? were you expected to use your stipend to pay for it?

\- was the internship group big?? would you say that ucla big is a competitive internship?

\- was the internship confined strictly to genomics? sounds like a dumb question, but i'm wondering if the interests of the other interns were diverse. did they have a general interest in computational biology, or strictly genomics?

\- did you get the faculty mentor you wanted?

Clearly, COVID has decimated that industry and as a result, I scrambled for a few months before finding a job in technical consulting (specifically implementations). I love what I do now and don’t plan on looking back, although I have my eye on some companies that specialize in hospitality consulting and tech. With this in mind, I need to tailor my resume with implementations as the focus but with a hospitality angle.

While in school, I had three different internships and hourly positions. I was lucky in that the first two were hospitality-related and involved implementation work (though it wasn’t the bulk of my work), but I had left both by the time I started senior year for the third, which did not involve anything relevant.

This leaves me with three options:

1) I can leave out the third position, but it will appear as though I had a nine-month gap. Not a good look timeline-wise, but I can focus my resume specifically in implementations and save valuable space.

2) I can leave in the third position, but it could bewilder recruiters as to its relevance.

3) I could leave out all of my work experience other than my current full-time position. I’m unsure if college jobs and internships are relevant post-graduation, and I hesitate to cut these out entirely as the implementations were specifically in hospitality.

kw4wln,58,2021-01-12,How to apply to internships when courses eat away at your time?,The-CAPtainn,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/kw4wln/how_to_apply_to_internships_when_courses_eat_away/,"**TL;DR** I suck at juggling schoolwork with other tasks, so I'm having have trouble applying to positions. Any advice on how to multitask and land a summer internship? 

Hey guys, this post was long overdue for me, because I'm a junior and I spent the last two years not applying to any summer positions because I'm just so occupied with schoolwork. 

So for some background -- I'm a person that gets frustrated pretty easily when having to deal with lots of tasks, and I can't handle a lot of responsibilities at the same time. I've never been able to survive a semester with five classes, and always had to drop something whenever I enrolled in five. This leads to two issues: 

1) I never found the time nor coolheadedness to apply to internships at the same time as my coursework. It would be too stressful and daunting. 

2) Because I could never take the recommended course-load (five classes a semester in CS engineering), I've been having to take classes during every winter session and summer session so far. This means I've been occupied during the breaks too. I'm currently taking a super rigorous three-week course. 

I would really like to apply to some stuff this winter. But considering that I'm taking courses all year long, and I suck with juggling schoolwork + job apps, I don't ever have the window to just sit down and practice my skills and apply to jobs. Any advice on how I can land a summer position with so little time on my hands?"
kw581s,5,2021-01-12,Any Advice?,WishIknew1000,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/kw581s/any_advice/," 

Hey guys,

I am 26 years old and have struggled to pick a career path and carry it forward. My childhood dream was to attend medical school and become a doctor. Decided to pursue a major in biology without a second thought. I did alright in most of the science courses until I reached organic chemistry. I scored very low on the tests and then withdrew from the course in fear of failing. The next semester I retook the course and panicked because I did bad again. Ended up withdrawing from the course a second time.

At that point I figured that I wasn't cut out for medicine, and decided to change my major to computer science because I heard it had great job prospects. After taking a few classes I realized that I did not enjoy CS one bit. So I decided to change my major once more to the next area of interest which was business/finance. During the finance curriculum I developed an interest in entrepreneurship and business. Despite developing an interest in business, I could never get the idea of becoming a doctor out of my mind. As a result I didn't participate in any finance related activities or apply for any internships during my time in college.

Ended up graduating with my bachelor's in finance and a 3.8 GPA from a very average state university. After graduation I began to wait tables and signed up for premed courses again. As soon as I took the chem course I felt extremely anxious/scared, and as a result didn't carry out the course. Afterwards I decided to look for finance jobs, but due to my lack of experience I didn't get any interviews. Since then I have continuously signed up for chemistry, experienced anxiety and decided not to carry through nearly each semester since graduation. This created what seems like an endless cycle of taking the chem course, dropping it, going into the business mindset and then returning to medicine.

I am now three years post-graduation and have nothing to show for it. I continuously go back and forth between medicine and business and feel extremely lost. My indecisiveness has even seeped into other areas of my life and I have an extremely difficult time making simple decisions. Now at 26 years old I've signed up for chemistry once again and it will start in a week. My other pre-reqs will expire if I don't carry on this semester. I have these feelings of anxiety once more and wonder if my potential is best used in business/entrepreneurial ventures. I have had a few entrepreneurial ideas in the past but don't think they are very good/scalable. No matter which path I end up briefly choosing, I always feel regret and worry that I didn't pick the best option for me.

I have been very unhappy and depressed for the last few years of my life. I just want to make a decision and move on with my life, enjoy my twenties and be like everyone else around me. I greatly appreciate any advice that you all have!"
kw5qnb,0,2021-01-12,Is there a future for me in engineering?,Convergent_Series,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/kw5qnb/is_there_a_future_for_me_in_engineering/,"I’m making this post in hope for any encouraging or guiding advice, but if you need to be blunt I welcome that as well.

I’m currently starting my final semester of college as an engineering major. In the last four years I definitely could have been more involved with school than I was, and my grades have suffered because of it. I have a 3.25 gpa and basically no experience at all and am really struggling trying to find an internship or job. I have dealt with some difficult things in my personal life while in college that really got in the way of me being more invested, but I always enjoyed my coursework. 

I’m afraid that due to my lack of involvement I may never find a fruitful career in engineering; and engineering is all I’ve wanted to do. I can’t imagine a career where I’m not helping create engineering systems, but a few have told me I might be better off finding whatever job I can after college. 

The last year or so I’ve been putting my resume out, and have only managed one interview that I thought went well but I just wasn’t the right fit for. Things get more and more discouraging the closer I get to graduation with no plans. 

I would really appreciate any advice, thank you!"

kw63io,8,2021-01-12,Are part-time GIS jobs(not internships) seen as more entry level?,estev90,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/kw63io/are_parttime_gis_jobsnot_internships_seen_as_more/,"I just got an invite to interview for a GIS application position for a city in SoCal this coming Tuesday. Thing is, it’s only a part time job, at 19 hours a week. I’ve really been wanting a full-time but at this point, I’ll accept anything. One concern I have is that the people I’m going to interview with may see me as a bit overqualified considering I have a Masters and a few years experience. The position isn’t listed as entry level or as an internship but I’ve always gotten the sense that these part time positions tend to be for people with less experience. There was a similar part-time position I got turned down last year for and I felt the employers may have wanted someone less experienced, since they would demand less compensation. Any thoughts?"

# Things to note before entering NAFA

**\[1\] What is NAFA and who is it for?**

NAFA, the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts is Singapore's pioneering art school. It is a private arts institution. It provides diploma studies with a study duration of 3 years just like poly. The special thing about NAFA is that it provides 1-year degree programmes which any student (usually from relevant diploma courses) can pick up.

Well, we always say 'art is subjective', it is a freedom of expression. The school is really **open to anyone** (and that is on the account that you have a portfolio or passed the test). Literally, you can have aunties and uncles as your classmates! You also have people doing art because it's fun but in all seriousness do not sign up if that's what you think. I'd like to think of NAFA as a school that guides you in the beginning and later on they just kind of let everyone be independent learners. Anybody can say that NAFA teaches you the foundation but they do not intend to fully teach you long term or up to a professional level. The school is excellent for people who have existing art skills (you've won SYF, art awards, distinction in art before you were even 17 years old) and wish to be a local artist. It is also great for people who are passionate and have some sort of basic skill or are/have developing skills already (that's me!) however this group should avoid Fine Arts. You can also be passionate and start on a blank slate but be prepared to work doubly hard for the grades. The school is **not competitive**, it depends on talent to stand out.

Do not come if you are doing for the sake of the diploma because the **difficulty of NAFA's diploma is no joking matter**. Dropping out is common in every course and you do not wish to contribute to that. That is also the whole point of NAFA charging exorbitant school fees so that you don't run away. Many people actually bet their future on NAFA because they couldn't go to poly/uni course of their choice and it ends up being wasted because it's not what they wanted! You may have heard people of saying that the school's standard is trash but the truth is, it's not the school's problem 100% of the time.

For students looking to enter NAFA Foundation Programme, it's still new and dodgy. I strongly advise you guys to take O levels and head to Poly instead if you still wish to pursue further education at local universities. I personally find no point in skipping a year and getting L1R4&gt;25 with an O level cert where you might've passed math seems to be a more lucrative choice to use for entering NAFA. The only benefit you're getting from the programme is a debt $$$.

*Entry requirements:*

**O Level:** L1R4 equal or less than 25 points excluding English (can use CCA points)

**ITE:** Full-time Higher Nitec or Nitec

[Other Local/International Admission Requirements](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/admission-information/admission-requirements)

*Important note:*

**NAFA diplomas do not equate with polytechnic diplomas.**

**NAFA being the oldest art school does not mean that it is the best place to go instead of Laselle.**

&amp;#x200B;

**\[2\] Available Courses**

One misconception is that NAFA has double diploma programmes for 3D Design. I'd like to announce that it is **false**. The school is not capable of teaching 2 types of diploma at a time but rather mash it up. So if you intend to take my course for example Diploma in Design (Landscape and Architecture), it is usually the 1st word that is mainly taught which is 'Landscape'.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[3\] When and how to apply?**

Once you received your results is usually the time applications are open. Local and international students have until March to apply. It varies annually. More here -&gt;[How to apply](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/admission-information/how-to-apply)

Method of Application: **Online portfolio submission or physical admission test**

Neither is better than the other. You method depends on whether you can show what you have within a given deadline.

&amp;#x200B;

*Online Portfolio Submission*

Minimum 10 images, various mediums allowed and a short writeup of 100 words.

**1.Make the portfolio for the course that you want**

To make them pick you directly for the course, make it look like you are built for the course.

**2. Have a variety of work**

Fine Arts doesn't only consist of drawings, it can also include some sort of sculpture or performance work. Same goes for the other departments. [Click here for what each course requires.](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/admission-information/how-to-apply) If you wish to showcase a single type of work because you are unable to show more, it can make your portfolio look okay/bad compared to other people.

**3. A passionate statement**

Only 100 words. Tbh I wrote what I wished to do after my diploma (plans have since changed and it was an odd statement lol). I don't suggest writing about your contribution to the sch because as long as you're a student you're contributing. Make it short and simple.

&amp;#x200B;

In case anyone is wondering, my application portfolio was mediocre, showing 11 images consisting of sketches/paintings/photos. If you have a god-tier portfolio because you have that artistic talent, there's a good chance to achieve a 1st-year full-coverage scholarship once you step into NAFA. You can submit whenever you want but my estimated deadline was 2 weeks after applying at the open house which waived my application fees ($70 better treat yourself Haidilao).

&amp;#x200B;

*Admission Test* (if someone has taken the test feel free to provide more info)

The test dates are staggered once per month from January-March. Held in groups. Consists of a drawing test and write-up.

I only know that the drawing test isn't difficult. People who took the test do not intend to submit a portfolio as it's quick and efficient. Nothing much to add on.

*Important note:*

If you are writing a **2nd choice** as a safety net please be cautious. I do not recommend as you may get the 2nd choice instead if the slots for your 1st choice becomes full. They will just shift you to the 2nd choice and that's where the 'appeal' part comes.

Choose to submit a portfolio if you can commit to the deadline, it usually gives you an upper hand over admission test applicants because you're showcasing more.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[4\] Application Timeline** (I only know O levels if anyone can kindly tell me I'll update)

*O levels:*

**January**

Receive results &gt; submit JAE &gt;  apply for NAFA

**February**

Wait for JAE AND NAFA results &gt; receive JAE results 1st &gt; receive NAFA results 2nd

You’ll receive NAFA results before poly starts unless you apply late. I applied during Jan on the day of the open house and got my results mid-end Feb. March is the last month to receive results.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[5\] Financial Aid**

[NAFA Financial Aid](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/scholarships-financial-aid-schemes)

Now, we all know private school isn't cheap and many passionate young souls I've met depend heavily on financial aid like I do. If you're a Singaporean with a tight family income, the bursary is attainable for you. It covers half of the annual school fee. Can only be taken once for each year of study. If you are able to claim the bursary for all your years, you’d pay a total of $7050.

For those who are hoping to start at NAFA but is at a really tight end, you need perfect grades in art and portfolio to be considered a scholarship/merit in your first year. You'll need testimonials and pass the interview. If you ain’t good in art, pass this opportunity however you can work for scholarship/merit during your diploma years. I’d score close to the 4.0 (3.8X) in Year 1 in order to get a scholarship to cover my Year 2 fees.

Other options are the 0% interest study loan by DBS. You can make use of your PSEA which you can also use your sibling account to cover your own sch fees.

Last option but not really one is the student assistantship scheme should you already be a student of NAFA. The pay is peanuts, I would not recommend but it's nice to have a one-liner in your resume that you did some work for the school :).

There are NAFA students with a possibly far worse situation than yours but they are extremely talented and hardworking to end up not paying a single cent. NAFA is really expensive so if you do intend to work to cover the fees, take care of your grades as well. It is not impossible to do so. I chose to not work as I was in a hectic design course and needed to maintain my grade for university.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, you would need to understand how the system works.

# During your study

**\[1\] Useful Acronyms**

*SOAD:* School of Art and Design (Department)

*SOAMDT*: School of Arts Management, Dance and Theatre

*SOM:* School of Music

*D&amp;M:* Design and Media

*FA:* Fine Arts

*3DD:* 3D Design

*FS:* Fashion Studies

*FYP:* Final Year Project (used in almost every SOAD course lol)

*OIP:* Overseas Immersion Programme

&amp;#x200B;

**\[2\] Life at NAFA**

So you wish to know how life is like at NAFA? First thing, don't expect the same amount of glitz and glamour that exists in polys. It's much quieter where you won't even hear a mouse die.

Because entry to the school is quite easy, the population regularly consists of graduated ITE students (can’t make it to poly/NAFA is the last golden ticket) alongside many international students. O level cert holders are like a small 10% or less. So if you’re young, prepare to take care of the older lot and expect to carry lazy people.

You have to be very committed to the course and can’t skip class. More than 3 times and they start deducting marks. The workload is heavy and even if it comes in small numbers, it is intense. The number of student to lecturer ratio is not a big difference but later on, consultation times may not suffice. Facilities are sufficient unless you’re in a design course. There are CCAs in the sch but not all courses got time for it. Staying in school late is a common culture. Fine Arts students after class just camp in their respective studios and design students would camp till closing 11 pm at the computer lab waiting for renders to finish. Every student will experience staying late and you can say its #lifeatnafa.

The culture here is not as toxic and dramatic as poly but more towards weird because we’re creative artsy-fartsy people. It’s easy to get along with course mates but there’s a chance for things to get somehow cranky along the way. Could be you or your classmate. Everyone is pretty open and wild. There’s a lack of competitiveness which is both good and bad.

There won't be a course that goes without presentations. That's the point of producing works ain't it, to show it off to the audience. Group work to individual work ratio is about 3:6 so if you worry about bad groupmates, don't worry I've faced them too and it can't be helped ;). Carrying other people during group work is also common. NAFA does stand for lazy people what to do. Your complaints hold no power. (Arguably, many students want the school to make entry to the courses more difficult as there seem to be too many bums to handle)

If you're mentally depressed or anything the school does try to help but no legit support system other than the ECG counsellor (which I find it practically useless). Now, the school deals with this quite often so they don't give a damn about your life. Ownself take care ownself is the usual term.

&amp;#x200B;

*School events anyone can participate:*

Open House (1-day Sentosa fun time with other Open House ambassador)

Orientation (has a 1-night camp! Recommend)

NAFA Fun Day

Overseas Immersion Programme (1-3 weeks long, Asian countries. Recommend but need $)

Student Assistantship Programme (1 year-long contract. Peanut pay)

&amp;#x200B;

The list of programmes here may not seem much but you can add it in your portfolio (except Fun Day).  There may be volunteer work available within some courses itself. Do try to be active

And that's about it. Nothing special just expensive and less fun.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[3\] Understanding NAFA's SOAD Standard**

Take a look at what past graduates have produced within their 3 years as a student. Only you can judge whether the school is great or the right fit for your goals (in being able to attain this particular level of skill for XXX course once you graduate for example). The best standard can be found under the best graduate tab.

[2020 The Grad Expectations](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/thegradexpectations)

[Graduation Showcase](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/showcase/graduation-showcase?itemscount=8&amp;year=2020&amp;graduate=featured)

&amp;#x200B;

**\[4\] General Curriculum**

[Academic Calendar](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/academic-information)

The 1st semester of your study begins at the start of August and usually ends late November or early December depending on the type of assessment received. The 2nd semester begins in January till May. The span of 1 semester is always around 4 months with a 1-week break in between. We don't really have any sort of term 1/2 thing like poly and is much compressed, so breaks are less. However, you do get compensated with a 3-month vacation between years so that's fair.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Applicable to SOAD only

*Year 1*

1st Semester: Foundation Study (not the same as NAFA Foundation programme for N level)

\+ Basic art and design theory

\+General Education

2nd Semester: Course Foundation

\+ General Education

\+ Basic course theory

(+ Electives)

&amp;#x200B;

*Year 2*

1st Semester: 2nd Set of Course Foundation

\+ Intermediate theory

\+ 1st project

\+ Basic report/essay writing

(+ Electives)

2nd Semester: Last set of Course Foundation

\+ Another set of projects

(+ Electives)

&amp;#x200B;

*Year 3*

1st Semester: Internship/~~School project~~ (wouldn't want to get this)

2nd Semester: Final Year project (practically on your own)

\+ Report/Essay writing

\+ Research and development

(+ Electives, not recommended to do during this semester)

&amp;#x200B;

It’s clearly not much different from poly, slightly worse at certain points. **Weekly** **school hours per week will increase each semester** e.g year 1 sem 1 is 18hrs a week for classes, next semester you may get an additional 2-4 hrs increase of class time. The longest time I had for class each week was 24hrs, pretty sure the same goes for any SOAD course. Do expect late-night classes. It is inevitable because most lecturers are teaching part-time so do bear with them.

Important note:

For a lighter schedule, **do electives early** as that's one of the simplest things to do.

The difference in timetable won't affect application to university.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[5\] Electives**

1 common mistake students commit is not reading the student handbook (from studentnet)/contract on the number of credits required for graduation. They end up finishing their electives during Year 3 Semester 2 which is the time one should focus on their FYP. Start doing your electives once you’re in Year 1 Semester 2. Good planning consists of not stuffing your modules until it’s way past 24hrs/week (also known as overloading). You’re required to do cross-disciplinary modules 2-6 credits worth (meaning not related to your course, if you’re from D&amp;M you have to do either FA/3DD/FS) and course-related electives worth 2-6 credits. Days before module registration, plan out the electives you want to do based on your given timetable and then rush to pick on the day of the module registration with no hesitation to secure your placement. You may have to do an elective that is unfamiliar to you.

*My sample plan:*

**Year 1 sem 1:** Can’t choose yet

**Year 1 sem 2**: Photography (Highly recommend, popular as well but must have time and skill + a friend who's free who be your model). 2 credits

**Year 1 sem 2 special term (aka holiday):** OIP to Hangzhou. China Academy of Arts for 3 weeks. Considered cross-disciplinary to FA. 3 weeks long. 4 credits

**Year 2 sem 1:** Intro to Rapid prototyping from 3DD (laser cut/3D print) (didn’t really learn how to use the machine as there are technical officers and I messed up at the end but still passed, great elective for embarrassing yourself if you’re a 3DD student who frequents the workshop ;) ). 2 credits

**Year 2 sem 2 - onwards:** No more electives can focus on FYP

*Important note:*

Plan well so you accumulate just nice **120 credits for graduation**. No point in exceeding the total credits as you have to pay extra for it. If you miss a few credits for graduation, you will be **retained** for another semester to finish.

**Cheat tip:** if you go on the OIP to China only, you instantly get cross-disciplinary credits.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[6\] Using Workshops/Loaning of equipment**

* The 3D workshop at wing B level 1 operates Mon-Fri 8 am to 6 pm but you need permission from the lecturer or Technical officer to use the machinery.
* Laser cutting and 3D printing in the 3D workshop operates from Mon-Fri 10:30-4:30 pm and it is based on a **first sign up first serve basis**. Booking is always done a week prior to the day of actual usage and maximum of 4 people per day (unless you let others share your slot). Every Friday the slate inside the workshop outside the room is wiped clean for students to book for the week ahead. Even if your name is on the booking board and you don't end up cutting, you will get a temporal ban after multiple attempts. Do ask the Technical officer about the laser cutting template as well and follow accordingly when you create the template so as to not cause a problem of cleaning up your drawing which may overtake another timeslot.
* Camera equipment for photography/filming can be loaned from a guy named 'Jack'. Priority goes to courses that require it, followed by the photography elective and so on. Loan lasts for a week and extension can be asked for after loan period.
* Photography Studio/Darkroom use needs to have a form signed, given to 'Jack' and then approved. Literally, find this guy for all your photography needs.
* Fine Art workshop time depends on the course instructor. People from other courses are free to walk in when its empty but usage not possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[7\] Internships**

Usually done in Year 3 Semester 1, this is one of the key semesters every student should complete for it plays a very important role in your portfolio for finding a job post-graduation. The school has a reputable network, however for courses like Fine Art and illustration the intern positions may be limited because Singapore is not very welcoming for such talents. There are top companies who are willing to hire NAFA students on the basis that they have good grades and a juicy portfolio. So if you want the best, you got to be the best.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[8\] Overseas Immersion/School Exchange Programmes**

Slots for OIP is limited (especially the ones to China), requires an interview. I think the max for some trips were 35-40 people at most. There are subsidies available and coverage varies.

&amp;#x200B;

*Places NAFA has flown to:*

\*Xiamen (3 weeks)

\*Hangzhou, China Academy of Arts (3 weeks)

\*Beijing, Beijing Technology University (3 weeks)

Bangkok (1 week?)

Korea (might've stopped)

Japan (might've stopped)

&amp;#x200B;

\*Special programme during Year 1 Semester 2 vacation only

I forgot the cost but I've personally have flown to Hangzhou. Best experience ever despite getting a C. Crazy stuff happened at one of the finest Arts school in China :)

*Important note:*

If you miss the chance to fly, fret not, NAFA's degree programme is a collaboration with a foreign university and they will open an exchange programme for 1 month (that is if COVID doesn't persist). Not sure about the cost though.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[9\] CCA** (The price list is not updated as of 2020)

*List of currently available CCAs:*

1. Muay Thai ( $63 10 sessions)
2. Yoga (basic: $50 12 sessions, intermediate: $42 10 sessions)
3. Entrepreneurship club
4. Urban runners club
5. Volunteer club

Short story: Long ago, I actually joined the photography club only to end up leaving before they even started anything because everybody was too busy to meet up and thus disbanded.

During my time, Muay Thai is the most popular followed by Yoga. Do check out [NAFA OSC](https://www.instagram.com/nafa_osc/) account on IG to find out what they do. Looks like they added Korean language class too hmm

&amp;#x200B;

# Post-Diploma

**\[1\] Furthering Studies at NAFA**

[NAFA Degree courses for Arts Management and Music](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/courses/degree)

**Update (thanks to the comment below):** NAFA is going to change its programmes and collaboration starting from AY2021/2022. The new degree courses are collaborating with UAL (University of Arts, London) and it’s changing from one year course to two-year course which includes 5-7 weeks of going to the colleges in London. **All the courses are affected** except for Arts Management and Music.

Students with A Level certificates, as well as those without relevant diplomas will be allowed to enrol into NAFA’s degree programmes.

**The stuff I wrote may not apply anymore but I will still leave it here as a reference for NAFA's 1-year degree. The degree website is empty for now.**

&amp;#x200B;

How do you determine if taking NAFA degree is worth it and why should you take or not take the NAFA degree? There’s always a mixed bag of opinions over the degree. Personally, I’m not a fan of it but I won’t be biased and input the pros and cons that can better aid in one’s decision.

&amp;#x200B;

*PROS*

**1.Existing CGPA from diploma is Low**

Finding a job with the private diploma cert and low grades can affect your career progression. Make up for the mistakes that were done during the diploma study and try to do well for the degree.

**2. High CGPA, expecting a scholarship (or free ride) for the degree course**

If you easily meet these 3 criteria (1) Singapore's local unis are too expensive for your taste, (2) you might be older than 21 years old and need to work ASAP, (3) ""broke"" but did quite well during your diploma and has an excellent portfolio to show, taking the degree might not be such a bad option. In some instances, the 1-year degree + years of work experience can allow one to take up a master degree at local uni if the pre-requisites are met.

**3. Changing career path (still art-related)**

It's possible to change paths from design to fine arts. However, for a degree that lasts only for 1 year, it is impossible to acquire a decent knowledge at a degree level compared to the diploma stage in my opinion. Usually, the people who apply for the design degree e.g Spatial Design, have prior knowledge from the related course of study either from NAFA or other polys. 1 year is not enough but never said that it’s impossible and has been done over the years.

**4. Increase in starting salary**

Nobody says this when asked why they want to take the degree but I'm sure they want an increase in starting salary. If you have a fear of starting out with low pay and want to bump it up by sacrificing a short amount of time and money, go for it.

&amp;#x200B;

*CONS*

**1.Not a legit degree**

This isn’t a biased answer but an honest one. NAFA's degree is not a professional degree. 1-year won't be enough to acquire a lot of knowledge. There are no internships and full training of Softwares/techniques whatsoever. It's basically aimed at NAFA/poly students who have an existing skillset and internship experience during their diploma studies or international students with similar qualifications. I'm not discouraging anyone who wishes to take the degree because some companies do take in students and if they're lucky, they can work for them after graduation.

**2. Not 100% applicable for postgraduate studies in Singapore**

The local universities may not kindly cater to all NAFA degrees. A number of students after getting a NAFA degree would choose to study overseas to pursue a masters. If getting NAFA's degree is a mean of broadening your studying experience by going overseas, why not? One real-life example that I've heard of works is landscape and architecture diploma + Spatial Design degree + 3 years of work experience at a good company + an excellent portfolio which eventually led this person to enter NUS Masters in Landscape Architecture. Spatial Design has a chance for relevant postgraduate courses although this may not be the same for the other NAFA degrees.

**3. Not worth if you are a Singaporean**

The cost of NAFA's degree is considered affordable for an international student and it was practically built for them. If a Singaporean were to study at local uni for 3/4 years including subsidies + tuition grant for a design degree, it'd still be cheaper than a NAFA degree. Plus an actual degree from the public unis is still considered much valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

If you stand for better higher educational standards after staying there for 3 years, I say work hard and flee.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[2\] Furthering studies at a local university**

It’s not impossible. It was already allowed a million years ago. It just a matter of effort you put during your diploma years. The current standard at NAFA has dwindled where only less than 10 NAFA grads emerge victoriously so don't be surprised knowing that NAFA barely has high flyers, the school doesn't even push for it. Even my juniors don't know my degree existed 1 year ago...

*2 things to note:*

1. NAFA diploma is not allowed entry into many courses that are irrelevant from the diploma unless the GPA is high. The usual entry requirements are GPA 3.5-4.0 also dependent on the 10th percentile, juicy portfolio and testimonial (I didn't need it FYI)
2. Chances are higher for relevant degrees although any degree will definitely have entry requirements to meet. Some degrees require O level pass in elementary/additional math (they say they don't check anymore after 2019 but I don't want to play out my chances). I know of students who were optimistic about their GPA but they did not read the instructions beforehand.

You will be fighting with the best from poly, JC and beyond. Do your best to represent yourself as a student from NAFA and you'll find a way to stand out from the crowd.

***A warning note to future/existing international NAFA students:*** I know most of y’all only started living in Singapore just before the beginning of the diploma. I don’t know whether your international qualifications can equate with O levels so **consider your future plans in Singapore carefully**. My dear international classmates weren’t called up for uni interview (GPA already wasn’t helping, no offence) and the super stringent admission criteria crippled their hopes. Many have remained in NAFA to do the 1-year degree or have returned to their home country. I cannot answer for employment rates. If neither one is the option you want to end up with, do take note.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[3\] Finding Work**

COVID really struck a lot of people hard. I can count the number of my coursemate who is employed with my 10 fingers or less. The full-time employment rate is terrible, believe it or not. The school hides it like the fine print in the student contract. Here in the [Graduate Employment Survey](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/why-nafa/graduate-employment-survey), you can see the ending choices of NAFA graduates.

I really can't tell the success rate of one finding a job even based on IG stories itself. I see quite a number of freelancer or people doing other things. Who will remain in the same industry? The top 10% in the cohort but even the best have struggled or are still struggling to find a job. NAFA students are not only fighting among themselves, there are poly students with similarly named courses out there too with a proper educational lineup that a NAFA diploma can't compare with.

A portfolio is usually the passport for finding work and the past 3 years of study is meant to fill it up. Don't waste time being a stubborn student especially when you will be spending a lot of money to study. The best way to make yourself look hire-able is to definitely have good grades and a portfolio. Can't emphasise anything else other than that to convince the company to hire you.

&amp;#x200B;

# Wrapping it up

NAFA is one of the schools that provides a unique and alternative route away from the usual poly lifestyle. I had some crazy times in there be it social life or workload. It isn't a bad school (I quote 5/10) but if you can work for what you love, you'll do just fine.

The Open House is open and I suggest for those interested to take a look. A whole bunch of admission guides are up for talks.

This upcoming Thursday I will be interviewing for an End Point detection internship. I am currently in pursuit of a B.S. in Cybersecurity and I need an internship in order to graduate.

I feel like my school hasn't exactly equipped me very well for a job in Cybersecurity so I'm a little nervous as I feel unprepared. The internship is within the company that I work for (currently doing application support), so I've already had the chance to meet with the head of the dept and shadow what they do for a few days during my day job (my boss has been very supportive).

I was wondering if you kind folk had any tips or advice to help me prepare for the interview.

Thanks so much in advance"
kw740g,1,2021-01-12,"A long tirade about what a new grad should pursue, startup or big company, and ultimately about listening to the advice of this subreddit as a whole.",Joecasta,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kw740g/a_long_tirade_about_what_a_new_grad_should_pursue/,"I was going to write a comment in response to the top upvoted comment of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kvukr9/im_getting_turned_off_from_working_at_a_big_tech/), but I had too much to write to ultimately express my thoughts that I rather just write this in a post. For context, I am biased bc I work at a startup, but I have worked at a big company before, albeit only an internship. I have a CS degree and I have about 1.5 yoe, so please take what I say with a grain of salt.  


**On one of the most important reasons to consider working at a startup that isn't talked about enough:**  
At a big company, you are taught how to follow the right way of doing things, engineering orgs have tons of docs on how to do it the right way, some companies make you do months of training before even touching code or even meeting your team), and if you are even a slow learner, anyone can be taught how to follow the right procedure, the right stack to use, the right X to do. What you have as an opportunity at a startup is to learn how to dig yourself out the hole by yourself. When we have a technical problem, we don't have the foremost expert on how to do X who I can just hand it off to and never think about that problem again. Rather, you get a real opportunity to push yourself mentally to overcome a technical problem when there's actual pressure of the company collapsing if these things are not solved in 2 months. If some bug happens in your team at Google as an L3, don't worry, a senior or someone else will 100% know how to resolve it 99% of the time, because someone there probably created the language that you're having issues in. This experience of overcoming very large technical problems by yourself, or with two other people who don't know what the hell to do is something you'll never get to experience much of in a big corporation, and I DO NOT mean something like ""Right now our response time is at 5 seconds, we need to be at 3 seconds because that would be really nice to have"", and then you add a bullet point on your resume saying you saved $5 million dollars because of a 10% improvement in some pipeline that already makes hundreds of millions a day, I mean more along the lines of there doesn't even exist a system in place for anything, we don't have a devops guy, we have one guy who is kind of familiar in building an infrastructure, and if we don't build this our company is out of runway in 3 months. Ultimately, in these high pressure situations, a lot of creative, interesting, and unique solutions that, yes, may cut corners, are discovered in those moments, and learning from moments like that will **help you in the long run of your career** **in my belief**. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Now, a direct counter argument would say, ""Well, if you're a new grad wouldn't it be better to have the steps on the ladder to get you out of there? Isn't it possible that you can be guided by a senior how to solve a problem but not be told all the steps?"" Yes, that is all possible, but I really think that **if this is a serious, mission critical problem** that the whole company depends on in a massive multibillion dollar company, it will absolutely be unacceptable for a junior to be stuck on the problem for a month because they're just trying to figure shit out. Rather, someone from the top needs to step in and get the right people working on it to get it taken care of ASAP. As an analogy, let's say you're playing chess. You're going to learn a lot by playing difficult opponents by yourself and reading about strategy, and iteratively improving, no help allowed. Whereas, if each chess match is a multibillion dollar bet on who wins, and on your side you have organizations of people there to help you that includes the worlds best chess players, many top talented chess players who have been playing for decades. They discuss all the options, arbitrate, and decide on the right moves every damn time, and this team of people is gonna win 99% of the time. Your hand will be moved for you if you don't figure it out in enough time. No way in hell is a junior going to handle an error that breaks the Amazon checkout process by himself for a month. At a startup, it is much much closer to playing chess by yourself, and I think as you get more experienced in your career, when you one day may be a director of engineering or principal, you will have moments to look back on where you were alone and the company was out of runway in 2 months and you figured it out. You will not be afraid of taking on that challenge again at this billion dollar company, because you've felt it all before. The feeling of saving your company through the work that you did alone is a personal accomplishment that no one can take from you. It is a moment you will remember for your whole career, even if the company ultimately failed, it was one hell of an experience. Rant 1 done.  


**On basing too many of your beliefs of the industry through this subreddit:**

Whether or not this is worth the tradeoff of job security, etc. etc. is honestly subjective and other times objective for example if you're an intl student and you have to work at company that provides visa sponsorship, a big company is going to help you secure that much better. What also needs to be said in this subreddit, is something that has been repeated over and over again, which is that you should not define your expectations of the industry **or your own damn career** through the lens of a **SUBREDDIT**. Please form your own damn opinions through your own experiences. Don't rely on someone saying what a FAANG is like to believe that that is what is actually going to be like (you can get some idea but its never going to be identical to your own experience), don't rely on someone saying startups are bad or amazing when that's what's being written by some random individual who you have no idea is legit or not. This subreddit is full of generalized bullshit about literally everything, where people say blah about blah, and don't believe this guy for that. If there's anything I've learned about being on this emotional rollercoaster of a subreddit for 5 years, its that there is some meaningful advice that you should carefully consider, and a lot of shit advice on how to go about pursuing your career. Go out there and do your best to try and experience it yourself (if you have the luxury to, that is) before saying 'oh all X is bad, Y is better'. I honestly hope you have disagreements with what I say, because that's you taking your own experience and realizing that this particular advice just doesn't work for you and **THATS OKAY**. Rant 2 done."

I am a junior majoring in Computer Science and I plan to do a master's in Computer Science as well.

Civil Engineering) using big data in their research.

**So basically my question is, considering that I have endeavors to do a master's in Computer Science, will me participating in a research experience relating to big data with a professor in a different department than CS be worth it?** An example of this is ""Analyzing social media data to understand public communication"" which is from a professor in the College of communication and information sciences but implements data analyses in python thus calling for a CS major.

kw9ycn,4,2021-01-13,Asking To Update My College Essay After Being Deferred.,robo_panda_x,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kw9ycn/asking_to_update_my_college_essay_after_being/,"Okay. I know. I know. It is not something that happens really, and I am likely not going to be able to, but it is worth a try.

I applied to Columbia ED and got deferred some time ago. After talking with a lot of people, it seems like a general consensus that my essays were what got be deferred. I agree. I am a faculty kid, employee, and intern there, and along with an average GPA, slightly above average SAT, and stellar (double spike) ECs, so I am 90% sure the majority of the deferral came from my essays.

I've already accepted that I fucked up, and have moved on to applying to multiple other schools, but I really want to go to Columbia. I could talk all day about all the emotional and personal reasons why I love it there and have always dreamed of going there. In addition, I would have tuition exemption as well, which would save me from debt.

The problem is that my essays were really really really bad. Since I had no tutoring and no experience, I just answered the questions based on what I thought the questions were asking as well, sometimes not really answering the prompt. They were well-polished but showed very little about me outside of being a typical STEM kid, but also painted me quite negatively due to some terrible things I included. This likely came across very negatively and is probably a huge factor in the deferral.

It just really pains me. Knowing that I will be rejected if they read my essay again for regular decision. It's \*\*THAT\*\* BAD. It's like making the same mistake all over again. So being able to submit an updated essay/supps will literally determine whether I can go to my dream school or not.

How should I write the letter, asking to allow me to resubmit new answers? I don't want to sound like I am begging, but I think I need to somehow express the importance of being able to change it. I know they will likely say no, and I should focus instead on building a stellar LOCI, but I think its still worth a hard try -just in case.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good afternoon,

I hope you are well.

I was wondering if it would be possible to reupload an updated common app essay and supplemental questions, as the previous one I submitted does not represent my application accurately. The previous submission had a number of personal stories I gravely regret sharing, and would really like to replace them with alternative ones. I am so sorry for the inconvenience, but being able to change those essays would mean a great deal.

Thank you so much,

I'm currently starting the second semester of my junior year in my undergrad right now, and I've been thinking of applying next year to the HBS 2+2 program among other deferred programs. Seeing as how I have a year from now till when I apply, I was hoping to see if I could get any suggestions to see what I need to work on to really beef up my application.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

* Top 25 University for CS, Major: Computer Science, Minor: Statistics
* *Work Experience*:

   * Another 3-month software development internship at different small startup
   * Currently doing a part-time job providing ACT/SAT tutoring for high school students
   * Will be working at a Fortune \~60ish company as a software development intern during Summer 2021
* *Extracurriculars*:
   * Free Python programming tutoring for underprivileged high schools students in the greater Chicagoland area
   * Currently a project lead in my university's consulting group, will be applying for board positions this semester
   * Member of my university's ACM chapter, will also be looking to apply for an Officer position here this semester
* *Race/Nationality*: Indian/American
* *Sex*: M

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

* *GMAT Score*: scored 700 (45Q/41V) on my first practice test with no preparation , my goal is to get a 750+ on the official exam

kwack6,19,2021-01-13,"Feeling depressed, anxious, hopeless",vivalaziams,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/kwack6/feeling_depressed_anxious_hopeless/,"Hello everyone. As open as I am with my friends, and often times strangers, I never expected myself to make a deep attempt to share my story in hopes to seek help/guidance. I am a 23-year-old native New Yorker born to South-Asian parents. I’m currently attending a graduate program at NYU and applied to Psy.D doctorate programs in clinical psychology for the Fall 2021 semester. It has been my dream to become a clinical psychologist ever since I became interested in human behavior at the age of 14. Growing up, my mother was rarely in my life because she worked full-time in finance. My brother is 9 years older than me and followed my family’s stringent expectations to become a doctor, so we never had the chance to form our own close relationship. For most of my life, my father worked part-time delivery jobs at Pizza joints such as Dominoes to make ends meet. We aren’t in the best financial situation, especially since my mother was fired in September and we have heaping bills for my grandmother and father’s health care. I feel that all of the financial burdens we have faced throughout our lifetime significantly impacted my mother’s ability to provide me with emotional support, but it does not excuse the traumatic things she has done to me.

Since middle school, my mother has made routine attempts to isolate me from any friends I make or romantic relationships I pursue. She thought my middle school best friends were “bad influences” primarily because we liked to speak on the phone at night for a few hours after doing homework. She would often call them and threaten to go to their houses and speak with their parents, and after a few years, I ended up losing all of them. I dealt with a lot of bullying for my physical appearance and generally found it difficult to make friends, which is why I would get so happy if I was lucky to make any. My mother moved my entire family to an entirely different town when I was 13, without discussing beforehand how I would feel. Moving from a very diverse town to a primarily White town was certainly a culture shock, but I found ways to adapt. In 9th grade, I met my current best friend who has basically been my lifeline through all of the physical and emotional abuse I’ve endured throughout our friendship. I loved to go down the block to her house during the summer to hang out, but if I stayed past 10pm, my mother would show up to her house and yell at her and her parents. Anytime we went to eat, to the mall, to the movies, I would be harassed with dozens of calls every 20-30 minutes. Her primary reasons to hate on my best friend is that she dyes her hair (and is therefore a bad influence), an art major, and her sister pursues romantic relationships. (She has stalked them on Facebook and other social media to keep track of what they do). My best friend is the only positive person in my life, who has protected me when our friendships with others fell apart in high school, or when boyfriends hurt me, and cheered me on when I graduated and got accepted to NYU. Our primary activities of enjoyment involve going to concerts or going on nearby adventures together to beaches or parks, but my mom has made every possible attempt to break our friendship.

This behavior has continued in college, to where she would look up all of my friends in Facebook and scream at me for befriending people who pursue relationships and post about them. She harshly criticizes what I wear (I wear absolutely nothing inappropriate) and calls me names for wanting to wear makeup which adds to my already-present body insecurities. She has frequently thrown out clothes I would spend money on just because she doesn’t like them, always goes through my phone call log (because I am on the family plan), tries to read my text messages, get access to my photos, has my dad track the miles when I go for a drive and yells at me if I make detours to get food, goes through my receipts to see what I buy myself, and yells at me if I FaceTime anyone in the house.

Recently, I began to pursue a relationship with someone who is Hispanic and she found out through my call log and has been EXTREMELY openly racist towards him with me and also by calling him. She paid for a service to look up his entire family’s information including names, addresses, social media, and called him essentially threatening him not to speak to me and not to tell me what she did. When I found out, I called her out and she claimed it to be a lie even though I saw the screenshots of their information in her phone. She went through my Apple Watch and saw photos of us hanging out with my friend, and also read every page of my mental health journal (I wrote 85 pages). She frequently yells at me for going in the car to do my therapy appointments (which I just started because she is insane), and spends everyday finding something to hurt me with.

I have done absolutely nothing wrong to deserve this harsh treatment and work immensely hard in school so I can get the top career in my field and move out and never look back. I am a straight-A student, spend hours reading, writing, and even started a mental health Instagram blog to help give others advice. I recently began a new journal to log healthy habits- where I keep track of my exercise, eating habits, sleeping habits, and finances, because I feel like everything I do is wrong and I am essentially a failure. My mother never expressed pride in me and often told me that I was a disappointment for picking NYU over Columbia, and also that I will never make money going into psychology. She frequently compares me to my brother, yet lets him do whatever he wants, especially since he works in Texas. She makes routine attempts to get information of the people I talk to, to make sure I’m “telling the truth”, and always asks for my schedule during school. I feel absolutely TRAPPED and horrified every minute that I spend with her.

I got offered a single studio apartment through NYU housing and my mother threatened to disown me if I take it, and keeps telling me that I will get covid. I tried my best to explain that I want to do it for my mental health because I am balancing 4 classes, an internship, study prep for this counselor exam I have to take in April, and prep for potential Psy.D interviews. She claims that I am lying and I will invite my best friend or guys over, even though I told her the policy is no guests allowed because of COVID. She basically sees me as someone who will accidentally get pregnant and drop out of school, someone who sleeps around with the first person that is nice to me, and someone who is easily manipulated, yet I work so hard to prove that I am much smarter than she thinks. She makes little remarks that I can’t even cook or clean, yet it is her fault I barely do much because she screams at me if I ever step foot in the kitchen or try to clean things. She even forbid me from sleeping downstairs because “it gives me room to FaceTime at night” but I moved down here regardless. I want to take the next step to move into NYU housing on January 24, and my brother told me to do it and that he’s willing to fly to New York to help me move, but I genuinely feel scared for my life to leave because she will come after me. I just wanted some advice if anyone has been in a similar situation. I also just don’t know if I can financially afford this since I’ve been unemployed since March and don’t have enough saved up. (Housing is $11.8k, I have $8k with checking and savings combined). I feel so helpless, scared, and depressed...."
kwagge,3,2021-01-13,[CA] Possibly tricked into accepting a job position at a company I’ve worked with for years and it doesn’t seem like I can backtrack,newgal914,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/kwagge/ca_possibly_tricked_into_accepting_a_job_position/,"Possibly tricked into accepting a job position I didn’t want want. Does anyone have any advice?

Warning: this is pretty long, but I’d appreciate any advice 

I’ve been with the company I currently worked for many years as an intern of sorts until I graduated from a university and  I’m now working there full time. At first, I was somewhat of an assistant helping wherever necessary. 

About a month in, I’m asked if I am I interested in getting training to cover an employee that received FMLA for 3 months (until October). I was told by many employees that it was a great opportunity for me and that I should go for it. So I did. 

I trained for the position and did relatively ok once I started, but it was a very demanding that had me working 10-12 hours a day, 5 days a week. I was also bringing a lot of work home and staying up late to keep up with it. I can get very obsessed with getting things done regardless of how long it takes me which only made it worse. It was to the point I was considering quitting. 

After 3 months, the person comes back. And I’m given my dream position in the companies online sales department department which is related to my field of study. 

However, flash forward to the holidays and the person I had covered unexpectedly quits without any notice on a major holiday where most people weren’t in the office. They didn’t give a two weeks notice or anything so you can imagine how chaotic the sudden change was to a department run by two people.

Since I’m the person at the company, I was asked to cover the position and help until they could find someone new and I had trained them in what I knew. This also meant my current tasks and projects with my position in the online sales dept was paused until then as well. 

This position was offered to the person already working there with a decent raise, although not enough to justify the huge workload it entails. That person was also asked if they knew if I was interested which of course knew I was not. 

Which brings me to today, I was working when I was asked for a quick meeting with my boss. We had heard that we had an outstanding potential employee coming in a few days, so I thought it was regarding their training and next course of action. 

I was told that they were very thankful that I was helping and they would appreciate if I could stay and help them until that department was bringing in more money. I was also told they had spoken to one of my supervisors from online sales was also in on the plan and that I was always welcome and that I would also still be able to work there if I had the time. I was also offered a small raise for this. He also stated I would be given a review again in 3 months time. With an estimated 6 months helping out. This was all very casual. 

In a moment of idiocy, I believed that I would be assisting both the employee and the other person working until the person was able to get a grip on the job and they improved financial. So I accepted. 

Later on, I’m being told by HR that they were informed by boss that I had accepted the job and I was very happy and even happier with my raise. I had known I wasn’t interested in going to that position because to be quite frank, it gave me a lot of anxiety and stress when I was last doing it. Had I known that was the intent behind that meeting I would have never accepted  the position regardless of what raise they were offering. 

Now, I just feel trick and manipulated  by a company that I have trusted for a long time. I don’t feel like talking to my boss about the big understanding will make a difference because I’ll come out looking like an idiot for not having asked. 

I don’t know what to do.

TLDR : I was tricked into accepting a previous job position and it seems like there’s no way of backtracking."

During recruiting season this fall, it felt like my whole life revolved around getting better at CS to get an internship offer, just to prove my CS ability.  I felt so overwhelmed with class work and interview prep that I never really did anything fun. I was fortunate enough to receive and accept an offer, but even since then I can't get out of the mindset of always doing CS related things to prove myself, even over winter break. When I have free time, my first thought is to prepare for classes or work on a side project just to make my resume look better because that's all I'm used to, instead of relaxing or doing something fun.

I also constantly find myself comparing myself to others, and end up feeling bad about myself if someone has more experience or a better offer. I check LinkedIn and this subreddit all the time because it has become habit at this point, but that just continues the cycle. I think this lifestyle might work for some people, but I don't want CS to be my entire life. I find it fun and I think it is a suitable career for me, but I don't want to become too wrapped up in CS for my own good.  (Just to be clear I enjoy CS, but it's important to me to keep my school/career separate from other aspects of my life. I would like to get a CS job in the future, but I don't wanna spend too much time outside of school or work focused on CS.) I guess I'm just having a hard time separating CS from everything else and I know I need to make some changes.

I also wanted to post this here because in my own opinion, I think sometimes people can get too caught up in getting the best grades, best internship, or best job and push away other important aspects of life, including myself. Especially with online classes, I think its even easier to keep grinding away and miss out on life. I find myself doing this a lot, and I need to be reminded that there is more to life than CS and internships, so if you're reading this, it's a reminder for you too :)

If anyone is feeling this way or has advice on how to get out of this position, I would greatly appreciate it!

tldr:  too focused on becoming better at CS just to prove myself to others, want to go back to a more balanced, less CS focused life, need some advice"

My family and I have been working very hard to immigrate to America all my life, but I'm getting more and more disillusioned. There's a whole story (and it's incredibly depressing), but the Tl;dr version: employment-based immigration to America is getting increasingly difficult especially with the newly approved rules, and no Biden most probably won't fix it.

To be honest, I haven't had a chance to visit Germany yet, but I have been thinking about immigrating there for a while. I will also admit that \*my goal is to eventually stay\*, not to live in Germany for a few years before going back to my home country (because I fucking hate it there). I have been rather hopeful given Germany's tech industry, as well as its current immigration policies. However, I'm aware that Merkel is leaving office this year. In that case, I wonder whether it will still be possible for me to work in Germany, and to one day get permanent residency.

One thing I'm interested to understand is how you actually deliver your work, for example if you're working on a smaller part of a bigger project, how do you add your contribution, my first thought is version control/Git? 
If that's the case how does one keep up with other changes if everyone is making changes in code elsewhere

Would the average employee also be working in Jupyter Notebooks, or is it more common to use something like Spyder?

Last question, is how does a model actually get used? For instance if I code some model that does what I need it to, how does this fit into the bigger picture in terms of implementation into the end product? Maybe an example would be something like a reccomendation system for an online store, even if the code is there, I most probably don't have all the knowledge to put into production in a web application, how does this work?

There's a lot here, just because I've rarely considered what happens in the real world beyond the notebook, and I'm aware this is likely to vary widely from firm to firm, but any insight is appreciated."

Here is the short version of my profile:

\-Harvard College - AB in Economics (3.6 GPA)-GRE: 169Q, 170V, 5.0 AWA

\-Have taken 4 semesters of Computer Science classes at NYU since graduation (in 2012-2013 and again in 2020-2021) to fulfill CS and Math pre-reqs to apply for a graduate degree, nearly 4.0 GPA there (1 A-, otherwise A in everything)

\-Programmed full time at startups from 2012-2014, including implementing ML and text mining algos for recommending similar artists and surfacing trending songs (they were music applications)

\-Completed MOOCs: MicroMasters in Artificial Intelligence (Columbia, edX, 4 courses), Fundamentals of Neuroscience XSeries (Harvard, edX, 3 courses), others in Reinforcement Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Data Structures, C++ Fundamentals, Math for ML, etc.

I've applied to 8 MS or ME programs for Fall 2021, and fortunately have been admitted to one while still waiting on the rest.  This brings me to my questions:

1. What is the best way to try to gain entrance into the ML and NLP fields with some work experience?  I would like to get some sort of internship or other lab opportunity for Summer 2021 to begin building my resume in the field.  I am located in New York, should I reach out to all the University NLP labs in the area and offer to volunteer?  Should I focus on industry or startup opportunities?  Are there any great websites or lists for this?  I'm not sure where to look to get started, could really use some help here.
2. Is it possible for me to catch up to the point of being able to apply for a PhD by the end of my Master's degree?  I feel very behind the 8 ball here, and I'm wondering if it's at all realistic to think that 12-18 months I'll have a CV and LOR's that could get me into a PhD program.  If so, I definitely want to pursue it, but if it seems unrealistic at this point, and makes more sense to focus on getting some work experience first, then I'd like to just turn my attention fully in that direction.

Thanks everyone, this sub has been extremely helpful in the process and I really appreciate you all!

UPDATE: just want to mention that I'm not limiting my interest to Top 20 PhD programs.  I fortunately have a strong name on my undergrad degree and really just want the chance to do research and take that deep dive, even if it's not at one of the most highly ranked CS programs."
kwifed,131,2021-01-13,[JC] All about Millennia Institute,irawantsfood,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kwifed/jc_all_about_millennia_institute/,"hii I know I'm slightly late to the party but I just wanted to share about my experience in Millennia Institute (MI) for those still unsure about the school or just simply want to know more about us. I've been in your shoes before and I know the feelings of uncertainty, excitement and even despair, so I'll try my best to calm your fears and share everything I know to help you just that little bit if you're still considering MI as an option, whether as an alternative option to a JC or a polytechnic course :)

For those who don't know about MI, we are a centralised institute offering a 3-year A Level course instead of a conventional 2-year programme that you see in JCs. We also offer a Commerce stream along with the Arts and Science streams, with us being the only A Level program offering Management of Business (MOB) and Principles of Accounting (PAA) as A-Level subjects :)) we use L1R4 to admit students, instead of L1R5 used by conventional JCs, as well as offer conditional admissions to those who were unable to pass their English and Mathematics at the O Levels.

Here's my self-introduction 👻 I'm currently a year 2 student in the Commerce stream taking Management of Business, Math, Literature and Economics (kinda a bit of a Commerce-Arts stream hybrid there). I've been actively involved in school events and proceedings having been a class chairperson for my Year 1, and will be an OGL for this year's orientation 🥳 (if you get me as an OGL I promise I'm a nice person)

First up, why I chose MI. I have to say that I'm definitely part of that rare few that chose to come to MI even though I was eligible for other JCs as well as polytechnic courses, but I sure do have a reason for it !! the 3 year course was a major attraction for me even though it might seem super counterintuitive, especially for a male who still needs to serve his national service, but I have absolutely no regrets at all. The additional year might seem undesirable by many as they may feel like they are ""wasting a year"". However, I really think the additional year has been especially helpful for me as it really spreads the rigorous A Level syllabus out manageably for me to fully grasp concepts and all the content taught by the tutors. I've heard from my friends in the science stream that it has been ideal in helping them lay down their foundation for the intense science subjects, and those in the arts stream (aka sorta me) can fully understand each topic/chapter in depth before moving on, for example. The slower pace gives students like me more time to process everything being taught and not rush it just to meet syllabus deadlines :)

That's why here at MI, we have little to no pre-requisites for our subjects - even students who had taken combined sciences and/or did not take A-Math at the O Levels but want to take the respective subjects at the H2 level can do so with the respective bridging programs offered !! For those taking Arts subjects like Literature and Geography, there is also no requirement to have taken it at O Levels, and most people qualify to take the subject - for example, to take Literature at the H2 Level, you only had to score a B4 and above for your English at the O Levels :) Together with the much slower and manageable pace to build up a foundation and unto it, a strong content tower is not too far from reach !!

Another reason why I chose MI was to take up one of the 2 exclusive subjects offered only by MI at the A Levels - in my case, Management of Business (MOB), with the other subject being Principles of Accounting (PAA). I've always had wanted to study business-related content and activities, having been interested in the social and corporate world since young, although not so much to consider it as a polytechnic or university course. Taking MOB as a subject helped me learnt so much about the business environment in the world right now, which has become extremely important even as society continues to advance and grow, all without the commitment of a specific course at a polytechnic. And yes, it may be to your surprise, but I have friends who take business courses at university, and much of the content is actually rather similar albeit from a few concepts in which they take it much further than we do. That's a given for sure, but still, that goes to show that it's no slack in the subject, and it has certainly been an enjoyable one for me with dedicated teachers, carefully crafted syllabuses and teaching schedules. For those who are considering business courses in polytechnic, the MOB course here at MI is definitely a strong alternative, soo do take that into consideration :)

That brings me very nicely unto addressing the next big concern - our subject tutors. A major worry of many out there would be the opinion of MI tutors being ""too slack"" or ""disinterested and boring"". That is certainly a valid concern especially with A Levels having such a gigantic stake in our academic lives, however, from my personal unbiased experience, I can say for sure that **most** tutors in MI are dedicated and are willing to guide you along to make sure you don't fall behind.

The general consensus that I've heard going around is that MI is a school for ""JC rejects"" and ""A Level beggars"". I have to say that is mostly not true, and amidst all the negativity, there are actually a lot of positives coming out of our school haha. Like mentioned above, the lack of pre-requisites for many subjects and the extended 3-year program means that students are a lot more guided than they would be in a conventional JC, where independence is promoted immediately when one enters the school. The rigour of the A-Levels is certainly daunting, to say the least, but the teachers here are more inclined to guide students and navigate them unto the right path by focusing a lot on fundamentals and foundations before moving on.

That's not to say that it'll be as guided as in secondary school, but it will certainly be not too much of a contrasting difference to throw you straight into the deep end. Think of it as a toddler learning how to walk, first slowly with the guidance of a walker, then a parent, and finally on their own. As such, MI would be perfect for those who might need a little bit of push and support on the content side of subjects and establishing foundations, before taking the wheel by themselves as they gain confidence in the respective subjects. All of the tutors I'd gotten last year in Year 1 have been extremely supportive of me, and have been constantly open for consultations, as well as being there to push and guide me along when I fall behind. My math tutor has been a particular highlight, consistently looking out for me and my classmates, and even asked me for a coffee chat once when he saw me looking rather troubled over one of my results on a test, where I performed way below expectations. He was also the person that re-established the love and interest of math back in me having lost most of it struggling with A-Math back at the O Levels, and many other subject tutors have done the same too, reminding me time and time again why I enjoy the subject so so much. With their guidance and support, it has made my academic journey a lot more enjoyable and manageable, and with their fun personalities, have been awesome people to approach even for the simplest of bits of advice.

As for the culture in our school, toxicity and the ability to make friends will actually be extremely subjective on who you really know and get as your classmates. Speaking from my personal experience, I've had made amazing friends and classmates even though I was the only one from my school that came into MI, and I'm sure it is the case for many other Millennians as well :)) there is definitely no guarantee or pre-established levels of ""toxicity"" for every school, and the MI community definitely isn't more toxic or anything like that, by measure. Again, toxicity is bound to occur everywhere - it is up to the individual to find the right company and friends, which I'm sure you'll be able to find here in MI :)

Lastly, for those still unsure about MI even after everything I've mentioned, I can't leave without talking about the strength of our holistic programmes in school !! We have frequent Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes for students to discover more about possible future professions, as well as many leadership experience programmes and opportunities for students to discover the passion to serve those around them :) some things more exclusive to us would be the [MI.World](https://MI.World) programme that takes students around the globe to locations such as Germany, France, India, China, all but to name a few, to learn more about the ever-changing world around them and discover various cultures that they would not experience on a daily basis. The Amethyst Talent Programme (ATP) is also exclusive to us, where we offer students who perform well the opportunity to participate in scholarship talks, receive internship opportunities and many more :)

That has been one **long** writeup of my experience, but I'm glad I've managed to pen most of my thoughts down - well at least anything and everything that has come to my mind while writing this. My inbox is always open for anyone still wanting to clarify anything or still have any pre-existing questions or worries that have not been answered in this post, so don't be afraid to drop me a message :)) all the best in whatever you choose to do, and for those of you who have chosen MI as one of your choices, I hope to see you at Orientation ;) ✌🏻

If I had to choose, I think I'd be most interested in Security &amp; Pentesting, and Software Architecture. But I don't know.

What can I do from here to find something I'd be more interested in and what I can do to test those waters?

kwl122,2,2021-01-13,Would it be monumentally dumb to delay joining the pension for homeownership?,timhortonsbitchass,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/kwl122/would_it_be_monumentally_dumb_to_delay_joining/,"Hi everyone,

I'm at a crossroads, where I can basically pick between pension and homeownership. I'm not sure which to pick.

I live in Ottawa, where housing prices are basically in clown town. [The average for all homes was 20% up YOY, and unlike Toronto and Vancouver, even condos are having double-digit increases here (15%).](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-home-prices-will-continue-to-skyrocket-in-2021-royal-lepage-1.5230718) I'm getting nervous about being priced out of the place where I have a good, stable job that I love, and one with good benefits/vacation/pension. I know how rare those can be.

I earn about $70k and I'll have a $100k down payment. From my calculations, this means I can afford a condo townhome or stacked condo in the $350k-$500k region. Closer to $500k would be squeaking it, but I'm ok with being temporarily ""house poor"", because in 1.5 years our household income will double; my husband will graduate from his comp sci program and will go from earning sporadic intern wages to a $50k-$65k. I would normally just wait the 1.5 years, but with projected figures, by then then the $450k townhouse will cost $600k or more (20% rise x 1.5yrs). Also: we probably won't qualify for any more mortgage in 2 years, because my husband will almost certainly be a contract worker. So it feels like we should just jump in now. Homeownership is really important to me, on a personal level; I've always bristled at having a landlord. I have an appointment with a mortgage broker later this month to find out the exact numbers.

Now, for the complication... As of this month, I'm eligible to join the defined-benefit pension plan at work. But my contributions would be $450 per month. That's STEEP, and I think it would kill the homeownership dream until my partner graduates. Would it be totally insane to put off joining the pension for 1.5 years until our cash flow increases, so that we can buy a home? The way I see it, the pension will always be there waiting for me to join, but the housing market in Ottawa won't be."
kwlmqr,0,2021-01-13,Microsoft interview coming up and already accepted a summer offer at a fintech company. Can I indicate interest in a fall 2021 SWE internship?,Temporary-Analysis14,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kwlmqr/microsoft_interview_coming_up_and_already/,"I accepted an offer for a fintech company because their deadline was the first week of January. Yesterday I received an interview invite from Microsoft. 

Obviously I shouldn’t get ahead of myself, but while scheduling for an interview time I have to fill out a form that asks if I have any offer deadlines with other companies and what is my “desired duration and term(s). E.g. 3/6 months, Summer, Winter, Etc.”

Are there Fall 2021 Microsoft internships and if so can I ask for that or are they strictly looking for Summer 2021 interns right now? Also, should I say that I accepted an internship offer for the summer or say I have a competing offer? 

Regardless, I’m getting ahead of myself since it’s only an interview invite but if possible I would like to put on my form that I am looking for a 3/6 months winter internship. Or would it be better to put myself down for a summer 2021 position since that is what I originally applied for?

More context about me, I'm a CS sophomore with no prior internship experience.

I already posted this on r/cscareers but hoping to get further insight."

However, I've recently got a really quick reply to an application to a startup asking for an interview this week, and I'm questioning whether I tell them that I couldn't start for 5/6 months (or just don't bring it up), since I could join earlier, as the internship contract allows me to give one week's notice, but it's a pretty good role/company and I feel like it would be beneficial to stick it out, but I'd assume that most companies wouldn't hire someone at a junior level who doesn't start for 6 months.

Does anyone have any thoughts on/experience in this?  

(I'm applying for junior data science roles, and I'm based in the UK if that makes any difference)"
kwmxab,1,2021-01-13,I’m lost on what to do and time is running out,Pincenti,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kwmxab/im_lost_on_what_to_do_and_time_is_running_out/,"Backstory: I am 26 years old (1/11/1995) and currently living with my dad. I say currently because at the end of February he is kicking me out of the house. After graduating high school I went to community college and after 1.5 years I dropped out because I did not know what I wanted to pursue and I got offered a career being a Home Inspector. After dropping out of college I worked as a server and took online classes to become a licensed home inspector. I finally achieved my license at the age of 24 and I did a free internship with a professional home inspector for 6 months before quitting it. You may ask yourself “why would you quit when you spent all this time pursuing your license only to achieve that goal then quit after 6months?” Valid question, my response it I hated every second of it. I would stand in the middle of the house during these inspections and ask myself wtf am I doing here. I have 0 construction background, no passion, and I don’t give af about what I’m doing here/quality of the work I’m doing and these people in the future who hire me deserve better. Also I do not want to be squaring, climbing, crawling, ect... when I’m in my 40’s.... So I quit. Obviously my Dad was not happy about that and hit me with the “so what are you going to do now?”. I figured I would go back to school and finish my associates and pursue my bachelors in finance or human management resources. I took 2 classes and kinda bullshitted my way through them and finished with a B and a C however I did enjoy the classes themselves and felt proud. And here we are now....




Currently: So now the next semester is starting up (January 25) at my community college and I talked with my counselor and we picked which classes I should take and with her advice I will have my associates degree in June if I complete the coming up classes.




My original thought process: So my “plan” per say is to obtain my associates degree from my community college then transfer to a university located 2 hours away from where I currently live and either pursue a degree in finance or Human Resources Management while working part time and living with other students in a house so my rent is only around $400-$600/month.





The Dilemma: 

1-Dad: My Dad is kicking my out at the end of February and thinks I should not go back to school and should go back to Home Inspecting and get an apartment in the area. This way that I have an apartment to pay for it will push me to do well in Home Inspecting because I will have bills to pay

2-Mom: My Mom lives in another state and wants me to move in with her while I take my community college classes online. She stated that by doing this I will not have to struggle by having an apartment to pay for and will be able to study and work. 

3-Sister: My older sister (who is successful) also lives in the same state as my mom and thinks I should move in with my mom because she thinks my plan of going back to college is stupid because I am too old at the age of 26, the students at the school I will be attending are all aged 18-22, and she blatantly said I will not be able to complete college and will drop out again because I can not commit to anything.




My newish thought process: I AM STRESSED TF OUT. I do have commitment issues and have a hard time sticking with something. I have multiple people pulling me in different directions and making me question my original thought process. So now I am questioning if going back to college is a waste of time and money I mean hell I will be 28-29 when I get my degree and will have 0 experience in the field I choose just the degree with debt. Also, will I be able to do it? I think so but hell who knows forsure? Lastly, do I just say f it and instead of spending what money I do have I spend it on a coding boot camp which takes about 3 months to finish and they guarantee a job paying 50k+ year or your money back. 


TL;DR: Do I go to school, Back to Home Inspections, pursue a career in computer programming via online boot camp.



HELP. Thank you for the advice in advance."
kwmy8p,3,2021-01-13,"I received a rejection email for a trainee position, stating not enough experience now what?",danjwilko,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/kwmy8p/i_received_a_rejection_email_for_a_trainee/,"After looking for an entry level Job into the IT sector for the best part of a year, I’ve applied for jobs and roles ranging from office admin work, admin assistant, trainee amin, trainee web dev, trainee web design, junior web design trainee and junior IT support. I’m no where further forward.

I tailor my CV and cover letter to each application I do and apply roughly to about 5-10 a week depending on how I feel and what comes up in my surrounding area. Lincolnshire area isn’t a great area opportunity wise on that front mind. 

Anyway I usually don’t get a reply, or receive an automated message. The only two I actually received a reply from was a junior position that was for web design I was cheeky and asked if they were willing to take someone on either full time or part time as a trainee so I could gain experience, the director replied and said normally they would take on trainees but at current they were in need of fully trained junior web designers to hit the ground running, which due to the mount of time and resources a trainee would require it was something they couldn’t do at the time.

Which I thought was completely fair, I replied saying thank you for the consideration etc and moved on. 

I finally thought I’d hit the jackpot when a trainee position came up locally (within 30 miles) stating no experience needed on the job training for the right candidate etc etc, I applied thinking just maybe il have a shot here this was about a week ago, I then received a reply today with the following: “Unfortunately on this occasion your current experience doesn’t meet our requirements for the role and we will not be progressing your application further”.

Gutted, I know I’m green and still learning but wow, it used to be junior position candidates used to know a little about the job or role in question but training would be given etc, trainees were zero knowledge candidates but a interest in the area hence full training given. 

Seems more and more juniors need 3-5 years solid experience of just about everything, and trainees need some experience and qualifications. Where does one even start now? 

My experience is a bit all over but always been interested in the sector just followed a different career path. 

I turned 30 last year, started teaching my self web design in January ish, learning HTML and CSS with freeCodeCamp, I finished the responsive web design and after discussing career options I started my degree with the open university in October as I hold no formal qualifications. Which as a degree was a lifelong ambition and a requirement for most roles I came across it seemed a obvious choice, I also wanted to learn to program properly and get my maths up to speed so a degree in Computing and IT it was.

I’ve used god knows how many Linux distro’s over the years, I currently use fedora, windows 7/10 and OS X, happy with terminal, command line and registry editing, basic knowledge of networking from playing around with the old backtrack 3/4/kali Linux and setting up and maintaining my family business streaming equipment which I keep tabs on and test each week. 

Programming wise I’ve basic knowledge of Java and python which I touched on before starting the degree, of which will go into Java in more depth. 

Il be continuing the freeCodeCamp alongside the degree which will through JavaScript and jQuery moving forward so keeping building up knowledge on that front. 

Overall I don’t class myself as being experienced just general knowledge and an interest hence why I’m only going for trainee positions.

Ended up being more of a rant than anything but where do I go from here? 

Do I just wait until I finish the degree and apply for trainee positions again? 

Maybe intern positions by then as they all ask for a degree or last year of study so haven’t applied to any yet. 

Am I asking to much to apply for trainee positions?

Any pointers, advice or things I can do to boost my chances of employability in that sector? 

Ideally would like to end up doing web/design/ dev or UI/UX area eventually. 
Although cyber security is being pushed hard through the Uni.

kwoave,0,2021-01-13,How much does major (Computer Science vs Psychology) matter for career prospects?,redditiwanthelp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kwoave/how_much_does_major_computer_science_vs/,"Currently a (second year?) computer science student I'm considering switching to a psychology major but wondered if there were any potential consequences to career prospects I haven't considered yet.

If I switch, will be going towards **Psychology major, computer science minor, and cognitive science minor**. When breaking down this program combination credit wise, it is 48 credits in psychology, 48 credits in computer science, and a couple of math and linguistic courses. For reference, the CS major in B.Sci is 63 credits and the CS major in B.Art is 36 credits. So, even though the title of my degree doesn't say it, I would essentially have a double major in computer science and psychology.

I want to keep options open career wise (have interests ranging from software, ux design, game design, education, maybe ml/ai/nlp?). Not interested in a masters at all right now but might change in the future.

Additionally, **will this limit me when applying for internships just for not having a CS/SWE major**?

I got a decent amount of experience for a secondish year student (completed first year full time, this current year is part time). By the end of this summer, I will have completed 2 full time internships (4 months full stack web dev @ small company, 8 months of backend @ large known tech company) and two large/long term (gamedev related) projects that I can talk about extensively. I also plan on working part time for 4 months next fall. I think this is pretty good as a CS major but I don't know how expectations change if not actually majoring in CS.

Edit:

Can't double major university doesn't allow. Interested in switching because there are more psychology courses I want to take after a psychology minor and not interested in taking some of the required courses in the CS major, this would allow me to include CS in my program and give me more freedom to pick the CS courses I'm interested in doing.

An alternative is doing the BSci Liberal Program at my school.

If I did that, I would do a Core Science Component in Computer Science (45 credits) and a Core Science Component in Psychology (45 credits) which is closer to saying a double major in Psychology and Computer Science than the other option. The issue with this is that I feel like employers would get confused about what a liberal program/core science component is and it might be better to just have a regular major. I would also prefer the psyc/cs/cogsci option because I would have a lot more freedom on what CS courses to take and get to skip requirements I'm not interested in (which is the entire reason I want to get out of the regular CS major).

So yeah any thoughts on this?"

Should I be trying to narrow down what type of developer role I am looking for before I start applying for internships? Or is it acceptable to leave it open and not specify the role I am looking for?

If it is acceptable to leave it 'open', how would I describe myself on my CV, LinkedIn or Portfolio? Would the title of 'Software Engineer Student' be acceptable?

So, I got accepted in a remote internship (web dev) in a hospital. We didn't start yet (supposed to start at Jan 17th) but todays morning I got a message from a professor whom I worked with last summer as research assistant (web dev) telling me they have a new project and asking me if I want to join the team.. 
To be honest, working with that professor at summer was an amazing experience. she gave me the full freedom to try and take decisions about my work which gave me confidence to take my time and learn so the amount of knowledge I got was really worth every moment.
On the other side, the internship training plan includes some interesting stuff I really want to learn (mainly ASP.NET, C# and SQL servers).

This semester is supposed to be my final semester but I am seriously considering taking a leave of absence this semester.  The reason I am deciding this so late is because of my mental health really declined last semester and there are some financial issues regarding me registering next semester so right now  my parents want to take out a second mortgage.

I have had 2 FAANG internships but they were in design and I am hoping to use this time to work on side projects and do some leetcode, even though it’s late I would like to find a part-time job at a startup or anywhere just to keep me going. I transferred into the CS major my junior year so my programming skills are really not on par so I think I should take the time to improve that.

In terms of the types of jobs I want to get I am looking for UI/UX jobs (this industry has taken a massive hit), software engineering and maybe some product manager roles. 

Pros of taking the LOA

* Take the time to improve my programming skills (I really want to learn game dev, app dev, be better at leet code)
* Take the time to improve my mental health (although I don’t want the fact that I am not in school to make me more sad. Even being home for a couple weeks I feel better but not really ready to handle 5 classes but I feel like I can suck it up and do it if I had to)
* Taking the time to build a good portfolio website with projects
* Financially it may be easier as more loan options might open up
* Get to take the classes I want when I come back
* Reduce the chances of graduating unemployed or even if I do I have a stronger foundation 
* Try starting a business\*\* (I know this one is kinda weird but I have a project that I have been toying with. This could be a pipe dream but I think this could be a good time to just go for it and see what happens and what I learn) 

Cons of taking the LOA

* Delayed graduation
* Will be a more bit isolated from others
* This could affect recruiting

Im posting this here in case there are any other opinions or perspectives that I have not taking into consideration."

kwpzio,6,2021-01-13,[Graduated w Minor] Should I go back to school for CS?,DuneDuneKing,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/kwpzio/graduated_w_minor_should_i_go_back_to_school_for/,"Hi everyone!

I just graduated (edit: finished all my courses) and I have a spec in stats and a minor in CS. As I've gone through the CS program I realized that it was more and more of my interests. Went through the minor pretty quickly to squeeze it in. I really loved development, learning new frameworks and building on projects. Never got to delve into ML but I also wanted to explore computer vision.

I haven't had much success getting a SWE role and I think I'm probably not eligible for many internships which seems to be the major focus in entry-level roles right now. My prev experience is more geared towards data analyst but it's pretty basic stuff.

Not sure where to go from here. I graduated with an average GPA (UofT's standard) at 3.0. Anyone have any tips? Do I keep trying to get a technical role and find my way to SWE/CS related?

Do I get my second bachelors? I've looked at Queens, Western, Ryerson as viable options? I guess when I look at this route I think it'll lead me into a solid internship where I can build from there.

I dont think I can really get into a CS masters program given my GPA but if anyone has any experience with masters programs I'd really appreciate that too! I know there's a few project based masters? From my GPA, I dont think I qualify for UofT's applied computing masters program.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts would be helpful :)"

kwqv2b,0,2021-01-13,Wasted my time in university in a cult,Jay11861,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kwqv2b/wasted_my_time_in_university_in_a_cult/,"Hey everyone,   


I hope this isn't too weird to discuss here. Getting straight to the point, I used to be an indoctrinated member of a cult of sorts. The cult severely limited my interactions with non cult members making it quite impossible to network and join student organizations, and my involvement in it took up a lot of valuable time I could've used to work on projects and refine my skills.   


I finally broke away from said cult and moved out at the end of my third year of university. At the moment I am graduating in six months with no internships, very minimal club involvement(was getting into it till COVID hit), and not many connections. Since then I've been trying my best to make up for these years I've wasted but feel like I've screwed myself over.    


Does anyone have advice as to what I should do? At this point should I be looking for an internship or a job? I'm currently learning flutter dev trying to get enough projects on my resume to be employable by graduation while practicing leetcode problems to refine my coding skills. Is that enough? Am I really screwed?   


Note: I apologize if this came across as a rant"

Is it because companies aren't recruiting anymore or did something happen to the page?

Also, new posts on LinkedIn aren't really new, just reposting of old positions that I've already applied for, or from big companies that have no interest in me.

&amp;#x200B;

Where can I find new openings from smaller companies?

I want to give one last try for the summer internship search now that the new year started.

:--|:--
What is a typical day in your life like?|I get up at 4:30. I watch some YouTube, do some email, work on my writing or similar. I head to the gym at 7, shower and start my day around 8. I work in my home office or shop/lab, code and work on stuff, throughout the day. I could be busy all the way through to 8-9PM if I'm wrapped up in something, but not usually that busy.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
You get up at 4:30 AM? Wow. Have you always been a morning person? Are other people on your team morning people so you decided to start early? I’m asking this because it seems like a lot of successful people wake up very early and work out before starting their workday.|No, I never was until my neck injury. While recovering I couldn't sleep more than about 4-5 hours max and just got into the habit. Since it was so productive for me, I just kept it up!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks for sharing. I wish you good health.|Thanks!
Did you create Robocopy, or know who did? I use that very regularly and much more efficient than using the GUI.|The secret dirt is that Robocopy was first written by MS colleague Kevin Allen, and he started sharing copies around in 1994ish. From there, and after many iterations and heavy-duty real-world feedback, robocopy ended up in the Windows Resource Kit, and then later merged into the core Windows package. In the beginning, Kevin was a very experienced programmer, but new to the Win32 API; so robocopy was one of his projects to educate himself about Windows programming. Later on, ITG used robocopy to routinely transfer many gigabytes of data around MS global offices, every night; it became very robust and battle-hardened. It is a long time now since Kevin was involved in the robocopy source code at all; it is maintained by the Windows team.
Did you create Microsoft Clippy? Will Clippy ever make a come back?|Noooo... but I was around at the time. We have Clippy now in the form of Siri and Google Assistant and Cortana, but there's no picture. That's all it was though, an early digital assistant.
I read on a Microsoft devblog that when windows got ported to 64bit pinball 3d was not ported because of bugs and the developers not being able to understand the code/not having enough time. It's a shame, because it was such an awesome game and I spent many hours playing it as a kid. Was the code messy due to being ported from Sam and do you think it could have been ported given enough time and expertise?|Basically what I did when I ported it was to maintain the central code ""logic"" loop of the game unchanged so that it would play just as it did on other platforms, and then ""hooked"" functionality coming out of it and going into it. So I rewrote the drawing code that did the actual drawing, but not he original code that wanted to do the drawing, if that makes sense. I changed the how, not why.
 |That meant, though, that at the very core of the game was a big bunch of code that we didn't touch or monkey with, because it 'just worked'. Apparently sometime after Vista, in 64-bit, there was a collision detection bug in Pinball.
 |From what I read, Raymond Chen looked at it and got the general idea of what was wrong but didn't want to touch the fragile old code. Raymond's one of the best debuggers I've met, so it wasn't a question of expertise but of time and resources.
 |Anyone on the team could have trivially fixed it I'm sure, but it sounds like no one ""owned"" the game anymore after I left, and it was more than just a random little bug to fix, it would have required a dev to be assigned to it, and there likely was no one free.
What is your favourite colour please?|Well, I have four cars with blue interiors and I'm wearing a blue shirt and a blue watch and blue jeans. So probably blue.
If my son expresses interest in serious computer programming, where is a good place to start? C for Dummies? (I'm joking and I know terribly little about the topic, only enough to know backend is where it's at)|Python, then Javascript. Build a website!
Hi! Just wanted to say, I still use MS-DOS regularly, on many of my older machines in my collection. Also Win3.x, Win9x etc How do you feel about computers becoming extremely dependent on 'cloud' services? I can still set up an old machine, install an old OS, install old software and have it all up and running within an hour or so, while modern software essentially requires cloud services for literally everything. What happens to that software once some random person out there decides that they don't want to support it anymore? Those cloud services go away? Are you concerned that future generations will not be able to experience anything from this era of computing? Considering computers were designed to be able to continually run the same software over and over as necessary, how can that apply if the bulk of this is lost when the cloud disappears? Or maybe this isn't a concern at all, and I'm just crazy...?|I already have hardware that refused to work because the cloud service that backs it has been abandoned or the company has gone out of business.
 |I worry that things become dependent on externals that aren't reliable long term, and I know what you mean... but fortunately Windows, once activated, runs perfectly well offline forever, really.
I'm a fresh graduate with some experience and reading the knowledge you all have in the comments has made me feel very inferior. I only started coding in my university and I don't do it in my past time. Am I doing something wrong? I do enjoy programming but I try to keep a work life balance. Is that a thing in software development? Also did you ever approve a pull request by Bill?|No, as long as you DO enjoy it when you're doing it, you're fine. There's an entire ""spectrum"" of people in the world and some of us have ""special interests"" with which we're a little obsessed, and tend to ""hyperfocus"". I'm one of those people but it's by no means the only way to do it!
 |I knew many great programmers who (a) didn't program in their spare time at home and (b) didn't continue to program recreationally after leaving it as a job.
 |If you can work regular 40 hours a week as a productive programmer, you'll be set!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thank you so much for this! Are there any tips you'd like to give to fresh graduates like me?|If you get a job at a large company like Microsoft, and decide you're not happy, try moving INTERNALLY before looking for another job. You could work for 5 different companies over your career and they could all be Google, for example. Culture goes through and through, but every team has its own.
^(the following is a later reply)|If you can put in a 35-40 hour week of solid work, you'll be fine. There are three buckets: the obsessives, like myself, who work as much as they can. Then the solid pros, who can turn out a ton of quality stuff in 40 hours. And then you have the slackers who surf Facebook at work and read reddit when they should be coding. As long as you're not in that group you're fine, and a balance is important. It is indeed a thing the successful people achieve it. It's not about how much code you write, it's about how much MORE time you spend coding than you want to, and that should be zero!
 |Lots of people are in careers they don't practice in their free time, in fact most. So it's a bonus if you're that way, but most people are NOT, so don't despair! You're normal!
If you're still answering, how much of the original Task Manager still lives in the modern Task Manager? Anyway, thanks for the AMA! You're a legend!|I don't know for sure, but from looking at the app, and not the code, I'd expect about 60-70% of it?
Hopefully you’re still taking questions. I get a lot of crap by my peers about command line. Power shell is badass but I’m a cmd guy myself. I know we can do pretty much everything that cmd does in powershell and more, but idk. I like what I like, you know? Where do you stand on this?|Honestly I'd be a CMD guy as well, but I'm really starting to lean towards using bash under WSL.
 |Have you ever looked the help for SET and FOR under CMD? It's where we put every piece of extra functionality, since you can't add keywords that might collide with people's script names, etc...
I didn’t use windows after windows 7 for about 5 years. Back in august 2019 I finally rebuilt and upgraded my old PC and installed windows 10. The task manager in windows 10 is so amazing and powerful. I would imagine it’s something you wanted to implement in the 90s but didn’t have the tools or time. Right?|Indeed, I'm a big fan of the current task manager and what they've done with it! I wish there was a Dark mode, I wish it handled file lock tracking, and I've always got wish lists, but they've done a great job with it!
CIA_grade_LSD: Why does the file transfer time remaining progress bar start at like 15 hours and then drop to two minutes and then stick at 99% for five minutes? (An exaggeration I admit. I know you and your colleagues do your best, but I am curious why this hasnt gotten much more accurate over the years.) androidethic: Yes, we need a justification as to why the windows file operation estimations are so random/inaccurate!|They're the worst estimate out there, except for all the others.
 |Mac is just as bad. It's a hard problem. I worked on it briefly, and to help solve it I kept track of the average time it had taken for a whole range of operations, like creating, moving, deleting, renaming a file, or moving a block of N bytes, etc. Then multiply by the number of those operations that remain. But even that can be wildly off in degenerate cases.
Do you ever get laid?|Not since your Mom kicked me out.
Why has windows task manager never had a true force quit?|End Process is a true force quit.
What was your team's opinion on linux at the time? And what's yours opinion too?|I like it a lot, I was an early adopter back in 1993-1994 and tried to contribute some code for parsing IIDs, though I don't know if it's still in there. I hope it is, becaue then I'd have code in Windows, Mac Office, and Linux. I'd be everywhere :-)
 |Now that we have WSL 2, though, I do most of my Linux work under Windows!
How much of the original DOS code is still in modern OSs?|None whatsoever. In fact, the only commonality at all would likely be the PGM header on disk still traces its original layout to MS-DOS.
 |But rest assured there's NO code from MS-DOS inside NT, for example. It was a complete clean-slate design.
Was it you responsible for the atrocious naming conventions in WIN32?|Your username is dhbt12 :-)
What current developments in the world of operating systems are you watching with eager anticipation? File systems and LLVM seem to be the rage right now, at least from where I sit.|Containers are cool to me, like Docker! That's really the biggest development of recent years I think!
^(the below has been split into two)|
* What's your compensation?|- Zero, since I'm retired and there's no pension.
* Have you met Bill Gates?|- Yes, a number of times. When I was first hired he had me and a few other recent hires over to his house for burgers and beer and it was quite nice!
What's your opinion of free and open-source software? Broad, I know. I saw your [response about WinRAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/kfpjhg/i_am_dave_plummer_author_of_windows_task_manager/gg9uz9f/) saying you like to license your software, but do you hold a similar sentiment in tossing a coin to the devs of foss software you might use?|I love it, I just don't have any illusions that making a piece of code open-source somehow leads to higher quality. It makes it more available to me, which is great, but in reality, on a typical project there are going to be 1-5 people who really look at the code and then a dozen the sort of know it to make changes, and then consumers of the code who just call it. I don't see that those 1-5 people are any brighter than the people who'd be responsible for a product in a proprietary environment.
 |Now at a certain scale, like the Linux kernel maybe, you've got enough eyeballs looking at it that it makes a difference... that I could see!
What's the idea behind SYSKEY?|As I understand it, its function is to encrypt something called the SAM (Security Account Manager) database. This database stores hashes of user passwords, and is used to authenticate users when they supply their password.
Hey Dave, what do you think the future of the windows OS will be? Is a cloud-based OS possible, potentially limiting computer hardware?|As a total guess, I imagine our experience will eventually be just a UI device locally and everything else happens in the cloud on server hardware. So as you say, at some point your client hardware is ""good enough"" and then companies compete on the merits of their back-end services.
Do you know Mike Toutonghi? , he used to work at Microsoft, now he started a new blockchain project called The Verus project.|By name and email but not well enough to recognize him at the mall today, I'd say!
If you had to redo windows, what would you most like to change? What do you regret most? What do you like most?|The Format dialog needs to be redone! And Task Manager is likely my favorite...
Android or iPhone? Beer or wine? Ginger or Mary Ann?|iPhone. Beer. Can't it be both? It's an island, after all.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I figured the iPhone since you have Mac's in the lab. I figured beer also since you can't shift a 4 speed with a glass off wine between your legs. Nice garage BTW. However i wasnt ready for both, it's an island after all. Touche. I tired to compile my first bit of code from GitHub today. I failed miserably. It would install but wouldn't run. I'll keep at it.|Make sure you're in a clean empty folder. Try the code from Episode 11, I just used it so I know that works! Clone it and build it in PlatformIO with no changes, and that'll tell you if your dev environment is set up and working properly.
I cant connect to my cloud, can you download it for me?|I'd love to, but I'm out of paper. Can you fax me some?
What amazes you the most when you compare technology from the 90's to now?|GPUs!
Is it wrong of me to only ever end task manager with itself?|Software Seppuku.
Probably too many comments and very late to the game, but here it goes! I teach Comp Sci at an international school. Would you be willing to give a small webinar talk to my students? They would just be so happy to hear from you as would I! Anyway, regardless, thanks for the many, many hours of enjoyment!|Maybe after Covid, but I'm not a big fan of Zoom lectures! I just did one for the U of R, though, and if you check my channel there are two that I have done for the University of Regina that you might find useful for your students...
 |You can email me at davepl@davepl.com with info about the school and what topic you would like, etc, and I can see if it's a good fit for schedule and topic!
What computers do you personally at home? Windows? Linux? Mac?|All three!
Why are processes able to hang to the point that task manager is unable to kill them?|At that point there must be kernel corruption or something going on in a driver or well below the surface, I guess. If TM can't kill it, no one can, and it's truly hung.
Did you ever meet the genius who wrote the Space Cadet Pinball theme song?|No, who wrote it? Matt Ridgeway?
Hi Dave, loved the videos on task manager Do you have any thoughts on modern C / C++ replacements like Zig and Rust (respectively)?|I think its cool if memory access is indeed provably safe but you get code nearly as optimal as C, but I've got to learn more about them!
Did you like the windows phone?|Never had one, started after I left, but I heard nice things about the very last one before it went away...
Hi Dave, Why doesn’t File Explorer automatically refresh to show new files in a folder, such as downloads? Seems such an obvious glitch! Also, how do I get the login screen on Windows 10? I push space, esc, mouse clicks, enters... and nothing happens. Then poof, it shows up. Why is this so unresponsive?|It does.
 |In fact I know it does, because I have a patent on some of it!
 |Not sure why yours wound't be working, your system might have a third party piece of software that has broken File System Change notifications.
Was the time on Microsoft fun?|It really was. I miss the people and the environment, and I especially miss lunch!
i’ve found 15+ 0-days in the shell32 API when doing a vuln analysis of explorer.exe. You can read my work at https://hyp3ri0n-ng.github.io! What’s it like to write really buggy code :P?|I sense that high school was hard for you socially.
I’m sure I remember owning the pinball game as a separate standalone title before it was in windows? Can you explain the deal with that? Or am I misremembering|Plus Pack!
You're a legend, can't believe I missed this. I'll post this here, if you don't answer it I'll have a good copy/paste for later. What are your thoughts on the sethc.exe / accessibility exploit? It's worked as far back as XP, and still works today in Windows 10, last time I checked. Windows Server 2003 and 2008 as well. Is checking the integrity of OS files before they're executed just not a priority?|https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/222193/description-of-the-windows-file-protection-feature
Why ctl+alt+delete?|An IBM engineer (David Bradley, I think) picked that combination to serve as a hardware reset. You can't fake it, you can't get around it. The PC knows it's really C_A_D when you do it.
 |Why that particular combination, you'd have to ask him!
What's the furthest you've gotten into a project that ended up not panning out? Was it something you really wanted to get working or were you relieved to move on? I'm a student studying engineering right now and reading these answers is extremely motivational; your passion for computers is awesome! Thanks for doing this.|I spent about a year on an early prototype of Media Center that I was attached to but got killed. They did do a Media Center later, of course, but I had started 2-3 years ahead, but couldn't get funding.
Why has the Windows she'll been so bad for so long?|I don't know, but I'll see you in he'll.
Do you still work at Microsoft? Do you still use only Microsoft stuff?|No retired in 2003. I use a lot of MS stuff, but my main laptop is a MacBook and I use a Mac for video.
Do you own any Apple products or use them for work?|I own all the Apple products except the new headphones, pretty much! I'm retired now though!
Is the workculture of Microsoft at the time very different than now? How much does Bill Gates' leadership impact the company? What changes had his departure bring?|It is indeed very different under Satya than Bill, and the changes are widespread. But I left before Satya started, so I'm not really qualified to speak on them!
What are your thoughts on the age old trick of ""Opening Task Manager to stop programs from freezing or being slow"", is there some merit to doing that or is it just a simple coincidence?|Total coincidence, honest! Task Manager, at that level, is just a windows app with a message pump. It's existence doesn't do anything that solitaire or paint would not also!
 |No, but there's a great meme with the Star Wars general about how apps work better with Task Manager open because ""fear will keep them in line"".
 |It's purely psychological, though. TM doesn't do anything by running the calc or paint wouldn't also provide!
Did you work on Windows ME? If so.. What the hell happened to that OS that made it so terrible? I had kernal errors every week.|Nope! My work on the shell would have been backported to it, but I didn't work directly on 98 or M3, other than they used our NT version of the shell code by then I think.
Did you make any contingency for when Task Manager stops responding?|Yes, lots! Check the video the ""Secret Life of Task Manager"" for more dirt, but there are MANY things it does to help prevent you ever being stuck with no task manager:
 |https://youtu.be/f8VBOiPV-_M
If not asked yet If this is correct, as posted in r/Regina awhile ago iirc I saw a post saying you’re from Regina, Canada Is that true? If so that’s awesome to hear that someone from my local area made one of my favourite no internet game and the basic fundamentals of the most used OS for computers|Yes indeed, that's me!
Why is the documentation for WPA so bad and scarce? I have to refer to Bruce Dawson's years old blog to decipher some of the columns names. Are there any plans to add a comprehensive manual for it?|Windows Product Activation? Columns? Sorry, are you using WPA for something else?
Can I intern for you?|If you know how to write a Material-themed admin-style Dashboard in React, can consume a REST api in doing so, and have some experience with iPhone apps an Unity, then maybe yes!
 |I was actually looking for an intern this past summer to write a phone and web app...
how did you assured code quality and readability? did you use static analyzers/ unit tests or what?|Check out the ""Secret History of Task Manager"" video for a description of ""NTStress"" and how we nightly tested, but there were professional testers, every line of code was code-reviewed, and so on.
 |My understanding is it's quite different now, though!
When you say you worked on Windows activation, was it for more than a day?|That's an odd question. Can I ask why you think it might have just been for a day? Clue me in to what you're hinting at and I'll fill you in on the rest!
Why do I need to press 3 buttons and 1 click to open task manager?|Because you choose to fail!
 |You can do it with two clicks or one simultaneous multikey press!
Do you think WPA was a success?|I think so! It helped stem casual piracy, wasn't ""cracked"" for at least 18 months after we released it, and didn't unduly inconvenience users too often, I hope.
 |We were really aiming for the 95% case. Trying to catch the 95% of piracy that is people sharing keys, reusing their own keys on too many machines, getting keys off the web, that sort of thing. I think it accomplished that.
How did you feel about windows 8?|Same way you do.
Who invented the blue screen of death?|John Vert. He said:
 |""Back in 1991 I wrote the original code for Windows NT 3.1 that put the video screen back into text mode and the routines to put text on it (and a truly gnarly bit of code it was!). I used the white on blue colors for two reasons.
 |* The MIPS workstations we were using for the MIPS port had firmware that presented a boot option screen in white on blue, so it made sense that the bugcheck screen would match.
 |* I (and many others) were using SlickEdit as our text editor and at the time its default color scheme was also white on blue.
 |I believe Mark Lucovsky wrote the original code that dumped a bunch of text to the screen. This was a bugcode and a stack dump, resulting in a bunch of useless hex numbers which product support would occasionally dutifully transcribe from the customers and include in the bug report.
 |There was no ""typesetting"" as we used standard VGA text mode on PCs.
 |I don't know the history of the Win3.1/Win9x blue screens, I think the fact they were the same color is just coincidence.""
But can you make sick stick figure death match animations in QBASIC?|No, but I do a mean Bill the Cat ascii art!
How could you?|Sometimes you just gotta say WTF.

Here is my question. Im a cuban teenager (17) and my dream is work is be a developer. What kind of mini works i can do for learn programation before University?|Do as many little program tasks as you can, and make sure you complete them, and SAVE them for the future so you can look back!
 |Try writing a little program to convert back and forth between roman numbers and regular numbers. Or fund the next highest multiple of 32, or count the number of it bits set in a byte.

Education: Psych associates degree, Work Ready Certificate's of Completion in: Python, MySQL, Tableau, a Vocational IT/Professional program

Ideal Career Path: Data Analysis

Going to College for: Psychology with minor in applied computing for behavioral and social sciences 

I originally intended to work at my current job for a couple of years and then apply for financial aid to attend University for the last two years. For reasons not important to this post I am ineligible for financial aid. I will have to pay from my savings. Fortunately I have savings of 25k. However, now I'm having second thoughts about school since I'm paying out of pocket.

I've already put in my notice and have recommended a friend of mine to fill the spot, things have been set in motion and I am not willing to go back on it.

I have not been keeping up with my data analytics studies and because of it I am uncertain about landing a job in the field. 

My options are

1. Pay the school out of pocket and finish my degree and take the risk of struggling financially plus being out of savings by the time I graduate. 1 pro about this choice is that I will have access to internship opportunities through the school's career program. 
2. Find another job that isn't in my ideal career field and is simply just a ""for a paycheck"" job and take a $5k 6-8 month long data analytics program to find a job in my desired field 

This decision is hard for me because I'm putting a lot of personal importance to the first option. Because it would be nice to have the college experience, make friends, take advantage of their extracurriculars and career programs. Any advice welcome. Thanks."

I did the research and it makes sense. My coding chops are up to snuff, and I already have my tools spread out, there are 2 problems . . . .

Energy and pivoting.

What do I mean by that?

Well, right now I'm dealing with insomnia and letting myself have something of a break, last semester was tough and I couldn't make time for my app.

I've done a lot of things to keep my energy levels up, I quit masturbating, I quit drinking, I keep to the gym, etc.

Now there is the pivoting problem. When I have time, I always find some stupid way to rationalize or put my app on pause.

It's the same thing with applying to internships or doing my side hustle. It's like there is this childish part of me that thinks its all fun and games and I can't snuff it out.

Does anyone understand what I am saying? Do any of you have any advice to offer me on just getting started? What's happening now is similar to when I started working out, but I'd like to begin faster if I can help it.

Because I want my dreams to come true, and also I think the current computer market is bullshit.

So, what would you do if you were me?

Apparently even if I accept, my application would be routed through multiple stages of approval and is finalized at the very end of the quarter.

I’m currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a minor in Security. I have 4 semesters remaining until I graduate but no internship experience.

Obviously the target for me should be to get an internship but I’m not sure if I should go through with this degree or drop down to a BSc (with no minor) graduate 2 semesters sooner with much less course load, and less loans. Even if I land an internship, I intend to take two courses per semester while working full time.

Presently, I’ve started hitting the LeetCode questions (bought the pro membership) and also started working on courses available on Codecademy Pro in my spare time.

I am conflicted because I want to spend hard time on training on LeetCode, doing projects, learning Kotlin, PostgreSQL etc. All things that matter to recruiters — but instead I’m doing 5 courses a semester. I feel like I’m falling behind or worse, wasting time.

The dream is to work for one the cool companies (I think y’all call em’ Unicorn🦄 ) like Snapchat, Uber, Lyft, Twitter or obviously a FAANG.

kwxc9f,0,2021-01-13,"Don't know whether to accept my current circumstances, or risk quite a bit to follow my girlfriend to the other side of the country. Could use an outside perspective.",NYThrowaway7544,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kwxc9f/dont_know_whether_to_accept_my_current/,"Hi all,

I'm finally making a post on here because I don't really know what to do, as there is no real right answer to my situation, at least I don't think.

I'm currently a senior in college. Last summer I interned for a good company in my college town that's in the Midwest.. My girlfriend had just graduated, and she got accepted into a graduate degree program at an Ivy League school halfway across the country in a very large city. COVID hit and she decided to defer. She did not want to stay in the college town with me while I completed my senior year, and the plan was that she was to go move in with her mother, 13 hours away, until her graduate program were to start this Fall 2021. 

She ended up breaking up with me the night before my big internship presentation to the executive board of this company, and then she moved back home within the next few days. We tried to talk things out, and even tried long-distance for about a week, but then she told me she didn't want to commit and pretty much ended things soon after our long-distance attempt.  We were together for about 1 year and 6 months before she broke things off. Never have been more in love in my life.

The few months that followed were some of the darkest I've ever lived through. I lost all confidence and lost all sense of self, and to be honest, I don't think I've truly recovered from the pain. My anxiety is at an all time high (it's pretty much crippling), and I always get anxious about every little thing. It's been very hard to work through and I seem to want to curl up into a ball in the face of any kind of adversity. 

The plan was that I was to follow my girlfriend to this large city and get my first job out of college there. I'm going into software, so the field is in demand, but interviewing will take good preparation as a good portion of the process is answering technical questions and jobs in this city are incredibly competitive. I was doing it because I loved her so much. Living in this city isn't very appealing to me at all, but I was willing to make the sacrifice for a couple of years.

This pretty much fell through when she broke up with me. In the time that followed when we were apart, I tried interviewing at a few big companies all over the country, but my confidence was so low and my anxiety was so high I was failing pretty much everything, and my mind was not in the place to where I could learn from my mistakes let alone prepare for my interviews. I felt like I was destined to fail. I had terrible impostor syndrome. It's gotten better, but im still dealing with it.

I ended up receiving a return offer from the company I interned with. While it wasn't the grand company I always envisioned working for, the pay is outstanding and the people are nice. It's close to home, I would have a support system nearby, benefits and pay are outstanding for the area, and I wouldn't have to interview. The only draw back was the location, as I always thought I would leave this state after graduation. This isn't my ideal place to live. It honestly affected my self-worth thinking that I may be staying here another couple of years or so, but the opportunity itself is really good. I would learn how to be alone again, save up some money, and work on myself. I would just start out here. I don't have to stay here forever. I accepted the offer.

A week or so later after I accept this offer, I begin talking to my girlfriend again. She tells me she's moving back to town and she got a job here.  I find out that ""75% of the reason"" why she moved back was for me.  After a little, we reconcile, and we are now dating again.

The problem is the future of the relationship. She knows that I accepted this offer in town, and she said that was okay, and we could do long distance for two years. I would be making quite a bit and I have generous vacation, so going for visits wouldn't be too much of an issue. To me, long-distance isn't ideal at all. A large part of me wants to try and make our original plan a reality. It was the dream. She keeps giving me subtle hints of pressure like telling me that her former ""to-be"" roommates are actually going to end up moving to this large city with their SOs and dogs. She really wants the dream of us all living together in this city to become a reality. I do love her, but I don't think my feelings are as strong as they were 6 months ago. I honestly don't completely trust where this is going, and I'm terrified of getting hurt again.  I imagine getting broken up with in this large city, and I feel so sick. She has told me that while she wants us to all live together ideally, she just wants me to be happy in the end.

 I'm having trouble deciding whether or not to take the risk and try to interview for jobs in this large city and move there with her in the fall, or to just stay here with this current job and try to make the relationship work. There is also the dilemma of interviewing behind my future employer's back and risk them finding out, or eventually having to renege the offer I accepted. I've recently submitted a few applications to other companies in this large city, and I am extremely paranoid since this company is on my resume as I had interned there. I'm afraid of another company looking at my resume and asking this company if I had actually interned there, only to find out that I accepted an offer months ago. 

Bottom line: I don't know whether or not I should stay in my current location with a great job, or take the risk and move to a big city with my girlfriend who I just got back together with a couple of months ago. I need advice on what to do. If it's to take the risk, how should I go about applying for jobs? Will the company I've accepted an offer with find out?. If it's to do long distance, does anyone have advice on long distance relationships? She also has a dog that I'm very fond of. Should I take the dog in so he doesn't have to live in a big city? If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Current college senior, broke up with girlfriend of 1 year 6 months, was super sad, accepted return offer from internship even though it wasn't my ideal company, got back together with girlfriend, girlfriend going to grad school in a large city across the country, don't know whether to apply for jobs in the large city and follow her (which means reneging my offer... not fond of this), or just stay where I'm at and try to make long distance work for a couple of years."

I applied to around 40 internships back in August-October (mostly big name companies), and I applied to around 30 more since then (yes I know now that this is not a lot). I was thinking at the time that since I have around 4 years of programming experience, a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures from competitive programming, as well as a few web dev and software projects, I should be able to at least land one interview. However that turned out not to be the case, and so far I've gotten 5 OAs (all of which I completely solved),  0 interviews, and around 25 rejections. I'm starting to lose hope, and I think it's safe to say that at this rate I'm not getting an internship from any of the companies I've applied to so far. 

I updated my resume recently to include college clubs, classes, and new projects I've done, but the issue is I'm having trouble finding companies that are still accepting applications. I heard somewhere that usually smaller local companies still accept people who apply in the Spring before. Can someone give me any pointers for where to find these companies? Thank you!"

I have a conditional offer for CS from some Unis but I'm mostly going to firm University of Manchester once I meet the requirements of the offer. If everything goes as planned, I'll start uni this September. 

I wanted to know what options I have for interning at one of the top tech companies at the end of my first year, which will be in 2022. I'm (obviously) inclined towards one of FAANG and Microsoft.

Here's what I have done so far:
Latest high school score: 96.4%
Predicted scores after HS graduation: 95%

Fluent in Python, C++, Javascript(ES6 too) as well as HTML/CSS.

I love making Web Applications and have already made quite a few personal projects using Vue.js for front-end and Firebase for back-end. I'm also looking at developing and hosting a real-world AI/ML project, integrating it with web and also mobile applications using Vue.js and Vue native respectively,which is what ill be doing for the entirety of 2021. 

I'd also like to add that I can solve easy/medium problems of leetcode(using python) with some brainstorming.

With all this in hand, what are my chances of getting, say, STEP internship at Google?

PS: I'm an international student(non-eu)

Thank You in advance."

My main goal would be to leave the country, but I'm well aware that with the pandemic it's nearly impossible. I'm interested in moving to New York, Portland, Seattle, and Atlanta, but I'm open to other suggestions too.

I'm currently finishing up my senior year at university. My degree will be in Journalism, with an emphasis on Public Relations.

I want to move somewhere with a young and lively community. I'm young and because of the pandemic I haven't experienced clubbing and bars like a normal person in their 20s, so I want to set myself up in a place that will have an opportunity for that once cases drop. I'm open to experiencing all four seasons but I truly wouldn't want to go somewhere where the weather is too unforgiving, remember I'm from LA where cold weather is 60 degrees.

I'm going to be fresh out of college with only one internship and a handful of customer service jobs on my resume so I want to make sure that wherever I go, the job market shows potential. I don't have any current job prospects but I'm not too worried about my experience limiting me from finding one in my field. However, I'm not opposed to working a part-time job or two to get by.

Is this possible to move to another state right now, by myself? (I might have friends who would go with me but they're unreliable). 

The main reason I'm writing this is for advice on what to expect from a big move like this, how much should I have saved? How realistic will it be to find a full-time entry-level job in publicity, media, and pr that pays well enough to live off of? Which city has the most potential and seems like a better fit? Would you recommend a city, not on that list?"

I graduated from college recently. My last term I did an internship with a company that I have wanted to work for for a long time. They hired me into the position I wanted halfway through my internship.  I’ve been there a month and the facility I’m at is very toxic. 

The other department managers are passive aggressive at best and aggressive at worse. My boss, whose office is directly next to hers is two faced. For example one of my college peers applied for a position at the facility and texted me when she was offered the job. I mentioned to her in passing that it’s great she’s coming to work with us, and she flipped her lid. She went off on me about how inappropriate it is I was talking to her and she was going to revoke her offer. I pride myself on being professional and cannot for the life of me figure out what social rule I broke. She also micro manages me and listens in on everything I’m doing. I haven’t had a conversation with her where I feel like I’ve done something right. 

I’m not happy there and my interactions with my boss and coworkers are causing a lot of anxiety. This is the first job where a month in I haven’t made any work friends or felt like my boss care about my wellbeing. 

How long do I have to stick it out before I can switch jobs, without it being held against me?"

Before COVID, I was really doing well with my depression - I was unmedicated, but I was fighting it by keeping myself busy. I traveled, got my license, threw myself into clubs and organizations, did really well in my classes, and was even getting pretty close to applying to internships. Then COVID happened, and everything was thrown off track. 

I’ve been trying to occupy myself with little things - show premieres and finales, walking my neighbor’s dog, occasional boyfriend visits, birthdays here and there, socially distanced meetups with friends, etc. Things have gotten worse as cases rise, but I’ve been able to distract myself for the most part. 

I tested positive for COVID on the 23rd and haven’t been able to get over some final mild symptoms. I was alone on Christmas and New Year’s (my two favorite holidays) and it really did a number on my mental health.

Every day I take my medicine and hope I get better and every day I wake up to the same stupid tickle cough. I want there to be a light at the end of the tunnel but every day I’m stuck in my room alone with no one to talk to and no sign of it going away. I don’t have a doctor right now so I don’t know what’s going on with my body or when I can stop quarantining, and nothing I read online tells me. My support system all seem to think I’m exaggerating my symptoms. 

I get calls from work, emails from school, and texts from friends, but what’s the point, you know? It seems like even if I get out of isolation, quarantine holds nothing for me. If I’m able to go back to school in the spring, it’ll be boring classes with no internship (none of the companies I want to work with are offering them this year due to bad business). Plus, none of the activities I enjoy can happen safely, so there’s no send off for me there. I won’t even be able to see my boyfriend in person at all, because his family and my roommates have decided to stop taking COVID seriously. And then come May, it’ll be an online graduation ceremony with no internship help or job afterwards. No hugs goodbye, no proper send off, I’ll just log out of campus WiFi. And then what??? What next???

I feel like I’m hanging on the edge of a dark pit, and my grip is slipping. I’m really scared. I don’t want to kms but I sometimes I don’t want to wake up. I don’t want to feel like this but there’s no one I can talk to about it."

The goal stated as : "" You come here to gain knowledges and experiences , not making friends"" . Even though I attempt make friends, i only sat there in silence because there isn't anything to talk about apart from my group of friends . Unfortunately, I feel comfortable with my group since i do find them match with my interest and have been throughout my high school years, also they speak English  ( me and my friends are in a different schools, so )

Despite being born in Vietnam with a full-blooded Vietnamese parent, i am the only one who is differ among the company intern, i feel comfortable with English rather than Vietnamese . So connecting with other employees with my Vietnamese accent ( Which is sound like who born overseas) seems to be difficult for me and them . Thus, i like being private and alone in which usually never compatible with the company culture.

So my questions is , it is possible to make employee connection without going bombarded with questions  about myself( like what you like, who you belong to, you wanna hangout?, whos your friend like, are you this and that . QUESTIONS ) because privacy"
kx59pw,1,2021-01-14,I'm seriously considering the 10+ years friendship with my best friend. Here's why.,for_better_or_worse_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kx59pw/im_seriously_considering_the_10_years_friendship/,"BACKGROUND.
My best friend and I have been friends for 10 years now. We are both 21. We both consider each other best friends. We've been there for almost all important events good AND bad and we constantly looked out for each other and lifted each other up. We both love each other like siblings basically and have expressed this several times. I don't doubt that our friendship up until this point has been genuine. Which is why I'm having such a hard time making sense of the following situation. 

THE PROBLEM.
The problem started about a year and an half ago. He was in deep depression, falling horribly behind in university and not even bothering to look for an internship. He for the procrastinator he can be, actually has a sharp mind and brilliant ideas so it pained me seeing him wasting away his time, energy and emotions being all depressed, sleeping the whole day and not taking care of himself at all. 

So I took it as my mission to intervene, as I've always had, because sometimes all he needs is a little push in the right direction. So I set him up for an internship interview at this awesome workplace and he got it. Immediately after the first day he was all excited about it. He loved the people, the culture, and the work he was doing. He was doing SO much better and I was relief. He is now working as a regular employee. He had once again gained a sense of purpose. 

However, the downsides of my intervention quickly made themselves known:
1. Ever since he started working there, we've hung out some 6 times at most. He constantly cancels me last minute or doesn't reply to my texts when I bring it up.

2. We don't talk as often either. Obviously, I was expecting this as he works full time now (so do I) but sometimes it goes days without us talking, if not weeks at some point. And most of the times, it is me who starts the conversation. The only times he has ever contacted me, is when he needed my help. Every single time.

3. It is not like he doesn't have time. And this is what pisses me off the most. Every other weekend, he goes with his colleagues to spend the WHOLE weekend somewhere. After work, he goes out to drink, eat and party. The last straw for me was 2 weeks ago, we had set a specific day for a reunion with the old high school gang because we were all finally in the city again, which had not happened in 3 years. We hadn't decided on what to do but everyone had set aside the time to do something together, at first, he had confirmed, but 2 days before, he informed us he wasn't going because his colleagues were going on a day trip to some island and needed people to form a group. I later found out they didn't even go to the day trip. 

4. He knows what I think of the situation, he agrees things have changed yet he really is not making an effort. I think what had made our friendship strong was the fact we could tell each other everything and be unapologetically ourselves. So I never hold my thoughts back with him. And likewise, he never did, or at least he said so to me. He would take his time sometimes but eventually he would tell me everything. What's more, we would do something about it in the past. He has stopped me many times from making stupid decisions, I have helped him through several of his darkest times and as a whole, we have both motivated each other to be better people and have overcome several situations that could have ended our friendship. Honestly, I FEEL betrayed.

NEXT STEPS. 
Lately, I really have been wondering if ending our friendship would be for the better. For all the acquaintances that I have, I rarely let people get close to me. Even more rare is for them to become a friend. I don't regret ever being friends with such an amazing person, because in many ways he has shaped me into the person I am today. And I proud of the person I am today. 

However, it seems that I'm the only one trying to keep our friendship afloat. And honestly, I am tired. I've gone to his house several times to see if he's still alive only to be ignored and left out. 

I also think it's weird how that when we talk (we still talk from time to time) he still tells me a bunch of things, incredibly personal things even. His co-workers and his classmates all know about me even though I haven't met them in person. Which makes it confusing for me. 

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU. 
If you've made it this far, I would like to know if any of you have gone through a similar situation. And if you have, I would like to understand the reason behind it. After all, I'm not getting any response from his end. Maybe you've noticed something entirely else that stood up to you and would like to point it out. Or you could offer your opinions on the matter. I am open to seeing it from another POV, which is why I came here. 

Preferably, I would not like to end it but seeing how things are going, I will do it if I have to. Just like it pained me seeing him waste away his time, energy and emotions being all depressed, it would pain me even more if I had to look back and see ME wasting my time trying to keep a doomed friendship afloat. If I come to that point, I will simply walk away. 

Some things to keep on mind:
1. I've talked about this with him already 2 weeks ago. He only said he was sorry. 
2. I've tried asking him what has been happening and why it's come to this, yet he has told me he doesn't want to talk about it. This has not happened before."

I'm still not sure what type of software development position I'd like to apply for. I  enjoy working with HTML, CSS, JS, Java and Python, so I am considering either front-end or back-end development.

Should  I be trying to narrow down what type of developer role I am looking for before I start applying for internships? Or is it acceptable to leave it open and not specify the role I am looking for?

If it is acceptable to leave it 'open', how would I describe myself on my  CV, LinkedIn or Portfolio? Would the title of 'Software Engineer  Student' be acceptable?

I'm a CS grad who's been working at a private company for about a year and a half since graduation. Pay is good, people are great, but the problem is the tech.

Is this possibly just the state of the current market? I had no problem getting interviews right out of college. I also fear that my odd amount of experience (1 and a half years) makes me not quite qualified for SDE 2 but not low enough for entry level (SDE 1). I'm just not sure what I should do to try and get in the door.

The first offer is for a part time internship with a midsize investment firm (about $50B AUM) in their Business Intelligence department. The second offer is for a temp position (working 40 hours full time with opportunity for overtime) starting in a few weeks that will run until the end of the year at a data information company that works with financial institutions and their KYC and anti-money laundering departments. 

The part time internship would pay a little less money per hour but it sounds that I would be almost guaranteed a full time offer after graduation and would be able to move up the ladder more easily. The temp position is not exactly what I want but it pays more and they said I would be given a full time offer after the contract ends as long as I don't screw up. Both are remote until at least the summer and my classes are also remote so there really isn't much difference between the two logistically except for the amount of hours worked per week. 

I want to eventually work in data for an asset management firm and am not really aiming for a high end job that requires long hours at the office. Given these 2 offers what would be the best opportunity?"

I am also studying Computer Information Systems and Business Process Management at a nearby university. 

My internship is actually really valuable as far as experience goes. I've gotten to do some work on data analytics projects, worked directly with some of our vendors, and I have also been able to develop training materials as well as train some of our new hires.

There is a full time position opening shortly that starts at $36,000/yr with a great benefits package and tuition reimbursement. It is essentially the same job that I do as an intern, but with a full-time schedule. It hasn't been posted yet, but as I am the highest performing intern I would be virtually guaranteed the position. 

My dilemma:
- If I accept, I will only take 9-12 credit hours per semester for the remainder of my degree program to help balance with my work schedule. This could potentially push my graduation back by a semester or two. Is the trade-off of a later graduation worth the experience of this position?
- I REALLY do not like school but I do like my job. I'm worried that I will get complacent in my position  and slack off on my courses. This is more a matter of personal discipline, but I was wondering if anyone here has had similar experience or advice they could share.

Please let me know if I can clarify anything about this situation. I tried to include only pertinent information, but I'm not sure if I left out anything important."

There was a freak accident three years ago where I physically witnessed the death of two people that I knew in a very graphic way. To put it plainly: it fucked me up pretty bad for a while. 

Up til that point I was working as an accountant for a medium-sized furniture company on the E. Coast. My city had a pretty big tech market and I always considered learning, but put it off for one reason or another. 

After this whole terrible situation I quit my job because it was making my anxiety and stress get lifted to their absolute limits and I hated it with a passion. I instead decided to enroll back in college and fast forward to today and I'm about a semester away from my second degree – this time in computer science. 

I have a lot of projects to demonstrate my ability but I'm terrified of trying to explain why I haven't been working; not even an internship. I've spent the last year trying to get an internship but with COVID it has been next to impossible. I'm hard-working and healthy and determined to make this work, I just need to find out how to even make it through that question. 

Also, in case anyone wants to ask how I sustained myself, I was living in a small (but nice) home that was already paid for and had a ton of money saved from a job where I was almost certainly overpaid. I'm also married but we are willing to relocate anywhere within reason, though that seems to matter less and less these days as businesses play with the possibility of remote work."

I'm starting my last semester in a couple weeks, and I will graduate in May. I want to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Not sure what I like yet, as I have limited experience. The only hands on stuff I've done in school is some penetration testing techniques, digital forensics, and basic network security. Therefore, I don't know what I'd like to aim for in the long run, but I definitely want to get into cybersecurity.

[My resume](https://imgur.com/a/JUHCTR8), if you would like to take a look. I don't have any internships. I have one noteworthy project with five other people in a web development class. It used express, node, mongodb, pug and git. And I presume I'll generate one more noteworthy project this coming semester in my capstone computing class. Resume critiques would be appreciated.

I have read that there are many positions that lead into cybersecurity, from software engineering, to networking, to financial analysis roles. So should I apply to all of these roles? From what I can gather from reading other posts, I am already too late on applying for positions that begin shortly after I graduate in May? Should I be applying right now to get a job as soon as possible?  Also, could someone settle the whole cover letter debate for me: do I write them or not? And how's the job market doing now? I have been very pessimistic about my likelihood of getting a job quickly after graduation. So, I wonder if it might be a good idea to apply for roles like technician at a computer repair shop or help desk roles too? Tips on places to look, services to use, and specific companies to apply to? I'm in the Tri-state area.

TL;DR: I'd like any and all advice on getting a tech job ASAP after graduation.  I'm very pessimistic about that possibility, so I want to know what I can do right now, two weeks before my last semester. Should I be applying to everything right now?"

Any help and insight would be appreciated."

I'm starting my last semester in a couple weeks, and I will graduate in May. I want to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Not sure what I like yet, as I have limited experience. The only hands on stuff I've done in school is some penetration testing techniques, digital forensics, and basic network security. Therefore, I don't know what I'd like to aim for in the long run, but I definitely want to get into cybersecurity.

I have read that there are many positions that lead into cybersecurity, from software engineering, to networking, to financial analysis roles. So should I apply to all of these roles? From what I can gather from reading other posts, I am already too late on applying for positions that begin shortly after I graduate in May?

TL;DR: I'd like any and all advice on getting a tech job ASAP after graduation.  I'm very pessimistic about that possibility, so I want to know what I can do right now, two weeks before my last semester. Should I be applying to everything right now?"

kxdodd,1,2021-01-14,How Do you Get a Job in Aged Care with No Experience?,rubel120,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/kxdodd/how_do_you_get_a_job_in_aged_care_with_no/,"How do you get a job in aged care with no experience? The first step is to gain formal aged care worker duties and responsibilities, including education and training. It's important that you gain this qualification to show prospective recruitment agencies that you are qualified for the role. There are many aged care worker duties and responsibilities that can be performed by people with no work experience. It's really up to the agency, whether or not they choose a candidate with no experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Gain Skills and Experience:

&amp;#x200B;

Once you've completed the formal aged care worker requirements, you'll need to gain specific skills and experience to qualify for the job. These skills and experience can be gained through a range of different ways including school, training, community work and employment. Some people find it easier to gain these qualifications while still at school.

&amp;#x200B;

Where to get Training?

&amp;#x200B;

There are many aged care worker schools across Australia that offer a variety of classes and study opportunities for their students. Many of these courses include practical training. This practical training will help you develop the skills you need to successfully complete aged care jobs. You can also learn about health and safety matters, as well as about staying safe while you are working. With the practical training, you can be confident that you will have the tools and knowledge you need to perform your job.

&amp;#x200B;

Pathway of Diploma in Aged Care:

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have completed formal aged care worker training and you know what you want to do, you can consider getting a diploma or certification. A certificate can take several years to earn, but it will provide you with a valuable credential that can help you get more aged care jobs. This credential will demonstrate to potential recruiters that you have certain qualities that are needed in aged care workers. These qualities can include having a friendly, outgoing personality, or being detail-oriented and able to follow instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

The certificate itself requires four years of supervised experience. Many people choose to get a diploma  while still in high school so they can still continue to participate in classes while completing their formal education. If your high school offers vocational classes in community arts or in K-12 education, then you should consider enrolling in those courses. These classes will allow you to gain the necessary work experience for your Senior Home Care certificate. You can also choose to participate in vocational trainees' programs to get additional experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Internships:

&amp;#x200B;

If you do not have any experience, then you may want to consider taking an internship. Internships allow you to gain valuable real-world work experience. During your internship, you will be able to complete projects that will be sent to a local senior care facility for an evaluation. Projects can range from helping patients with the daily activities required for daily living, such as bathing, to more specialized tasks such as cleaning or medication assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

&amp;#x200B;

While there are many different ways to get an aged care job, one of the best ways is to first build up your own network. This means you need to make contact with people who can provide information regarding jobs and such. The next step is to inquire about internships and traineeships. If these do not pan out, then you can always look towards the internet as one of the best possible sources of information on how to get aged care jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

ISMT, Sydney can be the perfect option if you want to pursue this diploma

kxepoo,885,2021-01-14,How an average student with no internships landed a SWE job after 600 job applications,8754378543a,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kxepoo/how_an_average_student_with_no_internships_landed/,"TL:DR at bottom.

**Background:**

Call me Mister Average. I had a 2.84 GPA coming out from my B.S. in CompSci that I finished in May 2020, as well as no internships during schooling. I didn't take schooling in general very seriously, and would receive B's and C's in many of the courses. I didn't realize how important it was to have a internship until my first semester into senior year.



**The Plan:**

Oh no! I'm out of time to get an internship! ""what ever will I do????"" is what you're asking. Well this is not the time for should've/could've mindset. We progress only forward now. There is nothing back there, look forward and keep marching.

I knew it was going to be a tough journey, especially during 'Rona season so it was going to be extremely difficult for me to land anything. So I had to come up with a plan:

1. Wake up early every morning and begin applying to Indeed, Glassdoor and then Linkedin.
2. Work on personal projects
3. Leetcode

**The Process:**


So every single morning, I would get up and immediately take myself to the PC and begin applying. At first, I didn't know which jobs to apply to so I applied to all of them. 100 or so rejection emails later all saying ""Unfortunately we have decided to pursue other candidates at this time"", and then I got my first phone interview. It was a recruiting agency that worked with government contracting for the most part. She begin asking me questions that would be on the interview such as:

1. Why do you want to work at X?

2. Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?

3. What challenges have you faced?

4. Describe yourself.

5. Why should we hire you?

6. Do you want to ask us any questions



You are probably thinking I was demolishing these questions, getting every single one perfect for how the recruiter would have wanted it right? 

**You're Wrong**

I was stammering, nervous, mumbling, and often times throughout these questions I would just say ""I don't know."" Did I get past the first phone interview? No, but guess what? 

**I just figured out some questions that would be asked in the next interview I take. The only way to truly succeed in this world is to fail.**

These questions should be **ingrained in your skull**. If you have a SO, roommate, brother, sister, mother, father, etc. to practice these questions on, then it will be better. And if you're on the boat as me, you don't so guess what? We are going to practice these questions before every single interview BY YOURSELF and say them all meticulously.

B-b-but 8754378543a, which one of those questions are the most important?

Well son, I would personally say that the final one is, and here is the reason I think it really helps: It shows how interested you are in the position. Should you fire 10-20 questions at them, and extend the interview by 30 minutes? 

No.

What you want to do with this is simply ask questions that if you were in the shoes of the employer, you would think to yourself ""Great Question"". Do you know how many times I have failed an interview but the dopamine hit of having the employer say ""Great Question"" when it came time for the questions to the interviewer? 

A lot.

Understand what the business does, and use your questions based on that research. Also hit them with general questions such as ""What do you like about working at X?"", ""How is the WLB"", ""How has X Company been affected by 'Rona?"" as well. 

On the same boat, speak about your personal projects as though they are your own children. Speak about the complexities of the problems that you faced were, **AND THEN HOW YOU SOLVED THEM**, speak about the tech stack you used, **AND WHY YOU USED THEM**, and finally give any important tidbits of information to show them how hard you worked on the application.

Now finally, it's time to speak about the elephant in the room:

**LEETCODE**

This sub likes to jump on the importance on leetcode, and to practice it every day. Now, don't get me wrong. It is in fact quite important to pass the coding part of the technical interview, but that is only half the battle. Remember that the questions discussed in the last section are the other half. But let's get started with the leetcode discussion. 

What to study?

I would personally go with something like the blind 75:

https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU

B-b-b-but 8754378543a, is that it? 

Well not only are you finishing each of these questions, but EVERY SINGLE TIME:

1. You describe the code to yourself.

2. Describe your thought process as you are writing it.

3. What are some of the optimizations that can be made to it? 

4. What is the Space/Time Complexity now, and with further optimizations, what can it be taken to?

And here is a final question before I get to the end of the post with the conclusion.

With just the blind 75 and leetcode daily you must have destroyed the technical part?

**Once again, it's a resounding NO**

I was once again, a stammering mess with voice cracks, chocking up, and general spaghetti coming out of my pockets. But guess what? I didn't give up, every single time I fell, I got myself back up and kept doing more and more technical interviews until I was proficient. And with 600 applications, 10 technical interviews under my belt. I finally received a SWE offer and I couldn't be more proud of myself and the journey it took to get here. More than half a year of constant fighting to get to where I am now. The me that existed months ago would be happy to know I finally got to my destination. I don't care if 1 or 2 people actually view this post, as long as I can lend a hand to those of you can't see the peak of the mountain and are discouraged ready to turn back. Allow me to lend a hand, and tell you that a mindset of moving forward, taking hits and getting back up, and you will see yourself at the top of that mountain. When you do however, I want you to lend a hand to those that can't see the peak.

TL:DR: Fall, and then get up. Fail, and then succeed. Wake up, apply, work on personal projects, and leetcode. And most importantly, ask questions in your interviews."

kxfxpb,7,2021-01-14,Should I dropout? Need some advice.,Tungdildo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/kxfxpb/should_i_dropout_need_some_advice/,"Hi, I'm a junior electrical and electronics engineering(EEE) student. I was pretty decent at math and science in my high school years and I'm from Middle East(I'm sorry in advance for my english), so I thought CS or EEE could workout for me in a way that I could be successful and also it could help me move to Europe or somewhere else. So, I went with EEE in a university since my parents couldn't afford a good college. During my first 2 years in university I was actually trying to be the best version of myself, I took as many CS related classes as I could, I have studied a lot in my free time and I've participated in many different events, competitions etc., even though I hated the university I go to. So I thought I could get an internship and applied for some relatively small companies in my country just to gain some experience. I got rejected by all of them.

At the end of my sophomore year I had 2.95 GPA (I know it doesn't sound that great, but it was okay, considering how tough and stupid the education is in my university). This semester I'm taking total of 11 courses with 7 EEE courses that I had to take,  and I'm failing at least 4 of them(the most important ones) so far. Since I was taking so many EEE courses this semester, I only had time to focus on EEE subjects, no CS or whatever. So I realized that I actually hate EEE. I didn't know it was going to be so theoretical(memorizing many formulas etc. for no reason if you ask me). I was expecting more of making projects with your team, and learning by doing kind of stuff.

Since I'm failing miserably 4 of my EEE classes, it is going to take me at least 1 more year to graduate, and also my GPA is getting ruined. So I can't get an internship or some research assistant job, since the industry is so competitive in my country. I was also planning on applying for some jobs abroad, but I thought that no company would accept some university(not-college) student with low gpa, who is also middle eastern, and gave up.

I've been thinking about changing my major to CS for sometime now but I don't think it will be any good either(I know many people in CS department, I have heard that it is not very good either). So I have tried to find a way to get accepted by a better university, but no luck there either.

This was my engineering-student experience so far. By getting into engineering in this university, My ultimate goal was getting my PhD or getting a job abroad(somewhere better than here). But now I can't even get an internship or whatever in my country. Me and my friends from EEE talk about these kind of stuff a lot and they don't seem to have an answer or some hope either.

So I thought I would ask you guys for some advice. Should I dropout, end my engineering career, try to live a more simple life from now on or should I just keep going with it, even though I would be graduated very late with a low GPA and it wouldn't lead me to a PhD program or a job abroad."

Only once did I make it to a final-round on-site interview last year. I unfortunately did not get the internship. So here we are now. Hundreds of applications later, and I'm gaining zero interest from HR, and I really mean ZERO. I couldn't even tell you the last time I got a hacker rank or any follow-up from an application. My resume has pretty much all I can have on it for having no professional experience. I have my languages/skills/frameworks listed out as well as a few of my projects such as Rails full-stack web app, mobile app, React portfolio site. As the days pass by, more and more of my friends that I often help in class are landing jobs. I wish that's something employers could know. Some of them even complain to me about their salary, and it just pains me because I would take anything at this point. Moving away from my little tangent, does anyone have any advice for someone in my situation? I really don't know what to do anymore."

It feels like even when I am able to put my best foot forward, it's not enough. I also feel overwhelmed sometimes when I get assessments with questions asking things on topics that I have literally never seen before. Am I supposed to know all of this stuff? I haven't even seen some of it in school/life yet. Is it just me or does it seem like companies want so much skills and knowledge from interns? Like isn't the point of interning to learn more?

I don't know, I just feel sorta lost and I know I try my best but it's admittedly p defeating when I can see that my best isn't really procuring anything. I feel like I am doing most things right: I work on projects to show my work, I have good grades, and I do mostly well on some assessments. Any advice or support is appreciated, I'm just sort of like ugh rn. The last semester and a half of remote class has also been super unexpectedly taxing on my mind. I don't think it has helped lol.

Something I have noticed: why do I keep seeing people applying to 100+ places in order to get just a few offers? Does this mean that the vast majority of CS students are not landing internships at all? The internship hunt for CS students seems so unnecessarily difficult and I am curious like what peoples' thoughts are on this.

At the end of the day, I know that not getting or getting an internship won't affect my future career all that much, but I can't help feeling like I'm ""behind"" my peers.

tldr, do I need to work harder or am I ok?"

For example, medicine is very difficult, requires years of intense schooling, and you'll likely take on massive debt. Law and finance can have rough hours and place a high premium on school prestige and pedigree. The humanities often have less than ideal pay or employment opportunities, et cetera.

On the other hand, CS, specifically software engineering, seems like a pretty sweet deal. There are plenty of jobs and internships available. You can literally build up your resume while sitting at home through side projects. The only education ""required"" is a bachelor's degree. The CS major is admittedly tough, but certainly not the hardest, and you don't need good grades at all to land an amazing job. Yes, entry level recruiting can be a pain and LeetCode blows, but it's really no worse than, say, SAT prep in high school. After a couple months grinding away at goofy problems like finding the kth longest palindromic substring in a 2D array, you can crack interviews at companies in fun cities, with ridiculous perks, (mostly) reasonable hours, and compensation so stupidly high that people wouldn't believe you if you told them.

kxkrg3,0,2021-01-14,GPA crucial in which aspects?,WpandaReddit,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/kxkrg3/gpa_crucial_in_which_aspects/,"Hi all, Im currently a sophomore pursing a Computer Engineering major. I actually had just bombed one of  my classes while getting all As in other classes. 

I heard that for interns some may care while others dont as long as its 3.0+

However I wanted to pursue a masters degree, if not an MBA or another degree (open to suggestions) and was wondering if grad schools mainly look at your GPA whether to take you in or not

But Im afraid dipping below a 3.5 will drastically hurt my chances over classes I may potentially do poorly in for the remainder of my college."
kxkxap,24,2021-01-14,Did I screw myself over by not going to this ONE thing? Or am I just “paying my dues”?,briestarot,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/kxkxap/did_i_screw_myself_over_by_not_going_to_this_one/,"I’m a film major in my senior year and I just joined this internship at a local in house studio just last week. The other interns and I are scheduled to come in twice a week and it’s unpaid so our bosses specifically said they will work around our schedule always. So the first day (Monday) when the 3 of us met, we were separated by departments. 

The 2 guys were with the photographer setting up for a test shoot, while I was with one of the employees as she was editing a green screen video etc. It was the perfect first day and very hopeful. Our main supervisor mixed up the dates of a photoshoot and it was actually that Tuesday, so the other bosses just asked if one of us could come in the very next day on top of also coming in on Wednesday. 

Now they said only one of us has to come in, I didn’t say no but I also didn’t jump to say yes, but the other 1 guy did. Mind you, it is unpaid and I didn’t want to set a precedent for being taken advantage of, and in my off time I drive for Doordash to make some money. I also live JUST under an hour away and the other intern is in Brooklyn and this studio is in NJ. Of course the two of us weren’t jumping to come in last minute. 

But I feel like I fucked up because that following Wednesday (albeit it was dead), I was asked to look up recent news for a pop culture segment. That in itself isn’t necessarily bad though, because it was practically writing for something on their show. I was also asked to email a bunch of companies for sponsorships for the studio. The 1 guy did that too earlier but here’s where it gets bad.

All of us were going to go in that Saturday for a test shoot but it got pushed on Thursday and they asked if we could come in on Friday for something else. Our sup said if it’s too short notice not to worry about it and no one responded to it in Slack. 

This new week rolls in and I suddenly get stuck with checking off an office supply list like groceries and paper towels. They take forever to give me a new task and then I’m stuck emailing people asking if we can use their recipes for a cooking segment next month. 

The second day of the week they stick me to the social media page and asked me to be the “official office supply tracker”. So whenever I come in I have to make sure this glorified grocery list is up to date. While the other two guys were editing a vlog and color correcting another video, I’m suddenly a PR person. 

I wouldn’t mind if the remedial tasks were scattered out to everyone but the fact that it’s just me? That’s kinda fucked up. Idk if it’s because I’m the girl so suddenly I know everything about social media and nothing about film?? I deadass started tearing up a little bit the other day because I felt like I was just completely downgraded to something that has nothing to do with my area of interest at all and that’s literally what they promised us when the internship started. I even came in 10 minutes earlier to see if I’d be given something cool to do, but you know what they did? Asked me to look for some lamination place, and when I saw they had lamination paper at Target my sup asked me to run out and buy it with her card. 

Not only that but the NEWEST interns that just came in were doing some editing stuff on the IG story. 
I REALLY hope that it was just a slow week and not a complete 180° because this shit is so unfair. I don’t need to credit for school I just wanted some more experience and a possible paying job when I graduate."

I am interested in accepting the job and I am thinking about negotiating the salary but not quite sure if I should or how to do it. 

The role is an entry level IT Business Analyst for a multinational company in the Marketing and Advertising Industry. During my first interview with HR they asked me for my salary expectations(20-30k) and they mentioned the usual salary for the role (25-28k) and asked if that was okay with me and I said yes. They gave the job offer with a salary of 28k. Some of my friends and family have advised me to negotiate because there is ""no harm in trying they've already offered you the position, they won't take it back"". So it made me think maybe I should, but I am not sure I have much leverage to do so. This will be my first job but I am not a fresh grad...I've had a business analyst internship and after graduating I spent sometime abroad teaching english which paid a lot, while it is not related to the this job I could say I have experience in an international setting. 

To note, on payscale their offer is the median for entry level of the role in my country. 

So yeah that's where... I am not sure if I should negotiate the salary because they offered me the max of their budget? Or if could negotiate some other benefits? Or is it greedy to ask for more? Or how to even begin a conversation about negotiating?

I just really don't know what to do.  What do you all think? Any advice is greatly appreciated :)"

A little backstory on me. I will be entering UMD’s CS program in a few weeks as a transfer student, and I have an okay amount of programming knowledge under my belt. After I made the decision I would want to attend Maryland about a year ago, I’ve pretty much researched everything that’s come to mind regarding this schools program and have read many of the post regrading the course difficulty here. I feel like I have a decent idea of what is expected of me to survive, but I guess only time will tell haha. However, I’m ready to work hard and ready to learn. I decided not to take the exception exam and will begin in CMSC-131. 

As the title says, I’m looking for advice in regards to preparing for technical interviews. For those of you who have earned an internship(s) through interview prep while at UMD, would you mind sharing advice? If so, what advice would you give to someone looking to land an internship who has at least 6 months to 1 year to prepare for the interview. Specifically, how soon did you began preparing for interviews? How did you prepare what recouses did you use? Was the course CMSC-132 a big help in studying and learning useful data structures? Did you have any side projects? Did you manage to get any referrals? Do you feel any of the courses here helped at all in preparing/learning for tech interviews. 

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. Also, yes I know leetcode haha."

While i do have some mini projects (not many and are really small, like 1 script), i am not sure if i should upload them onto github now, or should i just leave the github URL field blank?

Also, lets say if i decide not to include my github URL in the application, should i add “Git” to my list of technical skills on my resume?"

This semester I have two projects to work on. One is from my lab, and the professor would like to see the prototype by the end of May. My partner quitted the lab, and I am still struglling at the very first stage. The other project is from a robotics competition, which is also in May. I think it would be irresponsible if I drop any of them.

Meanwhile, I have four major courses--RF, physics2, computer architecture, microprocessor-- and a lab course for microprocessor. Each of the major courses have 3 credits, and the lab is 1 credit. If I don't take them this semester, I am afraid that I won't have enough skills to find an internship this summer. Actually, I am supposed to take two lab courses. I have dropped one already, leaving it for next year. Still need to save some time to study for GRE...

I am not sure I can handle all these things, but there is nothing I can really do about the situation except time management. Do need some courage to deal with this."

I am a google Product Manager currently coaching 3 MBA students from a top tier program in the bay area. 

These are super smart and hard working folks who aspire to get PM roles in Big Tech. The problem is they have 0 PM experience which puts them at a disadvantage. They didn't get PM internships and are now recruiting for their first post MBA job. 

Any thoughts how to address this gap and develop some PM experience to increase the chances ? 

Is this is a wide-known problem ?"

kxvxfc,2,2021-01-15,How important is a review from an internship in Germany?,Beatrichi,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/kxvxfc/how_important_is_a_review_from_an_internship_in/,"Hello everyone.

I hope, I'm in the right place to ask this question.

So, a little background.  I've been working in Marketing for 2 years (in Ukraine). Then I moved to Germany in 2019 and since then I was struggling to find a job in Marketing here since you have to speak German. 

So, I've been studying German and this September finally got my Goethe Zertifikat B2. And found an internship in Marketing.

But since everything is in German there and my level is not advanced yet it takes me more time to make work done than for a German speaker or for someone with a higher level. So the internship is finished, but since I didn't do every task, they gave me the possibility to finish them. 

So, finally, my question is: When I apply for a job, does the company write to this other company, where I did my internship, to ask for a review on me? And if yes, how bad is it, that I couldn't make everything on time?

Thanks in advance."

I am currently working towards improving my technical skills in preparation for internship applications. I want to intern summer 2022 so I will likely begin applying this August.  I would greatly appreciate some guidance regarding the steps necessary to be a competitive applicant for internships. 

I am currently a third year computer science major. My GPA is a 3.51 but I intend to raise it to a 3.55 by the end of this semester. 

I am competent in the following: 

\- Java and Python but I am doing a thorough review of data structures and algorithms this semester. 

\- I am comfortable with MySQL and I have used MS SQL Server. 

\- I regularly use HTML/CSS/JavaScript in my classes.

\- I am taking a class that requires me to use HTTP/REST APIs and I should be comfortable with that fairly soon.

My questions are as follows:

1. During the seven months leading up to when I begin applying, what additional technical skills should I work on developing? Based on your experience, what do you recommend knowing?
2. What should my skill set look like by the time I begin submitting applications? I know that I need to have OOP and data structures/algos down pat but what are the most important tools/skills to possess in order to be a strong candidate?"

If this was a larger firm then I wouldn’t be worried about dealing with the same recruiter for multiple positions but I think in this case it’ll be the same person looking at applications for both. So should I apply to both or only one?

I'm taking non-degree graduate classes in CS this semester to fulfill prerequisites for a Master's program, and I will be enrolling Fall '21 in an MS or ME program (already have one strong admit).  I spent 2012-2015 programming full time at startups before getting into music, so I do have a lot of programming experience, including in ML and NLP, but I had not done much coding recently until I enrolled in classes this past Fall '20.

I'm effectively starting from scratch in this career, so I would really like to find an internship in the field for this Summer '21, even if unpaid, to get my resume going and my foot in the door.  Where is the best place to start looking for these positions?  I'm located in New York, should I try to volunteer in university labs in my area, or am I better off looking in industry? What are the best websites or job boards for these types of opportunities and internships?

Thanks for the help!"

i became interested in computer science in 6th grade, my middle school had a code club so i was apart of that till i finished middle school, starting 7th grade i started to learn more about cybersecurity. once i got into high school i signed up for the compsci 1 class, my teacher than switched me to the compsci 2 class, since i knew most of the subject mater in compsci 1. i also joined cyberpatriot (open division) my freshman year- i quickly moved up to my schools “A team” and i became the highest scoring member. i continued this by taking ap comp sci principles my sophomore year, cybersec and ap compsci my junior year. i couldn’t take any classes my senior year but i got my certification in cybersecurity and networking through my school, i also stayed in cyberpatriot and i got to teach lessons to other team members. so far it seems obvious that i should major in something with computers and what not, but i really want to go into the liberal arts( i participate in a lot of writing competitions, i am apart of my school’s mun and current events team, i also have two internships at two art museums). i noticed this year(my sr year) that i found computer science kinda boring and that i wasn’t very enthusiastic about it, it was just something i was doing. i just feel like i have this burden to major in computer science bc it is the only subject in school where i excel. and i was just wondering if anyone in this community could give me some advice on if i should stick with comp sci or go the liberal arts way or maybe both?? i’m just kinda lost"

For the coding question, it was a binary tree problem, probably easy on LC, and I felt good about it. Right as time was ending I finished up what I am pretty sure is an optimal solution (since the email I have gone back over the code I wrote and checked it for accuracy). I correctly answered what the time and space complexity was and the interviewer wished me luck and signed off.

I'm a bit at a loss because I thought I crushed the interview and I was fully expecting an offer. Does anyone have ideas as to why I could've been incorrect in my assumption? I got \~3/7 on OA1 and half the test cases in OA2 but I figured if I made it to the final interview then my OA performance wasn't keeping me from an offer yet.

I am switching careers from teaching into CS, with a transition date in the Fall of 2023 - i.e. I would  begin looking for jobs in June 2023, midway through my M.S. I would complete my M.S. in December 2024. 

I began programming when we went into lockdown, using CS50 as a guideline for what to cover and doing a lot of learning on my own through udemy classes that relate to CS50's individual lectures. I am not done wth CS50, but that is just because I am really trying to learn the content thoroughly rather than just haphazardly doing the PSETs. I want to build a solid programming foundation.

**My question is this: What do I focus on when I begin pursuing my degree in Fall 2021 in order obtain the best job possible?** I have a limited schedule in some ways, including that I teach from 8 - 3 and teach an after-school class twice a week (I can't drop this because this is how I pay the bills). I also need time to exercise, cook, spend time with my soon-to-be wife, have some relaxation, and just do normal things. I am not against hard work; I work *really* hard, but I also find it unrealistic to say that my day will only be programming and teaching. That's not a (healthy) way to live. 

I have 2-3 quality, productive hours a weeknight, and 5-6 quality, productive hours a weekend. Again, I could say that I spend ""12 hours a day"" coding on weekends or some shit, but - let's be real.

**So what do I focus on? Getting a high GPA? Building projects? Some mixture of both?** **What mixture of both?** Right now, I am spending all of my productive hours coding but - with the CS coursework - I know that can't spend all my productive hours just coding (as I know that CS is not necessarily about just coding).  Thoughts?

Perhaps this is just a product of me being at home rather than on campus but frankly, I have not witnessed any of the college’s advantages in terms of recognition. I have thought about transferring to another school entirely, where I feel I’d probably have more success in getting an internship or securing a job.

ky5fkc,11,2021-01-15,"UK based - 11 Months after leaving my hardware role, finally got a job offer for a Data Science position!",Mrfazzles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ky5fkc/uk_based_11_months_after_leaving_my_hardware_role/,"So after being made redundant at the end of February 2020 and wanting to make a transition from Hardware to Software, I finally got a job offer and will be starting as a Data Scientist at a London based startup on Monday!

I thought I'd share my experience. 

So my background was as a hardware verification engineer of 3 and half years and I have a masters in electronic engineering and did a few electronic related internships. I really liked my job as a verification engineer, it was a great team, interesting work, but if I'm honest, the salary and progression wasn't as attractive and I had a feeling for a while that I'd do better in software. 

So March last year I started a 16 week full stack Web development course on Coursera exploring Javascript, React, Node, MongoDB alongside a pure javascript course on Udemy. The full stack course was a great course but by the time I'd completed it, maybe because the project was fairly boiler plate, I wasn't sure backend or frontend development was where I could see myself doing and at that time I figured, why not just keep learning? 

So then I started a short Udemy course in Data Science and really felt it was an area I could see myself doing long term. I picked up a few more Udemy courses, strengthening by Python, learned SQL, learned Tableau and started reading books on machine learning and Data Science Python packages. 

After completing a bunch of the Kaggle microcourses that I was really enjoying I found that the content creator had also helped Udacity form their nanodegree programmes. The 3 month nanodegree looked pretty appealing, but expensive. They partner with AWS and Kaggle and give you guided projects and a capstone project. So In June I took a free trial for a month. A few weeks go by and I'm really hating the course, the concepts are fine but understanding the AWS sagemaker API at the same time as seeing new machine learning concepts is an incredibly dry subject matter and it sapped my motivation. Up until now I'd been doing 4 or so hours of learning a day and this was pushing me to procrastinate and do nothing. At the end of the month I'd completed most of the modules and learning notwithstanding the capstone project and guided projects and was going to cancel but they hooked me with a pretty good deal so I figured it could be worth having some projects on my portfolio. That's when things got really enjoyable. The capstone project I chose was a customer segmentation project that involved lots of data cleaning, data science, unsupervised machine learning and supervised learning. I ended up taking six weeks on that project - costing another month of subscription - it was probably worth it though because the final model I submitted into a Kaggle contest ended up coming first place! I figured, if ever a personal project or mooc course could be taken seriously this would be something worth shouting about. 

At this time it was the end of August, so I'd officially been out of work 6 months and I was now starting to apply for Data Science roles... And getting absolutely nowhere. My partner has a background in Design and Copyrighting and helped me massively with the presentation of my CV and Coverletter but I was hearing nothing, despite applying for everything. 

While applying for jobs I continued my learning. I managed to get financial aid from Coursera to complete there 16 week Tensorflow course which I found really underwhelming. I'd highly recommend a book called 'Deep Learning by Francois Chollet' instead. I finished the first part of an advanced Python Deep Dive course by Fred Baptiste on Udemy which is absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend to anyone, at any level of learning Python and I picked up a book of SQL practice problems since even though I'd learned the syntax I wasn't too confident on my querying. 

As October came round more recruiters were being quite candid with me that without a masters in machine learning or a PhD. Companies, at this time, wouldn't be interested. Covid had created a real buyers market for Data Science and Machine learning roles. 

So I started building my software skills more to see if I could get a Python developer role. I read Test Driven Development by Kent Beck and worked through the examples in Python with PyTest. I took out a Leetcode subscription for a month and was doing a few hours most days. I really don't like Leetcode. I know it gets a lot of praise on here but to be honest I think it's teaching side is poor and found myself using other resources to learn the theory of algorithms and data structures. I was getting ok these areas but still finding I'd fail a Codility coding assessment which was incredibly frustrating given I have 3 and half years experience writing object oriented code. 

In December I focused on learning Flask. I found it really difficult to motivate myself. I think learning Web Development can be quite difficult because the projects are pretty boiler plate and I was just learning the same sort of functionality and theory of my first course but in a different language and framework. Also, the book I bought on Flask was in my view not easy to follow. I did however find a great course on Udemy that combined Flask with a few tools like Docker, Redis, Cucumber and PyTest to build a more complex application and that was going pretty well until I finally lost a lot of general motivation and drive over Christmas with the continued and sustained job rejection and feeling overwhelmed by all the different areas I was trying to learn and feeling like I either wasn't giving enough time to any of them or unsure whether any them would actually help get even a foot in the door. I'd had a few really promising interviews in late November, early December, but was then getting radio silence which probably contributed to this. 

First week of January comes round, New year, new me. I pour more energy into writing a script of my professional experience up until now and at my previous roles, walking through all my technical experience. I practice this script with my partner, getting the delivery natural and relaxed. I start applying to as many roles as I can. Having spoken with dozens of recruiters and my CV having gone through a number of iterations, I have built a good idea of what's made me interesting to companies and what I need to promote and showcase more of. For the first half of my job applications I was definitely underselling myself and not appreciating how verification engineering comes across. From listening to the Pragmatic Programmer, I realised that a lot of what I had been doing had been software so I started to really tone down any language that might suggest I was making a big transition and outlined my software experience. On recruiter calls I would take the time to talk increasingly longer about what verification entailed and tried to position myself as essentially an overlooked diamond in the rough. I rebuttled any concerns about not having 1-2 years of 'relevant' commercial experience by hammering my achievements and abilities and the highlighting the reputation of my last company. 

Finally last Friday I had a zoom interview with a startup who wanted a Python developer with some Data Science capabilities. We talked through my experience, they were really interested and impressed with my Udacity capstone project, the customer segmentation was relevant to the company and they liked my discussion of why I'd made certain decisions when cleaning and analysing my datasets which I offered as the core reason I'd been able to do so well in the Kaggle contest. I did my research and really dug into the company, which is something I really enjoy doing anyway so that wasn't too difficult. On Monday I got a call from the recruiter, saying the interview has gone well and I was their favoured candidate moving forward, they were keen to move to a final stage test. Tuesday, they give me a call and say they want to forgo the final test and make me a job offer! Today I signed, and next Monday I'm starting as a Data Scientist!!!

I'm absolutely ectastic and nervous with acute imposter syndrome. But, from what they want me to do, I think I can do it and I'm determined to demonstrate my value and secure my future in this field. 

It's been an 11 month journey and it's been tough. If I hadn't had my partner to support me financially and emotionally I think I would have thrown in the towel. I really don't envy any 2020 grads or people in my position but hopefully my experience is a useful insight. 

Happy to answer any questions.

ky72li,39,2021-01-15,Data on number of applications vs. interviews vs. offers that I got.,Alternative_Aioli_76,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/ky72li/data_on_number_of_applications_vs_interviews_vs/,"I know that navigating internships and co-ops can be a tricky world for many of you, so I decided to track exactly how many applications I sent out, number of applications that required a cover letter, number of interviews I got, and the number of job offers that I got from those interviews. I am hoping that maybe this will help some of you temper your expectations or (if you are very similar to myself) then what to expect going into this internship season.

Major: Civil Engineering

GPA: 3.59

Experience: Small mechanical engineering internship about 2 years ago

Number of applications submitted: 23

Number of applications that required cover letter: 19

Number of Interviews: 8

Number of Job offers: 2

Of those two offers, one offered me $20 an hour and the other offered me $17 an hour. I actually accepted the $17 an hour one and rejected the $20 an hour one. Why? Well I currently live in California and while $20 an hour is more, the $20 an hour job is located in California while the $17 an hour one is located in Michigan. I plan to leave California shortly after graduation and the $17 an hour one might turn into a real job in a state where the cost of living is much much lower, so the buying power of what I would make with an engineering job in Michigan would be much better than in California.

Also, the $17 an hour one allowed me to CHOOSE MY OWN HOURS (not kidding), work entirely remotely (obviously, they're in Michigan). They offered to buy me a new desk, a new laptop for work alone, a few monitors for working, and dental insurance. The company in California offered me none of these things and would require me to come in 3 days a week while still in school. It was no competition, the company in Michigan was the clear choice.

If you have any questions or want to hear more information about how I got these offers from a relatively low application count, ask below."
ky73l5,0,2021-01-15,"What is ""Normal"" in Terms of Working on Relevant Projects During an Internship?",nayyytan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ky73l5/what_is_normal_in_terms_of_working_on_relevant/,"When I started my internship, I was told I would be working on embedded Linux systems and OS development for the R&amp;D department.

I started my internship just under 2 months ago, and have since been solely working on programing Allen Bradley PLCs with ladder logic and occasionally assembling / wiring components for other projects. Before 2 months ago, I had never even heard of ladder logic, and to be honest I really dislike it. I enjoy figuring out the logic and seeing physical examples of the progress I've made, but I would much rather be working on something relevant to my major and future career. I quit my previous job for this which payed double what I'm getting now, so I'd like to know if I'm getting value out of it.

So I am curious what a ""normal"" amount of relevant work/projects would be for an internship? Is the work I'm doing helping my job prospects at all? Should I start looking for another company if nothing changes in the next few months?

I graduate in the Fall so I would like to have something useful on my resume before I start applying for full-time, but I'm not sure what would be considered ""useful"" as far as internships go.

Any advice or experiences at all would be awesome. Thanks!"
ky8e1l,0,2021-01-15,Is it unethical to keep applying after having accepted a job offer and signed the offer letter? Is there a chance my prospective employer will find out?,NYThrowaway7544,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ky8e1l/is_it_unethical_to_keep_applying_after_having/," 

TL;DR at bottom

Hi everyone,

This is something I normally would not consider doing, as I personally think it's unethical, but I want to give some context as to why I'm considering applying and interviewing again.

I'm currently a college senior, and I interned with a medium-sized company here in my college town over the summer, and I was fortunate enough to receive a great return offer with a very high salary for where I'm currently living. I accepted the offer last fall semester. I had a girlfriend at the time of my internship, and she broke up with me before the internship ended. This wasn't my ideal company to work for, to be honest, but with the current job market and the starting salary, I decided this would be a good starting place for my career.

Before we broke up, She got into a grad-school in a very large and famous city halfway across the country and I was to follow her to said city and begin my career there. She would have started grad school Fall of 2020 but she deferred because of COVID, so she will now begin grad school this coming Fall.

We ended up getting back together in November, but I signed and accepted this offer when we were apart, and I honestly did not think we were going to get back together. So now I am faced with the dilemma of applying for jobs in this large city to try and live with her for a couple of years and reneging my offer, or try and do long-distance for 1-2 years, begin my career with this company, and reunite later.

I've actually already submitted a handful of applications to some companies in this large city, and got sent a hackerrank by a big fintech company in the area this morning. I haven't replied though as I'm unsure of what to do. As I've said before, the company that I have this signed agreement with is the company I interned with last summer, and I have them on my resume. Let's call this company A, and an employer in the big city company B.

I'm really scared of the possibility that at some point during the interview process company B will find out that not only I interned with company A, but also accepted a job offer from them, tell company A about trying to interview with them, and get my offer from company A rescinded and company B rejects me. I'm nervous that other companies that I apply to that get into contact with company A will then always get a bad word of mouth that I went behind their backs, and make it really hard for me to get a job.

I'm still young and my career is important to me, I do care about her, but I'd rather not burn bridges. I guess my question is, is accepting an offer and continuing to apply to other companies more common than I think? If company A were to find out, would it be acceptable to say that my partner is moving to a large city and I'm looking for opportunities to be with her? We aren't married or anything of the sort. What are the chances that company A will find out that I'm applying to places in this large city? Thank you.

TL;DR: Had girlfriend who got into grad school across the country during my summer internship, she broke up with me, accepted return offer from company I interned with while broken up. We got back together, she wants me to look for a job in the big city to move with her. Is it unethical to look for these opportunities even though I've signed the offer letter? Since I interned with the company I accepted an offer with, they are on my resume. What are the chances they will find out that I'm looking for opportunities elsewhere? Thanks."
ky8h7s,9,2021-01-15,Qualifications for Amazon Interviewer?,bombedamazon2021,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ky8h7s/qualifications_for_amazon_interviewer/,"I recently had my interview for Amazon SDE intern and I was wondering if there's standardized qualifications/training for interviewers? I'm asking because I had a drastically different experience compared to my friends and what I've seen on this subreddit. To start, I've heard that Amazon prides themselves on making the interview process enjoyable but my interviewer was cold and standoffish the entire time. During the technical question portion he also seemed to be a little bit confused, I was continually validating my approach from talking about it to pseudocode and he interrupted me to tell me to start coding. Once I coded my entire solution and was running through a test case, he pointed out an edge case I was missing which I fixed. After that he created three more cases which we ran through and they all worked. At that point there was around 3 minutes left when he suddenly said ""we're out of time but you should have used an array"". He did mention that he only started at Amazon 2 months ago which is surprising because I feel like that wouldn't be enough time for you to understand the Amazon culture to the point of evaluating someone else.  


Full disclosure I was rejected 19 hours later so maybe I'm just a horrendous candidate lol"
ky936z,1,2021-01-15,I have an interview with a big company that I would love to work for but don't know how qualified I am for the position. How can I better leverage my strengths?,scaupcarron,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ky936z/i_have_an_interview_with_a_big_company_that_i/,"There's this tech company that I have been keeping tabs on and applying to occasionally over the year. I finally reached out to a recruiter whose name was given to me by a current employee. I asked her about the position I had applied to about a month ago and if she had any suggestions on standing out among the hundreds of applications they get for every position. She sent me a different open position (marketing role) and suggested that I apply because some of my resume experience matched the job description.  This is a position that I would absolutely love to have, but my experience in many of the related skills is very novice. 

I am used to interviewing at this point and discussing my strengths and eagerness to learn new things, but because this is a dream company, and I know the competition is stiff, I am just wondering how I can better leverage my current skills/ experience and work ethic to make it to the next round.

As a little background, I am a recent business graduate in marketing but I have held a few different marketing roles at internships and temp work."

Which do you think looks better to top CS Universities like UC Berkeley, CMU and UT Austin (in-state non-auto admit for this one)? I currently have an opportunity to do research with a professor at my local university starting this week (also happens to be a CMU alumni). However, I also want to do an internship this summer in something related to software/mobile/web development to gain some work experience. I could theoretically do both during the summer, but I’m not sure how sustainable that is. What are y’all’s opinions on CS-related research and internships, and which looks better to top 10 CS universities?"

I'm a freshman in CS in coe, and was wondering what I should do over the summer? I don't have loads of programming experience(I've did well in cs 1110, but that course makes up the majority of my cs experience). I plan to take cs 2110 this spring. Does it make sense for me to apply to internships at this point? Or would I benefit from taking this summer to further advance my programming skills on my own time/ take courses? I just don't want this summer to be put to waste--what can I do to make the most of my time?

Also, does it make sense to try getting into research at this point?"

The thing is, i recently found some reviews on this company and 2 people have said that all of the engineers/devs are interns. That there is no formal training or onboarding process either. 

Would it still be worth the time to try it out for the next 2-3 months just to have something on my resume?"

I get paid around 40k a year working 32 hours a week. But my dream is to be a software engineer and after hearing from my peers that the starting salary for software engineers is around 70k realistically, I think that it would be a good idea even if i take out about 30k of student loans if needed. I recently started my semester and I have noticed that this job is time consuming and some weeks I can work 40 hours a week and my classes are quite demanding. I have around 10k in my 401k and 2k in stocks that I can cash out before I quit. I currently don’t pay rent, and only have a phone bill and light bill to pay. My plan is to take out student loans for other living expenses and doing postmates, ubereats, instacart, to fill in some of the gaps. I can also study and obtain paid internships throughout this time I have two years left to graduate and I am planning to focus all my time on studying to obtain a job at a top company. Is this a bad idea?"

kyftl9,1,2021-01-16,How do I regulate the difficulty of my life again?,BewitchedHare,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kyftl9/how_do_i_regulate_the_difficulty_of_my_life_again/,"Not talking about how COVID-19 made everything harder, although that might be interesting as well.

Several factors have brought me to the belief, that only hard things are valuable in life. Because of this logic I ended up studying Bioinformatics. The computer science part is much larger than the biology part which I enjoy more.  It's not like I hate CS, however I dislike most people that teach it. The exam phases have always been hell, and I haven't had many real breaks, since there are so many mandatory internships over here in Europe.  I just turned 26, and have one last year of Uni ahead of me (not that unusual in Europe), but I know that I can't keep doing this longer than this one year. I really need clear breaks. It's fine if I have to work nine hours, as long as I get to go home with no work left, but right now there is always work left to do.

I just want to be done with it, and I am worried that any love for CS and coding that I might have had in the past, was crushed by all the homework assignments and mandatory internships during breaks where my friends went on vacation without me.

Another issue is, that I have trouble teaching myself. For me, it was always best when someone experienced took the time for my questions. Now I get assignments that I have to fix with the help of friends that also don’t know the right way. Often we just end up asking one of the genius kids to help us, but then we can’t claim that we solved the problem ourselves. I don't want the rest of my life to look like this. I am obviously not stupid since I will manage to get this degree, but I hate the thought of this lifestyle continuing. So I am getting by, but I always hate the process, since often it wasn't honestly earned by me. It wouldn't be such an issue if I could just reuse something I already know, but I am constantly forced into new classes where a lot of the previous knowledge is redundant. (I only hate it when it's homework or assignments from the Uni. It's no issue for me to fix something broken at home.)

How can I get out of this and chose a job that will not cause me to hate what I do?"
kyhmme,36,2021-01-16,Burned out/ not doing what i am supposed to be doing.,Ch3w_Ch3w_Train,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/kyhmme/burned_out_not_doing_what_i_am_supposed_to_be/,"Hi everyone,  


I (26m) actually got the idea to write this post because i was giving advice to someone else on reddit about something and they really seemed to find it helpful so I thought why not give it a shot myself.   
Currently I am in the final year of my 2 year college course and so far it has been relativly smooth sailing apart from some stressful situation due to faulty ( or basically no) planning, i aced nearly every project we had to do. But for the last few weeks i have been so burned out/unnmotivated. My country is currently in more or less total lockdown and so i can't do any of the things i used to do for fun/stress release and i think it is really starting to get me as i see posts on social media describing symptoms of anxiety and depression and recognize those in my day to day life.   


Also i have started my graduating internship and the thought of having to do it all from my bedroom ( due to lockdown) stresses me out and has me thinking I will not be able to complete it properly. I am currently taking some adhd meds but since i don't really know what to focus on i just spend hours hyperfocusing on social media and stuff.   


I do plan to have a talk with my teachers about it in a few days. I am aware of the pomodoro technique for productivity and that has worked in the past to some degree but it does not help with motivation. Also i am not sure if I am actually looking for advise ( it's quite simple ""just start doing your work"") or that i just needed to vent.

Kind regards."

kyi7op,1,2021-01-16,How can I stay motivated and sane when what I want is so close yet so far away?,pleximia747,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kyi7op/how_can_i_stay_motivated_and_sane_when_what_i/,"Within the last year I (24 f) have really figured out what I want to do and now I have a very clear image of what my ideal life would look like: a house in the countryside, working as a midwife, getting married, having a dog, just very simple and relaxed living. 

My current life though is very different from that: I live in the city in a small apartment and I am very stressed all the time. The thing is, I need to stick it out for at least a year and 4 months, because that's when I'll graduate. And in order to be a midwife, which is my absolute dream job, I need to graduate. 

It's just really hard because my life is so far from what I want it to be and I know that it is actually attainable. My boyfriend's grandmother died recently and she left him her country house and an old friend of my mom works as a midwife in that area and I can work for/with her once I'm done with university. It's just insane how perfect that would be and I cannot wait to finally live that life!

Even though I have this goal, it's getting harder and harder to actually motivate myself as the whole situation is making me literally sick. The city is literally making me sick, especially since I'm locked in my apartment all day during covid, except for twice a week when I can go to my midwife internship. I dream about what my life could look like two years from now all the time.

Anyone have advice on how to keep staying motivated and not lose my mind when what I want is so close? I don't want to feel like I'm wasting my time here for the next 1 1/2 years, but that's the way I feel at the moment."
kyjumo,1,2021-01-16,How did non-competes affect you as an EE trying to grow your career?,comfortcube,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/kyjumo/how_did_noncompetes_affect_you_as_an_ee_trying_to/,"I'm right now just an intern at a company, and the internship lasts until I graduate. However, part of the employee agreement I signed was a non-compete clause that stated a 6 month-non-compete period after termination that primarily bars me from working with other employers in a similar industry (they listed many). Now my plan/hope is to continue with the company full-time after my internship, especially because I really like the place so far and I'm graduating right when the internship ends, but if that doesn't happen, then I guess I have to find a job in another industry. What I'm confused about is I hear the advice that while you are a young engineer, it's a good idea to move through a few companies to get diversified experience and build up that depth of skill and knowledge in the industry. However, with non-competes, how does that work? What did you experience?"

kykden,19,2021-01-16,Fruiting Body,criterion_infection,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kykden/fruiting_body/,"As my mom drove me to my first sleepover, it occurred to me that none of my toothbrushes had ever left the house before, and now one was coming with me to the bad part of town. It was my best friend’s birthday, and his mom let him invite one friend to spend the night. I said goodbye and ran up to his third-floor apartment.

We spent the day watching movies on VHS. My friend was born in late December, so it was nearing sunset when the pizza lunch arrived. We ate, and he opened his presents after cake and ice cream. Afterwards, his mom abruptly handed him a six pack of soda and box of pizza and told us to go to his room.

My mom had always found his a bit off, but I thought that she was just cooler and less strict. My mom definitely would never have let me sleep over if I had told her what was in his room. A bracket was screwed into either side of the door frame, and he slid a plank of wood into them to barricade us inside. I had never seen him do it before, but he had explained to me that it was to keep burglars out. His mom had never let me stay past sunset before, and she had taken a lot of convincing to allow the sleepover, even more than mine. He closed the curtains, turned the light off, and we sat on the end of his bed and played video games. His mom had finally given him a PlayStation, and I brought the copy of “Twisted Metal 4” that I had received for Christmas and a controller.

“Hey man, I lied,” he said.

“You mean you don’t get into shootouts with the robbers who are always breaking in?”

He exhaled in a way that could generously be interpreted as laughter. “There are no robbers. The barricade is for ghosts.”

“Ghosts?”

“They come every night.”

“And that plank of wood stops them?”

“Yeah.”

“But you can’t barricade the apartment door to stop them from coming in at all?”

“No, it only works on bedrooms.”

“So have you seen them?”

“I saw them on our first night here after moving in. My mom didn’t believe the landlady, and we were watching TV in the living room after dark. The door was locked, but a ghost just came in.”

“What did it look like?”

“You know the Halloween costume that’s just a sheet with holes cut out for eyes?”

“Yeah.”

“Like that, but with no holes for eyes and nobody under the sheet.” I lost it. The image of a sheet ghost was too funny to keep politely humoring him. “Yeah, it sounds funny, but you weren’t there.”

“So what did it do?”

“It floated over to us. My mom got between me and the ghost, and it just floated into her. One side lifted itself up over her head, and she was covered. Then she just stood there. I tried calling her, and pulling her arm, and taking the sheet off, but nothing worked. She just stood there. Then I caught a glimpse of the window. Everything was different. We were somewhere else. I got closer and looked down at the street. There were more ghosts coming. I ran. I left her out there with the ghosts. You know that she’s different, but it wasn’t like that before. We moved, that happened, and then I started school with you guys. I know that things were rough at first because I was so weird, but then we became friends.”

“Because one day at snack time you ate room-temperature butterscotch pudding out of your desk with a protractor. That was awesome.”

The subject changed and the conversation moved on, but I kept wondering why his mom would only barricade the bedrooms if robberies were a concern. It wasn’t long before I heard a bang on the door. “What the hell was that?” I asked.

“I told you,” he said. The next bang was so loud that I thought it would break the plank. I jumped off the bed and backed away from the door, towards the window. “Don’t get too close to the window!” he shouted. “We’ll be fine if we just stay here. Can’t you just sit with me? Everything’s fine.” He didn’t look at me for a long time, and pixel-lit tears rolled down his cheek as we continued playing.

We went to sleep early that morning, but the bangs kept waking me up. He slept through them. I thought about playing video games until the sun rose, a then-unrealized dream of mine, but I was drawn to the window. I parted the curtains and peered out. His building was on the corner of an intersection, and I saw lines of ghosts coming from every direction towards the front door. They did look like the cheap Halloween costume.

I was sure that I wasn’t on Earth anymore, or at least that the world outside wasn’t Earth. The stars were too close and too dark. The twinkling scintillations of the constellations that I knew were now earthworm writhings. Only a pane of glass protected me from their cold, dim light.

We were learning about the scientific method in science class before vacation, and I wanted to test my hypothesis. I was going to toss something out the window to see if it would still be there in the morning. There was pizza, but a rat could drag a slice away. A can of soda could be blown away by the wind. I walked into his en suite bathroom, which had seemed luxurious before it proved necessary, and took the toilet brush. I struck my arm out the window and dropped it into the side yard. When I retracted my arm, it felt different. I closed the window and curtains and tried to go back to sleep. There were no more bangs after that. I stayed awake the whole night.

When normal sunlight brightened the room, I looked out the window. The toilet brush was gone. My friend was awake when I turned from the window. He went to the bathroom, and, when he came back, he knew. We didn’t talk much. At breakfast, his mother could tell that her attempt to do something nice for her child had just made things worse. She was like a wooly mammoth struggling against a tar pit; her every attempt to change her fate only hastened it. I called my mother and asked her to pick me up. My friend walked me out.

“You owe me a toilet brush,” he said.

“I hope that your uncle never gets out of jail,” I said.

“I want to help you, but I don’t know how.” That’s what he should have said.

“I want to help you, but I don’t know how.” That’s what I should have said.

My mother could tell that something had gone wrong, but she was glad to be rid of them. After getting home, I looked at my arm. When I put it next to my other arm under a bright light, I saw a difference in color that I didn’t think I was just imagining. You can’t hide your dominant hand forever, though, and my mother soon noticed that it had greened.

My mother brought me to the doctor, and I lied and said that I didn’t know what had happened and felt fine. The doctor said that it was probably nothing. When I went back to school after vacation, most of the kids didn’t even notice. The hot gossip was that my best friend wasn’t my friend anymore, then what a loser my former best friend was, and finally what a friendless loser he was. I ignored his pudding-based attempts at reconciliation. I felt bad that all of our mutual friends had chosen me, but I could never make myself believe that my arm wasn’t a problem long enough to forgive him.

The truth was that my arm was changing. It was the feeling of having water in one’s ear, but in my arm. There was something in me that wasn’t me. As that something wove itself into the tapestry of muscle fibers in my arms, I became aware of a labyrinth of nerves the existence of which I had never suspected the same way that people who have never had tonsillitis don’t realize that their mouths are full of tonsils.

My fingernails stopped growing. It was fine when I just didn’t have to clip them anymore, but, as I grew, my childlike fingernails took up less and less space on my teenage nail beds. Each one became infected, and nothing grew back after the nails fell out. The green tint became more prominent, and my mother sent me to more doctors. We were told several times that metal in jewelry can have that effect on skin. My mother informed them I didn’t wear a gauntlet that was turning my whole forearm green. After a series of tests, a specialist told us that I had a floral infection. There were plant cells in my arm. “You’re probably fine,” he said.

I started college as the freak without fingernails whose arm was the color of an unripe berry. My insecurity poisoned my interactions with my classmates, and I blamed it on my arm. I became incautious. I would walk too close to building or fences as I walked on the sidewalk just to scrape my hand or get splinters in it. I almost always wore long sleeves, but I would jog shirtless late at night to grind my arm against brick buildings hoping to get another infection. I held my arm out the window of moving vehicles to get out of this mess the same way that I had gotten into it.

The only person who really got me was my friend’s mom. He had cut contact with her by then, so I was the only one left who understood her. She had only gotten over the years. We mostly watched old cartoons on YouTube together. The fairy tales were our favorites. To cheer her up, I began to learn Flash to make my own animations. I adapted “Jack and the Beanstalk” to our present situation. I was Jack, and she my impoverished mother. I worked on the project for a semester before I was ready to show her one bright winter noon as we curled up under a sheet. Instead of trading a cow for magical beans, Jack butchers his own hand to cook a stew, but the mother catches him and tosses it out the window. That night, a vine grows from each joint. Jack wakes up the next morning and scales the green tower. When he passes the clouds, the sky is the sky of the other world. She stopped watching at that point and kicked me out. I never saw her face again.

I was still so proud of “Jack and the Starstalk” that I uploaded to YouTube under my real name. It gained a bit of traction, and some of the kids at my college saw it and liked it. I went from being the weird kid with a green arm to being the artist with a green arm. I found their admiration disarming, and I finally had friends. I made more videos and got more views, when led to internships, and, eventually, I graduated with a job offer.

Years later, I got an email from my friend’s mother. She told me that the apartment building going to be torn down and my last chance to see the “cursed stars” was fast approaching. I did want to see them, if only to thank them for giving me my most precious appendage. As a child, I knew that the arm wasn’t part of me, or even really mine, but I had come to regard it as a gift. I was even curious about the ghosts.

I sneaked into the building the day before its scheduled demolition. I left all of the doors and windows opened and sat where my friend’s bed had been waiting for the world outside to change. I fell asleep before the sun set. I figured that a ghost would wake me after nightfall.

I dreamed that I walked out of the bedroom and into the hallway. On the floor sat three bodies with their backs against the wall. Each had a sheet over his or her head. I shed a tear and prepared my goodbyes. I crouched before the closest of the three. Farewell my love! I would recognize the wine stains and cigarette burns anywhere, even if you never let me stay the night. I lifted the sheet to her neck, and there was no skin covering her abdomen. In the seat of her stomach there was only a flame that gently rendered her connective tissue and singed the surrounding organs. I blew the flame out and covered her. Farewell, my love! The tar will swallow you soon. The next body was covered in a Jetsons bed sheet, her son’s favorite cartoon. Farewell, my friend! The world hated you from the moment you first breathed its air! His fire lapped at the cinders of his half-burned heart. I blew it out and lowered the sheet. Farewell, my friend! I wanted to help you, but I didn’t know how. I lowered myself to the last sheet and saw myself reflected in the green satin. I didn’t have to raise the sheet to see the light blazing from my elbow.

I dreamed that I walked back to the bedroom. I had last seen the other sky in the winter, but it was summer now. The stars were gentler, and the ghosts stopped to smell the flowers. The trees of that world bore fruit without skin, each a hanging sacrifice unprotected. I sat by the window and watched the plants grow until I fell asleep. When I woke up back on Earth, my arm was hanging out the window. It was no longer green, and all of my fingernails had grown back. I stretched in the light of the rising sun.

The plant cells were still in me, dormant in my deepest. I knew that to see those ghosts, smell those flowers, and taste those fruits I would have to plant the seeds of that garden in this world. I exited the building. When the demolition crew was done threatening with a trespassing charge, I asked what would be built to replace the apartment buildings. “A sperm bank.”"

kymn00,1,2021-01-16,I thought I was helping my family and making our life better but now we're stuck and miserable,liannamae,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kymn00/i_thought_i_was_helping_my_family_and_making_our/,"I feel like so many people in the world are only out to scam you and if you need anything done you have to start from scratch and make it yourself- it's incredibly tiring to feel like you cannot trust and have to keep fighting people. I trusted my real estate agent and she encouraged me to buy a home 50% more expensive than I was comfortable with since it had two units. We are so new to moving and adulting that there were many many pitfalls we were blindsided by when we changed states- 

Our actual taxes and insurance ended up being more than double what everyone kept quoting us. Our new state taxes the shit out of our purchases, property,  AND our incomes. You can't fart without paying taxes here and yet they are letting crime and infrastructure go to shit. 

It is brand new home but in a sketchy side of town that I used to be comfortable in, but now crime is exploding thanks to coronavirus and I jump at every noise. It's also surrounded by a tow yard and big trucks are clanging all the time nearby. 

I think the guy that built the house didn't care at all about it and took shortcuts and did the bare minimum so we aren't even comfortable or feeling safe or happy with the house or have any peace that the house could protect us from bad weather or robbery or noises and even if we could rent it out I would feel worried that renters would hate it and move out ASAP because of all that. We are so far in debt and monthly payments I don't know how we're still making it so I tried to start a business and get business loans but I got scammed by a company that was supposed to help me do that they ruined my credit and charged me $5600 and counting for the privilege

My job hired me to work there and I moved to the state because they promised me monthly wage reviews to get me wages at least $1 per hour every month, but now that I make $16 and they put me on full time and pay tax and insurance I take home less than when I made $12 per hour as a paid intern and haven't had a wage review since being officially hired 4 months ago probably thanks to coronavirus losing us our biggest contracts.  I feel like I was hired because they thought I would be easy to take advantage of and overwork me for cheap too since I am doing a high skill technical job and wear many hats. Despite swearing and promising that they had millions of jobs for me to do and I had full job security, now it's feeling more and more like that's not true and not only am I not going to make any more money but also that my job is in danger 



The noise in my home is my biggest anxiety and causes me torture all day. I can't stand the loud banging and shouting and rattling and my heart tumbles and churns with every sound . If I was homeless at least I could give less of a crap about the noise because it wouldn't be chasing away people from renting in my home and chasing away my major income that I got sold this home for. I thought I was doing the best thing for my family and making an investment but it feels like we just bought a tombstone instead 


I feel like I'm trying to put out too many fires at one time while still fighting from getting scammed or suckered yet again and that there's supposed to be all these protections in place but nobody ever actually enforces them so you just end up screwed.  My body and face have visibly aged in the past couple months from this."

I’ll keep updating this as I hear back from places.

&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics**

• Gender: female

• Race/Ethnicity: white

• Residence: mountain west

• Income Bracket: 100k - 150k

• Type of School: public

• Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): underrepresented state, if that’s a thing? Otherwise, nah.

Intended Major(s): political science/public policy/ILR (Cornell)

&amp;#x200B;

**Academics**

• GPA (UW/W): 4.0/4.2

• Rank (or percentile): top 10%

• # of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 16 but only APs were weighted (had 9 of those)

• Senior Year Course Load:

AP Stat, AP Lit, AP Environmental, AP US Gov, band, dual enrollment German, debate

&amp;#x200B;

**Standardized Testing**

Perhaps this doesn't matter this year...

• ACT: 35(36E, 32M, 36R, 36S)

• AP/IB: AP Macro, APUSH, AP World, AP Lang (all 5s)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

It may be worth noting that 9th graders don’t go to the senior high (and I moved during that year). I still did some personally meaningful stuff, though, even if my ECs aren't curing cancer!

1.	President of Young Democrats (10-12) (did a lot of civic engagement projects)
2.	Founder/President of Model UN (11-12)
3.	Co-Captain of Speech/Debate (11-12) (won a few regional tournaments but nothing national)
4.	Peer counselor/intern on 7Cups (11-12) (got a lot of awards, over 200 hours counseling. also had a baby named after me, but that’s irrelevant.)
5.	Intern at \[local federal court\] (summer before 12) (did a lot of tasks. oversaw the second COVID era jury trial in the nation.)
6.	Campaign assistant for state representative (12) (lots of interesting experiences plus a bit of political organization! in their letter of rec they elaborate on this.)
7.	Legislative page to state house (12) (full time job on top of school, hecc yeah. 2021 is an interesting year for this.)
8.	Marching band (10-12) (two time state winners😤)
9.	Purveyor of deep fried poultry for a multi-million dollar company (aka: worked at Chick-fil-A as a summer job) (summer before 11)

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards/Honors**

(funnee joke haha)

1.	Selected to represent my state at the national Youth in Government conference
2.	Poetry published in some state publication thingy
3.	NHS
4.	Superior rating at solo/ensemble festival
5.	Varsity letter in debate

&amp;#x200B;

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: We were quite close! I think this letter was probably decent.

AP Lang teacher: Could’ve been alright, I suppose. My writing was frequently used as an example and we were friendly, but I wasn’t as close as some folks are to their recommenders.

AP Macro teacher: Pretty generic, definitely nothing super special. It was nice though!

State Representative: 10/10. My mom cried at it. It was a good supplement to the rest of my app and very personal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interviews**

Denison: probably about average. Lasted for about 45 min, and I felt a tad nervous, but it was a good conversation.

Carleton: went really well! I definitely bonded with my interviewer and it was very fun and relaxed.

Oxy: I felt as though I didn’t totally click with my interviewer, but hey, you win some, you lose some!

I have some other LAC interviews coming up, but I have not been invited to Ivy/Vandy interviews.

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**

I put a lot of time into my essays! (Granted, some were better than others). If I had to sum it up, I’d say they were for the most part either quirky, about politics in some manner, or both.

My CommonApp essay was an anecdote about how I inadvertently got pulled into investigating a prostitution ring on behalf of some private investigators while doing voter registration and ended up trying to register a prostitute to vote, and how it ties into my ideals of bravery and persistence. (Yep, that actually happened. Hopefully it’s memorable.)

I feel as though I’m generally a decent writer, but I’m probably around average when it comes to the college applicant pool.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information:**

At this point, it’s too early to know much of anything. I don’t expect a ton of acceptances; college admissions are unpredictable, but even so, I’m happy. I’ve gotten over my social anxiety in a big way these past few years, and I’ve worked to get involved in a lot of causes that are important to me, while having some absolutely crazily memorable experiences, for better or for worse. I plan to get even more politically involved in college! I’ll post more thoughts as I hear back more."

I'm worried that it will be too much for one semester, and that maybe taking ENGR 392 would be easier.

If anyone has any suggestions, it would be very much appreciated. Thanks!"

I really want to work for Google, but the only internship still open at Google is a technical writer internship. Would being a technical writer at Google help me get actual software engineering internships next year/jobs in the future? I don't think I want to be a technical writer, but who knows. Obviously who knows if I could even get the job, I'm not super qualified."
kyx2st,12,2021-01-16,"After multiple attempts and constant trauma, abuse of nearly every kind and abandonment, I just might do it again.",ChocolateDemiboy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kyx2st/after_multiple_attempts_and_constant_trauma_abuse/,"I usually would disclose my name when introducing myself, but for the sake of anonymity, I'm not. Just call me N. 

When I was born, I nearly died. According to my mother the umbilical cord wrapped itself around my neck 5-6 times and it was a struggle to take it off. It nearly choked me to death though sadly enough the doctors cut it off my neck just in time. I was born a female to my mother and biological father who probably didn't want me to start with, but we'll get to him later in the post. Growing up, my mother worked in education as a daycare worker and eventually grew up to be the head of reading coaches in her district. When I wasn't even three years old, she noticed as I was playing in the playground with the other children that I was limping extremely badly and wondered if something was up so she sent me to the hospital for an x-ray of my bones. Apparently a small hole had begun forming in my left hip and was the very beginning of hystosytosis, so she had to take a week off of work and I had to undergo surgery ASAP. Sadly even then I didn't die from the anesthesia they gave me when I went under the knife, survived, and began walking about three days later after the surgery. People called it a miracle. I really wish I had died then because the doctor said that was definitely  a risk and had I survived I would need serious physical therapy for months, if not longer. So there's that.

As I got older, it became apparent that I was struggling with some sort of neurodivergency that was initially first believed to be some form of ADHD due to me being unable to sit still in class and focus on what the teacher was saying. I was smart as a whip and I still am (I guess? Mom doesn't really think the same of me in that regard anymore), but when kt came to interacting with other kids, I struggled with nonverbal communication and facial expressions, as well as socialization with my peers and being quote on quote, """"normal"""" like them. 

This was when I began bouncing from school to school to find a good fit since teachers and students alike were beginning to treat me like shit because of my differences. I was put in timeout and in hallways for being unable to listen and focus, as well as being accused of things I never did and teachers siding with the bullies instead of me because some of the teachers didn't really like me or my mom because of how frequently she had to come up to my schools to defend me and clear up the bullying I dealt with almost all the time. I went to speech therapy at my second elementary school and was assisted by a rather racist white school therapist who accused me of being the victim because I got bullied all the time and didn't stand up for myself, even though a student tried to stab me the week before. She diagnosed me with Asperger's in 4th grade, but this was never officially diagnosed by a neuroscientist or anyone who works with behaviour. This did, however, give schools access to my IEP to take me out during classes to help me with my mental, social, and emotional issues. After my last year at this school, I moved to being homeschooled for a year by my mother and great grandmother, which actually went well for the most part. Learned more then than when I was in public school.

And then I got accepted into a private school (that is now closed thank god) for the rest of my junior high years. The school was quite small, maybe 30 people in every grade maximum. But even then, I was bullied, isolated, and ignored for my hyperfixations and being different. It began calming down around 8th grade, but it still didn't change the hurt. Just before I hit the 7th grade, I had came out to my mom as bisexual (long before I came out to her as a nonbinary trans man) and she immediately asked if I had gotten violated or if someone talked me into being bisexual. Confused, I said no. She then asked if I was sexually attracted to her or my sister and accused me of incest. Disgusted at this point, I said no. She immediately blamed me talking to my online friends during the time for influencing me to become bisexual and banned me from talking to them for years, though I consistently sneaked on when she wasn't looking. For background, she was raised a fundamentalist Baptist under my great grandfathers church and was raised to believe the homophobic, transphobic bullshit that the Bible spews. She was disgusted that I liked girls to say the least. This was when the verbal, emotional, and mental abuse began. 

When I graduated 8th grade, I began going to a center where I met other teens my age. This was when I met my very first boyfriend, we'll call him L. He was immediately smitten with me the moment he saw I was playing Pokemon (still a huge fan of it to this day) and wanted to date me and get to know me more. He had and still does have great qualities about him, but during the time he suffered greatly with DID, ADHD, bipolar disorder and autism, as well as anxiety and depression. And while I was not officially diagnosed with anything other than autism yet, I was dealing with gender dysphoria, depression, anxiett, and bad bad insonmia. His DID often came about in the form of alters, one alter in particular named Damien who often threatened suicide and verbally abused me. Keep in mind I wasn't even 15 yet when I began dating him. This also resulted in him becoming a giant bully, often cutting me off for months at a time until he felt like talking to me again and resulting in us getting into giant arguments. Due to my forgiving nature and believing people could changed, I forgave him multiple times. Over and over and over and over and over again. This also began to break my psyche.

When I was 14, I got into apprenticeships with other teenagers, my first program being a creative writing program. This was when I met the first trans person I ever knew who's name was Harmony. He was a white trans guy and he spoke vocally about his queerness and it always intrigued me. How could someone be so proud of something that is a choice and that God considered sin? (At this point I was pushed back into the closet by my homophobic and eventually transphobic mother. I was in denial). I began talking to him about it and luckily he was very open to answering questions. I asked him why did he identify as trans and why was he proud of it? How he discovered he was a man? After about an hour of us talking, I left with a lot of new knowledge and realizations about myself. I was never ecstatic about puberty. As a matter of fact it was absolutely horrifying to me, especially female puberty. I was an early bloomer so it made me hate it more when people mistook me for being much older than what I was and began sexualizing my body at a young age. Even if that wasn't happening, I did not like my chest and I DEFINITELY did not like having a period. I always wanted to be more like the men in physicality and in confident but I couldn't be. Why did I feel this way?

That's when it hit me. I'm fucking trans.

And I had to keep it from my family as long as possible.

Fastforward to when I was 15, I left the first high school I was at due to travel issues and attended an online school where I would eventually finish with a high GPA and honours. I attended a space for teens in a library and often went to their homeschool group and it was actually quite fun. I got to know so many different kinds of people there from all different races, nationalities, cultures, sexualities, genders and faith. It was so exciting to meet new people, new people that actually wanted to know me for me. This space was also a strong safe space for LGBTQIA+ people, and this was the time I began discovering different gender identites and sexualities. I began experimenting with multiple nonbinary identities and began identifying as pansexual before it was eventually tainted by family. This time around we were going on a field trip to a Zine Fest on the lower west side of the city, the type of fest that is predominantly filled with queer people. I loved it there. I bought a lot of merchandise that day, including a pansexual sticker that I had put on top pf my green flannel shirt. I went home with the sticker still on my shirt, completely forgetting to remove it before I got home. My parents eventually googled the colours of the sticker when I didn't tell them what it meant and my mother immediately began calling me a degenerate, saying I have no standards and would fuck animals and kids cuz I have no preference. Which incited an argument and having to explain to her I was also trans. She called me one of Satan's minions, brainwashed by media, and that I'll be an ugly tranny of a man. I was crushed. and my grandmother joined in on the throwing of slurs as well because their religion dictates I am going to hell for being who I am. They told me God doesn't want this in his plan and I need to abide by the Bible. I snapped off, saying I didn't believe in God and that God is a cruel God. They threatened to kick me out once I was 16 because it was legal in the state I live in and still currently live in, and that if I don't believe in God I'll be thrown into the streets. I was so scared and hurt by the abuse being thrown my way for coming out. I had my social media and technology taken away from me and couldn't get back on it for another year all because of this and she nearly took away my opportunity with a programming apprenticeship. My biological dad around this time, who had suddenly come back into my life, knocked up a bitch he barely knew and had the baby, preferring his new son to the son he already had that was trying his best to be a good member to society. He hasn't talked much to me since.

So for the sake of my safety, I became hyperfem and shoved myself back into the closet. I pretended to believe in God again and accept Christ into my heart just so they wouldn't hate me and kick me out. I am 16 at this point. I date men here and there as a cis appearing woman, but whenever I tell them I'm trans, they get disgusted and run away. Later that year, I graduate high school early and get sent off to a junior college to complete my gen eds and get a degree. I meet a man named Kenneth who approaches me in a bad boy esque way and a week later asks for me to marry him in the hallway of my college. My parents grow to like him and we end up traveling all around the city together. I was scared to tell him I wad trans until about three months later as he identified as a cishet man. It brings about major problems thay devolve into arguments and transphobia that I won't get into, as well as issues sexualizing my chest. We decide to take a break and this is when I meet my boyfriend now turned friend, Speedy. We hang out a lot and like each other a lot, but eventually that didn't work out as a romantic relationship either because of me being trans since he's not into men. 

At this point during my college career I am struggling in my classes because of managing a job and dealing with abuse at home, so I begin to fail. I eventually drop out in favor of working a full time job, but that never comes to fruition as I am unwillingly brought into a bank fraud scheme that took all the money I earned away from my account, forcing me to quit my job and close my bank account for good. I have nothing to do now and I am stuck at home with no education or job. My mother and father begins abusing me even more for losing the job, my money, and dropping out of college because of mental health reasons. I am called slurs yet again, lazy, unmotivated, fat, retarded (nice thing to say to an autistic kid, right) and a plethora of other insults and slurs. As well as shaming me for not having a job. I begin turning to self harm again and substances to cope with the dailt abuse and beratement. I still do to this day.

Come 2019, I discover a workforce program that honestly changes my life for the better that helps me gain the job skills needed to keep a job in the field of Information Technology. Even then, my parents stalk me, abuse me, and call me slurs recklessly for attending the LGBT club there and calling me demonic and evil for being a Luciferian witch during the time due to invading my privacy and actually calling up to one of the social workers I worked with during the time outting me as a witch. (According to my parents anyway. They've always been liars). Summer comes and I am promoted to an internship as a field technician at an esteemed university. But due to what happened for months before I got the internship plus the crippling dysphoria and suicidal ideation I was dealing with, I break down during my shift and attempt to slit my neck later that night. I eventually report this to my program and I am immediately hospitalized for five days. After coming out of the hospital, I am thrown into group therapy. Just to tell you, the doctors never acknowledged gender dysphoria as the cause for my issues, call it a cosmetic issue, and instead diagnose me with depression and psychosis, which doesn't help. My father then gets angry at me for my attempt, calling me evil, demonic, selfish, and self centered, among telling me that my transition is evil and doesn't matter and is selfish because of THEIR feelings and beliefs about it. So I ended up crying for the rest of the day about that.

Fast forward to the end of the year, I get accepted back into the program and begin interning somewhere else before the pandemic began. During 2020, I am forced to work from home remotely until June of 2020... during May of 2020, I had left my house to stay over my friends houses to escape their abuse and medically transition. During this time, I almost do start my transition but then they begin harassing me over the phone and blowing up my calls, commanding me I go home before police are called. I left my friends home before they actually did. I was so scared. 

I graduate my program in late July and begin job hunting with little to no luck until i come across a covid-19 contact tracing job that paid well, but due to shitty management and training, I lose the job in a matter of two months and get vehemently blamed for it due to mistakes I didn't know about and poor training that was not my fault. A month after losing my job, my grandpa dies of covid and my mom steals my money to pay his funeral expenses WITHOUT MY FUCKING PERMISSION. Back in April, my aunt died of covid so this was just another big blow. I have been two months without a job now or any sanity. My parents refuse to allow me to transition under their house and they don't care if I kill myself anymore or go into a shelter. Honestly I want to kill myself. For years I wanted hormones and surgery and all they did was abuse, silence, gaslight, and threaten me. Now their excuse is that I'm an adult. If I'm an adult then why can't I make an informed choice on my body? Why can't I at least attempt to be happy? I have been sniffing and consuming cleaning products to cope and have been crying myself to sleep every day and night for three months now. i want this pain to end. I already overdosed recently on bleach before and I might do it again. If I can't transition, I'll kill myself. I refuse to live as a woman any longer or with this pain of knowing I'll never be anyone's son, boyfriend, or nephew. I rather die than wait it out anymore. I should've died at birth. I should've died in surgery. I should've died when I was 12.

Tl;Dr My life is shitty and being trans, neurodivergent and mentally ill doesn't help."

All my childhood my parents have never let me go out anywhere without either one of them being with me. Either I would not be allowed to go or they had to be with me. Till I was 15-16, if I wanted to throw a birthday party they would tell me that they'll book a place or if I said that I just wanted to have a lunch with my closest friends then they would sit at a table near me. For movies with my till I was 18, my mother would tag along. Once when I was 15 and was invited to a friend's birthday at a restaurant, my father had dropped me off and upon seeing that there were no other parents just us kids, he immediately took me home. I didn't get to stay for even 5 minutes. 

There have been many more occassions like this. I was also not given the permission to leave my city for college. According to my mom, I had no idea how anything works. After multiple arguments, I stayed and was fine. Now my parents have want me to go to another country for further studies. But I still have no idea how anything works. 

I have started an internship at an organisation. It's sort of a young people only thing and everyone is about my age. We have an upcoming meeting and it would be held at someone's private residence. There would be around 20 people other than me. I asked my mom and she wants me to go with a driver who would stay out of the house the whole time I'm there. I really can't do this anymore. 

Till I was 18, my father had driven me everywhere. My parents refused to even let me go in the school bus because the stop was not right in front of our house. I was never taught or allowed to drive so my father took me to and from my coaching classes(that I had to convince my parents to let me go to) every day. While everyone else would come by their own vehicles, I would always have to be with my father. 

This would've been not as embarassing, if he didn't keep an eye on everything. I could not be late even if the class ran 5-10 mins longer because many times he came inside to ask me to come or called me multiple times so I had to leave class. I could not even talk to my friends after class. 

I do realise that my this is probably just a teen irritation. They are protective, I understand and love them for this because I know I'm lucky to have parents who are always there for me. But it is just too embarassing. I always cancel all my plans because of this. I don't know what to do.

 How do I convince my parents to let me go to the meeting at least if nothing else?"

I've been working hard and my results are excellent but if I disagree with a manager I argue with him/her, usually, I have better arguments and end up being right, which IMO brings me problems. I had 2 projects: in the first project, manager 1 was very incompetent and after such my behavior he started bullying me (senior manager was in CC of that emails), it lasted for about 2 months then after one email (from April the work is online) I sent him an email where I wrote everything I think about him, after that I was transferred to another project. Again, my results were excellent, I expected promotion, but in December 2020 I found out that I won't be promoted, another colleague with worse results, but whom a manager 2 likes, will be promoted. After this, I decided to change a project and the senior manager offered me a place in his project but there is no opportunity of promotion for at least 1 year. Then, after I agreed, he wrote an email where explained that I overestimate my results (without any proofs), I'm problematic and the possibility of my promotion is limited. CC of this email is a director, the most adequate person I saw here. I replied with an email where I objectively wrote reasons why I think that my results are excellent (and it's true: for example, the goal of the first project is to create a neural network for some purpose, and my net is considered as the best by everyone, although 6 people worked on this task including very experienced specialists) and I wrote why I think his opinion is biased - I had many arguments with him (again, usually I had better arguments and usually I'm right). He didn't reply to that email (because he didn't have arguments to prove my results are bad I guess). Several days ago, he wrote an email where announced the average-bad results of my 2020 evaluation (official procedure), also that I ""didn't seem to be able to keep good relations despite the different opinions"", and that ""opportunities for your future work and career promotion are limited"". I have a logical answer to this email: in short, there were no cases that I was toxic except that one email to bullying manager 1. And I have several options on what to do:

\- write this logical answer

\- write this logical answer but maximally ""smooth corners""

\- just say sorry

\- kinda ignore that email

The director is in CC and there is a possibility that he can help me if I'm totally mistreated so that email is mostly for him to see that I'm mistreated.

After all this, I'm going to leave the company anyway but I'm afraid it will take a long time for me to find the good job I really want (I need additional preparation), ideally I want to immigrate. Of course, I can choose a bad company that will probably accept me but this choice is bad too IMO. Now I'm going to work less and self-learn more, and want to do something to keep my position for a while (maybe it will take 6-12 months, maybe even more). What do you recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I dare to argue with managers (usually I'm right, but I never say no to orders, only argue), so they don't like me, and one of the managers evaluated me badly this year despite my excellent results, should I argue with him about my evaluation to increase my mark, or just say sorry, or ignore this, to minimize the risk of being fired? Should I argue with him about technical questions?"

I finished my studies like a year ago and for the last few months I've been working as an internship, doing some 3D stuff, modeling, animating, rendering. The thing is, even though the laptop had those problems, I could still work with it pretty good, it rendered fast,could handle all the programs I used with easy and also play videogames on high but since I started working in the internship it got veeery bad (I had to use my own computer) I think some of the components may be damaged from the usage, the rendering times have been doubled and games I could play on high or ultra have constant stuttering even when playing on low right now. I am so tired of this laptop, it gave me SO MUCH TROUBLE since the first day even though I took care of it so much, so I decided to build a new computer with the money I've been saving.

So for the last month I've been trying to build my own pc, I did some research and asked to some friends that know more than I do about this, but right now all graphic cards are out of stock so a few days ago I found this webpage where you could buy prebuilt computers but you could change every component and they had a lot of options for each one,not every option, but a lot and they told me I could have my computer in 2 -3 weeks   so I changed every piece to ones that I liked more and this is what I got:

ASUS GeForce RTX 3060 Ti DUAL OC 8Gb GDDR6  ( I was thinking about a 3070 but saw some benchmarks and for some reason the 3060 ti has better times when using blender which is the program  I use everyday, and for the 150 Euros of difference I didn't think it was worth it)

AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT 4.7Ghz 12-Core (for some reason the XT was cheaper than the X even though I think the XT is a newer model and just slighlt better than the X)

32Gb (4x8Gb) Corsair Vengeance LPX 3600Mhz CL18

ASUS ROG STRIX X570-F GAMING

Corsair iCUE H150i ARGB PRO XT 3x12Cm

Corsair RM750 750W 80+ Gold Full Modular

SSD NVMe Samsung 970 EVO PLUS 500Gb 3500Mb/s

HDD Seagate Barracuda 1Tb SATA3 64Mb

NZXT H511 Black (Okay so I read A LOT, A LOT of things about this case, I know it doesn't have the best airflow but I think with the Corsair iCUE H150 it should be fine, I could chose between a few different cases like the Cooler Master H500 for 50 more euros, I heard this case had much much better airflow but didn't like the design and also looked veeery big and heavy and I don't really want a case that big, also was considering the Corsair 275R Airflow but heard that is made of cheap materials and it could break easily, so I decided the NZXT H511 because I loved the design, and wasn't very big, and also saw a lot of 3D Artists that used this case and never had any problems with it.)

Everything cost me almost 2000€ . In 2-3 weeks I should have my computer, I asked them and I can still change some components if I'm not sure so any suggestion is welcome. I want a computer that I can use for work, I use Blender mainly but also Maya, ZBrush, Substaince Painter, and I also play videogames in my free time, I really want to play Cyberpunk (well, when it's fixed) and Tarkov for example."

I've always felt that I would not be engineering, always thought I wouldn't be able to start something from scratch and it just stopping me from doing anything.

I'm a CompE major, but after taking some physics classes I'm heavily considering switching to Physics and just doing a CS minor instead. I'll likely want to work in data science or as a software engineer regardless, but I also want to study something I'm interested in without having to worry too much about my future career prospects and salary, and I've heard Physics is a tough degree to get a job with. A lot of my motivation for CompE is that I didn't want to major just in CS, I wanted to take some Physics and have coursework that's also rooted in physical science and not just computers, but that same goal would be accomplished by a Physics major. I just don't want to have to struggle to find a job somewhere, and I know most places don't look at your minor so would the CS minor even be useful? 

For further context I'm also currently working at my school in Enrollment Services doing data manipulation with a CRM and PANDAS. I mainly just write queries and use PANDAS to retrieve data from a Linux server and format it into a report for various people. I'm also planning on keeping the job the 4 years I'm in college because they said I could take breaks for internships, so I feel like I'll have a good level of experience within the field of programming."

I feel like I am treated like an incompetent child ever since I told my mom that I felt like I wanted to be a creator, since about- late middle school. I realized that I didn't like the idea of working for someone else from 9-5 everyday for the rest of my life. 

I had these ideas that I had been developing for years (A music player that uses beats as a unit for song progression, and a  board game with some unique rules that I would eventually turn into iOS apps. They're both in the store as I'm typing this- with 300 5\* ratings for the beat counting music player and roughly 60 5\* for the mobile board game.) I hadn't told my mom that I wanted to make them into apps, but I told her that I wanted to develop them into large, successful products. 

At first, she never understood them, and I also feel- never took the time to try to understand them, instead helped propel my younger sister to success because she followed the ""norms"" of a traditional path- college, internships, jobs, etc. And now says they're more mature, responsible, etc.

It took me many years, and a big leap of faith to make a the jump and decide that I wanted to use my $6,000 I had built up in savings to create the mobile apps for my products because I was tired of being all talk and no action. I'm still financially dependent on my parents, but have always had large dreams of them helping me finance my products for a short while until they generate money for me on their own. 

I feel like despite having built solid ideas over the years, because they're not making a lot of money for me yet, (but are getting there), my mom still has me sit down with her over every decision I make with the products, and she has me turn to my sister and boyfriend to approve of everything I do with the products. We continue fighting constantly because I just don't feel like an equal in the family. How can I resolve this? Any additional info you might need?"

During my final two years at my university, I regularly attended the career fairs and tried to network with employers as much as possible, but was only able to get one interview which I did not get the job for. It seems that there were not many employers looking for CS students/graduates at my school despite its heavy emphasis on science and engineering. During my time in school I never got around to getting any summer internships partially due to having to work part time to pay rent and also due to my  own lack of initiative, but that is beside the point. What I’m trying to say here is that now I am in a position where I have graduated and have a BS in Computer Science, but no formal experience, so I am kinda struggling to figure out what to best focus on now if I want to get a entry level developer position, hopefully by next summer.  

When I first graduated from school, I began searching for any job in tech near me, but it seemed that there were not many options for people without any internships or previous job experience. It’s not that I just took the classes and went home when I was in school, however. I spent a fair amount of my free time teaching myself to program using different frameworks and programming languages, but did not have enough free time to join a university engineering or programming student project that would be resume worthy. I wrote a lot small desktop projects for windows and linux as well as making some Android apps, but nothing that I think would be really “consumer grade”, or something that people would actually use. My goal with these projects was mainly to teach myself the skills beyond the classroom that would hopefully get me a job down the line. I even learned some web development using the Django framework and made a basic website that I put some of these projects on to show employers, but it didn’t really seem to make a difference.  

Right now I am living at home with my dad and saving up money working at a pizza place, because I am thinking that without any formal experience in the field, I am going to have to move to another city that is less saturated with CS graduates, as it seems in my area (Southern California) the norm is to have three summer internships by the time you graduate at the least. Do any of you guys have any advise on finding easier to get entry level developer jobs in other cities? Do you guys know which areas are the best to get some entry level experience in?

I have also been continuing to refine my mobile application development skills since I graduated and have since learned to use the React Native framework to develop applications for both Android and IOS.

It's a small team that was acquired by the company in the past and is now a part of the company. I'm ecstatic about the opportunity, but if this internship does lead to a full-time offer, is it possible to ask for a location change to where the headquarters is located? I would much prefer to work in CA, where I currently live, where my life is. Is this a normal thing to ask, and do companies usually allow it? Thanks."

I am a 26-year-old who finished my B.S in cybersecurity in August of 2020. I had previously worked an internship for a year in IT and am currently in a full-time role as an IT technician, and have been since a few weeks before my graduation. One of the things that have been frustrating to me thus far in my American job search is the fact that everything is so closely tied to the military in my field, with most jobs requiring a security clearance as a prereq.

While this is all fine, I would prefer to live in Ireland, I’ve visited for several weeks in different parts of the year in the past and find the climate to be agreeable to me. I live in one of the rainiest parts of America and love the rain, and also truly enjoy cold and cool weather. I am not really a big fan of the heat and living in the southeastern USA is miserable. I also found Ireland to be beautiful, and its people kind and very agreeable. Something that is in short supply in the USA.

I would love to know the order of steps that I should take to begin the process. I am currently in a relationship and we would likely be married in the next 12 or so months. , she 24F has a degree in advertising but isn’t currently working in the field.

I do know I am in a position to secure a working holiday visa but I am not sure that is the best course of action in the interest of continuing to work in my field. I would like to be out of the US by the time my lease is up at my apartment in October of 2021 if possible.

I appreciate any advice, Thank you very much."

I have started looking at development jobs in my area, but to be honest, I don't even know what to look for. There seem to be so many different titles and specialties I must've been unaware of. As a recent graduate primarily working with .NET, how do I navigate these job boards? Do I even entertain the listings that utilize languages and frameworks I have no experience with? The lead developer at my internship had nothing but great things to say about me, so I am trying to use that as confidence, but man, I feel really lost right now. I feel like my education missed things, or that I didn't do enough on my own. To be honest, I loving developing, but that doesn't mean that I do it all the time. It was rare that I did code in my free time during university, and sometimes I wonder if I should have. Any advice from those with similar experiences?"

kzmvho,14,2021-01-17,what's your plan for 2021? here's mine (tl;dr),timeforachange_,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kzmvho/whats_your_plan_for_2021_heres_mine_tldr/,"for reference, i'm in year 2 of a CS degree, finished data structures/intro c++.

some are already in swing of things but i start in a week so wanted to get a plan going

Credit goes to [Nathaniel Drew](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdWRLq10OHuy7HmSckV3Vg) on youtube, vlogs on balance, life, and work in a non-wuwu way.  He also had the balls to up and move to Mexico city with a not-popular-yet youtube channel and only a few bucks in his pocket.

I distilled his plan for organizing to this:

1. Draw your thoughts first:

* our short terms are probably: this semester, coding ideas, research companies i'd like to work for
* our long terms are probably : by graduation, 1 year after grad, 5 years.

he interestingly uses pen and paper, so he can't edit anything. For CS it's probably coding project ideas, semester plans, and job application estimates. Also do we have a time to unplug (flexibly) each day, because ""me"" time is healthy.

2. Prioritize: Now we have our short/long term (solve 25% of easy LC by 2022, apply to 50 companies by 2022, google calendar all important syllabus due dates... etc)

3. Timeline: Nathaniel said he can do timelines for about 3 months, but I imagine many of us in school look by semester or year due to cycles.

**tl;dr loosely**

2021:

* 8am ready to work, done with breakfast, blackboard, slack, etc.
* 4 CS classes, main weekly goals are to finish ALL tasks that are able to be finished by Friday (no weekend bleeding). Also stop working 5-6pm, 8-9 pm latest, midnight for crunches.

me time: early morning, mid-day breaks, and 8pm-midnight

&amp;#x200B;

* longer term coding projects will be looked at week 1, and discussed with groupmates about what's reasonable and same for check-ins. Noone wants to be micro managed but also can't have 1 guy doing all the coding with slackers never contributing.

Leetcode: 1 easy 1 medium each day, if energy levels are up to it.  At minimum look at solutions and re-code why it works.

Project: spend Spring 2021 thinking of a significant project to work on until graduation.

Summer '21: 1 class and a lot of applications for internships.

Fall '21: to be seen

2022: grad role apps/networking, LinkedIn++...

2025+ settled in either a tech hub city or doing full time remote work from home.

anyway, work in progress, curious if anyone else had some kind of strategy for finishing their CS degree and making the leap."

I'm extremely lonely. I can't make friends at my new current small university. I live off campus and I know no one. I'm an introvert and not very sociable so it's been really hard for me to make any friends despite the campus being open and in-person. Everyday I would go to class do homework, sleep and repeat, I don't interact with anyone and spends time in my room of the time. I tried joining clubs but I didn't felt like fitting in, and most clubs people are doing their own things. I don't want to live in solitude for four years. I have great ambitions and I want to work hard to achieve them but sometimes I get anxious thinking that so what if I achieve all my goals? I'll still be a loner with no friends and no one to talk to. I'm terrified of that and it's affecting my mental health greatly. I believe a huge part of it is the university I'm currently attending. My goal for 2021 is to get good grades and internships so that I can transfer to a different university where I can have opportunities to make friends and meet new people.

For now, goodbye and good luck"

Hey reddit,

Hear my situation out, I’ve been interning at Company X, a company that provides IT services/solutions for roughly around 3 weeks as a ‘System Engineer’ even the job is basically transferring data, adding domain and some L1 support work. I do enjoy the work tho as I know it’s considered as a stepping stone for every IT professional.

I am a penultimate IT student where my university made it compulsory to undergo my internship before my senior year. One of the requirements for my internship is doing a project-based assignment and this is where my concerns lie; I am seeing all my friends/classmates are in software development and their tasks are considered as project-based (according to my university). 

My question is does anybody have been through this before where their internships require a ‘project’ and you are in a department that focuses on system/helpdesk? Another question is that if I would want to conduct a Data Analysis project based on my IT work, how would I go about that.

NOTE: I know my descriptions are pretty vague, but I’m happy to elaborate further if needed. Please help."

Right now, I'm in my last year of a double major in business administration with a concentration in economics and international relations in Rome. 

I just realized that another American university about 30 minutes away offers an economics and finance degree, a minor in mathematics and computer applications, and they are affiliated with the CFA institute and offer scholarships and fee waivers for exams and exam materials. Additionally, I've been scouting masters programs, and my current degree, although concentrating in economics, does not fulfill most of the requirements for a good economics program. The degree at the other university covers all of the upper-level requirements that I will need and then some. 

I would say I'm a good student. My GPA is fairly high, and I've been on the Dean's List every semester but it has been impossible to find internships relevant to my business degree, while the other university has partnerships with hundreds of organizations to mitigate this problem. 

If I transfer, however, it will mean at least an additional year of undergrad. I'm not sure if it's worth it and if the degrees that I'm pursuing right now are just fine, or if it really will be for the best to just transfer into a better economics and finance program.

I've been working at my job for eight years. I started as an intern when we were like 20 people working there, and now I am a manager (our office currently employs 200+ people).

I've loved my job for all these years until now. We're currently working part-time and receiving less money, as COVID has hit our industry pretty bad. I've done as much as I can to help my bosses and colleagues, working more hours than I should and helping with some stuff like taking care of some important clients and teams, and I was a part of a team of 3 whom helped both my CEOs and colleagues negotiate our furlough conditions.
 
Last year I changed departaments as our CEO wanted me to lead a project with him, but a month later he hired a new boss for my team. He is a great person but it has been hard for me to adapt to his working style. We have so many long weekly meetings that I have barely enough time to work after them. I always end up doing overtime (not paid). I also have trouble working with a teammate (a nice enough lady but lets say she is not a great professional to work with) and after I tried to resolve both of these things plenty of times (and not being able to), I decided to search for something else. I may receive two job offers this week.

I am a bit scared of how my CEO will react. I think he suspects something because he keeps telling me lately he cares a lot about me and that I am a central piece of the company. He tends to take these things very personally. I really like him as a person, but this past year has been really hard for me in terms of money and motivation. I feel I am carrying a lot of responsability because all the new bosses they hired don't know a lot about the company and I have to make a lot of decisions and planning (they often joke on how I am the 'functional boss' and they are the 'hierarchical bosses'). I am so excited to get either of these new jobs I know I am making a good decision. But I feel a bit anxious about how my CEO will take it. 

Does anyone has experience leaving a boss that you have a close relationship with? This is my first job so I have no idea how to leave in a good tone in such a difficult time.

TL;DR: I'd love some tips on how to correctly leave a company that is going through a difficult time when your boss takes these things personally. Thank you!"

I feel very grateful to have a full-time offer from the company I interned at last summer but if I'm being honest I really hated working there (the company is very pretty much all upper middle class white males, didn't feel very comfortable or like I could relate to them but maybe that's just me succumbing to my social anxiety idk, I also didn't really feel like working in ""corporate world"" was for me, overall the internship made me want to cry everyday and I think my last day there was the happiest I felt that summer). I've also always wanted to take a gap year after graduating to figure out what my next steps should be (if I want to work in industry or academia, if I want to continue in the field I majored in or do something similar but in a slightly different area etc etc), but now that I *do* have the option to have a full time job, I feel really guilty about declining it, since it does pay relatively well and offers stability and bc there are so many people working really hard/struggling to find a job especially in the middle of a pandemic. While I do have the means to take a gap year, I also worry that I might just be making it harder for myself to find a job or get into grad school by taking a gap year.

I switched into the major I'll be graduating with a little late in the game (switched the start of my junior year), so I wish I had more time to really explore my interests and figure things out, since now I just feel extremely burnt out, like my depression is just getting worse, and like I've run out of any passion or ambition to do anything with my life.

I was thinking of spending the gap year working part-time/interning for this organization hat works with profits that I'm also currently a part of and looking more into graduate programs, which gives me a little hope of finding some kind of drive in life again but what if that's just me looking for ways to justify not taking this job. I guess if I don't really have any drive to do anything with myself right now, realistically will I ever? the thought of going back to this company to work just gives me so much anxiety and makes me feel kinda dead inside but maybe I should just suck it up, take this job and make myself useful?

Sorry this was so all over the place or sounded ungrateful/like I'm throwing away an opportunity I should be more happy about... I just feel really confused and lost as to what to do and like my mental health is just going downhill."
kzvd7z,115,2021-01-18,Anyone else really dislike remote work (particularly new grads)?,Vivid-Fudge5362,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kzvd7z/anyone_else_really_dislike_remote_work/,"I'm probably in the minority of thinking this but I'm interested to hear if any others, especially those who will be graduating soon / new to the workforce and do not like working remotely?

Some context: I am a senior CS major, graduating this Spring. Between my final 3 semesters, and my internship during summer 2020 all being virtual I have grown to absolutely loath working from home. I would describe myself as in the middle of extrovert/introvert. I don't like big parties or huge gatherings but I really like social situations in a small group or around people I already know. I miss just seeing a classmate walking around campus and having a quick 5-10 minute conversation about anything, I miss going out to lunch or taking short walks for fresh air with my co-workers during my internship in the summer of 2019 (pre-COVID times...), I generally just miss having everyday normal human interactions and want so desperately to get the hell out of my apartment.

Does anyone else feel like this? I do understand why people like remote work for various reasons such as not having to commute, the comfort of home, have a family at home, etc. But for me as a single 23-year-old male, it just isn't it, I actually just withdrew myself from the next step in the hiring process for a job because they were unsure if the position would be brought back in the office or continue to WFH permanently. I won't do it.

I'd like to hear thoughts from both experienced workers and new grads, is anyone else like me hoping that remote work doesn't become the norm for the future? Maybe it's just that I haven't spent enough time in an office environment to dislike it yet (outside of my internships), but I actually would MUCH rather work on-site with real people as opposed to staring into a black hole on Microsoft teams for a meeting / when I need to speak with someone.

TLDR; On-site in-person work &gt; WFH."

kzwz8u,2,2021-01-18,Is the pandemic halting new Graduate Job Applications?,Ciaxur,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kzwz8u/is_the_pandemic_halting_new_graduate_job/,"Hello,

I recently graduated in December 2020. I've been having no luck with job applications for the past 10 months. I have applied to multiple companies prior to the start of the pandemic, with interviews from those applications. I was even scheduled to meet on-site a week into the official Covid lockdown, which was canceled and ended up not hearing back, obviously since they had issues they were resolving. At the time I was a Software Engineer Intern at an Auto Company, which they too had issues to resolve because of the pandemic, which ended up canceling all internships. 

I got offered to come back to work remotely in October 2020. However, I've been applying for jobs non-stop as I've stated earlier. I have multiple personal, academic, and freelancing experiences on my resume ranging from Full-Stack Development to Emulation to leading a Senior Design project. I also have 1 Year of experience as a Software Engineering Intern and (**so far**) 3 months of experience as a Full-Time Software Engineer. I want some peace of mind as to whether I'm the only one having this issue or is it due to actually being the pandemic that is limiting these opportunities. I'm questioning if it's my resume or experience because the positions I'm applying for are in fact recently posted and actively hiring.

kzxuvj,0,2021-01-18,Afraid of applying to internships,yo_itbambi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kzxuvj/afraid_of_applying_to_internships/,"As the title says, I feel afraid applying to these top tech companies because I lack the experience.

kzyc8f,14,2021-01-18,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (1/18/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/kzyc8f/weekly_job_qa_thread_1182021/,"Hi all,

Here is the forty-seventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

kzyce9,0,2021-01-18,FBU Engineering vs. SWE/ML @ Raytheon?,AdditionCurious5441,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kzyce9/fbu_engineering_vs_sweml_raytheon/,"Hey y'all!

I recently got offers from FBU and Raytheon, and I'm not sure which to accept. From what I've heard, FBU isn't really that exciting of a program to me (I've heard that interns don't get to work on anything related to facebook, and just create their own app?), but the SWE return offer is the main pro. I'm not yet sure if I'd be interested in working at FB full-time, or even return for an internship though.

On the other hand, the project that I'd be working on at Raytheon is super cool, but I'm not really looking to work in the space/defense sector in the future. I've also done ML work @ other defense contracting companies in the past, so it'd be a similar experience.

Is it worth taking FBU just for the return offer, or should I accept Raytheon cuz I'd likely learn more and the project is better? Any advice would be appreciated!

edit: raytheon also said they'd likely publish papers on the project I'd be working on, so I'd have my name on publications through that as well.

I have kind of put off school. Currently 23 years old and still a freshman (I think). But I am eager to progress in life and in this field.

kzyn0o,22,2021-01-18,I accepted two Internship offers.,Blackop4,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/kzyn0o/i_accepted_two_internship_offers/,"Hello all, I’m in a complicated situation and I hope I will get advice here. So back in September when school started I had my very first career fair, applied for multiple internships and got interviews. Two days after, I received an offer letter asking me to reply by X date, then, I received a call for an interview in one of my dream companies. The dilemma here was that the interview with that company was scheduled the day after my other offer expired. I tried to move the date closer so that in case I got an offer there too, I would be able to choose. 
Unfortunately they didn’t have any free spot before the expiration of my first offer. I went on to accept the first offer and on the next day my dream company sent me an offer after interviewing me. 
I have to say, the first company seems a bit Larger in terms is paying me 1.5 dollar more, plus a 1700 sign up bonus but goes remote for the summer. The second company’s internship is conditional to a full time position and I will work on site in a retail store. 

I’m stuck in this situation, both companies are expecting me and I don’t know what to choose. 

Ps: I’m an international Student and work authorization have to be signed pretty soon by my school under one company so I don’t have much time to choose."

I suppose that I am a “success story”, but I feel that a lot of it was pure luck.

I graduated high school in 2016 with a 3.2 weighted GPA, but took 6 AP classes my senior year while dealing with undiagnosed mental illness. In 2020, I graduated from a no-name online 4-year university while working a corporate job full-time. I got the job because someone I met in community college gave me a referral. Next week I will be starting an internship at Tesla and classes at NYU.

After community college I took a gap year to sort out my mental health issues which really helped, along with the full-time job I obtained, so I didn’t take the typical post-community college route. 

I do have advice I’d like to give, but it’s pretty specific to CS majors. To make sure that my experience does help others, I’d like to hear the perspective of former community college students in other majors. What type of questions would you have liked answered as a community college student?"

I got to host a matching stage for a Google STEP Internship. But, along with that, the Hiring Committee has noted that my application can be considered for the Software Engineering / Site Reliability Engineering Internship Program. So I have to choose one of the programs.

HR said that hosts will look at my CV, questionnaire and my interest in the project while considering me for their team. However, I do not have a strong CV with good projects. Most of my CV is about ICPC. So, I am worried that I will not find a team. 

What do you think I should choose?

l011x3,1679,2021-01-18,I got my first internship at 35!,Kurt_VonneAbs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l011x3/i_got_my_first_internship_at_35/,"So at 32 years old and after 15 years, I left my job in the military after a back injury and headed back to school. I had some previous college, but I had struggled with my mental health in my early 20s and dropped out after tanking my GPA down to a 2.0. 

I had to sell my house and moved back to where the university was, sleeping at a friend's place on an air mattress for the first couple semesters. I started out majoring in Graphic Design, and along the way I learned about the world of coding. I was brand new to both and had never done any type of art or coding before. I worked hard and got all As (except for one B in Calc this past Summer when I got covid mid-semester). Three years later, here I am in my last semester. I took as many web development/coding classes as I could, added a couple minors, and learned some other things through udemy/online. However, even with pulling my GPA up to over a 3.0, with the lockdown I was unable to network much. And since I am not a CS student, it is extremely difficult to get considered for development roles. My plan has been just to use my military benefits to finish school and to take a bootcamp through Galvanize once I'm done.

Well, one of my teachers I took a UX/UI class with last semester sent out an email to a group of us that a local company was looking for an intern and I decided to apply. I sent in a couple of projects and went in for an interview...and they chose me! Kind of surreal at the moment to be honest. They are a national branding/marketing/web dev firm that has done work for clients such as NASA. They have maybe 15-20 employees. They are even using Vue which is what my bootcamp will be teaching. The team itself is only a couple of developers, but it means a lot to me that I will be able to get some relevant experience on my resume and with current tech to boot. It has been a long road of trying to figure out what I wanted to get into, and a lot of nights thinking maybe I didn't have enough Design or Coding experience to get into either industry. It's not any kind of prestigious FANG opportunity, but for me it means a lot and I am happy just to have an opportunity in the field.  I'm still a long way from where I want to be, but I wanted to share for anyone who may think they can't overcome some past mistakes and go on to have success later. The imposter syndrome still hits hard, but I hit back with hard work and focus on what I can control.  Thanks for reading and good luck to anyone else on the hunt in these unprecedented times."

I'll try to make this brief. I have a BS in Biology and another in Cardiorespiratory Science from two regular state schools. Nothing special. I have been working as a respiratory therapist for the past few years. Rather than being self taught or obtaining a 3rd degree, I'm thinking about attending Digitalcrafts in Atlanta. My coding experience is minimal, and I believe a bootcamp would give me a bit of structure, community, and networking opportunities. How likely would it be for one to secure an internship at a healthtech startup after completing a bootcamp and crafting a decent portfolio?"

My wife is a full time therapist that was foisted into ‘full time’ Oct 2020, as her main job was cut due to the pandemic. She’s had almost a shocking assent to success in such a short amount of time that fellow therapists, interns, and her old LPCS (supervisor) said that they have never heard of anyone going from a few clients a week to more than 35 per week. We almost are holding our breath as this is currently our main source of income and are unsure if it is sustainable, but nothing has stopped the continuing of daily client acquisition.

Enter myself. I struggled to help her with advertising going from ‘what is Google Ads’ to building her professional site from scratch. There is data now that suggests what marketing strategies are working and what are not, including our own hypothesis of how Google search works based upon our own data specifically for therapist.

Should I sell this data or market myself as someone that can replicate this success for another therapist? Her sister is a therapist as well and she’s hesitant about me helping her so as not to distract my wife’s potential traffic. 

Is she right? Can helping others in mass hinder my wife’s success or is this valuable information to create a side income for myself?

Best,"

I was ecstatic since I was depressed from job hunting during a dead job market after graduating in May 2020 with no internships. 

Well fast forward and now I have a job but I’m so convinced it’s not just imposter syndrome making me feel like I’m useless. That I’m actually useless.

Previously I had worked at my university’s computer science department as a course assistant for beginning programming. It helped me refresh on problem solving and debugging, but never advanced programming. 

Now the interview for my current job was insanely easy- they just asked me how I would design a parking system with classes, how I would utilize inheritance to reduce repetitive methods etc. they also asked me if I knew how to debug people’s code which I do. It was only 30 min total and I got the job right after. 

But now after my first week here, I’m looking at C++ files with syntax I have no idea about and not an inkling of how the code base works. They tasked me with cleaning up their build but I’ve never had experience with it.  I have no experience with any of the software they use. 

And also I’m the only female so it feels harder to ask questions. I grew up only gravitating towards other girls and women. 

Any advice is appreciated."

It is looking pretty good so far and I'm quite excited about it. The company seems pretty cool, I did quite a bit of Leetcode and really learnt a lot of quick problem solving tricks, however I don't have much experience with the real programming deal.

All of my real life programming work experience has pretty much been Web-App Development, where I used Django, and was always in back-end... So I only had the chance to use JS once, did the most basic html templates, and didn't even get active SQL experience as Django includes a built-in ORM. I did get some agile/scrum experience from this.

How will the real deal be like? The company is rather big (fintech) and has tons of projects so they'll just assign me my own personal ones. For those of you in fintech, what should I expect? Also will I get the chance to walk a bit away from Web-Dev? Or at least from Django?"

I am a second-year Electrical Engineering Student in Québec Province. So far, I don't have much significant experience in my field (didn't participate in student projects due to the pandemic, no internship done yet) and I am actively looking for a summer 2021 internship . I have great grades and have learned a lot from my year and a half of studies in EE.

Since seriously wanting to find an internship, it seems like I always find myself feeling bad for playing video games, taking part in courses on Khan Academy unrelated to engineering and reading up on ""useless"" stuff from an engineer standpoint. My brain keeps telling me that in order to be a serious competitor on the job market, I absolutely need to sharpen my programming skills, my electronics skills, especially Arduino and such. The problem is, I just don't know where to start. I can't find project ideas that interest me easily. I don't know what kind of program I could write and what package/language to learn.

To finish up, I feel disappointed, seeing (seemingly) everybody around me do all kinds of crazy projects and have success.

My question is, **is that a normal feeling?** **Am I doing too little to make myself stand out?**"

Idk how to feel about my medical ec's because I actually found out about BS/MD programs not too long ago, and im having a really hard time looking for medical internships, volunteer opportunities, or research because of Covid and how they wont let students into the hospitals and stuff like that. Plus these summer research and medical camps are ridiculously expensive and theres no way I can afford those or try to go to one of them so I dont really know what to do. But I have worked at my local hospital as a volunteer helping around with patients, and I have also been doing virtual shadowing with 3 different programs in place of actual doctor shadowing due to Covid, but I feel like it isnt enough.

I live in an ultra-competitive city in the Bay Area. Every one of my friends is easily going to the top 30 colleges because of their insane applications. All of them have internships here, founding startups there, working at Stanford here, making a nonprofit there. It is super cool how they are all able to get these super cool important positions at these places, but something kinda bugs me. They only do this because they want to get into college. And before you say ""WOAH WOAH WOAH, HOW DO YOU KNOW,"" trust me I know. When I ask most of them about whatever they are working on, they can only tell me the part they are working on and basically nothing else, not the companies mission, the reason they are passionate for the cause, literally nothing. They just see it as basically another extracurricular they can put on their common app and LinkedIn. 

I'm not blaming them for not caring about these things, but the colleges that seem to require these things. Try applying to a top 50 college without many extracurriculars and see what happens. Founding non-profits seem to be driven on the sole reason of ""this will help my application"" rather than ""I actually care about the problem."" Colleges should instead ask kids to do things they are passionate about, instead of stuff that they think is good for you. It kinda hurts me to see people being forced to work on things they arent really passionate about and end up half assing it.

\-Various Coursera certificates that are semi-related to my interests

**Essay**

I haven't started brainstorming and I don't have any interesting hooks (I've had literally had 0 hardship in my life). If you have any ideas based on this limited amount of info I've given you then anything is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

**LORs**

Haven't asked anyone yet but there are a couple of teachers that really like me and I have known for 4 years

&amp;#x200B;

As I am still a junior any tips or suggestions to improve anything will be greatly appreciated. If there is a particular section that seems weak please let me know. Also if you could list a couple of colleges that would be good for reach, target, and safety that would also be really helpful. Personally prefer urban/sub urban

l0hotm,0,2021-01-19,I hate my job what should i do?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l0hotm/i_hate_my_job_what_should_i_do/,"This is going to be a long one. I've been thinking about this for a long time.  I'm 29 female who is a teacher. I'm a teacher since late 2019 and I never wanted to be one in the first place but I'm getting a good pay. Before I started that was my main reason to get this job, I thought I would do this for a while and save money. So that's what I'm currently doing. I never liked school or teachers when I was young, however I very much enjoyed my time at the university. It was good to live on my own and study something I was interested in. Despite being really poor I had to eat the same cheap chicken wrap for days, I still think I was happier than now.

I didn't really have a good relationship with my dad, he was always a control freak. Never let me do things with my friends and my curfew was very early like around 4 pm when I was in high school. I was never allowed to go on trips with my classmates even if the teachers were also present. As a result of not being allowed to do things my peers were doing, I became bitter and isolated. I only had one friend. We had constant fights, and I've always felt like I stayed behind in experiencing things I was supposed to . I think I still do feel like that. That's why I studied in another city in university, and it was really better. I had a lot of friends and I almost experienced things I couldn't in high school. We were really poor then. So even if I had applied for a student loan it was a very little money so I was also went on being the same old poor me. My dad tried to control me there too, he would call me every night to see what I was doing. Since I was far away it wouldn't bother me much but we still had fights over the phone. 

I graduated and didn't have a reason to stay there so I moved back in my parents in my hometown.  I stayed with them and worked there around 2-3 years. My dad would force me to give most of my pay to him and said you can leave if you're not happy with this. He also did the same to my mother. He didn't work. I only had what little money he gave me every month. I couldn't leave since the wage i was getting was really low and my hometown is a big city. I could only afford maybe only rent with the wage. That went on like that. I studied literature so to become a teacher you need to get some extra classes at a university and do internship in my country. Kind of like getting your master's degree but it took only about a year. My dad paid for everything, he kind of had to after putting me through that shit. Anyway, when I was about to finish it, he died of lung cancer. I didn't feel sad at all, but I felt relieved and guilty because I didn't feel sad at all. That happened two years ago.

I was planning to become a teacher before he died because I wanted to move somewhere else and get away from everything. So even after he died, I still decided to go on and become a teacher. Don't get me wrong, I love my mom so much and if she wasn't there I probably would've killed myself. She was my support throughout my life and she still is. She was through far worse than me. So, I decided on becoming a teacher even though I hate it. I thought maybe it would be different once I get used to it. Plus a very good pay. But ever since I started, I feel like this job is killing me inside. I can't stand it. I've never felt this tired. I had to live in a village and there's nothing to do. I can't relieve any stress at all. I can't stand online classes,regular classes, disrespectful children and their stupid parents. I'm sick of teaching the same thing over and over again. I want to quit as soon as I save enough money. I feel like I'm going to be stuck in a job I hate. I feel like I won't be able to quit because of my age. I'm not old but I'm not young either. I'm not married, have no kids but I have a serious relationship so at least family and love part of my life is pretty good now. I have a long distance relationship with my bf and he says he wants to come here too even though he knows I want to quit. He says we should spend as much time as possible together and respects my opinion.

What do you think I should do? I am really sorry for long rant but i've been thinking about this for a long time and don't know what to do. I felt like I had to give some background info to show how I was always behind in doing things I was supposed to. I feel like I wasted my whole life (it wasn't my fault i know but still) and I'm still wasting it. And I'm afraid I would waste my life even more if I quit and try to do something else. But I feel like I should quit even though I end of unemployed, just feel like I can't take the risk."

l0ij9n,4,2021-01-19,"20M, Last year studying for CS Bachelor degree but I'm extremely unmotivated",SnowyBk,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/l0ij9n/20m_last_year_studying_for_cs_bachelor_degree_but/,"First, let me introduce a little about myself,

I'm currently a last year Uni student studying CS in &gt;!Vietnam!&lt;.

In my school days I've kept doing what my parents told never really thought about what I wanted to do with my life, and since my parents are Asian, they wanted me to become Doctor/Lawyer/Engineer/High paying jobs etc..., so I just randomly picked Computer Science without much thought.

Last year 2020, I'm hit with a total burnt out due to multiple deadlines, the pandemic and sitting in one place from 9 to 5 staring at a screen basically killed all my passion from my intern job.

One of the more discouraging factors, is most of the software engineering jobs in this country offer a salary of only 500$/month for a 60+ hour work week, whereas I was offered to work as an English teacher (After I got an IELTS band of 8.0) for a salary of 1200$/month for a 20-25 hour work week both with no experience.

Pursuing CS might one day give me a chance to work abroad and ""make it"", but I'd have no passion in my job. While teaching English might be fun and pays me well for now, I'm afraid of having no chance for career development and higher pay since I'm not a ""Native speaker"" (The schools here are suckers for anyone from US/Europe and pays them triple the salary compared to other teachers).

I also had experiences with other English related jobs such as tour guide and translating documents and a 300 page book (volunteer) but tourism died from Covid and I'm afraid AI will soon replace any translating/interpreting jobs.

TL,DR: Last year Uni student but hate my profession, somehow teaching English pays more than coding in my country. Should I pursue IT for long term stability or pursue other careers which I enjoy but are unstable in the future?

Thanks for reading, I'll appreciate every advices and responses."

Where from and where to? 

\-Why the UK? 

\-What sparked my interest in this field of study? 

\-Why do I want to pursue it in university? 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions for content:

\-What are the necessary academic skills and attributes to take on this subject at university? (Show obvious disciplinarity)

\-How have I pursued my interest in the discipline/field outside of the syllabus over the last 3-4 years?

\-What were some skills/insights I learnt from these activities that are relevant to the study of this discipline?

\-What have I learnt from these further explorations, that makes me want to carry on in this field? Any specific areas of interest?

\-Within the discipline, what particular questions am I keen on finding the answers to? Why?

\-If relevant, how have my non-academic activities contributed to my interest in, and/or honed my skills?

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What to avoid:

\-Laundry listing

\-Talk about the reason why you pursued the activity and/or what you learnt from it are important (Include reflection, learning or insight, write about areas it led you to)

\-What are your opinions/analysis on the theories/subject raised? Where can it potentially have application in?

\-Choose 1 or 2 specific pieces 

\-Losing focus

\-Avoid overstuffing

\-Question if the achievement/project you are writing about is relevant

\-Avoid short-hand/incomprehensible acronyms or details which do not matter in admissions

\-If writing about transferrable skills, make sure they are relevant to the field.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tips:

Spamming is not the same as demonstrating understanding or aptitude. 

The reason why you pursued the activity and/or what you learn from it, is important. 

\-Include some reflection, learning or insights. 

\-Write about areas it can potentially lead to. 

\-Less can sometimes be more, your opinion and theory raised.

\-Avoid overstuffing, shorthands, acronyms, details that do not matter. 

\-Write about adaptability to UK culture especially if writing about transferable skills. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Oxbridge** \- Cambridge &amp; Oxford

Some admission facts you should know.

Cambridge (Cam) - Requires Promos, Prelim and A-Level results.

Oxford (Ox) - Requires Prelim, and A-Level results.

Conducts interview which is Academic in nature.

Some courses will require other qualifying tests.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Academic Interview

[https://youtu.be/dUwN6GI-0EQ](https://youtu.be/dUwN6GI-0EQ)

Usually, a series of questions, starting from the very basic, to questions they don't expect you to actually know how to answer.

This is to assess the way you learn, your critical thinking skills, basics in the field of study, command of English, and how well you fares under pressure.

Taking Chemistry as an example, a typical question chain could go like this.

1. Please write the chemical formula for Methane. (CH4)
2. Please draw a structural formula of Methane. (Display Formula)
3. Please draw a structural representation of Methane in 3D space. (Stereochemical structure)
4. Please indicate the bond angles of the bonds in Methane. (109.5)
5. Why is it 109.5 degrees? (VSEPR)
6. Under what conditions can it react with Oxygen? (Heating)
7. Whats the products of the aforementioned reaction? (CO2 &amp; H2O)
8. Any idea what is the mechanism of combustion reaction of Methane?

Question 8 is where the question goes into the discussion phase, and you would provide ideas on plausible mechanisms. Whilst the interviews will give little hints to guide you to the answer.

These interviews can't really be mugged for, and will require a deep understanding of at least the corresponding A-Level content. 

 \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final notes:

UK Places are conditional upon A-level results

You are obliged to meet all conditions set by the school

Personal statements can become interview prompts. Write your statement yourself. Do not exaggerate, ensure you know **exactly** what you are writing about.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What now?

Know the universities, courses and cities.

Keep an eye on datelines and to-dos, no extensions! 

Sep/Oct deadlines: Go to higher-ed counselling(If your JC provides) with UCAS draft before prelims.

Jan deadline: UCAS draft by end-October.

Approach CT for recommendation early. Follow the recommended internal guidelines closely.

To avoid stress: Confirm your statement at least 1 week before deadlines.

I'm currently an engineering student at École Polytechnique de Tunisie, which is a top engineering school in Tunisia. I'm familiar with measure theory as well discrete stochastic processes. We also had some courses that can be useful in this domain such finite element methods or control theory.   
The training in our school is multidisciplinary so we had some courses of economics and finance.   
Older students than me did some interesting projects like forecasting using kalman filter or option pricing with finite difference method which I find very interesting.

However I’m not explicitly from that neighborhood so my insight might be different than someone who is from there

My dad also went to gallatin for undergrad and stern for mba

I’ve grown up in Greenwich village my entire life, I’ve had NYU students as babysitters, tutors, etc

Food is immaculate, lots of options (yes there’s boba everywhere), tons of cuisine, and is just generally good with all types of price ranges. Food here is also just really good. Downfall - chances are your fav place will close at some point since rent is high and a lot of places don’t last

With that said, HOUSING IS NO JOKE. If you want space, if you want cheap, or if you want to live alone, NYU IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. While you can definitely find somewhat affordable housing options, be prepared to give up some liberties. Also New York City is just inherently expensive anyways

Nyc is convenient. There are drug stores everywhere, it’s easy to get around on the subway. DO NOT BRING A CAR. You do not need it, parking is literally thousands a year, and again you don’t need it. Also you can’t really drive anywhere anyways. Subway is 2.75 per ride, if you intend on taking it a lot, while expensive, it might be worth it to get an unlimited one. Also nyu might have discounts idk. Also don’t take the subway late at night, it’s not safe, but it’s perfectly fine during the day.

There is no campus feel, everyone knows that, however the majority of the buildings are pretty localized. If you say nyu area people will know you mean Washington square park. Greenwich village is a pretty nice area, lots of townhouses which go for tens of millions and million dollar apartments. But there’s still a ton of sketchy people out there.

Washington square park is GREAT it’s such a vibe. Stray away from the west side of the park at night, but the center and east are wonderful to just sit with your friends. Also lots of skater boys. I love it there, and sometimes people play jazz music and it’s so nice.

From the people I’ve seen at NYU: it’s a lot of ABGs, skaters, social justice warriors, and the people who go because NyC iS mY dReAm (sorry if it’s your dream lol I actually hate nyc). Nyu is super liberal, everyone knows that. People here are really chill. 

Also super easy to get 🌿🍺

From the job front: there is a lot of competition, be prepared to not be interning at Goldman Sachs your freshman year lol. But there are also unparalleled opportunities being in nyc, like the fact that u can apply for an internship at GS in the first place. My dad got his first job because his interviewer went to gallatin, and he’s now a 1 percenter so YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL you just have to be persistent

Dear lord this is long sorry everybody

Also this is more of a personal thing, but I find nyc to be very stressful and very high strung, it gives me anxiety to be here. That might just be because I’ve grown up here my whole life so I associate nyc with school and anxiety but I just thought I’d put that out there.

Also happy to answer any questions abt the area/nyc if anyone has any

I am currently a sophomore in college and I was lucky enough to get an offer at Google for the STEP internship. This would be my first internship, if I get over an obstacle.

Summer heading towards the 11th grade, I decided it would be a great opportunity for me to work at my parents' &lt;business&gt;, &lt;company&gt;, since it would allow me to help my parents and gain new skills; I worked at the &lt;business&gt; from May 2017 to Feb. 2019 without pay as a &lt;role&gt;. When the &lt;business&gt; was called for the background check, my dad picked up and told the agency that I worked from April/May 2017 to Feb./March 2019 since he wasn't able to recall the exact months of my work, due to the lack of official documentation, and this was marked as discrepancy on my background check.

I was asked by explain the reason for this discrepancy on my background check and I gave the reason that was said above by email. After I sent this email, I got an automated email confirming that my email is successfully processed and to give “up to 2 business days” for the Background Checks team to get back to me.

Note: I talked to someone else who had to explain his discrepancy on his background check and his was resolved in 2 business days.

It’s been 5 business days and I still haven’t heard back from the Background Checks team and I now I have a bad feeling about this. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do?

Edit: When should I send an follow-up email?

Thanks"
l0rt6f,0,2021-01-19,Background Checks,yesiryesirrr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l0rt6f/background_checks/,I've been applying to graduate jobs lately and I am in late stages of interviewing for a couple. I had one internship in June 2015 and I accidentally wrote July 2016 on my CV. It was with a small local company and only lasted 2 weeks. If a company does a background check on me and sees that it was only 2 weeks when it looks like it was a month and it was a whole year earlier. Would they not give me a job. Should I tell them now to avoid problems later? The jobs I am applying to are with big banks and large tech companies

Hey!

I'm a student at a local community college and still have a semester left of mostly major preparation classes until I receive my Associate's degree, all these classes are unnecessary to transfer. I still need to complete my transfer coursework before I'm able to apply at any University for a Computer Science degree, which is what's holding me back for a whole year from transferring so I won't be finished with all my transfer courses and able to apply until Fall 2022.

From your experience, is it worth it if I get an Associate's degree but I might not be able to even work until I'm done with my Bachelor's degree in a couple years since that'll be my main focus. I want to know if having an Associate's degree will be useful in landing internships while pursuing my Bachelor's degree."
l0s71x,7,2021-01-19,"Keeping a positive mindset with someone nit picking at everything you do wrong is hard, and I am just tired at this point.",a_short_vent19273618,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/l0s71x/keeping_a_positive_mindset_with_someone_nit/,"I’m sorry for the long vent, just needed a place to dump my thoughts anonymously (and get some camaraderie? Understanding? Similar experiences? from others) since I don’t feel comfortable sharing my feelings on this with any of my friends in real life. 

Every conversation with my mom is nagging, with my main message mostly being “you’re not enough.” 

I know I’m enough. I’m trying to keep the positive reinforcement going internally. But it’s exhausting to have to fight so hard to hold on to that idea with my mom always trying to drag me down. 

My mom’s dream for me was premed at Harvard with a 4.0 gpa. But I’m a freshman at another lower ranked Ivy League (that my grandparents in South Korea have never even heard of bc it’s not famous enough, as my mom constantly reminds me), majoring in computer science (I don’t like biology. I like math and engineering. To my mom, who is a doctor, the software engineering industry is several ranks below the medical field), with around a 3.1 GPA my first semester. 

I’m proud that I even made my 3.1 GPA. I honestly think that 3.1 was the best I could’ve brought my grades up to in this situation (long story, but I was not in the best place mentally back in early fall). 

And I am trying to get my shit together. But getting my shit together starts with small goals: trying to get up consistently at 9 am, doing self care, doing a small exercise routine, holding part time jobs, practicing some organization skills, weekly counseling. It’s impossible for me to do a complete 180 overnight. 

Unsurprisingly, this is nowhere near enough for my mom. Because 9 am is getting up too late, it should be 7 am. My exercise routine is useless. My attempts to get into a healthy mental state— self care + dressing in nice outfits even when I just stay home to be in a more positive/confident mindset, organization with Google calendar/notion/bullet journaling, catching up with friends once in a while, weekly counseling with my college’s mental health services— they’re all just superficial and self-indulgent. My first part time job— SAT/math tutoring— is terrible because it’s completely unrelated to my major, I should be doing research with a professor instead. My other part-time job as a software engineer intern is not paid high enough, her friend’s son got paid $30/hr as a software engineer intern. 

My mom can pick apart everything about my life, even the way I hang my clothes, set the table, tie my hair, etc, and connect it all back to how it shows I have no self discipline, and that must be why I have a 3.1 GPA. 

I don’t know how my mom could be thinking her negative reinforcement could be helping. She might think I’m not that affected by her comments since I guess I don’t react too much and keep my composure and just take it, since it’s usually in front of my whole family during family dinners or something. 

I have tried having a reasonable one-on-one talk with her about how her constant criticism can make it hard to focus on improving, and point out that even though she might not notice, I am trying hard in my own way. She does act sympathetic during those conversations, tells me she just wants me to succeed, and she might lay off me for a day. But a few days later it’s pretty much back to normal. 

So here I am trying to get my life together. One of those “get my life together” items is having a more positive mindset. But wow it is fucking exhausting to try to keep a more positive mindset when all I hear about myself is negativity and more negativity."

l0umyl,0,2021-01-19,Going through a bad break up and overwhelmed with school and other personal problems,hotcheethoe,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l0umyl/going_through_a_bad_break_up_and_overwhelmed_with/,"F21. I’ve had a history of mental illness since I was 13, so think being mentally ill further intensifies my feelings. 

2020 sucked for everyone. I’m in college and worked as a research assistant, and in mid March when COVID hit, everything moved online. My life kind of flipped around cause I have younger siblings, so I had to babysit them, help them with their own online school, and still stay on top of my things. 

That same month my grandfather (who has suffered from lymphoma in his spine since 2015 and left him paralyzed), his brain cancer worsened and he passed away ten days before my birthday in August. Grandfathers are so special, but he was truly my very best friend. He helped raise me. He was there for every single small success, every single break up, every single time I was very sick or had the flu, every single time my mental health worsened, every single time I needed advice. He was always there for me. 

Also, some time in June or July, my family and I moved homes. It’s actually a really nice house and in a really nice neighborhood compared to where we were before. And it’s closer to both my siblings school and my own school. It’s still hard both spatially and mentally though- letting go of my childhood home. Even though it’s been six months, I’m still ~moving in~ and having to get new furniture and I still have a few things away in boxes.

In August for the fall semester, school and work were still online, and my siblings finally went back to school in person in October. It’s great, but still a drag because I have to pick them up from school and sometimes drop them off in the morning because there’s no early risers or after school program due to COVID. I had to plan my whole class schedule in August knowing that was coming. It’s not horrible, but it just sucks and is inconvenient, and it still applies to this spring semester.

Also, in August I started seeing a new psych for a few reasons. She diagnosed me with bipolar disorder, so she had to switch around my meds. It was VERY hard for me to adjust to them. I started seeing my therapist again in October. I’ve seen her on and off since I was 13 (for both good and bad reasons). I’m a little attached to her but she’s also not the best cause she talks 90% of the time. It’s hard finding a new therapist nowadays given the circumstances COVID has presented.

So today was my first day of school. I’m very very very overwhelmed. I’m taking 5 classes and I have a job/internship/scholarship where I can conduct my own undergraduate research. I’m really stoaked about that. But I’m just still really overwhelmed. The hours per week for the program is 2-3, so it’s basically like taking another class. I usually take 4 classes a semester and a few in the summer, but I didn’t take any in 2020 cause I was extremely burnt out. I won’t be able to take any this summer because the internship is full time. I’m thinking of dropping a class, but I don’t know. I’m already graduating two semesters late and I’m determined to not graduate any later. I’m seeing my therapist tomorrow and I’ll probably talk to my advisor later this week.

Also, a few days after Christmas, my boyfriend of 3 years and I broke up. He was my rock through everything this past year. And I mean everything. He was so patient with me and so comforting. My family adored him and invited him everywhere. My ex’s bio dad died before he was born, and his step dad wasn’t really the best growing up. My dad treated my ex like a son. My grandfather was the closest thing he had to a grandfather, and my grandpa even treated him like his own grandchild. My ex had his own financial problems, family obligations, and his own mental problems. From October-December we were fighting a lot. By the time December came along, we were both burnt out and the break up was kind of mutual. The only thing I’m straight up mad about is the way he handled the break up, but he’s a man, and he has the asshole front to mask his feelings, and he’s also hurt. So whatever I guess. I love him. I don’t think I ever will stop loving him. The love was most definitely mutual. He was my better half. He was my first real love. We were planning our future together. He pushed to become a better, more sane person. He pushed me to go back to therapy despite my mixed feelings about it. I pushed him to achieve his dreams. I helped him go back to school, and I was really looking forward to spend the semester with him since we would both be students.

A few days ago was my little sister’s 11th birthday and grandpas birthday. They were unintentionally birthday twins. It’s hard seeing my baby sister so desolate. The morning of her birthday she was bawling her eyes out. For me, it’s so hard for me thinking of my grandma’s first birthday without my grandpa (that was in early December), the first Christmas without him, his first birthday without him (ESPECIALLY since it was shared with my sister!).

With my grandfather’s death, my family has gotten even more close than we already were. My aunt from out of town has visited twice a month , or we visit her. My mom and I visit my grandmother even more than we already did. My family has become closer grieving my grandpas death. 

It’s hard not milking this, but it’s hard even dealing with my grandfather’s birthday without my ex. Like I said, my grandfather was practically my ex’s (only) grandpa too. When my grandpa started getting sick again, my ex would put his own sorrow away and be strong for me. He went to the funeral. My mental health further spiraled and he’d just hold me. He’d hold me. If I was violently crying, or if I just wanted to be held because of my anxiety. He brought my mom flowers for her birthday because she was a total daddy’s girl. He brought my grandmother flowers for her first birthday without her soul mate.

One more thing! I’m having really bad car problems, and I can’t run to my ex for help since he’s a mechanic. I can’t ask him for help with an employee discount. Even if we were together, luckily I have savings, but that’s all gonna go toward my car. And dammit! Retail therapy is my go to and it actually works!

I’m not religious and neither are my parents, but I’m beyond blessed. I’m extremely grateful and appreciative of most things that’s gone down this past year. Even with my grandfathers death, my family becoming even closer is so beautiful to me. Everything is just so incredibly fucking hard.

I’m sorry for my long post. I’m just looking for words of wisdom or kind words, or even advice from someone who’s had similar experiences. Thanks!"

I’m a senior mechanical engineer who has been dabbling with programming and data science ever since I took my first programming course my junior year. Since then I have taken two python courses and worked on multiple simple machine learning projects with scikit learn using kaggle data sets. I am also a research assistant at my school and my role is to debug legacy FORTRAN code in a Linux hpc. If you tell me to program something and allow me to use the internet I will be able to give results but I haven’t taken data structures or algorithms. The only advantage I really have is my mix matched experiences in programming and that I have to take far more math than cs majors (stat 1-3, calc 1-5, physics 1-5, LA) which is why the math and statistics that go into machine learning and deep learning come easy to me. I feel like I’m much better than the beginner course taker but way behind having a shot at doing anything cs at a decent company. Some tell me all I need is to practice leetcode and understand principles of data structures but I’m not sure. Also because I jump between python, MATLAB and FORTRAN I’m always using the internet to remember syntax and how the language works. After multiple mechanical internships I realized I want to get my masters in Cs and work in the cs field (even at my last internship I took on a gig to make a program that predicts costs of product builds just to get some experience with scikit learn).

I can do a 1 year Masters (top 15 CS program in US) and buy myself some time to try again for full time FAANG.

l0ygrx,1,2021-01-19,I either need more interviews or I need to interview better (or both). Help? :^),[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/l0ygrx/i_either_need_more_interviews_or_i_need_to/,"Preface:  I got my AS in Computer Networking in June 2019 and I'm about 1 month out from wrapping up my BS in IT at WGU. I've acquired the CompTIA A+, Net+, Sec+, Project+ and a few other smaller certs (LPI Linux Essentials for example). I've been working at a small local MSP for the past 1.5 years. They do things REALLY old school (timesheets and documentation are ALL in MS Excel, no ticketing system, etc). The cool thing is, I was thrown into the mix to deal with EVERYTHING that comes up with our clients. I manage everything from workstations to network devices to printers to servers, and I do it all the time. Great experience, but I'm also 1099 and I hate not having benefits and REALLY hate having such a lack of structure. 

I've applied to at least 300 IT jobs (Help Desk/Desktop Support/Netadmin/Sysadmin, etc) in the suburban Seattle area over the last 3 years. Probably more. Anyway, I've only had 5 IT interviews total. 2 of them ended up offering me the job but they are both actually the same company. The first interview was my temporary internship for the MSP I currently work for, and that position was essentially handed to me over a 2 minute phone interview. The second interview was a full-time position for the same MSP I interned for. This was months after the internship ended, FYI. I could tell they made the decision to hire me before I even interviewed though, so once again it felt handed to me in a way.

&amp;#x200B;

**The other 3 interviews where I didn't get the job (all essentially desktop support):**

**A)** I had 3 interviews total here. At the third interview, I was introduced to the higher ups in the office and I was pretty convinced at that point they were going to offer me the job. After the third interview ended, I had to wait over a MONTH for them to get back to me. When they finally did, they said that it was close, but they were going to go with another candidate. To be fair, I was still in community college and had no professional experience. Oh well.

**B)** I had 1 interview. I had my AS and a few months of internship experience at this point. I didn't get a vibe that the interviewer was impressed at all. I was told I would be contacted with a decision. Never heard from them again. Oh well.

**C)** I had 3 interviews total here. Similar to interview A, I was introduced to the important people within the medium-sized company on my 2nd and 3rd interview. In my second interview, the IT Director actually sat me down with the Marketing Director and told him to ""just talk to me"" (he seemed just as lost as I was, but he was very nice and friendly). He asked what I did for fun, and ONE of the things I mentioned was that I enjoyed gaming. Well, so did he. A lot. So we talked about Persona 4 for *45* *WHOLE MINUTES*. The IT director just watched us talk from a distance. For what it's worth, it was a great conversation, I listened well, I didn't interrupt, and when I did decide to speak up, I had nothing but well thought out additions to the conversation. The IT director ended our conversation eventually and told me to come back for another interview next week so that he could introduce me to more people. I wrongly figured, surely he wouldn't have me get to know all these people on this deep of a level for no reason? I mean, it's not really a prestigious position. The company is smaller and there is essentially no room for real growth. That seems a bit overkill. Well, after my 3rd interview this afternoon, which was an all-around great experience in my mind, I was denied the position with a cookie cutter response. Oh well...?

Is this normal? Is it common for employers to request a 3rd interview and not proceed to hire? I don't think I'm that abysmal at interviews. I always imagined I'm just as good if not better than other IT people that suck with soft skills. Regardless, shouldn't I be getting more opportunities to interview, anyway? Is my resume that bad? Anyone down to critique it for me?"

l0zjhz,3,2021-01-19,Should I double down by getting a master's degree when my undergrad sent me into a depression?,Wellas,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/l0zjhz/should_i_double_down_by_getting_a_masters_degree/,"I could probably write a book about this, but I will *try* to keep it short. Edit: woops, it's super long.  TLDR at bottom.

I graduated with a bachelor's of architecture 5 years ago. On one hand, I did fantastic - earned the praise of my peers and professors - and on the other hand, I barely made it out alive.  The program was sooooo taxing on me.  I never rested, never enjoyed myself, I was always stressed, I always had too much to do.  To say I suffered burnout is a gross understatement. I worked very briefly after graduating, felt incredibly disillusioned with the industry, then took off to travel.

Since graduating, I have gone to therapy for 2 years, I have slowly battled my way out of depression, and I have traveled all over the world volunteering and doing odd jobs. I have also spent a lot of time diving deep, trying to figure out 'what I want to do with my life'.  Name an online personality/interest test.  I've done it.  I've also read a few books on the topic (recommended by this sub) and spent countless hours listening to podcasts and researching online.  All roads seem to point back to architecture. 

So, on my most recent travels, which was a 6 month road trip in a van around the US, I actually started asking the more focused question of ""how can I do meaningful work within the industry of architecture?"" and I have eventually found about 10 firms doing work I am in love with.  3 of those firms, I'd move across the world to work for.  The rest of them, I really like, but not sure I'd completely move my life for them.

Now, I would totally apply right now, except the first thing they say in the design industry is ""show me your portfolio""  well... I don't have a portfolio.  Ok, easy- next step: create a portfolio.  Well, I am trying, but it is going to take many months to do so.  I am back living with my parents while I am trying to do this.  I am searching for design competitions relevant to the niche I want to work in, I am offering pro-bono work to nonprofits I have found, etc.  I am getting very little response, and the work I am finding is not exactly what I want to be doing.

So... Plan B would be to get a master's degree.  I could go back to school for 2-3 years, work my ass off, try and get a great internship, make connections, graduate with a portfolio, hit the ground running.  Right?

Well, that sounds great, but here's my biggest fear: I end up back where I was at the end of undergrad.  Burnt out.  Disillusioned.  Depressed. Completely fed up.  Hopeless.  

Maybe it's going to turn out that I just hate school.  I can tell you I definitely hate some of the BS that comes with academia, like needing to take classes I have no interest in, write silly essays on topics I don't care about, 'dance monkey dance, and get that piece of paper!' etc.  I definitely hate the fact that in school, it's all abstract.  You have these big, sexy design projects, but it's all make-believe and nothing concrete comes out of it.

On the other hand, maybe now that I have identified the niche that interests me, perhaps I could find a program that is in the area of the firms I like *and* allows me to focus on my area of interest.... I don't know. 

**TL;DR:** Anyways, I guess my question is this: Is it a horrible idea to double-down by getting a master's degree in a topic that nearly killed me? Is there something I can do to 'make sure' this is the right choice?  I don't want to gamble my literal life as well as tens of thousands of dollars of debt on the off chance that 'maybe I'll like it this time'. But, I can't really think of another good concrete option besides continuing what I'm doing and hoping I get noticed and eventually catch a break.  What do you think?"

l0zrp3,10,2021-01-19,Hopeless New Grad Looking for Advice,joltjames123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l0zrp3/hopeless_new_grad_looking_for_advice/,"Sorry if this sounds like a sad-sack post, but that's pretty much where I am at this point in my life/career. 

Long story short, I am a CSCI December grad who still doesn't have a job.

Longer story is that I graduated from a Big 10 university with a 3.95 GPA in Computer Science and it still seems like no one wants to hire me. Since September I've applied to over 200 positions and the vast majority haven't even responded. The ones who have responded either decide to go with another candidate or I fail their coding assessments. I am a smart person but these problems tend to trip me a lot. I have been practicing about 4-6 hours a day on Leetcode trying to get better but not much progress. If I had to guess, my biggest problem is my internships. I have had two ""tech"" internships but unfortunately neither were software development, which is what I want to get into, but I took them because they were the best offers at that time. I have the classic problem of companies wanting experience without giving it, or expecting new grads to have 3-5 years of experience in something I've never even heard of. I have even considered a few tech consulting jobs that seem similar to software development but ultimately wasn't chosen for those either. I know some of you are thinking just suck it up, but honestly I really need a light at the end of the tunnel. Obviously the 6 figures pipe dream is dead and buried for me but I'm just trying to find a $70k job that I'll at least somewhat enjoy. I'm struggling in life right now so any advice is appreciated. Thanks"
l103r9,10,2021-01-19,"Received an average annual review,5 months into first job.",Snoo_53395,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l103r9/received_an_average_annual_review5_months_into/,"Started working remotely,I got 4/5 for my communication &amp; team playing and 3/5 for technical stuff/productivity. My manager said no one really gets a 5 and anything below a 3 is worry some. That being said I feel I have just ""passed"" this review and cannot continue like this. What is more troubling is my job is a rotational program and I will leave my current team pretty soon and start a new tech stack and I feel I will suck there too.

Some background:

My company is pretty large (15k+),I had no internship or work experience before this job and did not know basic stuff at the beginning ( React,JS,git work flow,agile ethology)  and was a complete idiot for the first 2 months. 

My questions:

I’m signed up for ece 445 but I feel like I’d really prefer ece 411. The ECE 445 past projects seem really boring and difficult to me (I’m not interested in embedded or analog electronics). ECE 411 on the other hand seems perfect for me since I really like ECE 385, and I’m planning on pursuing a digital hardware career in processors (I enjoyed my AMD CPU internship and my recruiter contacted me about 2021 openings, although I’d have to pass the interviews of course). 

I’m talking with my advisor this week to see if they’ll let me turn the pre-req into a co-req esp since this is all I really need to graduate (and 5 tech hours which I’ll finish during the summer). Has anyone else taken them together before? On Dr. Everitt’s neighborhood it says the ece 391 knowledge is not strictly needed (and I’ve learned the knowledge before during my multiple attempts at 391) but I’m worried that the department will be strict esp. since I’m on probation. My plan is to take ECE 391, ECE 411, and Ling 406 (easy technical class but still useful). 

Anyone taken 391+411 together? Should I just bite the bullet and take 445, even though I doubt I’d get as much out of it/enjoy it as ECE 411 (I’ve heard contradicting things which ones harder so I’m basing my preference on personal interest). Any advice for my situation? I took a gap year after what was supposed to be my senior year (failed/withdrew bc depression) and I’m at the final stretch to being done with this school."

l1126y,32,2021-01-19,GWU from the perspective of someone from DC,piedrafundamental,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/l1126y/gwu_from_the_perspective_of_someone_from_dc/,"Okay, so! My mom has been a GWU professor literally my entire life, a lot of my babysitters earlier on were GWU grad students and undergrads, my dad’s been an on and off adjunct for the Elliot school, I go to a high school on GWU’s campus, and I’ve taken two dual enrollment classes there. So, needless to say, I have a lot of personal experience with GWU, although I don’t live too close to the main campus. 

1. The Foggy Bottom campus has about 4 or 5 blocks that are definitively GWU, where you are still in the midst of the city but most non-retail buildings are clearly GWU buildings, but from then on as you walk in any direction the campus vibe goes away pretty fast. I go to school on campus (before covid, anyway) but to this day I still cannot tell you where it is that students live. 

2. The stereotypes about GWU/Elliot school kids are true. There are a lot of kids from the Northeast (including NY) who are extremely into liberal politics and definitely have a bit too much of an ego about it. That being said, there is definitely diversity to be found. And honestly, there’s something to be said for a bunch of nerds whose favorite show is Parks and Rec. 

3. There are some really great opportunities at GWU, and students are good at making them happen. I really love seeing how excited students get about their internships. A lot of students do internships. 

4. I don’t think many students have access to a kitchen. (Edit: I was wrong — most freshman don’t have access to a kitchen, but it isn’t much of an issue for upperclassmen) There isn’t a dining hall — I think most students just eat out as there aren’t many other options. This is really expensive and I don’t think most students realize before they come here. The food options aren’t bad (lots of great food trucks, plus a whole foods to shop for groceries), though. 

5. GWU does struggle with socioeconomic diversity, and this hasn’t been helped by the new university president who has been advocating to reduce the incoming class size. 

6. The fact that GWU has its own metro station is a game changer. You can go pretty much anywhere with the metro, and it’s great. I do feel that many GWU students who come to live in DC definitely miss out on interacting with DC culture beyond downtown/the scope of the various federal agencies. Having the metro right there makes it so easy to explore the city, but I’m not sure to what extent students take advantage of it beyond using it to get to their internships. 

7. Student culture is positive, nerdy and friendly. GWU is pretty chill, where you can talk about school/work in a non-competitive way. I think that there is an intensity and maybe even competition when it comes to internships — they are a part of GWU culture. But students are eager to help, and eager to serve. They join on and off campus organizations, (I’ve for sure been a beneficiary of GWU students helping out in my community/communities), they like to engage with the world on and off campus. I know many students find community within fraternities/sororities, student organizations and cultural organizations. 

8. For what it’s worth, my dad (who’s been an adjunct at both GWU and Georgetown, and who works in international policy) says that all of his GWU interns have been outstanding, especially in comparison to Georgetown students. My mom says that she thinks that there are some students who are brilliant, and others who very much aren’t, but that that shouldn’t be a surprise. 

9. DC right now is scary. But I think that the GWU students over the past four years have really worked within DC and their home states to fight for social justice on campus and within the broader national scale. People don’t typically think of GWU students as activists, as they’re considered more to want to make change within the system than putting pressure from the outside. But this is changing. I think that coming here is a really exciting thing to do, and DC’s community is a great place to learn. 

10. Some last things: DC is its own city. It is not (yet) a state. You will not be able to vote for a senator. Historically, DC has been a predominantly black city, although it is currently facing intense gentrification that has been ongoing for years. GWU is a part of that gentrification and demographic change. This shouldn’t dissuade you from it; but it is nonetheless an important reminder. Also, DC is a predominantly liberal city that has vibrant diversity (political, cultural) within. 

11. Fun facts (precovid/on campus) :
- Tons of people like to ride those motorized scooters!
- The Kennedy Center is a few blocks away and has free performances every night (also great for insta pics, ngl) 
- DC has an amazing food scene!! The suburbs also have really rich Ethiopian and Salvadoran communities. 
- DC is one of those cities where there are so many fun and free things to do. Take advantage of it! Whether it’s going to a free festival or concert or museum, there’s so much to do. 
- The DC Public Library system is amazing, truly. 
- The student multicultural center is wonderful
- You will feel really cool having gotten to know the capital city for an amazing four years and will be proud of all that has become familiar to you. 
- As a student, you can access covid testing

l1142q,2,2021-01-19,Insight on possible career choice (Corporate Finance to MBA and IB path),baboubou,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/l1142q/insight_on_possible_career_choice_corporate/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm reaching out to the community as I am a bit lost in regards to my potential in the current job market and what would be possible for me to achieve career-wise. I am currently looking into FP&amp;A or a job as a Financial Strategy Analyst, but I have questions. Here's my background : 

\- Undergrad in Political Sciences (Specialization in Economics and Finance) at a prestigious European school (for Poli-sci). Students from here usually end up in politics or high-ranking management at big companies (including Big4), although it is mostly in France.

\- Master in Risk and Quality Management (mainly corporate finance classes, 2-year degree) at the same school, as well as MSF from a non/semi-target (the MSF program is well ranked and has good placement, especially in corporate finance). GPA of 3.7/4 and Dean's List. I'll graduate in December 2021. 

\- A few internships, including one at a French Investment bank and one at a global insurance company (that does investments). A lot of university involvements in clubs and leadership positions. Trilingual.

I did an MSF as well as another master's because my French diploma is a 5-year degree, with the possibility of earning a dual-degree in the 5th year. I got a nearly full-ride and the program is STEM so it's a good way to be more employable in the US (European national), also learning about finance and standing a chance in interviews was a must. 

I realize that my resume is just not competitive enough to make it in IB or even as a Financial Analyst in a fund. I am however interested in working in corporate finance, work a few years and go back to school to earn an MBA at a top school (I earned a good score at the GMAT and could easily make it into the 700+ again then) to switch into IB. 

\- Is my goal to get employed in corporate finance doable? I am looking for work in the Bay Area in basically every Silicon Valley startup and big tech (I do have experience with coding which I think would help?)

\- Is getting an MBA  after two master's overkill at this point? I'm thinking the networking would be the most important part (most of my network is in Europe, although I am building one here), but I also understand I'd need an MBA for IB. 

Thanks in advance for your help, and I would greatly appreciate the feedback. Should you need clarifications, feel free to reach out."

l123ir,94,2021-01-19,Actual Help - Pseudo-Guide for regular people who are looking for entry-level jobs,chuchodavids,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/l123ir/actual_help_pseudoguide_for_regular_people_who/,"I will try to create a guide on how to get your feet in the door. This sub can be very intimidating and unhealthy for regular people who are not aiming for a FAANG and just want to get a position in ""whatever"" company willing to hire them(like me). This guide is for the regular human being that is not a genius or a prodigy. Ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those. I will divide my guide in multiple parts such as, should I go to college or to a bootcamp, top tier college or no-name college?, LinkedIn, Leetcode, Projects, Interview, Resume, and finally my personal story.

Before starting I want to disclaim that I am not an expert in any of this, this is a non-professional guide and it will mostly be opinionated and based on personal experience. I have good intentions nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

* Should I go to College, or should I go to a bootcamp?

This is my opinion but if you have the time, go to a college. Many companies are now filtering candidates without formal education. This mostly apply to those who have not a degree in any field yet. I am not saying there are no positions for people without a degree, because I know there are. But formal education does more good than harm in the long term. I would strongly recommend going the college route if that is a possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

* Top tier College or Low tier college?

This one is very controversial, many people would say that the college you go in is very important. In my personal experience, it had no relevance. I chose my school because it was the cheapest one I could find. My student debt is about $5k as a senior. I would recommend to anyone to choose your school not because of the name, but because it is convenient for your current situation. If you can save money by going to a no-name school, do it, it is still worth it. Another good recommendation is to do two years of community college and transfer, you will save a good amount of money by doing so. This is actually what I did.

What matters more than the name of your school is how much effort you put in learning your shit. Just as an example, my coworker went to one of the top five schools for CS in the U.S., he is working for a ""low-tier"" company, owns a lot of money in loans and is working two jobs to keep up with his college debt. Meanwhile, I have offers from two great companies and have almost no debt. This is just an example and means nothing, but it shows that going to the best university does not mean you will be successful right away. You still have to work hard for it.

&amp;#x200B;

* LinkedIn:

Do you have one? If you don't, stop reading and go create one right now. Really, many students don't realise that recruiters are looking for people, they are desperate, they will message you with whatever offer just because. You need to be out there; you need to get expose and see that companies are actually interested in your set of skills. This one was the game changer to me. I got reached by a company that I would have not even dreamed to work for. At the end. they kick my ass in the interviews and I went not far away in the hiring process. However, I realized that recruiters and companies were actually interested in me. If this HUGE company was considering in interview me, then I was not as lame as I thought I was. This opened my eyes, and I started applying everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

* You don't know how to create your LinkedIn profile? here are my personal tips:

Go with the basics and add your school and personal info. You want your summary to be short and to the point. Don't add any crap that has nothing to do with your final goal. Add what industry you're aiming to in your summary. For instance, if you want to be a DevOps, add ""Aspiring DevOps"" or any shit that will help the recruiter know what your intentions are. If you don't know what are you want to go in, just be general, i.e. ""Aspiring Software Engineer"" or ""CyberSecurity student trying to ...""

Also, delete anything that is not related to your final goal. I mean, I see many people who have 10 jobs listed that are from MacDonalds to Target customer service. Remove all that crap and only use things that are related with the position that you are looking for. You don't want a recruiter to get to your profile and ditch it because he has to read 10 pages to know what your skills are.

what if I have no experience in relating with my goals?

Then just use your current job and one past job. Or just your current job. In this case, I realized that if you don't have relevant experience the less you add the better.

&amp;#x200B;

* Should I grind Leetcode?

If you want to, then go ahead. But You don't have to. No matter what this crazy sub says. You don't need to spend 9999999 hours in Leetcode. This is my Leetcode profile: [Leetcode](https://imgur.com/a/d2BdPjI). I solved two freaking exercises. To be honest, I could solve nothing else. I was not good enough for the hard exercises. I found out a way to actually learn without feeling bad with yourself. If you cannot solve an exercise, see the solution, don't feel bad about that. Then, type the code in your IDE, don't copy the code, type letter by letter yourself and try to understand the problem. Even if you did not come with the solution yourself, you will learn a lot from this activity.

Also, after many interviews and technical assessments, I realized that many companies won't even use the hard exercises in their technical interviews. They will use easy-medium and they really want to see your logical thinking rather than if you solve the problem. I am talking about non-FAANG companies tho. Therefore, go with easy and medium exercises and try to understand how to solve them.

This sub makes you think that companies are throwing einstein-only-can-solve-this exercises because everyone here only talks about Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft. But I can bet that 90% of the people in this sub are like me, who gives a fuck about those and just want to get a fucking job wherever they can.

&amp;#x200B;

* I don't know what projects to list in my resume

This was my case. I was very lost and felt very overwhelmed by seeing people here doing 400+ Leetcode exercises and having GitHub profile with many projects. I would say 70% of the interviews I was into, the interviewers were very interested in the set of skills I listed in my resume; I gained those in whiting a year.

Media server project: This was my main project in my resume. I thought it was silly of me to add this one in my resume; but I had nothing else to put in it. Turns out, this one got me two jobs offers. This project is just using microservices to download movies and shows. And then you can watch that media in your Plex, Jellyfin or Emby server. The interesting part of this project is that you need to use Docker, Network Attach storage, Linux, LXC containers, Virtualization. This project escalates pretty fast. You can start with a Raspberry Pi and last thing you know you have a huge home server at home. This project also teach you basic and advanced networking skills. I found out that Docker and network skills are precious in the industry. Many aspirants will have experience with coding, but not that many will have experience with technologies as Docker, networks or Ansible. That will make you stand out. This project is fairly easy and well documented online. You can find thousand of tutorials online.

Ansible project: this project was literally one hour project. I installed Ansible in my virtualization server (which I already had with my media server) and controlled 10+ Raspberries Pi from there.

* Want to do a different project?

Go buy a Rasberry Pi and buy a Rasberry Pi projects magazine. There are many projects with guides that you can use to populate your resume. I realized that for entry-level jobs, what matters is that you went out of your way in your free time and do whatever project. That shows you have passion. I got interviews for things that were not even related to my projects. and I got an offer that is also not related directly to my projects.

&amp;#x200B;

* Got an interview?

First relax. I found out that the interviews I was most worried about; I did terrible. I did very well in the ones I had no interest in. This is because I was not nervous and spoke without fear of not being chosen. A good tip is, remember the person interviewing you is still a human being. This person is not a god or is not superior to you. They are still people with feelings and opinions. Be yourself and don't be a robot. A robot is the person who will be serious the whole time and answer questions repetitively. Be open, be funny, SMILE.

If you are in a video interview, SMILE SMILE SMILE SMILE SMILE SMILE. Don't be fucking serious. Smile the whole time. I don't mean to have your mouth open like a lunatic, but a smirk on your face will help, even if you are shitting your pants.

In every interview (as an entry-level), there is going to be a moment in which you will be asked something that you have to answer with a non-appealing answer. FOr instance, do you know how to code in Assembly? or what frameworks have you used in Java(I was asked this actually)? ALWAYS ALWAYS be honest, if you don't know, you don't know. However, if you have to say something negative about you, say something positive about you right away.

For example, what frameworks have you used in Java?

\- I don't have any experience with any framework like Spring Boot. but I did not know how to speak English either, and here I am after three years. I am a fast learner and a dedicated person, I will put all my effort in learning how to use it.

\- Do you know any other language besides Java?

No, however, I have been learning a little Python in my free time, and I realized that once you know how to program using one language, other programming languages are easier to learn, they just make sense.

\- Say something about you you want to improve?

**whatever XXXXX I am not good at**. But I have been working on it, and so far I am doing better than before. And from this  I have learn to XXXXX.

Basically, no matter what it is, but if you have to say something bad about you, say something good right after the bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

* Do you have questions for me/us (the interviewer)?

You will be asked this, always... Many people will ask something like ""how is the day of an x position engineer? please don't ask this, please don't. Everyone is asking this same questions because it is the first question that Google suggest that you ask. God knows I have asked this, many times. Instead, ask something more personal like: ""How do you like x state?"" ""what do you do for fun in your free time in x state?( this is not asking about the person but more about what activities can you do in X state)"", ""I am curious why after N years are you still working for this company, what do you like the most?"" Thiss type of questions are open-ended and you can create a real conversation with your interviewer. Many times I laughed with the interviewers at the end of the interview for questions like this. They opened up, and I could show off my charm. And hey if you make them laugh at least you will make them talk about personal experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

* Resume:

This is very important. Take the same advice from LinkedIn. Ditch anything that is not related to your final goal. Leave it simple. If you don't have experience in the field, list your last job or current job and that's it, use the remaining space for projects and skills. Use this [website](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwih7ZWk06nuAhWTXc0KHau6AVMQFjAAegQIARAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livecareer.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw33mCgeIRNNbIvgESDA6j4A) if you need help to build your resume. I do not work for Livecarrer tho, you can use any other website that has the same purpose I guess. I used that one and had good success. I cannot say too much about this one because I am not an expert by any means. Well, to be fair, I am not an expert in any of what I have wrote so far.

&amp;#x200B;

About me

I am 30 years old. Senior student. Going to the cheapest college I could have chosen. Following my crappy guide I got two job offers, one for a HUGE COMPANY in the US (not FAANG) and also got many interviews (which I got rejected), technical interviews (which I got rejected) for actual jobs ( I mean not for internships). I will start working for a big corporation soon. It is not any FAANG; I never applied to any FAANG. Also, I did not apply to anything that I was required to write an essay or recommendation letter. Why? because I am fucking lazy. My first language is Spanish. My entry-level offer is very good for a first job in the industry.

More:

I would say that in 50% of the interviews, interviewers were more interested in my Docker, Ansible, Virtualization, containerization, Linux skills than what they were about how many programming languages I knew.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you are looking for an entry level position and you have had no luck, I will encourage you to send me a PM, I will be very please to help you fix your LinkedIn and your Resume, you just have to know that I am not an expert.

l12qih,15,2021-01-20,"Has anybody else felt like they haven't learned anything at all from Computer Science classes? Just this constant feeling of doubt and anxiety, semester after semester, building up more and more with no end ? If you have, how have you tackled it? What is the cause in your view?",hookup1092,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/l12qih/has_anybody_else_felt_like_they_havent_learned/,"**Some context**: I am a sophomore, going into my second semester of classes this spring. I never really had this innate sense in my heart to pursue computer science as a major and career, but most of the classes I took in high school that I liked were in the/related in some ways to the field, which is why I choose Computer Science as my major. Since then I have taken Data Structures in C++, intro to ai, and pretty much ""gone ahead"" from typical student scheduling according to my advisor in my classes and major progress. 

Despite all that, I really don't feel like I have learned anything. Throughout the major process so far, it feels like each Computer Science class I take, I end up getting a good grade and understanding *in the moment*, and then once the semester ends, I forget a majority of the information that I learned. Even when I have tried to review some of the things I have forgotten or aspects that I never understood in the first place, like some data structures, or concepts that I couldn't get during class, I just can't seem to muster the drive for it once class is over. It just seems so....*foreign*?

I can acknowledge that part of the problem is that I don't know what to apply any of the stuff I am learning. For example, last semester in the fall I learned about A\* Search algorithms in Intro to AI. Great! Makes sense to me on paper and I was able to struggle and fail my way to success to program it for a class project. But once class is over, I am just left confused. What can I do with this concept? I don't know where to start, or what to even start *on*.

And now my friends and family are telling me about applying for cs-internships for this summer of 2021 (which I am definitely late to the party for) and next summer, to prepare my resume, to grind leetcode and create some ""portfolio"" projects to help with finding a job, and all of this useful information, that I don't know what to do with and were to start. Half of the stuff I just learned that I should be doing a couple weeks ago. I tried applying to a couple local internships in my area with a semi-rushed resume that I made, and the requirements always seemed like I would not qualify, and most of them required technical interviews which I doubt I will be able to pass. I have gotten rejected immediately by a couple. I have also tried some easy leetcode questions, which I knew how to answer in my head, but it took much longer to answer it on the website. And of course my answer was always brute-force and not the smarter solutions like hashing that we are constantly taught to use in classes. It just makes me not want to program more and more, *despite* being a Computer Science major, where programming seems to be all you should be doing.

To people who are or have felt this way in the past, how have you tackled it? Was the cause something to do with you and your studying habits? Could it be that your heart wasn't  situated in computer science as career path? Or something else? What advice could you give to me?

Thank you for your time and assistance. I really appreciate any advice/direction you can give."

Will be learning Microsoft tools like powerbi, form, sharepoint, access, power automate. Planning to do SIP this summer.

The internship offer came much earlier than I expected and I am not sure whether to accept it or not. I have sent applications to other companies not long ago and have intended to attend the career fest for more internship opportunities. I am also not sure how useful will this internship be because of my lack of knowledge on Microsoft tools. 

Can a senior/someone with experienced advise whether I should take up this internship? How useful are Microsoft tools to my future computing career? If I want to take some time to consider, how long should I take?"
l157he,47,2021-01-20,rice from the perspective of a native houstonian,Anon3724,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/l157he/rice_from_the_perspective_of_a_native_houstonian/,"Technically, I live in a suburb of Houston, but that's just semantics. Sorry in advance for the word-vomit because I'm typing this at 1 am.

**Rice's vibe?**

* Since I'm only a senior, I'll be going off what some of my friends have said for this section. It's definitely as close-knit and collaborative as people have said. Residential Colleges play a major part in social life because it becomes your family and home. A lot of bonding happens during O-Week. Each college has its own traditions, dining hall, social events, etc. It's easy to stay inside your own college's bubble, but if you want to branch out, there's no problem doing so.
* I have visited the campus, and I quite liked it. Trees are everywhere, so you are shielded from the scorching Texas sun. Idk how to describe the architecture, but it's the same style from building to building, immersing you in that Rice environment.
* My friend was mentored by a Rice professor as a junior, so Rice professors are approachable and open from what we've seen!

**What's the weather like?**

* The weather is as ehhh as you think it is. There are only two seasons --hot and cold--, but it can change throughout the day too. 
* We have humidity here which feels disgusting and suffocating, especially after warm showers. (I'm still not used to it even after living here for so long.)
* For the cold, it goes as low as the mid-30s, so it's not too bad. That being said, *always* dress in layers or bring a jacket because we like to put the AC on full blast. Also, bring an umbrella because it randomly rains.
* We have hurricane season from June to November. It shouldn't be too much of an issue unless you live in Galveston. Plus, we had Hurricane Harvey recently, and global warming is a fat yikes, so you should make an evacuation plan just in case.

**What are the available academic opportunities?**

* Well, Rice is near the Texas Medical Center (TMC) which is the largest in the world; so for you pre-meds and scientists out there, there are many many many opportunities. You can conduct research, shadow doctors, etc. I was able to work on a project there as a junior, so don't be afraid to reach out.
* Moreover, we're the Energy Capital of the World as well as a port. Thus, the energy, oil, and gas industries are very prevalent here. Most of these companies are Downtown or along I-10. If you're in engineering, business, computer science, natural sciences, environmental sciences, public policy, etc., there are plenty of internships for you. At my high school, we have an internship program, and many of my friends intern at these companies. Therefore, I'm pretty sure if you go to Rice, you'll have the same and (most likely) even more opportunities.
* I almost forgot that we have NASA Mission Control which is about half an hour away. I also heard Elon Musk is moving to Texas, with a SpaceX facility near Brownsville (which is really far) and a Tesla factory outside Austin.

**What are fun things to do in Houston?**

* Tbh, Houston is not a touristy city, so there's not a lot of major attractions per se. However, students generally get discounts. Near Rice, you have the Museum District which has a wide variety of options: The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Museum of Natural Sciences, Children's Museum (love this one), etc. For performing arts, you have the Houston Symphony at Jones Hall (amazing but I'm biased), Houston Ballet at Wortham Theater Center, concerts, musicals, and plays at various places, etc. My favorite event is the ""Summer Symphony Nights"" at Miller Outdoor Theater: you lay on a picnic blanket and watch the night sky as you listen to incredible playing. Also, we have an aquarium and a zoo.
* For shopping, the Galleria is the main area, but there are malls everywhere.
* For sports, Houston has the Astro, Texans, Rockets, and Dynamos. I don't keep up with sports, so I can't tell you much about it. All I know is that football is **big** here among certain crowds. Friday night lights are a thing. It's a way of life for some people, so you'll probably attend at least one tailgate and one football game eventually.
* To put it bluntly, Houston is flat, like really flat. The only hilly/tall stuff is the highways. Nevertheless, we have beautiful parks for hiking, biking, running, etc., like Discovery Green, Buffalo Bayou, and Hermann (this one is right across Rice). If you want to go swim, you can drive to Galveston which is an hour away. However, the water there is often dirty, and clear water is so rare that it made the news (Article: [https://abc13.com/blue-water-at-galveston-island-pretty-beach/6256438/](https://abc13.com/blue-water-at-galveston-island-pretty-beach/6256438/)). If you want clear water and nice beaches, then you have to go to Corpus Christi or South Padre Island which are around 3 and 6 hours away respectively. If you want waterparks, we have Schlitterbahn in Galveston, Typhoon Texas, and Splashtown, to name a few.
* If you want to visit a different city, Austin and San Antonio are about 2.5-3 hours away while DFW is around 4 hours away.

**How's the food scene?**

* My favorite part of Houston easily! ***You definitely need to try as many restaurants as you can when you come here!*** There are so so many different cuisines to try, but Houston is most known for Mexican, Tex-Mex, BBQ, Burgers, Southern, and Vietnamese. I love the latter in particular because surprise-surprise: I'm Vietnamese-American! What's also nice is the price range, so you can get a $1 taco for lunch and then splurge $100 on sushi for dinner if you wanted to.
* There's great food all over the city, but for East and Southeast Asian cuisines, Bellaire is the place to go! There's no shortage of boba shops ofc. For South Asian cuisine, there's a large concentration of restaurants in Hillcroft.
* There's Rice Village nearby too which has a decent selection of restaurants.
* Some of my favorites: Nam Giao (Central Vietnamese food), Crawfish &amp; Noodles (Cajun-Viet cuisine), Don's Café Sandwich (Vietnamese sandwiches), Mai's (late-night Vietnamese food, lots of doctors eat there after shifts), Phở 54 (Vietnamese noodle soup, great when it's hot or cold outside), Breakfast Klub, Ninfa's or Pappasito's (Tex-Mex, order fajitas), Tacos Tierra Caliente, Mala Sichuan Bistro, Gen Korean BBQ, Phat Eatery, Hopdoddy, Govinda's Vegetarian Cuisine, and I could go on and on and on...

**To access all these things, do you need a car?**

* Yes and no. If you want to go anywhere, you need some form of transportation. If I remember correctly, Rice gives students passes to the METRO, Houston's transit system. I have never used the METRO, so I can't give much detail about it. However, you should probably bring your car or friend a person with a car, so it's easier to explore Houston and such. Plus, gas is cheaper here compared to other states.
* Traffic can be bad around rush hours, but compared to other cities, it's not too bad. During these jams, you'll still be cruising or moving, at least.
* Btw, Texan drivers are scary.

**What's the cost of living?**

* Honestly, I don't have enough context to give a definitive answer, but from what I've heard, it's pretty affordable --housing, gas, and food in particular. However, I've noticed more and more gentrification around the city, so the cost of living is probably increasing.

**Is Houston the stereotypical ""yee-haw"" city?**

* Not really, for the most part. However, when the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo comes, everyone gets their ""yee-haw"" on --wearing that one pair of cowboy boots they have, eating ginormous turkey legs and fried Oreos, watching concerts of country musicians (btw, if you like kpop, it's sort of a rip because most groups tend to go to DFW so 😥). 
* Many people use ""y'all"" to address others, and there are noticeably more Ford/Chevrolet trucks here than in other states. 
* Of course, you have the group of actual farmers and ""cowboys,"" but they tend to live in the outskirts of Houston.

**What's the political culture and diversity like?**

* It's a mix. Texas is predominately conservative (although I think it's turning purple), but Houston is a major city, so it leans liberally. Thus, the balance of power tends to swing between the two parties. You'll find both viewpoints anywhere you go in Houston, and people are generally civil about them (well as civil as they can be with politics). Notably, Houston has no zoning laws.
* Houston is very diverse (as evidenced by the food scene). *However*, Houston is segregated by socioeconomic status: those with ""higher"" status tend to live in the northwest, west, or south while those with a ""lower"" status tend to live in the northeast or east. Suburbs tend to be wealthier than urban areas too.
* Rice is in a wealthy area, so it's easy to get stuck in that bubble. I would encourage you to make a conscious effort to reach out to the greater community or venture out. I personally think trying different restaurants or shopping at different grocery stores (i.e. Viet Hoa, Seiwa Market, etc.) is a good launching point.

**How safe is Houston?**

* It's like any other city. Use common sense and street smarts.

**Feel free to pm me if you have any more questions!**"
l16my8,7,2021-01-20,If only my professor could see the rest of the story,Jaboticaballin,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/l16my8/if_only_my_professor_could_see_the_rest_of_the/,"**TL/DR:** Inattentive ADHD in college - feel like my professor will only see my incompetence instead of all the progress I've made in terms of procrastination, time management, and memory as I ask for a second deadline extension during a very competitive internship.

I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD about two months ago, I'm a junior in college and just began a fairly prestigious and competitive internship with the state legislature through my school. As part of the internship, I was part of a high octane preparation class that crammed a semester's worth of material (for a 3 credit class) into a single week. I knew going into the class that the intensity would be really hard for me, so I set aside time way back in December to go through the syllabus and carefully put on my calendar and my reminders app when every little assignment was due. That worked out pretty well, but for some reason (maybe just the fact that I couldn't have my cake and eat it too), I didn't put on the calendar the date of the final exam (worth over half the final grade). Yesterday - a day after the exam period had closed and the internship itself had already started - I got an email from the professor of the prep class asking me if everything was alright because I hadn't taken the final exam. I apologized and thankfully he extended the deadline to the end of the day. I felt so stupid but grateful that he would make an exception for me.

I spent the rest of the day at the internship itself trying to soak everything in since it was my first day. I've been trying terribly hard to be proactive about things and not let my ADHD get in the way of my success (or even come up in the professional setting at all). In that sense, I did pretty well - I've been so worried about feeling like an imposter that I've managed to get well ahead on several projects. I've also been so nervous about forgetting to wake up on time or to have all my things ready that I've set a bunch of alarms on my phone and I've packed up my clothes for the gym and for work together with my breakfast and lunch for the coming day. I feel like the uncle in *It's a Wonderful Life* after he misplaces a ton of money and feels absolutely distraught because he always has to have a bunch of little strings on his hand to remind him not to forget things.

Amid all that preparation and fear, I totally spaced taking the final exam, *even after my professor had extended the deadline just for me.* I woke up out of nowhere at 3 AM just now so terrified and ashamed that I let my stupid brain forget something so important **again**. I just rattled off my sob story in an email to my professor, asking for *another* deadline extension (like who does that?).

What hurts the most is that I felt like I had been making so much progress as far as dealing with my ADHD in a school/work setting, and yet my professor is going to think I'm the biggest idiot ever, and that I'm not going to do a good job with this internship. I just wish he could see all the trouble I've gone to making sure I've done well up until this point (i've gotten almost 100% on everything else in the class). I already feel like an imposter at this internship, as I'm surrounded by other very driven and successful students. I'm otherwise a very capable and smart student, I just lose it with deadlines sometimes. I keep meaning to get an accommodations letter from my school's accessibility center, but I keep forgetting/putting that off too! I feel like if I were blind or in a wheelchair my professor would have no qualms about making special exceptions, but since it's a mental thing it probably just seems like a cop-out from a student who's blowing off the class and not putting in enough work.

Anyways, it's about 3:30 AM now and I'm literally shaking with how distraught I am about this whole thing. My professor is a pretty intense guy and I'm worried I'm going to fail the prep class that I was otherwise very successful in. I'm also freaking out because I don't know that I'll be able to fall back asleep and get the sleep I need to do well at my second day at the internship."

Also, what should I do so that I do not have to return to India if I pursue MS there. Or should I work in the industry first and then try to move out after some time. 

I do not have any preference regarding the country, as long as it fills some basic requirements. Like basic pollution free environment,  no useless bureuracy and corruption in government facilities etc. Hopefully I added all the information, but please tell me if I need to add more information."

**Demographics:** Male, Arab ( international student), upper-middle class, and I go to a somewhat competitive high school in my province ( it's considered one of the best) + I don't know if this counts but I'm a Shia that lives in Saudi, we're a real minortiy - only about 10% -and sorta discriminated.

**Intended Major:** ARCHITECTURE

**Cumulative GPA:** I have a GPA equivalent of 4( to be exact it's a 98.88), my schools don't offer rankings nor APs, but I think if they offered ranking I'd be at the top 7 or smth not sure.

**Coursework:** My school doesn't offer any APs or anything really special, except this gifted students program that I'm part of ( it's kinda selective)

**EC activities:**

\- Founded my school's Ted-Ed club.

\- Started a peer-mentorship program at school for enrichment programs.

\- Founded a regional volunteering club, organized multiple events, and established a partnership with the most known park in my province, raised about $3000, we roughly impacted about 10000+ people.

\- Co-Tutor for school's Math Olympiad club, a couple of kids now are in Olympiad yay!

\- Founder of an after school study session for advanced curriculum kids, also taught younger kids

\- Did an internship at the place that rents offices, was the co-chief editor, and projected about $5000, and regulated over 20 courses for students.

\- Founded an architecture club during the pandemic that gave high school students early insight into architecture.

\- Member of a high school research club, conducted three pieces of research, won 6th place in a national competition, and earned $2000 for a regional one.

\- Co-captain of a local soccer team.

\- Leadership program in the UK, at Sandhurst sponsored by my country.

\- Summer program at MIT

**Honors**

3. Accepted by an elite Prep Program
4. Selected from the top 2% of Saudi students to be part of a gifted students program
5. Selected for an exchange student program in Taiwan.
6. 2nd place in Best ted talk competition

**Essays:** Wrote about how I used writing to recover from a friend that backstabbed me ( I'd give it a 9/10, because I've shown it to my college counselor and other people and they really like it so yeah :) ). For my supplementals, I think I really showcased my personality, but I don't wanna rate them out just makes me feel self-conscious

**LORs:** I have four, One from my counselor (obvs), he says that he wrote something nice but I really don't know, two are from teachers ( math and English) that I think  personally were maybe superb since I did have a personal connection with both, and the last one was from the CEO of the internship I had ( we're on good termbases so why not)

Idk if this helps, but I ED to Cornell and got rejected, so yeah..

But I think that's it, anyway thanks!!!"

One day one of my  friend met with accident. I couldn't handle that. And I had not slept for 5 days even after taking tablets ( prescribed by my doctor). That day I had to sleep anyhow, I took 5 sleeping tablets and 8-9 anxiety tablets at once just to sleep without any other intention. I knew that dose is not fatal. I texted my friends before taking that I had to sleep, I can't handle this situation, I m not getting sleep even after taking 2 tablets, so I'm doubling my dose . Next day they informed my parents and sent me home for one month. That was the last time I talked with my best friend. He never talked to me when I came back from home. I don't know the reason. I cried, begged to tell atleast the reason for doing like this for me. But still I never gave up. I took my medication, exercised, whenever I had a had day I used to double duty in hospital (That's the only thing that I enjoyed and diverted my mind). I slowly recovered and my treatment was tapered and stopped last month. As I recovered I lost my other friends too. I don't know the reason even why they did like that. I miss my friends and my bestfriend daily. I have frequent breakdown whenever I see him. I blame everything on me. I have done some terrible thing that they left me.I don't know how to handle this situation. I have come here after I lost everyone who can understand me. And I don't want to go to that sabe phase again."

I recently got accepted into STEP as a sophomore and already have accepted an offer from BofA for the SWE (Technology Analyst) role. I am really confused between the two, though I am kinda leaning towards Google because of

1. prestige
2. return offer for SWE internship
3. tech company obviously

But the positives of BofA are that

1. it is an actual SWE internship
2. wont have to renege
3. pay is marginally better

I would really appreciate seeing what others think and why I should pick one over the other. Thank you!

At the moment, I feel a bit lost and uncertain, and unconfident. It's been 10 months since I left the U.S. amid the outbreak of the COVID pandemic in mid-March 2020 and a lot has happened.

I failed to secure a summer internship in the field of project management in my province back in China as there were no such job postings at the time. But I did intern at a tech firm, basically helping algorithm engineers with NLP (natural language processing) as a language major.

After the end of the summer break, as I continued my studies into the second year, I had a clearer picture of the responsibilities of a localization project manager (LPM) in an American context.

However, the LPM role in China is different and the demand for the role is much smaller. To be honest, that's why I think working in China after graduation with a master's degree would not work very well for me.

But since I've not worked as an LPM intern in any U.S. firm, now I have a very vague impression of what it is like and am uncertain about my career path. I think the best way is to secure a position before graduation to see if LPM really works for me. And if not, I may have to spend extra time and money preparing for a fully-funded Ph.D. in the research of Computational Linguistics. And yes, of course, that can take some hard time making up the undergraduate level math classes. But that seems to be the hard truth of life in the Artificial Intelligence Era:(

Thanks!"

My current grade is 80 (I believe equivalent to a 4.0 GPA but don't quote me, I'm not sure) which puts me in the top 5% of students in my cohort.

Anyway, I've recently been applying to placements and internships and had absolutely no luck. I have projects on my CV, but I haven't had a huge number of interviews. Even when I have interviewed, I haven't had any success. In the most recent case, I know I solved the coding interview problem perfectly but received a rejection almost immediately after.

Long story short, I feel completely demoralised and defeated, and I'm considering giving up completely. I'm starting to feel like there's no point even carrying on with my degree if I can solve problems in an interview but still not have any success getting a job.

Has anybody in a similar position to me ever felt like this? Can anybody offer any advice? I'd appreciate any insight you have."

Any job suggestions?,DokiElly,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/l1hml4/i_24f_quit_my_career_any_job_suggestions/,"Hello everyone, so, I'm going to get a little personal.  Here's my situation. I graduated with a degree in elementary education. I loved it and graduated with a 3.8 GPA. While working part time with an internship. I had hardly any social life in college, lol. 
I am fully certified in my state and taught for a little over 3 years. In those three years I worked myself sick. I learned that I didn't like being a teacher. I didn't enjoy the classroom management, I enjoyed helping tlmy students, talking and building relationships with them. I loved the kids but I was incredibly stressed managing a room of 30 children while teaching and wearing all the hats teachers must do in their role. I think I want to work with adults or young adults in my next career. All without being paid the 15-20 extra unpaid work I did a week. 

I also got incredibly sick and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and moderately severe migraines. I was as given medicine for both which did (and still do) help. But the stress was causing migraines that made me unable to drive home from work without pulling over to vomit. (I really let myself throw up from stress and the pain of my migraines 3 -4 times a week coming home from work for four months of my career before getting pain management medicine. 🙃

I snapped finally, secured my old part time job and put in my two weeks after a student (who was removed from the room FOUR TIMES just that DAY) hit me, punches our ia on the stomach, attempted to stab a behavioral specialist in the arm with a pencil, destroyed 2 rooms and then was told that I he might have acted out because he didn't know I loved him. (You may have with me). So I quit and am simply done with the profession.

Sorry for the rant, I am bitter. Happy for all the teachers who love it, I miss the passion I had my first year, before my spirit and soul were crushed like a baby bird.

 The old part time job fine for now, but I now am looking for a new career. I was hoping to get some advice on career ideas from this community. 

The type of lifestyle I want Is working a 9-5 Monday-Friday. I made a salary of around 38,500$ as a teacher. My School county paid DIRT. I have no student loans, only debt I have are my car payments, I live in an apartment that I share with my boyfriend. Who works full time. Ideally I would make 40,000 or more a year. Eventually save up and get a house with my partner and have a job I can stay for a many years in.  

I know I want a career where I help people. That was my favorite part of teaching. I'm extroverted in my job and love talking to people. I am pretty good at customer service and wouldn't mind a career that utilizes it. I would say I have microsoft offices skills from teaching, public speaking skills and I love working in a team environment and work well in groups. I would like a mildly active job as well but will work on an office if needed.

My dream is to have a job where I take ZERO or very little work home. I ideally want the 9-5 job where I can enjoy my weekends. My friends and family always say that I would be the perfect tour guide because I'm loud, am enthusiastic and positive.

However, as much as I toot my own horn for my gifts, my flaws are apparent. I am very anxious about my performance, to the point of self-detriment. I don't do well not interacting without people. I am not great with organization, my memory is terrible and I have zero sense of direction. I love people, but can also be very sensitive and a bit naive...which has lead me to being manipulated to work for no compensation.  I'm also a wimp so physical labor like the police force is not really an option. Also, everyone thinks that my degree in Elementary Education was a waste of time since I didn't stick with it and is useless, despite my grades 🙃.

Some ideas that come to my mind for jobs are College student advisor: I could work with students and counsel them while working in an office. Working with one person at a time as opposed to 30. But I don't really know how to step into the field.

A specialized medical assistant: I like the idea of helping people in the medical field, getting to move around, and caring for patients. I worry about the lack of 9-5 gigs for medical Options. I think I could go back to school for a certificate or degree if I needed to but I would want to shadow first (which during covid isn't really a thing atm) Some ideas I had are  Radiology tech. Assistant, Physical therapy assistant or dental assistant.

HR assistant: I was trained in Trauma Informed Care as a teacher which helped me though working with students in abusive situations alongside the social worker. So I think I could handle the emotional toll of working with people in emotional distress as long as I also had some levity with it.  I think I would be good at the people aspects of the job but I would dread the paperwork aspect. 

I commend you if you actually read all of this. I have reflected a lot in the 3 months since I quit teaching.

Tldr; I (24 m) quit being a teacher and don't know what to do. I like working with people but get stressed easily. Any job suggestions?"

My initial thoughts are that company 1 is more on my track with software development and may help me gain more relevant experience, and ultimately the pay difference is not important to me relative to career opportunities. That being said, while company 2 is a risk, it would give me a chance to explore a new city, and gain experience in a new industry. Based on my interview, it also seems like company 2 understands I'm not that experienced and mentioned the possibilities of working in other parts of the company in the future, suggesting I may be able to more easily advance my career in the company. Additionally, company 2 also does a lot of work in far more interesting fields for me than company 1. My main fear with company 2 is that I will struggle to learn the field and will perform poorly in the internship, or that the experience I will gain is not relevant enough and will not help me gain a full time software engineering position in the future. Open to any thoughts, thanks!"

After doing some research (and mostly, finally taking mental health and ADHD as a condition seriously), I came to 99% certainty that I have ADHD. I began the process to get tested in November 2020.

The test took place on January 2nd. Perhaps the most ADHD part of this story is that had I not procrastinated the painful process of getting enough focus to schedule a phone call and called for an appointment earlier, the test could have occurred in 2020. My family hit their deductible earlier in the year, so had the call been made earlier, this ~$1000 test would have been free.

I have great respect for psychology, my psychologist, the work put into these sorts of tests, etc. But my GOD will I feel defeated and frustrated if he tells me I don't have ADHD all along.

To me, a diagnosis is going to be a huge step in getting the help I truly need. I have seen so many great stories and transformations from people who take medication. I'll do CBT or whatever it takes to get back on track to the life I work so hard for.

The clinician facilitating the test said that she couldn't make promises, but ""doesn't see how the dr could say you don't have ADHD"".

For background, my whole life, I was gifted but ""lazy"". Growing up, I was the weird kid who said weird things all the time and had 0 friends up until the tail end of high school.

I got good grades but it took hours for me to get enough focus to do homework or projects. I was so easily distracted that no matter how smart I was, some assignments could take hours.

Into college and adulthood, it became more and more apparent. I constantly got in trouble after forgetting simple but important details, even losing a job because of it. I couldn't focus enough to write cover letters to apply for internships and jobs, causing me to lose out on countless opportunities. 

There's so many symptoms I've had over my life, impacting so many aspects of my life, that there's no way I could fit them all in a reddit post.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of anxiety? Despite being so sure of yourself? I know that a common experience amongst ADHDers is this sort of self-doubt having been told we are ""wrong "" so many times in our lives."

I have some basic projects on github, thet aren't something amazing but I think they are passable for a beginner.


I wanted to ask how hard is it hard to find internships from foreign countries.


Do I focus on only one of those and get really good at it or keep trying to learn new stuff.

l1r9h3,5,2021-01-20,Is Math and CS a good double degree?,lukessss001,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l1r9h3/is_math_and_cs_a_good_double_degree/,"Hi everyone! I am a first year student studying at a Canadian university, and I have a lot of interest in a double major program available at our school. It is a Math and CS program (half math half cs). In doing research, there seems to be an overall consensus that mathematics and math related degrees are among the better double majors with computer science, and I was wondering why that is? Are there any CS careers that would be better suited to someone with a math background? 

I have considered a normal CS pathway as well, and knowing that it has a COOP program whereas Math and CS does not, I would be tempted to take that route. However, I’ve gotten extremely lucky to get a data analyst internship, so I’m not sure if I should stay with this company or if I should expand my experiences into software/coding through our coop program. Being a first year, I still don’t have an entirely clear career path in mind.

I’d love to hear any suggestions!


Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions! There are a couple things I forgot to add in my original.

a) coop is not guaranteed, and it’s a somewhat competitive program to get into. However, once you get in, with the schools assistance it becomes MUCH easier to land internships.
b) my school in particular has a better reputation in mathematics than in computer science, but not a lot to make a huge difference.

I’m not entirely sure how big of a factor reputation plays in employment especially in this field, so I’d love to hear any thoughts!"

I recently started an internship for my local state representative, and one of the issues the office is tackling is Xfinity's new data caps. For those unaware, effective January 1st, all Xfinity home internet customers are now on a plan requiring them to pay surcharges on any internet use over 1.2 per month. Obviously, this an attempt to recoup money lost on cable as streaming becomes more popular, and a way for them to capitalize on the ""new normal"" of the remote work and school that many people are in for the foreseeable future. His current idea involves a surtax on their surcharge, but I'm not sure there's a way to do that that doesn't result in them passing the price onto their customers. Can you all help give me ideas on how to keep them from passing on the buck? Or are there other measures you think a state can take that won't violate the commerce clause?

For context this is in Massachusetts.

The issue is that I'm only a sophomore level student (though I'm planning on accelerating my graduation date soon) and I haven't really got a clue about which would be the ""better"" choice? 

My school's web dev and database classes were horrible quality and I disliked them, mostly due to being confused about the material most of the time. But I feel like this would be a really good opportunity to flesh out my web dev skills to improve my chances of landing future internships/jobs?

I personally like the idea of working with data more because in my mind, it'd be writing SQL + python stuff (which I have more experience with than bootstrap/react/etc.) but I have very little knowledge in general about these different tech specialties. My biggest concern is that I'll choose the data role and then be pigeon-holed into analyst roles rather than SWE/SDE roles when I graduate.

Sorry for the long post - just really confused on CS and the different fields/specialties in general and feeling anxious about making wrong choices that could really impact my future career. Thanks!"

I got into a Masters program in a state school( international student) and got a very good scholarship offer for that said program. Problem is I have been given a week to accept the offer. The deadline happens to be before I hear from all of the schools I applied to. I also got a PhD interview at a top  US school(my no 1 choice program - also the only school I have had back from apart from my admission). 

The professor told me to wait till the end of January for a decision from the school. That will be around 2-4 days after my scholarship response deadline. I do not want to risk rejecting this very good offer and getting zero acceptances and at the same time, I really want to hear back from the PhD program. The interview went well I think but I can't say for sure that I will be accepted. I have interacted wi 2 people who applied to the same program (with stronger profiles than me, at least according to me) but haven't heard anything. The professor also told me he will be taking 1 or 2 students. Our research interests are aligned and I think I will be very happy working with him.  


How do I request for a decision from the PhD program early without increasing my chances of being rejected by the program?

You can too!""

Let me put it this way: That post gives terrible advice, as others have mentioned. But before I realized how _hard_ it is to actually make a game (and I mean **really** make a game, not something that runs in PIE in Unreal), when I was younger and naïve, I would have eaten it up. That post is dangerous to anyone serious about wanting to ""make it"" in the game industry, since it tells them what they want to hear and ignores all the lessons I know I had to learn the hard way.

This is a long post, and I imagine probably only 3 people will read it... but I feel I need to speak out.

---

I've made maps and mods for other games since 2006, when I was barely old enough to follow a tutorial and learn 3DS Max. In 2012, I learned to program because I wanted to make my own game. A game I could _sell_. And once I sold it, I would park my successful self in front of AAA game dev companies, who would snatch me up as a great engineer/designer/artist/one-man-army.

And boy howdy, how I wish I didn't do that.

Other people told me at the time, ""Don't get overambitious with your game! Make something simple!"" So I started by making a Galaga clone in Unity with some cool steampunk assets I made. But the game I _really_ wanted to make was a steampunk RTS with gameplay similar to space combat in the game Star Wars: Empire at War.

Instead of publishing the Galaga clone and getting a portfolio ready, I instead decided it wouldn't be too hard to make it into the RTS game I wanted to make -- after all, if I released the Galaga clone, people might play it instead of the ""real"" game!

So I ripped out the keyboard controls and the Galaga AI and made the thing fly to where you clicked. But then I wanted to make ships customizable. So I made a Kerbal Space Program-style ""airship builder"". And then I wanted to go in the first person as an airship commander and turn the game into a FPS/RTS hybrid.

Bear in mind that this RTS game didn't even have any AI at this point. And here I was, overambitious and wanting to basically create a new genre.

---

I went to Comic-Con while making that game, and I met a group of _real-life game developers_ while we were waiting on a panel. They were working on the South Park game that came out a number of years back; this was circa 2013 or so.

I asked them for advice to break in to the industry, and do you know what they said?

""Make lots of games. Build up a portfolio."" One of them specifically mentioned to look up Ludum Dare.

Shortly after that Comic-Con, Ludum Dare ran their first event -- [Mini Ludum Dare 44, with the theme ""7 Day RTS.""](https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion-30/game-jam-roundup-mini-ld-44-aka-7drts-1447333/)

Wow, RTS, huh? I'm making an RTS! So surely, I would use this time to polish the RTS base I already had so I could take the advice of the _actual game developers I personally met and talked to_ and release something... right?

Well... no. I decided, ""Hey, this is a good platform to experiment with my RTS/FPS hybrid idea!"" So I made a FPS, and had struggles making the ""RTS hybrid"" part... so many struggles that I missed the 7-day deadline and spent a month on it. Bear in mind I was on vacation from school at the time and didn't have a job, girlfriend, or social life... so this was like 16ish hours per day solid of work. For a month.

---

While I was working on that game, my friend messaged me with this great idea he had! He didn't want to actually make it, but I agreed it was a cool idea. But I already was working on this prototype, right? So I should focus on that?

Well... no. I thought it was a cool idea, and this time I _was_ smart enough to think ""I should keep a record of what I've done!"" But it wouldn't package, and I was too impatient to fix the errors. I uploaded the entire source code + assets to my GitHub account, except some files were too big so I left them out. I'm sure I'll never lose them and make all this worthless, right?

You're starting to see a pattern here. I was laser-focused on ""I'm going to sell this game, so I better not accidentally release part of it for free!"" And then when I shifted focus, it was ""only temporarily, lemme explore this concept and circle back,"" followed by never circling back.

If I made my games achievable, just the bare minimum, I could have learned so much more. You notice I already realize I was running into errors with packaging the game, but instead of fixing them I just... ignored them. Because I was chasing my ""better idea,"" the idea I was going to sell.

---

So what broke the pattern? Well, nothing I did willingly. [I started making a game in Unity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/3o9so8/a_glimpse_of_a_jungle_temple_ive_been_working_on/), and I thought, ""Wow, I've seen this same stuff 1000 times and it's getting pretty boring! But do you know what will _never_ get boring? Procedural generation!"" This was followed by realizing procedural generation in Unity was **hard**, and therefore the obvious solution would be to learn Unreal (despite having no C++ knowledge).

So I remade the whole game in Unreal. And by ""remade the whole game"" I mean ""made like 1/16 of the features I had in Unity followed by chasing the endless rabbit hole of procedural content."" By this time I had school, a job, girlfriend, _and_ social life, so gamedev was a lot slower. But it's okay because I'm an _experienced developer_ now, despite not releasing anything other than like a dozen gifs to various subreddits of a game that barely worked outside of that gif.

I took a class for school about game dev. The goal was to make a game by the end of the semester. I used it as a way of testing out my procedural generation code by making a 3D version [of the algorithm mentioned here.](http://beckylavender.co.uk/portfolio/the-zelda-dungeon-generator/) If the link doesn't work (it isn't for me at the moment), just search ""Becky Lavender Zelda Dungeon Generator"" for the paper she wrote on it. She cites another paper whose name escapes me about generative grammars; I used both the methods to get my tech demo (and that's really what it was; there was no ""game"" other than ""find the room that I said is the end"") to work. My end goal was to merge this project with my commercial project; I built the generator as a plugin to facilitate that.

And then my professor expected us to have a packaged .exe file to run and demonstrate. That's when I realized I had never successfully packaged anything before. I started running into cooker errors. I tore my hair out to get a build that mostly worked if you didn't stare at it too hard. But I got something submitted, and I put it in my portfolio.

---

And it was the _only_ thing on my portfolio. I realized that I never finished anything else.

I started looking for internships, and I realized that despite doing game dev as a hobby for 7 years, I had nothing to show for it. Zilch.

It's now that I realized my mistakes. I started doing Ludum Dares again, but I kept to the spirit of the competition and only worked for 1 weekend, after which I put the end result (finished or not) in my portfolio. I packaged early and packaged often. Pro-tip for Unreal Engine users: PIE (what happens when you hit the ""Play"" button) is completely different than a ""real"" build of your game, and things _will_ break in the real build but are fine in PIE.

All the while, I kept looking for internships. I got interviewed for a few (one of which hired me), and do you know what every single one of them asked me about?

The stupid tech demo I made.

They made me go through the algorithm to explain every step. It sounds complicated and impressive when you say it out loud, but really it's pretty simple (again, read those papers for the details). It was something I made for a school project, something that I could've made with basically no experience.

And it got me an internship as an engineer at a AAA studio. I ""broke in"" to the industry.

---

I was extremely lucky in my internship that my boss is one of the nicest people I ever met. He believed in me, mentored me, and I managed to wow people with my ""intern project"" -- so much that my intern project got polished and became part of a regular workflow (can't go into details here, sadly).

Once my internship was up, I asked if I could stay on. My boss checked with HR and his boss (who was still very impressed at the time with my intern project), and they agreed that they could spare the headcount. I got hired.

---

Was all that time I spent making useless projects wasted? No, not necessarily -- I learned a lot and I became a better game programmer.

But at the same time I never took the advice I was given. Now I see a post on the frontpage which is giving newbies an ""out"" -- that their giant project _isn't_ worthless, and that they should bite off more than they can chew because it'll work out.

It worked out for me because I was _very_ lucky. I was in the right place at the right time. But I'm still upset that I spent so long doing things with nothing to show but a single portfolio item and a baseless claim on a resume. I wish I had listened to that advice and done things differently.

---

A small coda: I'm hesitant to talk much about my current job, because it is my dream job and I love it. But making a ""real"" game is harder than I ever thought possible. Things I never even THOUGHT about considering as problems are actually major problems. Any kind of commercial game needs more layers of complexity just to release than I ever DREAMED.

l1w5rt,4,2021-01-21,Should I pursue another degree or find a job?,czycz,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/l1w5rt/should_i_pursue_another_degree_or_find_a_job/,"In July I'll finish my master's degree and I have no idea what to do next. Sorry for the long post.

After high school I couldn't decide what to do with myself, I've enjoyed math the most so I started BA in Economics at the best uni in my country. It bored me from the start, I haven't learned anything valuable and I finished it with average results. While studying, I found my first job in a multinational corporation - people were nice, salary good, I've learned a lot - but after 8 months from intern I became the most skilled specialist in my team and I couldn't find anything new to learn. I left my job and studied abroad for 6 months, after which I decided that I have to change my path. I haven't got much time to think what I should do, I just knew what I didn't want to do - so I came back, wrote an entry exam and got accepted to MA in Cognitive Science. I really like my studies, finally I can learn some math, I also discovered machine learning which I find interesting. I started to think about an internship in IT but I was always rejected without an interview. I know that in many cases that's because of my studies, I was told that (people in my country have no idea what CogSci is and if they do, they confuse it with psychology). Because I needed money, I skipped this part of education in my CV and quickly found a job in accounting and I HATED IT. Every day I did the same thing without using my brain once - I quit after 2,5 months with the feeling that I wasted my potential and for the rest of my life I'll do basic stuff without thinking. I continued my studies and tried to look for an internship in research - I sent many applications for different research labs, scholarships, programs - and I was rejected from every single one of them. I'm aware that my background is chaotic and I lack scientific experience. On top of that, my country is not really research-oriented.

I'm tired and depressed. I have several month before finishing my studies and still the only experience I got is in the field I hate. I was thinking about PhD but I don't even know in which field so it should wait till I'm sure. Another possibility is MSc in Computational Engineering - it recently opened at my Uni and I like the program a lot - but again, this degree doesn't seem to be recognized in my country and there is a high possibility that I won't get accepted, as they look solely at candidate's background and mine looks like shit. I can't think of any job that I would like and to which I can get accepted without BS in CS, EE, Math, Physic etc... I really enjoy learning new things, I'm good at solving problems and in general I'll enjoy most of the things which keeps my brain stimulated. I'm learning super fast, I'm organized, can pay attention to details, I love maths (but it's not advanced enough for any job) and I want to be respected as a person with a huge knowledge. On the other hand I can't stand pointless job and I don't really like working with people (I have asperger's syndrome but you wouldn't tell, I just seem shy). And I don't feel like I'm having any hard skills to offer. 

I'm 23, education in my country is free, but I don't what to blindly choose another studies which I'm not sure of because my parents will have to pay for my rent and food for another years. But at the same time, I don't see any path suitable for me and I can't look through job offers without feeling that it's pointless. 

What would you do?"

* How can I prep? 
* What Kind of work do interns typically get the do?
*  How much training do they get? 
* What I can do to try and turn it from an internship into a full-time offer by the end of it

Things I have been doing now is Excel, Some financial modelling and I've begun to tap into Comps, precedent transactions and DCF's that are more practical rather than the stuff I learnt in BIWS 400 questions.

Edit: Formating. 

There so much info out there and when you feel like you get the gist you overthink and try to keep looking, so I decided to ask here for a more rounded answer.

I’m an intern at a K12 school as a tech person. Last week, I was cornered in an office by two women who work at the school as well and asked about my gender. I’m stealth, and my gender has not been disclosed to anyone but the hiring principal. When the two office workers confronted me, they asked me if I was “really a girl” and if my name was really my dead name. They also stated that it was another teacher who had told them; this teacher was my fourth grade teacher for less than a year.

Even if this isn’t considered harassment, I feel unsafe in my work environment now, and as if my privacy has been invaded. I don’t really know what to do about it."

So in the case of Churn prediction the idea is to generate new features checking the data, more imagination, think what can help the model to discern between a client who want to leaves or one who wants to buy the whole shop. But here is where I don't have a clue where to start, they have Matomo (google analytics) and the CTO told me that it could be a good idea to start learning the scope of the data and try to extract new features from there. 

But I was hoping there was some framework or structure of steps to follow, like what to search for, maybe is better to read papers focus in ecommerce?"

Is this normal?,fancytrees,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l1zpng/i_feel_like_im_in_over_my_head_is_this_normal/,"Howdy reddit. I started learning to program in 2019. I took a year of community College classes but dropped out because I got hired. I have a bachelor's degree in a science field but not anything development related. I did a 6 month internship with the company before I got hired, and I think I only got hired because I was willing to just the shitty code that no one else wanted to touch.

At my job, I'm expected to do Middleware integration (java) with our legacy enterprise system (PeopleSoft). I also am expected to do pretty heavy customizations to the legacy system like changing our billing process.I get to work with fun stuff like COBOL, code that can't be source controlled, and code that no one knows how it works. There is one other developer who works on back end stuff, and the higher ups frequently go to him to find out how their systems actually work. 

I've been programming for 2 years. Because of this, I feel like I'm constantly having to play catch up to learn things like good programming design and small but crucial skills. Im having to constantly read legacy code to find out how our business operates, and because I work in backend, this involves things like learning encoding, networking, obscure database problems, soap messaging, wsdls, and such. There is a lot I have to learn, but I feel like I don't have time to learn this because back end developers are in such high demand at my job. I barely even get time to develop because I have to focus on bugs. I have about as much programming experience as a junior in college. And then I also have to teach new developers because there are so few other people who know the backend work.

I'm considering going back to school for my masters to get more experience. I feel like this is a lot to ask of someone with my level of experience. Or am I just being a wimp? Is feeling like this normal as a developer?"

I’m currently a Marketing specialist looking into becoming a front end developer. Quick education background: my bachelors is in Marketing and my minor is Digital Design Media - it was a new program when I was in school. The courses consisted: graphic design I + II, photoshop and web design where I had a taste of HTML &amp; CSS.

SO, I enjoyed the web design class and always wanted to dive deeper in that direction. During my internship and my first job, I helped with the company’s website but on the marketing/content side. Although, I wished I could navigate to the code side.

I’m currently taking the flatiron school prep course for a refresher and to see what I’m getting into. 

Now for my question: what would be my best (career?) route to basically blending front end dev work &amp; my marketing experience? I do enjoy marketing a bit but at the same time I dont want my degree/knowledge to go to waste."

l228oj,31,2021-01-21,"""Don't do a PhD if you're not sure about it"" - but then what else could I do?",jienly,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/l228oj/dont_do_a_phd_if_youre_not_sure_about_it_but_then/,"**TLDR: I have a bachelors in biochemistry, and realized after graduating that I don't want to go to grad school. Now I don't know what to do with my life with a seemingly useless degree.**

Hi all, I graduated with a bachelors in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) back in May 2020, and I have been having a little bit of an existential crisis that has been keeping me up at nights for weeks due to my stress and anxiety of not knowing what the hell I'm supposed to do with my life.

I've grown up with a parent with a PhD, and they have instilled the thought of this linear line of success since I was young: **go to college, start grad school immediately after college, do post-doc, then work.** My father is quite successful following this route, and is quite a workoholic.

I went to college thinking that I was going to major in BMB, get my PhD, etc. And so far, I've had an alright linear path. I've had internship right out of my freshman year thanks to \~father's connections\~, and due to that leg-up, it was easier for me to get my second internship after my sophomore, and then through junior and senior year I worked in a neuropsychiatric lab on campus, where I found my love in neuroscience.

However, I decided to take a few years off before grad school, because undergrad was stressful for me. I was in a small (and new) lab in college, and the research I was doing required me to come into lab all the time - weekends, and every single weekday. On top of that, it was studying for classes, doing extracurriculars, going to the gym, part-time job (10 hours/week), and trying to still maintain some semblance of a social life. While college was fun, senior year was stressful (not to mention anxiety-inducing while graduating in a pandemic).

I'm not even that great in school (or at least with my major, I did fine in all non-BMB classes) - I graduated with a 3.3 GPA, but I have tons of lab experiences. By graduation, I had two internships, and two straight years of doing independent research. I got a job at Harvard Med School as a research assistant after graduating. Pay is good for my field with a B.S. (50k), and projects I'm working on here are to hopefully get published in papers, where I get to have my name on them. Everything I have done is to prepare me for grad school. Which has always been my plan, for some reason (prob because this method has been instilled on me since I was young).

I know I'm stupid for saying this, but I finally am understanding what it means to go to grad school, which I didn't at once think about while I was in school. And **it doesn't sound like grad school (PhD) would be a good fit for me.** It sounds awful - the long grueling hours, no social life, and focusing your life on working so much for so little. I've always had the misconception that grad school was like college but harder, but I didn't realize it would be all-consuming, which now I see is the common description from people describing doing a PhD to be. Senior year of college was hell because my research did consume a lot of my time, but at least I still could make time for friends, go to the gym, study, etc. I cannot think about doing research for half a decade just for the hopes to publish bunch of papers, go to post-doc which is a similar thing, and then work.

I also just understand how **useless a bachelors in Biochemistry is**. Apart from being a lab-tech, what can you do? The thought of doing a masters appeals to me much more, but apparently even a masters in the life science is useless? When I had asked my advisor last year if I should get a masters or work, she told me ""go into work, because you're getting paid to get experience. Having a masters in biochemistry, neuroscience ,etc is just *you* paying for experience"".

Everyone says that only do a PhD if you are completely sure you want to do a PhD, or if you have a true desire to contribute to the scientific community. But it seems like there is no choice but to do a PhD when you're in life sciences because of the glass ceiling when doing just a bachelors/masters.

As much as I like doing brain research, I absolutely do not think it's worth slaving my 20s away for \~pursuing my passion\~ (not even a passion, just something I find interesting). Working at Harvard has stressed me out from being surrounded by people that are so passionate about the science of their research. I just want to get paid well, live an ordinary life, enjoy my 20s (hard to do during a pandemic, but at least I'm not drowning in academic stress), and be happy. But what the hell can I do with a useless bachelors? I really regret not pursuing ChemE or data analytics (I'm quite good at math and chemistry) in college, but I also can't afford to go back to college to get another degree.

I have no idea what else I can do with a bachelors in BMB, I don't know what I can do for a masters degree if I get one where I can just stop at a masters, and I am a lonely depressed 23 year old in a pandemic who feels very lost and stupid and useless.

I don't know what to do, and I apologize for this big post. I don't know what to do, and I don't know who to talk about this with.  Please let me know what your experiences are (PhD life, work life, why you did or didn't go to grad school, etc) or any advice.  Anything is appreciated. :)"

So I’m currently on an 8 month co-op in a software company as a cross departmental intern. I recently got my “mid” evaluation back from my manager through school.... 
Key Points: 
• I received above average or excellent in all points. 
• Manager mentioned she would have me back for full time 
• HOWEVER, I received average in both creativity and leadership capabilities. 

I really wanna change that with only 3 months to go! But I am a remote intern... I barely know anyone to start a project and My internship duties span across several teams too (Hardware, Automotive, Software, Customer Technical) 

I also feel extremely less experienced/overwhelmed all the time and feel like I am not giving my best. I am scared, and I really really wanna excel at my job. I just don’t know how to because I’m not the best at coding or necessarily the most creative so working with the hardware team is hard too. I know if I had more exposure to the projects and the pipelines I would eventually see the cracks and figure out a project on the side. However, most of my work is do this task or do that task.... as a remote intern I havent really been exposed to a lot of things that aren’t working... because well, it’s high priority and they usually give me tasks that take longer. 

Idk what to do, any suggestions? 😄"

**This is the International Office response:**

f you will be on a leave for one term, you may be eligible to reactivate your SEVIS record and return to the U.S. with your current I-20. Please note that this is not something we can guarantee given that the decision to reactivate your SEVIS record is made by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). You can submit a request for reactivation here no sooner than 60 days from the start date of the term for which you will be returning.

If the reactivation is not approved or you are not eligible to request a reactivation, you will have to return on a new, initial I-20. This means that you will have to re-pay the SEVIS fee and you will have a new SEVIS ID. In this case, you will not be eligible for employment benefits (CPT and OPT) until you have maintained your F-1 status for at least one academic year from the program start date on the new I-20. You can submit a request for a new I-20.

While we are not able to guarantee that a reactivation request will be approved, reactivations are typically only denied if you stop attending classes and/or depart the U.S. before applying for a leave. We have seen successful reactivations for students who request the leave in advance.

I’m a 24F recent college graduate (May 2020) with a Bachelors in Psychology. Right now, I’m working for a non-profit in a job I’m absolutely overqualified for and get paid like shit. My current job is going to be “transitioned” into a case manager due to contracts being renewed and restructured. I’ve come to find out I’m very much qualified for this new position which will also require I use my personal phone and vehicle for work purposes. However, my pay will stay at the same shitty entry level rate (I get like $10 additional a paycheck for cell phone use... eye roll). Before you ask - yes I did multiple internships in college, I have multiple industry certifications, and have about 2 years experience in healthcare which is my current job. 

Now that you have some background - I am really needing a different job. I’ve been at this company for 7 mos and I’ve become quite unhappy with my workload to pay ratio. I know it’s my own damn fault for getting a degree in psychology, but to be quite honest I was way too young and immature to be making lifelong decisions at 18 years old. That being said, I worked almost full time through school, so I’m luckily in a position where I do not have any student debt tying me down. I’m going back to technical school to get into the cybersecurity field (which I’m loving! Wish I would have done this a university). 

At this point in time, I really don’t care what job it is I just need to make enough money to pay my bills. I’ve been lucky enough to have a steady income through the pandemic, but I’m becoming more frustrated every day with how small my paycheck is vs how much work I do for this job. I was a server throughout college and frankly I’ve actually found it quite hard to find another serving job to get back into. I’m still trying, but what I really need help with are suggestions on “entry level” jobs I could do in the meantime that pay decently. 

I don’t need anything crazy, but the cost of living in my city has risen exponentially while wages haven’t.

I’ve just been focusing on school and I don’t really need money because my parents help me out and I’ve saved up enough where I can afford my own gas and food which is all I need right now. Ever since I got out of high school my grandma has been on me about getting a job at some fast food place or store to gain experience and meet people. Just personally I’ve felt that I don’t think that will help me because who am I going to meet in that area that will help me with my career in accounting? Also it’s not like I’m dying for money as I’ve said. Yes I do feel it would look good on a resume but really how important is that sort of experience?

A little background is I do plan on getting an internship because I know that is important. Once I get more comfortable with accounting, since I just signed that as my major, then I will start applying and looking for internships. Also I coach football at my local high school in the fall on top of school so I don’t know if my grandma expects me to work on top of all that as well or something. I have thought about just a summer job but then COVID hit and that fell through last year. Would love your guys’ thought and opinions. Thank you!"

The shocking thing about that last interview was that it was for a TAC, a glorified call centre job. It paid a fucking PITTANCE for this field, &lt;45k/yr in Ottawa. And you know what? Every person in that interview besides myself *had a Masters.*

I've heard back from the first interview, the one-on-one interview, with a rejection of course. I fully expect to hear back something similar from the second one given my competition. I don't know what to say. If that  absolute last resort bottom-of-the-barrel job had *those people competing for it*, I don't have any options.

The company allowed me to continue working through the school year and I have been. The problem is that I feel like I have developed such bad habits regarding slacking off, going on my phone and just overall not being a productive employee. I have been remote due to the coronavirus and have not met any of the employees in person with the exception of my connection who got me the internship.

I have been doing a substantial amount of software development projects even though I came in with no programming background but I have learned a decent amount of that along the way. Regarding finance I have done very little and learned very little. So my main issue is that I have developed bad habits before I have even truly entered the workforce: I am lazy and the work is not holding my interest when I sit in my bedroom with so many more things I could possibly be doing, I also frequently hit roadblocks in my programming because I am not particularly skilled or trained in it and by the time I get the hang of the project I am working on it is completed and I have a new assignment I don't know how to do. It also makes me feel bad for the software development team because they are spending more time teaching me how to do things than it would for them to just do my assignments and as an intern I wasn't really intended for them originally. I also feel that I come off extremely boring and unengaged in video chats as I still feel like a stranger with these people I have been working with for months.

Essentially, besides for a few productive weeks over the months, I feel like I am unproductive and not finding my stride at work. Does anyone else who started a new job remotely feel like this?"

So in my free time I've been practicing my cs skills and learning new things. I recently finished an online course in Java and continuing to learn it, right now I'm relearning Python since I have not coded in it in a while, and currently I am looking at learning what Angular JS is and how it works. I do have experience in other languages such as JavaScript, c/c++, HTML, CSS, SQL that I practice on here and there. But I feel like its not enough and a lot of companies do look for skills in other areas of programs. But as a college graduate I would be going for entry level positions and I know that they wouldn't expect me to know everything right away.

But what can I do to get more experience and skills and what kinds of programs do companies like to see that you have some experience in that I can look into to learn?"

What I do on a daily basis: 

Basically, my supervisor makes me take the phone all day handling issues people may encounter in the office such as their printers not working, outlook not working correctly, Zoom, Webex issues, network issues etc...

What Ive done since starting as an Intern:

-Take phone calls.
-Unbox equipment, log serial numbers, MAC Addresses, of equipment such as desktops, laptops, and access points. (Documentation work)
-Wipe clean a ton of Desktops and Laptops.
-Make product recommendations on products to purchase for the company.
-Setup one IP telephony phone (once) with the help of my supervisor 
-Update a diagram of our company’s access point locations.
-Update printer firmware
-Setting up an employee’s iPhone and transferring his/her data
-Upgrading employees PC’s and transferring their data.
-Installing/removing software

What Im currently working on:

My supervisor has me upgrading all the printer firmwares in the building manually since some of the printers are not on the corporate network.

Im also working on getting a new computer ready for an employee.

What is my schedule like:

I currently work three days a week part time and work alone in the office two days a week and work with my supervisor once a week. My day is typically quiet we barely speak to each other unless im assigned something to do my supervisor doesn't seem very talkative or maybe we don’t vibe. Im not sure im going to sign on as a full time employee after graduation because, I don’t feel as if there is much room to grow, Im not very excited about taking phone calls and walking people through a solution, but then again im not sure as this is my first internship so if anyone could hopefully give me some advice/insight.

I found that dual majoring in computer science and math would only take an extra year (I was already going to be here for 5 due to changing my major for a year pretty early into my college career) Would it be worth it to dual  major in Math? It would allow me the opportunity to gain more experience while I am still in college since Im pretty late to internships and while it would raise my loans it would also allow me to continue to defer for a bit longer as I gain more experience and allow me time to really build my resume more.

l2dgjx,1,2021-01-21,I need help determining weather I speak to a person or not (Complicated past).,Carlos16L,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l2dgjx/i_need_help_determining_weather_i_speak_to_a/,"Backstory:

I (17M) am Gay. I knew when I was about 15 year’s old, and told my best friends when I was 16. For reference, I never knew I was gay because I had never fallen in love before (Or I least hadn't noticed). So that’s why when I met this person, I was caught off guard very easily. Love was never in my mind, when I imagined my self-grown up, I always imagined a house, with kids, but never a wife (or husband). 

Also another thing, I never fall in love based on looks, I have always considered a person pretty if they are nice, and ugly if they are bad persons, despite their looks. 

Story:

I entered High school when I was 15, my first semester went pretty well, I usually hang out with my best friend Alice (Fake name). In one of my classes, I noticed an old friend from my childhood, Mary (Also fake name). We just said hy but really never spoke (Important character for the future).

First semester when by without anything important happening, I hanged out with Alice on all of my breaks, had a steady working group, everything was great. Then second semester came and everything went to hell. 

It happened in the first week of my second semester, I still remember it as if it was yesterday. I was the only person (Besides my sister), who knew I was gay, I would always look around in my classroom and check out the guys (Discreetly of course, I live in a very homophobic society). Nothing popped out, until I got to my English class, I noticed a guy roughly my height, with blond dark hair, dark eyes, with a really nice face. He was in the other side of the classroom so I really didn’t notice him. I got a good look at him once I realized he was in all of my classes. 

I got to know him better in Tutoring class, which is basically a class for your wellbeing and emotional stability. There I knew he had a scholarship just like me and that he liked Oreos. Until that point I just found him handsome, but didn’t really liked him. It wasn’t until Friday 25th 2019 when things really started. 

The teacher assigned us in pairs in order to chat with each other and get to know us better. We were assigned randomly, but as luck would have it, I got assigned with him. I really didn’t think much of it, and introduced myself. During that talk, I learned a lot about him. His name was Alec (Fake name), he was also 15 years old, he had a smaller brother named the same as I, my name is Christian (Fake name). He wanted to go on an exchange program (Mandatory in our school), which I dreaded, and he was born in the U.S (Important detail further on). I told him I was born here, I also had a sister, and that I didn’t want to go on an exchange program. 

I honestly don’t remember much of that conversation, this last detail was given to me by Alice, but when I told her about him, I described him as and I quote “Kind of an Idiot”. Weeks went by and I really didn’t care about him, he hanged out with his best friend and I hanged out with mine.

It wasn’t until mid-march when we were assigned in an activity together that I was left speechless. I was sweaty and nervous, and for some reason couldn’t think straight (I was very discreet but freaked out at the same time). It is worth mentioning that at this point I had (unconsciously and discreetly),started watching whenever I could, and even noticed him staring back at me, but immediately looking away when I noticed. I had even changed (Unconsciously) my everyday route to the library (I was an intern there), just so we would cross paths. When the situation was over and I regained full conscience, I started analyzing the situation, and as many of you will have guessed, I came to the conclusion that I liked him. 

It wasn’t like I was in love or anything, but I liked him, like a in those movies where a teenage girl liked the Jock. For the next few month I felt that way whenever we would met up or I would catch him staring at me or me at him. At the end of the semester I noticed he had befriended my work team and started working with them, so I felt kind of left out, but decided not to dwell and instead go with his old work team, which so happened to include my old friend, Mary. 

We chatted, we talked, and really became good friends. The semester ended and we parted our separate ways. I thought that was the end of it, but in the summer, when I had gone to school to do some work, I found him in the library, he was there with his mother and his brother, I was left speechless and honestly don’t remember much. I remember two things, I kept enough cool so he wouldn’t notice my freak out, and that he was in almost all of my classes with him next semester. 

Next semester came, and it wasn’t all bad news, I was with my best friend, Alice, in two classes, and in the rest I was with Alec. In the classes I was with Alice I team up with her, and in the classes I was with Alec I surprisingly team up with him. I say surprisingly because in the first class we had together, we sat in opposite sides of the class, he was with his “friends” (I quote and quote), and I was with Alice. But in the classes after that, (Where we were just him and me) he sat next to me, no me next to him, him next to me. I have always sat in front of the teacher, and he in the opposite side, but in all of those classes, he sat next to me.  

As the semester flew by, I noticed he was friendly with me, not romantic friendly but friendly, but I still fell attracted to him, so I finally broke and asked Alice for advice (of course I told her I was gay and she accepted it). She said to get to know him better, and so I did. When we would change classrooms, I would wait for him and he would wait for me, and we would talk. That when I learned he really loved the U.S, and I was given the impression that he liked it because he was a citizen and he felt proud of being part of that (Despite the fact of never living in the U.S), and tried very hard to fit in into the culture. I also learned he really didn’t have many “Friends” as you may call it. He had friends, but no one close. The one friend that I though he was close to him ditch him when their classes weren’t compatible.  

At that point at had started to hang out a lot with Mary, at the point I told her I was gay and that I liked Alec. I was impressed to hear that she had also liked Alec and as it turns out, half the school had liked Alec, which only made me feel worse about myself. My life had officially become a high school soap opera. 

As the semester went by, I learned a lot of things about him, I am not going to write them all because this post is going to be long as it is, but from what I learned, I really liked him more and more. As time passed, he met a boy with who he hanged out, I wouldn’t say they become friends, but they dis share a class and spent recess together. I in the other hand, spend my recess with either Mary or Alice.  

One day out of the blue, he told me that he would like for us to work together in and assignment. It was an individual assignment, it was ridiculously easy, and it wasn’t something we could do together. Me in my love stupidity said yes, and was really excited. So exited I used a pore strip ( I never use them), and also wore my most decent clothes. The day when we did the work together was started nicely, we ate together, but when we started to work, we encountered one of his “friends”, he invited her to sit with us and for the next 15-20 minutes they talked about things I didn’t understand and I honestly felt like he was totally ignoring me. I made up and excuse and left. He invited me a next time but I made another excuse (I had already been in similar situations with him, this is the most extreme) and decided not to go. 

As luck would have it we were assigned in the same exchange program. I almost laughed at this, seeing as we were going to be in the same FREAKING SAME EXCHANGE PROGRAM. Right there and then I gave myself a pep talk. It basically went something like this “He isn´t GAY, you are in an impossible situation, you are clinging to hard, but since you apparently can’t stop caring for him, at least be friends with him, that way, you are in his life, can look after him, and move on from this crush” (In retrospect it was pretty dumb but, I was in Love. 

 When I got to the airport, I honestly kind of ignored him, I still spoke to him, but preferred to speak with other people. I admit I was being petty, but soon payed the price when he went with his “Friends” (Again, people he knew but had never spoken to, or hadn’t spoken to in years). After a few days, his so called “Best friend”, who he had gone to school for the most part, found other friends and basically left him aside. 

So I took pity on him and started to talk to him. We soon became close, and I learned he is actually pretty shy. He told me he was upset we weren´t speaking English (English isn’t my native language) and he really wanted to practice, seeing as he was a U.S citizen (He said it between joke and seriousness). I agreed, partly because I wanted to spend time with him and be friends (I still liked him, but was on with my original plan of just friends), but also because I was going to meet some estranged family who only spoke English so I wanted to practice. 

We hanged out and I mentioned that we should plan a field trip for the upcoming holiday, to go out of town, he said it sounded like a good idea and we could plan in the future. A week went by and I found out he made plans with his “Friends”, and had totally excluded me. One of his friends said that there just wasn´t enough space (He wasn’t there). In felt hurt but seeing as we weren’t friend, and we hadn’t made any plans, it hurt but I got over it. This happened on a Friday, on Monday, a friend from the exchange casually mentioned not having any plans or field trips planned for the holiday, I also mentioned that I wasn´t going anywhere, and said we could do something together. Alec look surprised and said he had no idea, I almost yelled. The I left for the bathroom to calm myself down, but he followed me and explained that he didn’t knew and that he was sorry, that I could go if I wanted to, blah blah blah. I didn’t even said a word. The Monster in me wanted to hit him and throw him off a window, but the Christian in me just said “Leave it like that”, he wanted to say something again but I said in a loud tone “Alec, just leave it there”. ( I obviously stopped speaking English with him) 

I just make to make a point clear, I am not mad because I didn´t get invited, I was mad because he lied to my face about not knowing when I had made plans with him. Any way, he tried to apologize again later in the day but I just blew him off. At the end I did get invited by one of his friend but I got cancelled due to covid (This was January 2020). 

Long story short, I made other friends, still talked to him and was the only one who invited, but I did it out of respect more than of friendship. 

Long story short, the exchange program got cancelled, we went back home. I tried to remain in contact with him but didn´t work.  During this period of time it was his birthday, and I think his “Friends” forgot his birthday”. I think this because I congratulated him in the morning, but during class, nobody said anything, and it wasn’t until math class that someone remembered that everybody wished him a happy birthday. Usually his friends post photos wishing their friends a happy birthday, but they didn’t in his. 

As the next semester went on, he was in one of my classes again, we worked together but didn´t really talked. It wasn´t until the semester was over that we talked, or rather I talked to him, but he stretched out the conversation for a week. And this was the case also when I asked him about his first day in class. Long story short, he is AGAIN in one of my classes, and we decided to work together. 

PROBLEM

When we were working together, we chatted for an hour like we had talked the day before. I asked him if he had spoken to anyone but he said no. I told him I had spoken to my friend, Alice and Mary. He said we should organize a Zoom with the people of the exchange. I just said sure. Time flew by and we ended doing nothing. After that talk I was given the impression that he was lonely, he always had friends, but they didn’t last. At this point we had known each other for 2 years, I think I am the longest “friendship”, if you can call it that, he has ever had. I feel bad for him, but I don’t know if I should try again to be friends with him or just let it go for god’s sake. 

I want to make something clear, he isn’t a bad person, much of his behavior can be explained by his uprising, of course he has made some bad choices, but he has always apologized for his behavior.  But I don’t know if that grants him a second chance. 

So my question is, Should I try again or just let it be?

Sorry for making this so long but I seriously need help hear. My friends are tired of hearing this (With reason I have mentioned it long enough), and I need a straight answer. Thanks!"

2 years ago I came into university loving finance, especially the stock market. I've been doing it since I was young, and to be honest I was pretty decent at investing. That is why I decided to major in honours finance. First year was ok, I did better than average in all my classes and was having an alright time is residence. I have a good group of university friends, and they were honestly the best part of my year. 

But ever since I started my second year, everything seemed to go downhill. I've applied to maybe 50 internships and I only got called in for an interview for 1. Didn't end up getting it. This really bummed me out, since all my friends were getting them without a problem. My marks also took a big hit since last year. Although I'm still doing better than the average, it is only 1 or 2 per cent. I'm also applying to businesses school this year, but in all honesty I don't think that's going to work out. With my low marks and my okay extra curriculars, it's a long shot at best. Now, I can't help but feel that I am a failure. Sure I'm doing alright in school, but in this industry I feel that if you aren't the best, you're nothing. 

As a result, it seems that I am completely numb to everything. Nothing excites me, nothing motivates me, nothing really makes me happy anymore. No matter what I do, I'm not interested in it. Whether it's classes, clubs, sports, I don't want to do anything. I just want to do nothing. The only reason I do any work is because I know other people in my program are doing work too, but it takes me maybe twice as long to do it. Even though I feel this, I put in so much time into what I do, yet I always never do well.   What doesn't help is that I always think I do well on these tests. I check over my work, and everything makes sense. Then I get my mark back and its a 73% when I thought I got a 90%. On every god damn thing. 

I always see other people doing fantastic. Great marks, junior analyst on the investment club, internships to pick and choose from, and I just can't help but feel that could have been me. I also don't know how to do half the shit these other kids in finance know how to. I see my friends loving what they do, and am envious that I don't love what I do anymore. I even changed my major to finance instead of honours, but to be honest thats not helping much. 

I've told my parents about this, and they're doing the best they can. But they are really busy with their work and can't really focus on me because they're starting their own companies. 

Now the only thing that makes me feel happy is imagining what life would be like if everything was what I thought it would be. Dreaming about having good marks, having a future, and overall loving what I do. 

Although I hide it well, I am in a really dark place. I tried talking to counselors, therapists, but nothings working. And to be honest, if business school doesn't work out, I might honestly kill myself. That might seem like an overreaction, but if I don't get in and I continue to not get internships, I know I won't be happy. I don't want to go through life constantly thinking I'm a failure. I just see no point living a life where I'm just not good enough. 

Now I know this sounds like first world problems, and I might be overreacting, but I just want all of this to end. I'm tired of always being anxious, sad, angry and all the other negative shit I've been feeling.

Please, if you've been in this situation and got out, please tell me how. Pushing through isn't working, thinking on the bright side isn't working, nothing really is. 

I just want this to end."

Most of my experience is on development and I'm not sure if it can help with getting a helpdesk position. I've been looking around if there are any threads related to this and I can't seem to find any. I'm trying to apply for software development in some companies, and IT helpdesk in others (as a fall back plan). 

Two things I read that are great for this position are customer service experience and CompTIA A+, but I have neither. Would development be enough? I did do an internship before and I was tasked to troubleshoot for clients (like take a look at why the computer was so slow and fix it), as well as set up Thunderbird and other things.

I also got a portfolio, a github, and a website (in GitHub pages). I would love to know any opinions!"

l2f9bb,233,2021-01-21,I'm 36 and have worked a range of jobs at entry-level. How do I put a positive spin on my haphazard resume?,kippozzting,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/l2f9bb/im_36_and_have_worked_a_range_of_jobs_at/,"I'm applying to courses in tech like full-stack development, data science and data engineering and they all come with internships.  Some of these courses have quite abit of competition and they require a video interview. Others do not require an interview for the early stages but I figured I would stand a better chance by writing a cover letter to explain the switch.

I've worked as a camera assistant, a teacher for autistic kids, a project manager for a research consultancy and most recently as a gig worker delivering food. The way I've lived my life gave me more freedom with my time to pursue my interest in music (nothing really came out of it tho), take extended holidays and allowed me to try out different professions. I've also just found out I'm INTP which explains alot of how I've approached working life. 

Most of these jobs had low barriers to entry or I had lucked out with connections so I'm unfamiliar with what works in resumes and job interviews. 

Which brings me to this problem. How do I answer questions like:

* Tell us as much about yourself as possible and your interest in participating in the program.
* Help us to understand your strengths and how this program will make a difference in your career journey.

More info if needed:

&gt;!From the little bit of reading I've done so far on these questions and given the example responses here  I still have trouble thinking of what to say.!&lt;

&gt;!My interest is mainly in securing more money for time worked and programming related work seems to suit me in a number of ways.!&lt;

&gt;!A few strengths I might have:!&lt;

* &gt;!logically approaching every issue and analysing them!&lt;
* &gt;!open to new things, likes learning new things!&lt;
* &gt;!seeing the big picture and how it works in smaller scale!&lt;
* &gt;!good at finding out where the fundamental problem is!&lt;
* &gt;!able to sort through huge amounts of data and organize them!&lt;

&gt;!The thing is most of these traits are self-observed or what I've heard friends say and are not strengths I've had to use professionally.!&lt;"

With no prior experience from past mini courses and what not it was a bit of a shot in the dark but most of the tests school gave me at the time to ""find what I want"" pointed in this direction.

Now I enjoyed the first year quite a bit, I learned coding with Python and enjoyed solving problems with a fixed end goal and seeing it get there closer and closer each time. Even during the 2nd year when I learned C#, and more specifically .NET and xamarin I somewhat enjoyed it.

Now however tailing to the end of the year I found myself never being the one coding in the group projects. More the one making the documentation. And then came finding an internship. 

Honestly I could have done more for it but for a solid year and a half I could not find a place that wanted me. Always asking me if I coded in my free time, why I didn't know X language or why I didn't have a clear path in mind for what I wanted to be. (Web dev or app dev)

It really started to demotivate me and foe that year and a half I've done near nothing in terms of coding and basically hit a slump. I'll be so front and say I was and still am quite depressed about it. Never finding motivation to pick it back up and only taking extra courses when allowed that don't end up having to do with coding. (Design and cybersecurity)

Now that I've actually found an internship that is starting soon as a back office working on a .NET Core web app, I wonder if I'll not be complete ass at it. I certainly didn't have the motivation to do it during those 1 and a half years so who says it'll change now. 

Did I choose the wrong career path? 
Will I make an embarassment of myself when I start working there for that company? 

Sorry for this post being a bit... ranty. It's been on my mind so much I had to get it out somewhere and at least start by looking for some help."

To my understanding this internship was highly competitive I beat out at least 15-20 other applicants. This internship seems like it would give me the best experience. I was told I would get the opportunity to talk to suppliers, use Apex and other supply chain programs, and get my own tasks to draw conclusions from data and more. The internship sound generally interesting. This is the best of what I have seen. I could say I worked at a fortune 100 company in aerospace which on its own sounds sick. SO should I do this or do it at a smaller no name company where I could just be mostly using excel sheets closer by. Money is not a problem and nothing is tying me down. Just don't know if it is worth leaving my whole family for the whole summer. I might end up working at the company but how far does a big name company on your resume."

I am an industrial engineer at Purdue University

Fresh of my first semester of college I didn't start looking for jobs til February. Genuinely thought I had no chance.

Experience: All I had was some lifeguard and swim teacher jobs from highschool. 😅

Skills: I just learned 3 coding languages, had previously known CAD, and had a slightly above average Excel skill level

Projects: I had some feats with CAD and 3D printing plus the school projects I had to do. Designing and coding an autonomous lego robot in particular.
I also was captain of the IM indoor soccer champions lol

GPA: 3.03

I applied to 30ish engineering internships near my home at a community college career fair to make the Purdue stand out. I got 3 interviews and 2 offers. I took a manufacturing engineering internship I really grinded my ass off and did very well. Got told to work less and earned a letter of recommendation from the CEO/President of the company. Set myself up pretty nicely for 2020

A small shark will stand out in an aquarium but not in the ocean.

Moved into basically in-house consulting (customer facing, but very minimal travel) 7 years ago. Now hold a senior position. I am certified.

I have a 80/20 split, base salary is less than 30% of industry minimum. No raise in 6 years. Zero development.

Here is my problem

\- I love the job, hate the company

\- Zero confidence in getting a new job, have had job interviews previously but never successful

\- Not interested in travelling

\- Networking (linkedin, etc.) weak

The company and how I've reacted to my circumstances has sucked the life-blood out of me and I take responsibility for it but I would like to change it.

I know I'm a good at my job and I get positive feedback but I would like to benefit from it and build on that.

l2kk8h,27,2021-01-22,"Ph. D, Interview tips",__jaykay__,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/l2kk8h/ph_d_interview_tips/,"Hi all!

I see a lot of posts here asking for interview tips. I am by no means an expert but having given several interviews last year, making mistakes and adapting myself each time, and finally getting a position at one of my favorite universities, I think I can share some things that would help.

**BACKGROUND** \- I started applying in March 2020 mostly to open positions in Europe. I got my Master's degree from a European university in 2020 and started applying while I was doing my thesis. In the very first interview I got, they asked me to prepare a short 15 min introductory ppt about myself and my work and that helped me a lot going forward. Also, my experience relates to European Ph.D. admissions which are usually well-defined projects so it helps. But I still think even in the US, UK and elsewhere interviews go in a similar manner. I come from a materials science background so my examples would be such.

1. **CONGRATULATIONS** \- In my observation, only about 5-10% of the applicants even go past the screening to the first interview so it is already a big achievement and in the eyes of supervisors, you are already a good fit (going by your CV and letter). The interview is a conversation between you and the supervisor/admissions committee to verify your credentials and test you on some soft skills.
2. **PRESENTATION** \- It is best if you prepare a presentation. I have a 12-15 slide presentation. Typical design - The title slide mentions the name of the university you applied to and the project; next 2-3 slides basic info about you, education, and any work experience; then 2-5 slides mentioning your relevant projects (remember to only showcase projects relevant to this position, hide others); then maybe one slide mentioning coursework that you think would be helpful for this positions; one slide mentioning your soft skills like teamwork, problem-solving, etc. preferably with examples to demonstrate; a slide to showcase how you fit in the project mentioning things like ""*this project requires numerous SEM analysis and I have 2 years of experience using SEM for my xyz projects*""; additionally, finally a slide to tell them how doing a PhD fits with your long term goals; optional - a slide showing your strengths and weaknesses, but be cautious not to rant about weaknesses much and demonstrate that you are working to improve there. Only include this if you can handle it well. **PRACTICE AND DO NOT EXCEED 10 MINS FOR THE PRESENTATION.**
3. **POINTS** \- With or without presentation, it is a good idea to write down points on a paper basically showcasing everything the presentation would. Since interviews are online, keep it with you and it helps you to speak up and remember the flow when telling them about yourself. Additionally write small notes like - ""*summer internship 2019 to showcase teamwork*"", ""f*iguring out the problem with the reactor, final year project 2018 to showcase problem-solving*"" etc. Just be ready with examples to justify the stuff you say.
4. **RESEARCH THE GROUP** \- Although they will introduce themselves and the project it is a good idea to research them a bit in preparation for the interview. For example, **check their recent publications and make pointers about how you plan to use that work** going forward with this particular project. It takes effort and you won't always come up with a brilliant idea of how-to, but even a vague idea and a direction would suggest that you are indeed interested in their group.
5. **RESEARCH IDEAS** \- **Search literature** a bit and see if you can find some study that would help you to **address the research goals of the project**. This would be like ""100 points to Gryffindor"" if you can find a genuine proposition that they did not already know and would work tremendously in your favor. Just beware that you may not be directly asked to do so. So it is upon you to direct the conversation towards this. This is why the presentation helps. You can add a slide ""action plan"" and talk about it or else find another appropriate opportunity to talk about it.
6. **REVISE** \- Read a bit about **techniques used in your projects** that you already worked on. For example, if you mention using X-Ray diffraction, you should know how it works, how the data is obtained, and even better if you can explain how it applies to the materials you would study in the PhD project. Any challenges you may face etc. The same goes for other experimental techniques relevant to the project.
7. **EXAMPLES** \- Be ready with examples to **justify what you say**. For example, if you say you are a team player, tell them that in a past project you worked in a team where you collaborated and worked on the project in synchronization. If you say you are perseverant, tell them by example that you keep on finding new ways to take the project forward after encountering many failures and finally had success. Of course, **do not tell fake stories. Only genuine examples** you can discuss freely.
8. **DO NOT** \- Some things to be cautious about. Never say something you are unsure about. I.e. do not mention stuff on your CV you can't defend when asked about. Sometimes it is tempting to write keywords or techniques you barely understand but are relevant to the project. I advise against it as it will take your interview in a very unfavorable direction if you fumble here.
9. **ASK THEM QUESTIONS** \- They will at times ask you if you have any questions for them. Do ask even if you don't have much technical awareness or any strong questions regarding the project. Ask things like - ""*how is the university life for a PhD student*""; ""*how is the city*""; ""*what kind of infrastructure you have in the labs*""; ""h*ow do you prefer to handle your PhD students? do you give them all the plans to work with or expect the student to come up with everything*"" etc. Just be polite with the last one and in general. Better if you somehow ask questions about the project in a way like - ""*this project requires us to work with xyz material. I was wondering if we are going to synthesize the material ourselves or do you have collaborators who would provide that""* or *""is the primary goal of this project to find a better material for this application or take a proven material and optimize the device characteristics for this application*""
10. SOME QUESTIONS - From my experience here are some questions that are sort of commonly asked -

* ""Explain your role in the xyz project you mention?""
* ""You mention, you worked with xyz technique, how would you apply that to this project?""
* ""PhD is stressful at times, how would you maintain your composure?""
* ""Your advisor asks you to do experiments that you think won't work, how do you proceed?""
* ""Have you been in a conflict with another group member, how would you handle such a situation?""
* ""Why do you want to work with this group/this university?""
* ""If we select you, provide a general roadmap of how you will proceed with this project?""
* ""You mention you are a good problem solver, can you give an example?""
* ""You mentioned in one of your projects, you used xyz technique to synthesize the material. Can you explain why did you choose that and how is it superior to other techniques that could have been used?""
* ""In our lab, we have many people working with the same instruments. How will you handle any time conflicts?""
* ""Do you get along with other people well?""
* ""Tell us about something you learned from a colleague while working with them?""

All the best with your interviews and let me tell you from experience - A LITTLE PREPARATION GOES A LONG WAY."

I've taken classes in AI, ML, CV and lots of math. For the next year, i'll be taking a year off for travel and work, as I would like to get some hands on experience before taking my Masters (probably Data Science, perhaps vanilla compsci).

I would like to find a job somewhere in Europe in the next year, maybe an internship or a half year job posting. I have thought about going to the US for the summer or half a year as well.

Was/is anyone in a similar situation and where might be a right place to start looking? Any good websites with job/internship postings for an undergrad student? Any advice?

l2oe10,0,2021-01-22,Waiting for response while having to sign another offer.,throwaway40666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l2oe10/waiting_for_response_while_having_to_sign_another/,"Please help me. I got an internship offer at a local software company X with a reasonable salary and good benefits. However, I also did a final internship interview with FAANG company Y recently and I am waiting for their answer.
The problem is: I must sign X's contract until next wednesday, and Y told me they AIM to give an answer until next tuesday. However, some time ago I did another interview with Y, and they told me it would take a week to respond, and took a month to reject me. 
And with the experience I gathered, this time I feel I went way better on Y interview.

So, what do I do? It would be extremely bad for me if I signed X offer and week later got out? Or would people understand that I went to a company thousands times bigger? And being a internship makes it less ""bridge-burning? By the way, I've already accepted X offer verbally, the only thing left to do is sign the contract.

Do I tell Y that I would like to know when their hiring meeting will be because I received another offer and need to know? Or telling that I received another offer would be a reason to not accept me?"

My biggest mistake during my college years was that I was not able to land an internship early on even though I tried during the 2nd and 3rd year and I just recently started working on my GitHub as a compensation for a real life experience. I really, really want to hear peoples perspectives here about how much GitHub helps or not because I am not sure if HR people will notice it at all because I have applied to 100s of entry job since Dec 2019 but only got 2 interviews in which I got rejected. In the rest of job applications I either got a rejection email which is normal or I flat out got ghosted. Im going to graduate in the summer of 2021 and I am terrified of not having a professional experience at 26 years old and only a degree in hand. Therefore I am trying right now to improve my LinkedIn, GitHub and even do a Data Structures and Algorithms class on Coursera online. Any advice is appreciated here. Im just confused about my situation if it is ok or horrible. The pandemic also didn't help me in my job search much. Thanks yall and stay safe."
l2puwy,18,2021-01-22,I just failed my first React technical Interview and here are the lessons I learned from it.,fetishthomas69,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/l2puwy/i_just_failed_my_first_react_technical_interview/,"Hello friends, a week ago I asked here on reddit this: 
[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/kvrk05/how_to_answer_tell_me_about_yourself_in_an/]()
It was a question that I had no idea how to answer and I am so thankful for the huge amount of awesome responses I got from the Reddit community - you peeps are amazing! And today I got a chance to have a face-to-face interview with the company that has asked me this question through a phone interview. But the thing is, I honestly did not perform well at all, and by the half end of the interview, my confidence level dropped down by 90%. But here are some of the lessons that I learned today:  

1. When you enter the room, **always smile, be pleasant and greet them Goodmorning or GoodAfternoon**. This just ensures that you have the basic courtesy of greeting a human being. Period.  
     
2. Always be prepared with the question: ""**Tell me about yourself""**. WHY ? Because if you can nail this question without any sweat, I feel like you have a kind of head start already. So refer to the above link on how to answer it in a cool way.  
  
3. If they give you a take-home project with a figma link or any design that they want you to build **ALWAYS STICK TO THE DAMN DESIGN.I REPEAT - STICK WITH IT**.I think this is where I felt like ""oh goddamn it, I really messed up here"".So I was given a basic design and was told to design that basic app with that UI plus add some other features following the same design. But guess what I did ? I didn't follow almost 95% of the design.I added shadows,I added border-radius and all that crap just to boast my CSS skills and when they asked me why I deviated from the design, I had to say that I thought my design was better than theirs which was a very foolish answer to say.  
  
4. **If the interviewer is asking a question, make sure you give some time to think and then answer**. Process the question being asked.What I did was just abruptly jump in and answered it and then when they counter-questioned me whether I was 100% sure of the answer - I went into this state of self-doubt I cannot even explain.  
    
5.If they ask a question and you have zero idea what the hell that thing is, you can say I dont know. OR if you know what it is by at least 10% of it, but don't know how to say it due to lack of accurate knowledge never say I dont know, instead you could say - ""I am still learning on X topic"", OR ""It is something that I am considering to learn"" OR ""I have not figured out what it is **YET**"". These just shows that you are willing to learn and shows some form of positive attitude.But on the other hand if you are comfortable telling honestly that ""You dont know X something"" that's is also fine. But I personally prefer the former.  
  
6. At the end of the interview, they might ask you ""Do you have any questions for us ?"". Here are some questions that you can ask:    
 - ""How is it like working at X company?""  
 - ""What will be some of the tech stacks which I will working on in the coming years"".  
 - ""What all learning opportunities will I receive"".  
 - ""What is the process like to go from an intern to being your  permanent developer?"" (this only applies if you are applying for an internship"".  
 - ""What would be some of the expectations from a junior developer like me?"".  
  
7. Last but not the least, end interview with this golden question. This is one of the questions which I really love to ask, because I believe that every human brain works well with a feedback system.Ask the interviewer: ""**Could you please give me any valuable feedback on how I performed. If so, could you also specify which areas I did not perform well. Also I would really appreciate if you recommend some resources or books that you think would help me increase my knowledge of X subject?**""    
If I was the interviewer, I would 100% appreciate the effort that the person is putting to know more about a subject matter even though the person did not do well in an interview. I might also remember this purticular person well - because I had given him some form of advice.    

Well, these are some of the pointers. At the end of the day, even if you didn't perform well - you will feel like you don't know anything or you'd feel like you are a dissapointment especially if you are a beginner like me. But the truth is, we all have a potential to learn and succeed in life. If not this interview, your lucky one will be your 5th interview, or your 20th interview. Never give up and keep learning and building projects!  

I'm sure this list is not exhaustive,so if any one of you have any other lessons that you have gained after your first technical interview, please leave it in the comments as damn sure its gonna help other beginner programmers a lot. :)"

* pay for your tuition at either York university in Toronto or Carleton in MN towards your Bachelors Degree in Comp Sci
* have you work 25hrs/week on specific projects tailored to your goals where they also give you a competitive salary
* have you undergo Shopify skills training 

I am applying for this, but due to the low acceptance rate, I want to find other internships or programs from big or growing tech companies.

Does anyone know the term for what type of program this is or know of any other programs similar to this."

Hello, Luckily I was able to get an internship from my country's Big Financial Company (bank) and Mid Sized TECH Company (around 50 employees and growing)

So in both company I should use .NET C# tech stack. Salaries are almost same. Internship from bank is 6 month period where I can switch to front end, devops, mobile dev and others... but i think there will be lots of legacy code while other company's internship period is 3 month and their .NET team is relatively new (3-4 month) and use newer versions of technologies.

So what do you think which would be optimal choice ?"

l2spjv,67,2021-01-22,Square vs Amazon vs Salesforce Einstein.ai vs Box internship,physicsgod981,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/l2spjv/square_vs_amazon_vs_salesforce_einsteinai_vs_box/,"Hey everyone, I just received a Square SWE internship offer. I'm super excited about it as this recruiting season as a junior in college has been extremely long and tiring. I also interned at Amazon last summer and have a return offer there. Currently in the interview pipeline for Salesforce [Einstein.ai](https://Einstein.ai) and Box as well, although I'm unsure if I can get through those before Square's offer deadline. In the off chance I had offers to each of these, what would you guys say is the best option? I'm interested in SWE and ML engineering/data science in the future, and plan to go to grad school, so this wouldn't be my last internship before full time. I'm heavily leaning Square but would like to hear your thoughts."
l2t3i5,5,2021-01-22,Jobs for C++ Intermediate Level Dev in 2021?,BolverkSpark,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l2t3i5/jobs_for_c_intermediate_level_dev_in_2021/,"Greetings everyone, I'm currently employed as a back-end developer mostly working on Web API development for our clients and occasional CMS work. I was wondering if there's any jobs out there for an intermediate C++ developer in 2021 and, if so, what am I expected to know in order to be hired?

Intermediate seems like a vague term but I'll explain. I been doing programming for some 5+ years mostly with C++ in the beginning. I knew the basics as well as OOP principles and nuances to memory allocation prior to C++11. What I learned from undergrad wasn't enough since I still didn't know what building real world C++ applications looked like. So I resolved to learning it on my own by perusing [cppreference.com](https://cppreference.com), C++ ISO standards, various blogs and Github repos. Its not easy since my direction on what to learn next is very uncertain, but I'm trying even till this day. My knowledge of making basic template functions and classes were there but knowing Template Metaprogramming is very foreign to me even now.

The reason why still come back to C++ even though I work with Java and C# is the joy I have working closer to the hardware. I have interest in working in anything regarding graphics or computer vision even gaming, all which C++ is prevalent in. I'm just not sure what is hiring in those areas or what else exists out there that I can potentially attempt.

My job in back-end web development and I really find it boring and pointless. It doesn't fulfill any accomplishment or meaning that I can say I'm proud to do. I really don't want to do this but as of now I feel like its the only thing I'm pigeonholed into at the moment until I find time to seek something else out.

A bit about myself and skill set for context:

* Programming - Competent enough to understand SOLID principles, OOP principles, writing test cases, loading external libraries and reading the documentation to use it. Regards to C++ mentioned above.
* School - Both my undergrad and grad schools didn't prepare me enough. They mostly taught front end development which bored me to tears, which made me try out Back-End Development as it felt more like Software Development to me.
* Big O - I can apply a simple estimate an algorithm on its runtime complexity, and where bottlenecks can occur and applying solutions to remedy it ( i.e. when to use a hashmap, apply a sort).
* Algorithms &amp; Data Structures - I have a pretty good knowledge of algorithms and data structures, although I still struggle with Dynamic Programming Q's but I'm still working at it. Mostly learned from CLRS despite struggling with the math driven approach (see below point).
* Math skills - here's the kicker I feel that may set my competence back. I have decent college level algebra skills but none in the fields Calculus or Linear Algebra. As of now, I'm trying to bolster my skills by self-teaching myself Linear Algebra via [Linear Algebra |MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) as a starting point.
* Experience -  I never had an internship and it eats at me til this very day. My aforementioned schools didn't have any real opportunities since they were sparse and rare to find something outside of purely IT, and the ones I sought out never got back or said I needed experience. This would allow me to explore my tech interests to truly settle on what I wanted to do. My job as mentioned is a Back-end developer for a consultancy and I really don't enjoy it.

Apologize for the long prose, I'm willing to take harsh criticism and jump through whatever difficult hoops necessary. If any experienced C++ developer can chime in, that will be a huge plus. I appreciate anyone taking time to break this down with me and help guide my dubious path to something more decided."
l2tvqe,6,2021-01-22,I've come to the conclusion that my resume sucks and I need help.,Sarpool,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/l2tvqe/ive_come_to_the_conclusion_that_my_resume_sucks/,"Hi all. I graduated last year with a IT degree, no certs, no internships and no experience. And right now I am struggling quite a bit to even get a HelpDesk job. I suspect my resume is not very good, even though I had my uncle who works with computers help me out. (I have no idea what he does, but the closest role he described it to be is Database and SWE and he lives in a different state).

I also have another problem, I have no idea what I want to do in IT. I have no ""favorite"" classes that I took, but there were some that I did rather well on, Programming in Java, Python, SQL/databases and some of the System Admin classes, so I suppose I at least have that going for me.

Another concern that I have is I feel like I either wasted my time in college or maybe the IT program at my school wasn't all that great because I barely remember anything and I couldn't get past a phone technical interview for a Junior System Admin role.

I have no idea how, where or what skills I should improve on in order to land an entry level job. 

Are certs worth it for me?   

Is helpdesk really the first step even with a degree?

Should I be trying to land something other than Helpdesk?

What skills should I already have and know well before even applying?

What projects should I complete on my own to help make my resume better?

A couple months later, everyone is leaving and he offers me a higher position with a slight raise to get me to stay, only for me to tell him that I got a position offered as an IT PM.

Worked for a company for almost 5 years, and grew through the ranks starting at Level 1 helpdesk to level 3. Built great personal relationships with a lot of the end users and they all say great things about me (becomes relevant later). Great environment with a great team until a little under a year ago when we got a new CIO. 

During this time, I was telling my boss the IT Director, that I was interested in doing some more PM work so he helps me out and starts giving me more work in that area while guiding me until the position opens up officially. New CIO comes on board. Immediately the environment starts changing and people start dropping like flies. CIO tells me to my face that I am a terrible PM and that I'll never make it in that career after a minor mistake on one of the projects. Heard rumors that he told my boss to fire me too but he backed down after others told him what a great employee I've been through the years (those end users that I mentioned earlier, many of which are in high positions). I see the project to completion, get praised by the key stakeholders, in front of the CIO, about what a great job I did but was already mentally checked out and started looking elsewhere.

People keep leaving the company including my boss until me and an intern are the only ones left on the IT Ops side of the department. Out of desperation, and probably in an attempt to try and keep me, CIO offers me a supervisor position with a 5% raise. The look on his face when I told him that the day prior I had officially received an offer as an IT Project Manager at another company... Priceless! 

New job comes with a 25% bump in what I was making and they are paying for me to get all my PM certifications!"

While going through tutorials I'm making projects on the side to add to my resume (no internships), and I’m already applying to frontend jobs, though with not much luck so far, probably because of having only an ok grasp of HTML/CSS/JS and not much else at the moment perhaps?

I'm currently living at home with the parents, and they're starting to get impatient with me not landing a job yet. They know the former supervisor from my last job personally, from which I quit to pursue my CompSci degree, and he has offered to take me on as his assistant at the same company but out of state. My reservation is that the company deals with legacy VB programs, which isn’t in line with the technologies I want to learn and work with in the future. However my parents would prefer me to take the position for now, because who knows when I would be able to land a decent position in the current economy.

Perhaps I can just work on continuing learning in the weekends if I work there. But I’m just worried that taking the position would push back when I would get to where I want to be. Personally I would rather keep self learning, building projects, updating my resume, and keep looking for and applying to dev positions. So my question is, if you were in my shoes, would you take the job?"
l2v0nn,34,2021-01-22,I might be leaving my full time job for a summer internship and it's giving me anxiety,Odama23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l2v0nn/i_might_be_leaving_my_full_time_job_for_a_summer/,"I currently work at a very large utility company that offers good benefits and has decent pay (the most I've ever earned, but I don't think that's saying a lot), but I have a Summer SDE internship lined up with Amazon which lasts 3 months. I'm currently a junior and a CS major, and getting to work for a major tech company like this almost seems like a dream come true. On top of that, this internship will be paying me quite a bit more than my current job does (around 1.5 x my current pay). All of it seems really exciting and gets my blood pumping, but I'm having lots of anxiety about potentially leaving my current full-time job for ""just a 3 month internship."" I'm not someone who has ever really suffered from anxiety, so I don't even know if I'm properly describing what I'm feeling, but it's something I think about at least once a day, if not every other day, and get stressed over.

The bigger issues are:
-I only started this job late last November, and my internship begins in June. I'm afraid I'd be burning a bridge when I leave. My original idea was to ask for time off, which I believe I've accrued enough for a month, but 3 months seems ridiculous, especially as a new employee, and I'm afraid my employer will just tell me to quit or fire me. My idea was that maybe I can say I have an emergency I have to take care of and won't be able to return until the end of August, but that still seems like it would be a stretch for them to be okay with. 

-I know there is a possibility of it becoming full time work, and the person in charge of my college STEM program mentioned that one of her friend's students just got offered a full-time position, but I don't know how likely that is. I know I shouldn't be banking on them offering me full-time, but I'm also worried that when the internship is over I won't find another job to keep me afloat. I have money saved up, and I know that with the extra income from this internship I can definitely save up a lot more, but it's still somewhat terrifying.

-My mother, who works in the same field as I currently do, keeps asking me about work and how I like it because she believes that it's ""the right path for me"" despite me disliking this line of work. I know they will be upset when they find out I've left what they see as a ""sure thing"" for this uncertainty. It's driving me crazy to keep acting like I'm so in love with my current job, but if I ever complain about not liking the work or even act too neutral towards it, it leads to hour long arguments where they either tell me to stop dreaming and take what life has given me, or they drill me about how I can't afford to throw it away and that I'm not taking it seriously.

-I'm turning 30 this year and I still live at home with my parents. I planned on moving out two years ago, but the plans fell through, then last year I lost my job around June, so I had no choice but to tough it out and stay even longer. Now I'm once again looking for an apartment because I can't stand living here any more. I don't have a good workspace/work environment, because I don't have a desk or the room for one and my younger brother &amp; dogs are very loud. Plus if I leave my job for this internship, I'm sure I'll either be kicked out or my life at home will be insufferable.

It feels like things are starting to look good when it comes to a CS future now. I have this internship opportunity, and I just got accepted into a program that Google and like 3 schools in the country (mine being one of them) partnered up on. It's essentially taking a CS data structures class with them and getting college credit for it and meeting up with someone from Google once a week. It's supposed to be a great way to network, and also has an industry emphasis and some interview skills modules. So it really feels like I'd be wasting this opportunity if I don't take it. I'm afraid that this internship is a big chance for me, and I can't say no.

If I'm being honest, I'm not even sure what type of advice I was looking for out of this thread; maybe I'm just venting. I told myself I'd made up my mind and that I'm gonna stick with my decision to take the internship. I figured that I should be giving my all to what I want for my future career path, rather than not take the opportunity because I felt safe in what I consider to be more of a back up plan. If someone has some good advice, I'd love to hear it. Maybe I really am just childish for wanting this; idk."

I graduated in December with my BSME and have since been applying to jobs like a madman to no avail. I even went and took the FE exam (and passed) just to market myself more but that hasn’t helped yet either. I know the job market will come back and I’m staying positive, but that’s where my issue comes in. 

I have been interning at a lumber mill about 30 miles from my hometown/ college town for a year and a half now, mainly working with our reliability engineer. It’s been a great experience and I have learned a lot, but I do not want to stay there. I’m not the biggest fan of reliability engineering and management isn’t great, along with many other problems. However, I was prepared to take a job there, work for a little bit and then go somewhere else. The company has been dragging their feet on hiring me even though they say they want to, but I don’t mind since I don’t want to stay there long term anyway. I make $20 /hr as an intern so I was fine with just staying on until I got a new job. 

The problem is, my gracious aunt set me up with an interview with Naval Air Systems and it went really well. The job sounded cool and I really think I’m going to get an offer for it soon. However, the air station base I would have to work at is around 1.5 hours from my house in absolute BFE. I hadn’t applied for any jobs there because I didn’t want to be in that area, but when she set me up for an interview I couldn’t say no. My goal when I graduated was to get out of this part of the country and go work near a city with my girlfriend. If I get/take this job, I’d definitely have to move since it’s so far from my house and I’d feel the need to work for them for a few years (at least a year due to a lease). My whole motivation after graduation was to leave this area and start something new with my GF and it feels like if I take this job I’m moving in reverse and won’t be happy. Should I put my goals aside for a little bit and take the job or stay at my internship and wait until the job market comes back so I can get out of here? 

Thanks for the help."

Even though I’ve worked for a year, I feel like I still need a lot of help in doing stuff, I don’t retain any information and I keep asking the same questions over and over again. 

Before the pandemic, I was an overachiever at pretty much anything, work and school both. My internships during college I was always labeled a leader, go-getter, people said I understood things really fast and well and I took charge in whatever I did, I was happy at work, I liked going to work and I was one of those people who thought about work even at home and on weekends I’d do some light coding for work if I got a burst of idea for a problem I was stuck on at work or something. At school I graduated in the top 2% of our entire CS department. I say all this not to brag but to explain how much of an overachiever I was. (Also when I say work here I mean internships during the summer, spring and fall semesters)

Since the pandemic started I have lost all motivation, I stay quiet during meetings, i zone out. In fact, today during a meeting our PO was doing backlog refinement and I zoned out and all of sudden he’s asking who wants to work on this story and I would usually say yes but pandemic me stayed quiet and my PO asked me if I could pick it up and I said yes and idek what story I just picked up. And this is not the first time this has happened. That’s how bad I’m doing at work. 

I’m just wondering if any other new grads are feeling this way? I wanna get out of this mess I created, it’s getting worse everyday. Any advice would help, I wanna not hate work. I just hate work at this point.

Edit : wow this blew up! Thanks to everyone who shared your advice and stories, I’m glad I’m not the only one feeling this way, I hope we all come out of this pandemic stronger and better than before! And I think I need a nice long vacation :) I have too much PTO saved up.

Also to ppl saying I have depression, I don’t. I probably have a lot of anxiety and get stressed out too much but I’m still a cheerful and generally happy person outside of work :)"

The problem is I have no positive motivators to finish my degree. Basically my only motivator is the fear of what will happen if I DON'T get a degree.

I've come to realize that my major isn't something I'm really interested in. So I can't produce motivation by thinking about a specific future I'm working towards with my degree, because I have no such future in mind. I'm not motivated by the prestige/identity of the school either. I guess I just went here because apparently employers care about the rankings of the school you went to. But tbh if I was an employer I wouldn't want to hire me, I don't have any internship experience and I would rather jump off a cliff than make a LinkedIn profile.

I skipped a whole week of classes just to be able to get my homework assignments in this week and then I just didn't do the assignments (not for lack of time) because I cannot construct a narrative in my head as to why I should be doing them. And now I'll have to spend the weekend catching up on a week's worth of lectures and I won't get a break before the next week of torture begins. I've used up every possible method to try to motivate myself to focus on assignments, for example, I physically cannot listen to music or podcasts anymore because I now associate them with the feeling of forcing myself to do assignments.

I feel that if I were to construct some reason as to why I should be motivated in my current classes it would just be lying to myself. And I don't want to switch majors because a.) I only have two quarters left to finish my current major and b.) what would I even switch it to that I would be more motivated in than my current major? I also don't want to take a quarter off because I really didn't like living at UCLA and I want to finish all my classes while they're still online so I don't have to go back there. I know that I just need to somehow find the motivation to get through the next two quarters, but 5 months is a long time and I don't know how I will do it.

Is anyone else in the same boat lol. Any advice?"

Her friend began feeling sick a few days ago and claimed it was ""just a minor cold."" For the past few days my mom has been visiting her and running errands for her. Because of the news about the comedian, her friend got tested and the result was positive. Despite this, my mom continues to visit her. She claims that she's only in her house for a few minutes at a time, but that to me is still VERY worrying. Though my mom hasn't shown any signs of being sick, I fear that she could come back sick and get both of us killed. I've expressed my concerns to her but she just tells me I'm overreacting. As someone who has been home since lockdown began it's upsetting to think my own mom may be the one who exposes me despite all of my precautions (not traveling, not seeing anyone for almost a year, not going out to eat, etc.)

I started taking extra precautions by wearing an N-95 mask in the house at all times, bleaching the entire house every night, and not leaving my room until my mom either leaves the house or is in her room for the night.

Wins:

\-got an advisor for a potential research oriented club at my school that I can start next year

\-got 2 responses from professors (one said to email them in April/may and I might be able to intern at their lab and another said they would look for opportunities and get back to me if the found any)

Exactly how it sounds. I have recently (like as of two days ago) was hired to be a content writing intern, started yesterday (made the god awful mistake of saying that I could start immediately). And now I'm stuck in a role where the other two interns are leaving everything EVERYTHING to me. I wasn't informed of this until after the interview. The official offer letter is going to come over the weekend, but I don't want to be stuck in this sinking ship doing the roles of two people, plus the new duties they are assigning me. I also have the possibility of being offered a couple other roles here in the next week (one of them paid). However, yesterday and today was a lot of training, and I barely remember anything because of all the stuff they are asking me to do. This job was advertised as a part-time internship, and yet, they expect me to work full time. I have been working full time. And the tasks they've had me do are so utterly soul crushing that I can't stand it. Copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, over and over again until I die. Yesterday, I didn't get up from my desk for so long, that when I stood up, I nearly fainted from the head rush. A few minutes later, I was making myself something to eat, and wound up charring my sandwich (I hadn't eaten all day). Last night, I had the worst sleep of my life, and almost slept through an 8:30 meeting. Today, I spent hours copy-pasting again. Then was told to read several articles to understand the writing style, so that later today (she ended up not having time) I could talk with my boss about how to make them shorter (it was like 40 articles). And she also wanted me to shadow one of the other interns all day so he could teach me how to do things. And then I learned that I have to interview people for more internship roles. Now, first off, I can't in good conscience tell people that I love working a role that I hate, and second off, I have such terrible social anxiety that I can barely talk to people, let alone interview them! I made it through the interviews I did have by the skin of my teeth, and my beta-blocker pills, but I'm not supposed to take them too often bc they interfere with my ADHD meds.

I'm just so tired, and close to tears, like I don't know what to do. I know that I want to get another job so that I don't have to be working this one for too much longer. Which gets me to my main point. They want me to review intern applications. Which means I have to go on Indeed through their account. But it requires two step authentication, which means every time I log out of their account to log back into mine to find jobs, I need to get a code that is texted to the boss's phone number. But if I constantly ask for a new code every day, then she will get suspicious, and it's just too many steps.

And it's not like I can just go on Linkedin instead, bc there are so many scam job listings in my field on linkedin that it takes me all day to apply to a couple of jobs that also don't work for my field usually. 

I don't know anymore. My head hurts too much, and I think I might just be overthinking it, but I'm also so done with this job, bc she keeps piling on so much stuff, and she only listed the job in my field (content writing) and literally she barely knows what that means, because her first task she would set me to (while I was interviewing) was look at these messages they send to people on linkedin and improve them. Like???? They're fine as they are???? What do you mean by improve??????? And every time I have the chance to ask, she starts talking again, and like, I don't know what to do with that???? She just talks so much, that no one can get a word in edgewise. Like when she was having trouble with zoom this morning, the other intern on the call looked relieved, and then asked the business partner lady something about a job that I was given, bc she kept changing what she wanted that everyone even the business partner lady was confused, I was confused, just not able ask.

Anyways, sorry for the rant, if anyone has any suggestions as to what to do, I would be very much appreciative. For now, I'm going to take a nap, and get something to eat (bc I haven't eaten all day today either)"
l30a9m,1,2021-01-22,"Conservation dream job, genomics semi-dream job, or programmer secure job?",greataidan,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/l30a9m/conservation_dream_job_genomics_semidream_job_or/,"18 year old freshman at university intending to major in Quantitative Biology and minor in Computer Science from North Carolina

My number one passion for my entire life has been the preservation of Earth’s biodiversity, especially apes. I’ve declared to friends of mine that if I don’t get the opportunity to work with apes at some point in my life, then I will have failed. It’s become clear to me through research that there is not much money in primatology nor conservation, and the former requires a lot of post-undergrad education. Money isn’t everything, but security is very important to me, but so is my dream. I’m also currently working part-time in principal wetland restoration, which is kind of conservation.

My number two passion is science and math. I’ve always been very skilled and interested in these two things, so I figured if I’m not doing apes, I’m doing something in STEM, preferably biology. Summer 2020 I had an internship with a pharma company as a researcher. While I enjoyed the wet lab experience, I found that pharma is not something I’m really passionate about. My major and minor choices were inspired by research into companies like Mammoth Biosciences, but I don’t really know how realistic it is to have one company in mind when thinking about my degrees. Computer science, I figured, was a great choice for generally applicable skills by the time I’m in the job market. Unfortunately, I’ve just started to think about how daunting the necessary time commitment of 6-10 years for my undergrad, graduate, and doctorate education if I intend to end up somewhere like Mammoth Biosciences.

My brother attended the same university I’m attending  right now, majored in Computer Science, and got a 6 figure salary out of a BS in Computer Science working as a programmer. Since CS is STEM, I’m still interested in it, but it will likely be a far cry from my dream. This is another option.

I don’t really know what to do. I’m probably gonna be talking to academic/career advising soon about this. To fulfill my ape dream, I could commit a summer to a study abroad program or something. I’m not asking for anyone to tell me what to do, but I’m happy to hear what anyone has to say about my current situation."
l30oup,2,2021-01-22,Looking for advice on my Capstone project,Sauronsbrowneye,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l30oup/looking_for_advice_on_my_capstone_project/,"I posted this in the networking subreddit, as that is a bit more specific to what I personally will be doing, but I thought I could ask here as well, if anyone had any experience with the same dilemma. 
As a little bit of context, I am an older student (~30) who is about to graduate with a CS Bachelors with an emphasis on systems and security. I got into this degree when I discovered networking while getting my AA from a tech school, which actually IS a networking AA. This prompted me to try and break into the field, and get my CCNA, etc. 

I have a job parallel to the field, doing fiber/copper cabling and basically working on the physical aspects of networks, and last summer had an internship with a small company to help implement a VLAN system into their network as well as help them migrate ISPs. I also acquired my CCNA early last year. I have a solid background now I would say, but am unsure EXACTLY what employers are looking for.

This semester before I graduate, I have my capstone project, which is essentially anything I want related to systems and security in computer science. I was looking for some insight or ideas about what a practical, network based project I could work on for my capstone is that is something that could actually impress employers and potentially help me get my career started when I graduate. I would also like to state that I have some experience programming in Java specifically (and a smidgen of python), and I know this subreddit tends to heavily lean towards se, but that isn't my goal, and the majority of what I know is from my advanced programming course in the school, so a heavy coding/algorithm project is probably not in the cards for me."

l325hn,1,2021-01-22,Should I accept a job offer or go to graduate school?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l325hn/should_i_accept_a_job_offer_or_go_to_graduate/,"I am a recent college graduate and I really need help deciding what to do next. I am in an admittedly very fortunate situation where I have been able to work at an internship while applying to graduate schools (master of economics programs) for Fall 2021, however I have just been informed that a full-time, 1-2 year, position is opening up at the company where I work and that I could stay on if I wanted to. They need to know soon whether I will accept the position but I won't hear back from my masters programs for another couple of months. 

The issue is that I applied to very selective programs so there is a reasonable chance that I won't get in to any of them. However, it would feel like a waste to accept the job then get into a program and not be able to go after I spent all this time/money applying. Ultimately, I would rather be in grad school this fall than working but how can I justify turning down a paying job in these difficult times? What if I turn down the job and end up not getting into any school? 

I do really like the company I work for now but I just hate the idea of having to repeat the application cycle in a couple of years if I keep working now. Any advice on what the best path is after undergrad? Anyone who has re-applied to grad schools after not getting in the first time? Any recommendations would greatly appreciated!"

But I am working from home right now and I feel like I’m being very lazy. Constantly being distracted by non-work things on the internet, getting up, eating, walking to the coffee shop and back, chatting in discord, I’d say these sort of activities take up a good chunk of my work day. I do try to be available during work hours but I definitely am not working 40 hours a week. It’s probably quite a bit less than that. But, my manager says I’m doing well. And I do make an effort to complete all my tickets, which sometimes leads to harder workdays

Is this common? Perhaps it is just the nature of cerebral work like software engineering"

I am a 21 year old male from Indonesia and I am currently a senior double majoring in molecular biology and chemistry at a US institution with an F1 Visa. Current plan is to attend graduate school (Master's) or work as a research contractor (if I don't get accepted for grad school).

Steps taken for USA:

I have 2 internship experiences (1 in a research lab and 1 in a major US company) and 3 years worth of lab-based research experience. I am fluent in English (native proficiency according to my friends) and currently learning German, aside from my native tongue. I have been applying for jobs in the US although COVID has diminished a lot of job opportunities for fresh grads like me (I have been hearing companies cutting down staff or freeze hiring from friends). I am wondering if you guys have any ideas that might help my chances of staying in the US?  

Switzerland:

I don't really have any preparations yet for these countries aside from trying to learn German at the moment. I am mostly interested in Switzerland because of their low tax rates and lucrative jobs in the biotech sector and it seems like a really nice place to live. 

What are your thoughts? 

Thanks!!!"

This is clear through the text messages that my uncle have sent me. 

She says I must sign over all the money from my Indian bank account to her(possible the money that my father left in solely my name from selling the house they paid for together)
She has not given me any details of the account and refuses to do so. She says just sign the paper. If I refuse she tells my uncle to do the necessary.

If I do not comply my uncle will not give me my documents in India which os legally time sensitive.
I will be signing the documents on Saturday morning as I have no other option.

Is there anything I can do when I come back to the US in April to get my money back from that will be transfered out of my Indian bank account tommrow?"

I am currently applying to Software engineering internships. But I am struggling with getting calls back. I think it might be my resume. I have some questions to ask.

1.) I noticed some companies will say upload Resume/CV. I know CVs are longer than resumes, and resumes are one page. For someone like me (no experience with CS internships or jobs) should I upload a resume or a CV.

2.)  I do have work experience but it is irrelevant for positions that I applying for. Should I still mention those in my resume/CV?

Thanks."
l35i82,3,2021-01-22,5th year pursuing my bachelors in software engineering and failing on getting an internship or job offer. Graduating this November. How should I go about this job search?,stalkersquirrel108,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l35i82/5th_year_pursuing_my_bachelors_in_software/,"Hello all!   
This is my first post on this subreddit so I apologize if I'm missing any of the appropriate reddiquette for this post, feel free to call me out and I'm more than willing to fix it right away.

Anyways, as the title says this will be my 5th year pursuing a BS in software engineering, a program that should have been 4 years, and in this kind of lies my issue.  Over the course of my college career I've managed to land 2 internships, my senior design project, and a free lacing gig. While I've had a decent run with the amount of experience I've had, my GPA was never great, a 2.45 on a 4 point scale to be precise. Due to my poor grades, I feel as though most of the applications I submit get thrown out right away despite the, I think, decent amount of opportunities I can showcase, but that doesn't get to my issue. 

My issue is that I'm not sure what kind of positions I should be going for. I will be graduating in November so I'm not sure if I should go for full time positions, internships or just try my hand at freelancing for awhile to make ends meet.

If it helps, my experience thus far have been with full stack web development alongside some Java/SQL applications. Anything will help at this point as I'm not sure where to go to ask for this kind of advice. Thanks in advance!   


TL;DR Low GPA but decent amount of experience. About to graduate but don't know what kind of positions I should be seeking, looking for advice."

My biggest mistake during my college years was that I was not able to land an internship early on even though I tried during the 2nd and 3rd year and I just recently started working on my GitHub as a compensation for a real life experience. I really, really want to hear peoples perspectives here about how much GitHub helps or not because I am not sure if HR people will notice it at all because I have applied to 100s of entry job since Dec 2019 but only got 2 interviews in which I got rejected. In the rest of job applications I either got a rejection email which is normal or I flat out got ghosted. Im going to graduate in the summer of 2021 and I am terrified of not having a professional experience at 26 years old and only a degree in hand. Therefore I am trying right now to improve my LinkedIn, GitHub and even do a Data Structures and Algorithms class on Coursera online. Any advice is appreciated here. Im just confused about my situation if it is ok or horrible. The pandemic also didn't help me in my job search much. Thanks yall and stay safe."
l37dnh,39,2021-01-23,I am in dire need of a profile assessment regarding my career and life in general! A desperate cry for help.,endlessbrooder95,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/l37dnh/i_am_in_dire_need_of_a_profile_assessment/,"Hi folks,

Namaskaram! This is a little longer than I thought. Please bear with me. My life depends on it.

I was a good student till my class 10th. 11th and 12th were a disaster as I took science with maths and clearly lacked an aptitude for both. I liked computers though.

 I appeared for engineering entrances and did bad. I took an year off and tried again and secured a worse rank.

I took an admission in a tier 3 Engineering College in Bangalore. Please try to understand, I am not dumb. I understood the concepts and I am an avid reader, developed coded a game in Unity, organized trips for my juniors. But all these things were a flash in a plan kind of thing.

I lacked consistency, I procrastinated and lazed around and my aversion to mathematics didn't help. Though I was a people's person, I could see the direction I was going into. 

I ended up with an aggregate of 52% in my Engineering. But at the same time, I secured a job in my 7th semester. It was a Business Development Job and had no connection to my graduation degree.

It was an advertising agency with very unique services. As it was a startup it gave me immense exposure where I was pitching and meeting CMOs and negotiating with them. I also had 4 interns reporting to me. 

I take a lot of decisions in my life impulsively, and I could sense that an MBA might help me here to succeed further in a job. I was getting a meagre 14k in this job, but I stuck for 14 months because the work was great. But I don't see any particular skill I needed to do it. I mean, I could have done it if I didn't finish college too.

I left the job and came back to my hometown where my father needed someone to help him out in his work. It is not a business but he works as a consultant valuer with State Bank and I started helping him in making reports and stuff. My plan was to do extremely well in CAT and somehow get into a good MBA college.

I tried really hard (maybe not, I don't even know) but I bombed CAT and secured 89%ile in XAT. Funnily, my score card reads 97%ile in English and Reasoning, 96%ile in decision making and just a 48%ile in Quantitative aptitude. 

It's been 3 years since my graduation and my career sucks. The colleges I am getting are tier 2 and 3 private colleges charging lacs which means I absolutely have to take a loan. 

My question is, what should I do?

1. Take admission into a substandard MBA college and try to score good and just study for 2 years?
2. Take a hard transition into tech. Study coding from where I left it and take a internship in a software startup and learn and start the same process which a lot of my friends started a few years back.
3. Take a combination of Digital Marketing and web development and try to become a digital marketer?

I am feeling choked as I am 25 now, and I need to decide fast. 

I do not want to go into Business Development without and MBA because sales never fascinated me, marketing did. The job of a Digital Marketer and an Of line marketer who works with creative teams to run ad campaigns. But CMOs have something in common, they are academically strong and from good colleges.

I need to start a career and earn. I know I am worth more than the mess I am in right now. Please throw some light."
l37edh,4,2021-01-23,Seeking Advice i am turning 30 and have been in IT fiend since 19!(sharing my long story),icmma,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/l37edh/seeking_advice_i_am_turning_30_and_have_been_in/,"Hello All,

After reading some stories i just wanted to share mine and get some advice.

I did't get chance to go to college although i wanted to but due to finical condition it wasn't option for me so i worked 2 jobs just to make living.

As kid i always been good with computers and had self taught almost everything. When i graduated from high school i wanted to have career in IT field so i did internships at any company that opening just to get hands on experience.  My first internship was with system admin which i did for about 6 months during the internship period i started to apply for IT jobs and i got first job with known anti-virus software company that provided tech support.

I started as entry level tech however after 3 months i was promoted as level two tech i was happy with first job and never thought that it will come to end. I worked there for 2 years and then 2012 recession hit the company filled chapter 11 and they started to let go people one department at time. My team was last team they let go but what i can say is within 2 years i learned so much and had good mentors.

After being let go from work i had hard time finding IT jobs around the time. It wasn't just me of course  i know a lot of people suffered from the recession. i knew someone who worked at yahoo and was let go and was working as server at restaurant. Since i had hard time finding IT job as well during that period of time, i end up working as cashier since that was only job that i can find to pay bills. After sometime i was still looking for IT jobs and then picked up some small gigs on craiglist for general computer repair later was able to find part time entry level IT Job again so i end up working 2 jobs at same time.

As time went by working 2 jobs wasn't doing for me since it caused me some health concerns. While i was working as cashier i was promoted to manager position with little pay increase which was results into same pay as for 2 jobs into one pay check with less hour so around this time i started making 16hr after 5 years later i was finally recovering from my health while still working full time i decided to go back into IT job again.

During period of working as cashier when i was home i will give myself 2 hours of play time everyday where i learned on how to build website from scratch by modifying existing HTML, CSS and Javascript code. I learned how to write html and make beautiful art out of CSS. Although i did use javascript but i never wrote it from scratch but i made modifications to code i found online and made it work to what i wanted to do. I have been person who has always been fast learner. If i learn it once then i can do it over and over.After learning some code, i end up digging into other coding languages example php, python and frameworks like node.js ( i know how to use them all but i can't write from scratch i can just make modification by research which is basic coding i guess)

Since my health was normal now i got into IT automation help desk job where i learned about home automation which was great learning experience and i end up raising my pay to 19hr. After doing this job for couple of years i decided to move on next position which is now my current position. I started as level 1 on site tech for $22 hr at company support over 500 users where i for first time i was introduced to azure ad, 0365, onedrive when i started back i was 19 i was working on real servers and now it was completely new world since i am fast learned i was able to pick up azure ad pretty quick. 

Since i wanted to dive more into azure ad i end up getting my own tenant and started paying more and more this is where i learned powershell which i was able to learn within a week. Since i had messed around with batch script and other coding languages in past which helped me a lot with powershell. I am not saying i can write complicated powershell code but instead i can make the code work on the tasks to make things more automated. i have used powershell most for azure ad  and exchange online but not on actual desktop environment but i have built some codes for desktop environment. I can say i am just okay with powershell anyways back to story after 6months later in job i was promoted as Help desk tie 2 with TeamLead title where i am now currently support my team of 5 other techs while pay now is $25hr yes there was $3 pay increase it's something.

At my current position i have been involved with a lot more projects now then help desk work which is helpful to have more experience to grow my career. I have been with my current company for about  1 year and 5 months now but now i am at stage where i would like to get out of helpdesk position in general and get into something else.

At my current position i work with multiple companies support over 1000's of users where i have worked with migrating users from network drive to sharepoint sites, building sharepoint sites since learning html kind of helped me here now i am the only one at my company who works on sharepoint site, settings up rooms, mailboxes, groups etcs, know basic TCP/IP, setting up DC , write group polices ,Azure AD connect, setting up DC and file server  using hyper-v, exchange online, power automate, phishing emails  purge using e-discovery, recently had project to migrate from tenant to tenant using bittitan was helpful , i have don't any exchange migration yet but can learn it quick. overall i am pretty good with 365 based environment. 

I am kind of confused at the moment on what path can i take to improve my overall career? i would like to get to goal of making less than $40 hr just being reasonable if i could make more it will be great. Please note i do have no any certs, just high school diploma with years of experience me just messing around to learn stuff. 

i am just seeking to move my career to next position i just don't want to be stuck in same bubble anymore what will be my options options that i can look for ? i do live in California 

I am more of hands on person really strong on software side. I know how to debug a software even when i have no clue no how it works. 

Any advice will be appreciated and thanks for reading.

Namaskaram! This is a little longer than I thought. Please bear with me. My life depends on it.

I was a good student till my class 10th. 11th and 12th were a disaster as I took science with maths and clearly lacked an aptitude for both. I liked computers though.

I appeared for engineering entrances and did bad. I took an year off and tried again and secured a worse rank.

I took an admission in a tier 3 Engineering College in Bangalore. Please try to understand, I am not dumb. I understood the concepts and I am an avid reader, developed coded a game in Unity, organized trips for my juniors. But all these things were a flash in a plan kind of thing.

I lacked consistency, I procrastinated and lazed around and my aversion to mathematics didn't help. Though I was a people's person, I could see the direction I was going into.

I ended up with an aggregate of 52% in my Engineering. But at the same time, I secured a job in my 7th semester. It was a Business Development Job and had no connection to my graduation degree.

It was an advertising agency with very unique services. As it was a startup it gave me immense exposure where I was pitching and meeting CMOs and negotiating with them. I also had 4 interns reporting to me.

I take a lot of decisions in my life impulsively, and I could sense that an MBA might help me here to succeed further in a job. I was getting a meagre 14k in this job, but I stuck for 14 months because the work was great. But I don't see any particular skill I needed to do it. I mean, I could have done it if I didn't finish college too.

I left the job and came back to my hometown where my father needed someone to help him out in his work. It is not a business but he works as a consultant valuer with State Bank and I started helping him in making reports and stuff. My plan was to do extremely well in CAT and somehow get into a good MBA college.

I tried really hard (maybe not, I don't even know) but I bombed CAT and secured 89%ile in XAT. Funnily, my score card reads 97%ile in English and Reasoning, 96%ile in decision making and just a 48%ile in Quantitative aptitude.

It's been 3 years since my graduation and my career sucks. The colleges I am getting are tier 2 and 3 private colleges charging lacs which means I absolutely have to take a loan.

My question is, what should I do?

1. Take admission into a substandard MBA college and try to score good and just study for 2 years?
2. Take a hard transition into tech. Study coding from where I left it and take a internship in a software startup and learn and start the same process which a lot of my friends started a few years back.
3. Take a combination of Digital Marketing and web development and try to become a digital marketer?

I am feeling choked as I am 25 now, and I need to decide fast.

I do not want to go into Business Development without and MBA because sales never fascinated me, marketing did. The job of a Digital Marketer and an Of line marketer who works with creative teams to run ad campaigns. But CMOs have something in common, they are academically strong and from good colleges.

I need to start a career and earn. I know I am worth more than the mess I am in right now. Please throw some light."

I was already in doubts and I wasn't sure as to whether I can go down this particular route because

1. I'm not that good at it - I'm not as smart as my family and teachers led me to believe
2. I lost interest

Since then, I've dibbled and dabbled in courses, internships and traineeships in a variety of different fields. Despite being productive during the pandemic, I've yet to find a graduate job and I'm losing hope. If thousands of graduates with higher grades and more experience are struggling, how can I get anywhere?

I'm losing hope in life in general - I never expected to be a millionaire or something but I'm approaching 25 without having had a proper job, and the more time gaps on my CVs, the more concerning it is for employers

I have a night shift job which is basically minimum wage, and keeps the lights on and I am very grateful, as I understand that many out there would kill for a job but it's fucking with my mental andn physical health especially with lost sleep. I even had a interview which i ended up botching up because I had worked the night before and the interview was literally just as I finished work. I just feel like there's no hope out there despite me being positive.

I have applied to 100s of jobs, and only received around 20 replies - i've gone to expert CV specialists and friends who have tailor made my CV and I've had no luck.

I'm just losing faith in life."

To give some reference, I am currently a Junior attending Grand Valley State University in Michigan and have around a 3.16 GPA which is close to a B average. Last semester (Fall 2020) I took an internship prep class as all CS majors must have an internship before graduation and take that class and is usually taken the summer before Senior year. So since October I have applied to over 180 or so internships and heard back from around 40 or 50 saying that they were gonna move forward with other applicants and did manage to land 3 interviews. 

Of those 3 interviews I managed to get into the second round of interviews and finally (literally yesterday) I got an offer!

This whole process has just been very stressful as my college requires CS and Engineering students to have an internship before graduation so this is a major blessing. 

There is one question however that doesn't add up, why is there such a high need for computer programmers but the internship positions are far and few as in so many studenst apply for them but only few get accepted or receive offers. Like am I going to have the same issue like I was having finding an internship when I graduate and look for a real job either as a Software Engineer or Software Developer?"
l3eq24,4,2021-01-23,[Showoff Saturday] I made a visualization tool for HWInfo logs that displays data in a line chart!,torta-de-frango,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/l3eq24/showoff_saturday_i_made_a_visualization_tool_for/,"HWInfo is one of the best hardware monitoring software out there. With it, you can monitor the internal components of your PC collecting data such as CPU temperature, percentage of RAM memory usage, GPU utilization, among many others.

It has a log feature, where data is recorded over time in a .CSV file.

The point is: interpreting CSV data in tables is not the most intuitive way.

Feeling the need to better interpret the logs, I created LogCharts. With it, it is possible to generate a line chart representing any data present in the log. You can view smaller parts of the graph with the ""brushing"" functionality, check the individual values ​​through the tooltip and check the minimum, average and maximum values ​​of the selected data. You can also add more than one line to the chart, allowing you to compare different data over time.

[LogCharts](https://preview.redd.it/19ba8nx0u3d61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc71910a78c1263cc150afaa50c28c21d0959954)

With LogCharts, I could see how the voltage of my Ryzen 3200G was showing a strange behavior, making the temperature a little uncontrolled as well. After researching, I switched the Vcore in the BIOS from Auto to Normal, generated another log and then realized how the Vcore line was much more stable, and how the temperature was within acceptable levels even with the CPU load close to 100%.

I hope LogCharts can help you identify problems and find solutions more easily, as well as better understand how your computer behaves over time.

Forgive me if any bugs appear unexpectedly! One of the reasons I built this project was to compose my portfolio in search of an internship, I don't have much experience in webdev but I tried to do my best to code well and learn as much as I could.

My family is incredibly racist and overly ""protective"" even though we all know protective means lack of freedom using manipulative tactics to keep you indoors at all times (especially now during COVID). I graduated from college in May a little after lockdowns and curfews were put in place and still have not found a job. Prior to that, my dad passed away this month of last year and a part of me snapped. I feel like I've completely lost myself. My dad was my support system when I was still a student. Though he rarely ever spoke up for me against my mom and sister, I was the only one closest to him in the household. I always stayed at school until closing time anywhere between 9PM-11PM just to avoid going home and after schools started shuttering, I felt even worse having to be around my family 24/7 while doing online learning.

8 months post graduation and a year after my dad's death, my mom and sister are on my case now more than ever. I am struggling with my mental health and I dread waking up in this house each and every day. I understand I'm fortunate enough to have a roof over my head, but this isn't *living*. It's absolute *torture* for me. My mom and sister both constantly degrade and belittle me treating me as if I was a child. Both comment on my weight, which has really affected my relationship with food. I still eat, but not the way I used to. My mom constantly brings up that my Computer Science degree was a mistake and truly I'm starting to believe it. She literally compares me to her friend's kids who are now currently in college. What is there to fucking compare me to? I've already graduated and I have my damn degree. She constantly says I should have studied to become a nurse and says how easy it is for them to secure a job after graduating, which is bullshit. I had zero interest in going into the medical field and was terrible at the sciences, so for her to remind me that I'm unemployed constantly really is upsetting. I honestly am terrified because at this point, I don't know what to do with my degree either in terms of job searching and don't want to just settle for anything. I've had people tell me a job is a job given the pandemic, but I know myself, and I know myself better than anyone that if I just take any job, I'll be unhappy. If people think it's because of pride, it's not. I don't care what job it is, but at the end of the day I'd rather it be a job I actually gave a damn about. 

I've rebelled from the moment I realized just how toxic my family really was. I've gotten piercings and more tattoos than my family members could care for (they don't know about any of the tattoos), but now, mentally, I feel like I'll end up disconnecting from society and those who do love me if I keep living here. Moving isn't an option for me at the moment, even though I wish it was. I'm tired of crying myself to sleep and thinking that I'm worthless and stupid for not being able to secure any sort of job or internship. It's incredibly difficult for me right now and it makes things even harder when my family members constantly degrade me."

Help out a young IT tech.  I’m 22. 

I could use some help planning out how I can get hired by my contractor. 

**Here’s the backstory:**

Back in Fall 2020 I got a contract to work as help desk support for a company. A pretty big company. A college actually. 

I was contracted to work for the fall semester. 

Everything went well when I started. I got there and immediately was embraced by the tech staff and the student interns. The professors loved the work I was doing and frequently said how much they appreciated me and the work I was doing. Even other faculty members from other departments acknowledged not just me, but also spoke highly of me to the IT team in general. 

I constantly get praised for my work in this role and I enjoy working for the school. The people are great and because of it being a school there’s a lot of cool tech to be around. 

**This is the part I need help with:**
- The fall semester is over and the spring semester has begun. My contract is coming to an end....I want to stay and the team wants me to stay as well but they said it’s a lot of approvals they’ll have to get in order to actually hire me...

- What should I do to not just keep the contract but actually become an employee?

- I’m assuming I’m qualified enough to be help desk support for them because they gave me the contract.  Do you think I would need more qualifications? Or is it budget restrictions? They also use about 6 student workers, so maybe it’s money (although to be fair to me, I’ve been told I do waaayy more work than a few of them combined)? When I asked about staying my supervisor said they wanted me but they need approvals and said I might not get it.  

- I have CompTIA a+, google support cert and OnBase system admin cert. With 2 going on 3 years of IT work experience. 

- I thought about maybe asking some Professors who were really appreciative to reach out to the IT dept. head, but to be honest I don’t remember everyone who seemed nice enough to do that (I help a lot of ppl 😅). 


**TLDR:** I’m a help desk contractor working for a college, for the fall semester, who ended up REALLY liking the position and wants to get hired on. But I don’t know how to go about becoming an employee. 

Any suggestions you guys might have would help me a lot, thanks.



Edit: I also forgot to mention that I’m still working there now, even though the spring semester started because my supervisor was able to extend me for another 2 weeks."

I graduated with masters in architecture 6 years ago and haven't been able to find a permanent job ever since. I have done 2 internships abroad ( 1 before and 1 post graduation) and also worked at three firms but none of them hired me after the probation period. I have worked in those firms for 4, 2 and 3 months. Basically my longest  and least problematic employment in architecture was when I was in my 4th year in university and I did an exchange year in Germany. I did a 6 month internship then. This doesn't make any sense because supposedly I had less experience at that time.

After the last job that lasted 3 months I was so affected  by all that happened that I decided to give up architecture, learned to program somewhat and then worked as a software developer for an year and a half.

I am not that interested in programming though and I would like to go back to architecture even though where I live the gap in payment between the two professions is enormous ( threefold at least).

I feel really ashamed about my past failures and scared to apply for jobs. I suffer from depression and guilt because of everything that happened. My portfolio used to be decent, even interesting for someone just graduating, my internships abroad used to make a good impression when I was 25 but know I am 31 with a horrible job record and just some student projects in my portfolio.

Probably it would be relevant to try to explain why I wasn't hired at those jobs, although the real failure really is that I gave up after the 3 unsuccessful attempts. So some of the reasons are:

- I was sometimes late for work
- I wasn't motivated enough and didn't work hard enough ( here it's a very competitive field where it is required to make a lot of overtime and really do one's best )
- at the first place they told me that they needed someone more experienced. In general it was one of the best firms in my city and they are pretty selective. 
- I overthink and am not fast enough 
- I expressed my opinion when i was expected to execute what the boss wanted. Argued with him even.
- I didn't get along with a bitchy project manager.

Recently I dared to go to one interview, but was unsuccessful and tried to talk to some acquaintances with their own practices, but also didn't lead to anything. Here the market for architects is generally small and tough and I think I don't have any chance.

 Please, help, is it possible to get out of this or should I give up architecture?"

I am currently employed as a postdoctoral fellow in my second year. Given the nature of the position (i.e., trainee), my employment contract is usually for one year at a time. The intent is that I eventually will move on to an academic tenure-track position. I have two people that I report to: my boss, i.e., the one who within the organization is my supervisor on paper, approves leave, etc. The other one is my mentor, the one who oversees my research, and with whom I discuss all aspects of my work/research.  

I have a great relationship with my mentor; as far as I know he thinks very highly of me, primarily because he has said that to me in no uncertain terms. Things are a bit different with my boss. Although we are courteous with one another, I’m pretty confident that if he could, he would try to screw me over in some way. 

This is not an issue specific to me – as far as I know there is not a single person in our organization that thinks highly of him, at least not anybody who is below him in our workplace hierarchy. I know that several people have reported him to HR, but as far as I know nothing ever came of that. Because I have been connected with this organization as an intern before I even took my current position, I know a lot of people in this field, and at least according to hearsay, he has a poor reputation among professionals in our city. He’s known to lie and be very conniving. Also according to hearsay, HR even forced him to take leave in order to have a couple of situations cool down. Anyways, I know none of this matters per se, but it gives some background information.

Given the nature of the research (and COVID of course), things are progressing slowly, and I was not ready this Fall to go onto the job market, and had planned to stay in my current position for a third year (not unusual for my field). I had discussed this with my boss on at least two occasions in the Fall, both times he said that -  assuming they have funding for my position – I could stay a third year. I just recently found out that apparently they posted my job, and were interviewing several applicants. I immediately followed up, stating that I was confused given that I had been told that I would be able to stay a third year.  Long story short, they made me go through a competitive interview, which I thought was dumb, but I understand that there are HR rules they need to follow once a job has been posted.  However, I now heard through the grapevine that they are not sure whether they want to keep me because I “don’t seem to want to be here,” whatever that may mean.

Here is the thing (actually, a whole list of things):

1)     I have built up this project from the ground. I AM the person who is most familiar with it, and knows the ins and outs. Therefore, by definition, I am the most qualified person for this position. My mentor agrees – he wants me to stay on, has raved about my qualifications, and likes working with me.
2)     About two months ago, I received a glowing employee evaluation (by said boss), literally singing my praises. It felt somewhat manipulative (for a variety of reasons I don’t want to go in right now), but I have it in writing that I have performed at or above expectations. In there, I am described as “a wonderful employee,” as going above and beyond of what is asked of me, as kind, etc
3)     Out of concern that I may need it some day, I have been recording all of my conversations with my boss even before I took the current position (as an intern). This means that I have audio of him specifically stating that I could stay a third year, pending funding for my position. I also have it on tape that ultimately the decision would be up to my mentor as he’s the one who’s actually overseeing my work.

As far as I know, they will meet in the next few weeks to decide who to hire. Assuming that they decide against me, what are my options here? Are there any questions I should ask to get more information for their reasoning to potentially use that against him/the organization? Location is USA"

I have done 3 internship terms with a big well-known software company (not FANG)  (in the same team) so I can help pay my international tuition.

I wanted to try doing an internship at other companies to have more security when I graduate. I literally tried applying to every company that had open internship opportunities but for some reason, I did not even get an online assessment. I was silently rejected for most of my FANG applications (note: I had referrals for almost all of them). I tried the same for 2 consecutive Summers (2020 and 2021) but I got nothing but rejection.

I thought it could've been my resume and I got a couple of recruiter friends and co-workers to review it for me and they considered it was pretty solid and were confused why I am not able to get an internship with the experience and skills I have.

I tried my best to polish my technical interview skills but funny enough, I never even got an OA from any company.

I am writing this post with almost no hope left, totally confused, shattered and anxious about my future after graduation. I tried reaching out to a couple of recruiters about the same just to get some kind of insight into what could be causing it but not a surprise, they ghosted me.

I required a lot of hand holding . She also encouraged me always and provided honest feedback in nicest way about my shortcomings. It's been around 6-7 months since we spoke last (around the end of my internship). I feel like a jerk for not expressing my gratitude to her. I wanna thank her for investing so much of her time in my growth and putting up with me. Do you think it's too late? Also I'm so bad at keeping in touch with people.

Sure, I shouldve studied engineering. I take care of my mom whos a cancer survivor and a paranoid schizophrenic. I didnt grow up with my mom, I dropped out of college playing baseball to care for her after her house burned down my freshman year; no one thought Id ever come back to live with her. She was great, first black home coming queen, psychology graduate, then worked civil rights in the 70's (I believed in her and wanted to restore dignity that why I came back. I just ""knew"" Id be successful but didnt prepare for it). She developed schizophenia at a young age after that time. My father was drunk in the ghetto (not in my life) and sobered up a few years ago, now has stage four liver cancer. Its been a challenge to say the least. I always keep part time work, consulted, and moved furniture to make my money, but now that I'm out of college and ready for full time work. The problem is that I have bad credit and a couple of DUIs on my record (misdemeanors), last one in 2017. Terrible mistake, do the crime do the time. I do not pass like any background or credit checks. I look pretty good in the application process until then.

I mean, if I was hiring college graduates for banks or call centers, I would forgo the corporate liability of hiring someone convicted of a crime and defaulted credit accounts for someone clean as a whistle. Therefore, I understand why I cant get any kind of decent work. Not that factory isn't but this factory I'm preparing to go to requires ""7 days a week, 12 hours a day, for 90 days"", during the beginning, then it might be like 6 days or 5 sometimes. Heck, one call center job refuses to hire people with bad credit. I get it.

I find it unfortunate that i have ambition to work in the media business and it is pretty nonexistent in my KY town. What have I done to try to work in the media business or gain experience? I did an internship at an FM station, was a college radio FM DJ, and threw/throw shows at our local mall and university. I've gotten to a point that I am scared to leave my mom because I think she'll get back on drugs and her health will debilitate. I've been in foster care to the point that when I was like 13, I saw a white lady (I'm black man) at the mall and she was like ""hey do you remember me"". I was like, no, and she was like, ""I used to take care of you when you were a child."" What I can say is I've been very lucky to have great people in my life.

I know the Auschwitz' sign said, ""Work will set you free"" and I do believe that. I know it will be liberating to go. I guess I can't hold on to things that arent for me (like having a decent job that doesnt demand so much). I dont have kids or wife but do have a gf.; don't know if she's for me either, she's 11 years my senior. Good lady. Came into my life before I was ready. I wasn't ready to date until I had solved my money situation. Kinda hard to feel like a man without having money.

My biggest fear is that I'll change from this optimistic and pretty good person that I am and become very bitter after factory life kills my dreams. Also not being able to get out of the factory once I start. I mean, the only substantial experience I'll have is factory five years from now, so how could I move into another industry? Basically, asking, how will my life be affected by working so much and giving up on my career goals? Will I become a destitute and miserable person? I've considered doing some spiritual practices where I cast my soul into something so that I wouldnt be so full of spirit when I'm going to a factory work. Having a spirit seems pretty pointless when I'm placing screws on an assembly line conveyor belt for 80 hours a week."

Also did a 3mo internship at a small investment firm working on market data, which was mostly Python/Pandas. 

I’m at the point of planning where ideally I’d like to get an idea of realistic salary expectations in mind so I can set a budget for looking at places to relocate. Anyone with backgrounds similar to mine (PhD, lots of programming and ~1.5 years ML research) have any insights? Also is it commonplace to get up front sign on/relocation bonuses or anything like that? 

Also, on a practical side, how long would you recommend leaving to start applying? I would assume applying now is too soon for a September start, but of course want to give myself enough time to apply widely to make sure I can secure something suitable.

Finally, what sort of things would people recommend I focus on for interview prep? Current plan is to make sure I have a good grasp of the fundamentals behind ML, the different models, the jargon (explain bias-variance trade off) and can explain my research.

Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks!"

I am 1 7 years old, and I have been living in the USA for quite a while now on an H4 visa. I've recently got accepted into Purdue for comp sci. I know that Purdue has a lot of connections and many get internships as early as their first year which helps them to pay for tuition. I want to know if I can get paid internships on an H4 visa? Am I allowed to apply for EAD? My family and I are pretty sure we will get our green card in the next 3 years, but till then, Purdue is really expensive and on top of that if I can't get a paid internship, then it is even harder... So, would you recommend I go to my state school- University of Tennessee Knoxville- or is going to Purdue and it's expensive tuition worth it?

Please help me make the right decision,

Currently I am working at an online store in Denmark, and I want to find a new job, but I don't know how.

Let me tell you a little about me so that you know why I am struggling.

**My background:**

I am 24, studied at the faculty of humanities at my local university, and got a bachelor's degree. It was a bad choice and I regret not studying computer science, since I think I have more talent for programming. Too bad that I only realised my talent recently...

**How I got my current job:**

I was hired by this company to help translate their web site to a language I speak, but while working on that task, I noticed that I might as well just implement all the translations in the web site myself, instead of asking our developer to do that for me - this is how I slid into the dev team.

**My current job:**

Gradually I started to learn more and more about web development, and taught myself all the skills needed to work on the web site. But this company is pretty shady in many things. I don't have a job title or position, but I work full-time paid by hour (with a bad salary) as sort of an intern, but most of the day I spend coding and working with SEO. I have many other tasks as well too, which frustrates me to madness, since I want to be able to focus 100 % on web development and improve my skills. 

Another weird thing is that all the development is done by an outsourced developer in another country and me. He is a pretty bad developer, and the online store sucks in a million different ways. Since he worked for this company for many years before I joined, 80 % of the web site has been done by him. I merely develop new features, and sometimes I try to fix some of the mess that he created, but due to the complexity of the web site and the limited amount of time I have for developing at work, I am unable to fully take a grip on the web site.

Our online store is based on Magento 2, so I code in PHP, HTML, Less CSS, tiny bit of JavaScript and do Linux server maintenance every day. Basically I do the same work as any developer would. Recently I even started getting into React and Java to improve my programming skills. Everything I know about coding, I learned myself through trial and error at work, and self studying at home late into the night after work. Magento 2 is insanely complex, but somehow I am still able to do a lot of things and create modules without huge issues, though I need to underline that I still have to google almost everything I do, but I guess this is the nature of Magento 2... While working here I realised that I love coding and I would love to have a real career in the tech world.

I have been working at this company for a year now, and considering how weird this company is, and how I have the ambition and passion to become a real web developer it's time to move on.

**Where I would like to go from here:**

It would be a dream to get some kind of real junior web developer position, but in Denmark normally companies write in job ads that a computer science degree is required, as well as previous web development experience. This makes me pretty depressed, because I don't see why I should go and study for 5 years when I could just develop my current skills through practical work in the coming years.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think are my possibilities? Where could I go from here? How could I find a better paid job with the set of skills that I have? I am very afraid that my resume will forever be tainted by my non-IT education and ugly and dysfunctional web site of my current company. How can I escape from this? I strongly believe that I can do more and better, if given the chance to do so. I think that after a few months at a real web development agency, nobody would notice the difference between me and other junior developers."

Fall 2019 intake. Hoped to secure an internship sometime after my first year, which would've been super helpful as I don't have work experience. But then COVID-19 happened and the job market is in tatters now, just as my luck would have it.

With 2 and a half weeks remaining to secure an internship (prospects looking bleak at the moment), my family is asking me to consider doing a PhD, as I'd be graduating with a Master's degree in Summer 2021. 

The thing is, I went for my Master's right after my Bachelor's, and was looking to secure a full-time position in the US and make use of my OPT. This is exactly what I told my family too, as they've been asking me to do a PhD even before I started my MS but I wasn't interested at that point in time. But now with the present condition of the job market, I'm not sure whether I'd be able to get a full-time job without any prior US work experience, and thus I've started considering doing a PhD to weather the devastating impact caused by COVID-19.

I'm so confused at this point. What would be my best option?"

For the US/Canada/Europe/Japan

Try get approved in masters program -&gt; get scholarship -&gt; find work 

Try get approved in masters program -&gt; get debt -&gt; find work 

Try get entry level job directly (except Japan )

The thing is which option is more viable for my conditions? Any word of advice would be great ? And similar experiences as well! I’m giving preference to US and Japan bc my gf has access to those places !

It’s just that it’s so bland here.

Major cities cost a lot to live in, smaller cities cost less, but have less opportunities and things to do. Plus as someone going into IT, the second a city starts to become a tech hub tons of people move to it driving up the CoL. Plus with being black I have to do research on the amount of racism the city has rooted in it, I should’ve sued but there was a job that I was denied a management position because there were “too many black people”

Then there’s the work culture here that’s horrible, not Japan horrible, but I literally didn’t get a job after an internship in highschool because they had a super strict attendance forcing me to not be able to skip a day and I was super nauseous ONE morning and could barely move. They based an entire year of the internship off that one morning. Companies here have a “live to work” mindset  while paying you as little as they can.

Then there’s the lack of public transportation, can’t take a trip across the US without paying for an expensive flight or driving. Even then if I fly there’s barely any public transportation so I have to rent a car. 

School costs a kidney to attend so either way I’m doing my masters outside of the US. Then there’s the lack of good health care here which is bad as someone with developing issues.

It’s just stuff like that that fuses together into being this bad day to day experience that would take years to fix even if we’re on the path there. Especially with the work culture here. Looking at countries in Europe you’re required by law to have around 30 days of PTO, healthcare is free or affordable, and college is affordable, it’s just more tax you have to pay which I don’t mind.

I know I have to learn a new language, save up  about two or more years of expenses if I’m going to college there to get a work visa, and make sure I have all of my debt paid off. But that’s why I’m asking this now so I can get started ahead of time rather than wait last minute and probably not be able to realistically go."

The final class I have required is intro to software engineering which I am taking this semester (as well as mobile app development for the experience).

I feel like I barely know how to program at all.
The only languages I could say I have any comfort in are Java, C/C++, and SQL. We learned scheme as well but I dont know if theres really a practical use for it.


Besides for doing homework and solving problems, I have no real idea how to apply anything Ive learned. 

Im doing things like hackerrank problems to freshen up and test myself but even then I have no idea if what I’m doing would be useful in a job.

Ive started looking at internships and junior developer positions but I dont know how well Id do, I feel like I rely heavily on google to make even simple things work.

I have no motivation or ideas for any personal projects and just trudge along doing a few hacker rank or leetcode problems a day and i feel like I dont even have time as I work full time as well. 

How can I get over this feeling of incompetence and improve my programming?

edit: Thank you all for the comments, it has helped calm my mind a bit.

Reading all  of the requirements for even entry level jobs and internships, I was getting a bit worried that I wouldnt be able to find anything as I figured if they wanted someone who had experience developing, I wouldnt have a chance.

Your comments have reassured me, and I will start practicing more practical coding and find a project I can work on.

Thanks everyone!

I also don’t really have any friends unfortunately. I have old acquaintances that I keep in contact with over social media but I don’t hang out with people (besides my boyfriend who I live with). Unfortunately due to covid I had to move back home away from college and all of my old friends from home have moved on to different cities. I also failed to make friends in college because I have social anxiety. I spend so much time alone which is depressing me and I don’t know how to make friends here especially with covid.

Here are the differences!,delusionalkimchi,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/l4i5u7/uni_confused_about_nussmuntu_business_here_are/,"Hello once again!! It's the resident bored uni kid writing more articles for you guys. As business is consistently a very popular course of study, I have identified the various differences between the business schools in Singapore. Hope this helps you guys choose the business school that would be most appropriate for you.

I briefly researched about this topic when I was applying to university last year, and I'll try to include as many details as I can remember.

**CUT-OFF POINTS/IGP**

In terms of COP: NUS ~ 80, SMU ~ 77.5, NTU ~ 75. If you're the kind who is blinded by prestige alone, then I guess NUS would be a good choice for you. However, the other two universities do offer a good, if not better business education as well. Poly COPs/IGPs: NUS ~ 3.65, SMU ~ 3.66, NTU ~ 3.61. 

**DIFFERENCE IN MAJORS/SPECIALISATIONS**

In terms of majors/specialisations: NUS has about 7 different majors within the BBA degree, including the traditional ones like Finance, Marketing and newer ones like Business Economics and Business Analytics. NUS also has the luxury of being a huge school with other faculties, so if you want a second major in an unrelated discipline, (eg. Engineering/Real Estate/Chemistry) it would be viable as well. SMU has a variety of majors within the BBM degree as well, with some unique ones like Quantitative Finance and Sustainability. There are also a lot of double major/double degree combinations within SMU, but most tend to be quite business-oriented due to the emphasis that the school places on business education. NTU also has a number of majors/specialisations but in terms of variety it loses out to the other two schools. If I'm not wrong, I don't think you can do Business and another discipline of your choice, and even if you could, you had to apply for it specially. NTU does have some pretty unique specialisations like Actuarial Science which the other two don't offer. 

**SCHOOL CULTURE**

In terms of School Culture, NUS and NTU have strong hall cultures and a huge campus. If you're looking to stay in school, NUS and NTU should be the top two choices as hall stay is guaranteed in NTU, while there are choices of hall/residential college/student residences in NUS. SMU also has its own hostel near the campus, but its mainly for international students and the costs tend to be significantly higher than those of NUS and NTU. However, if you prefer a more accessible and central location and don't mind not having a hall life, SMU is definitely viable as it's located in the CBD and it's very close to numerous MNCs and big companies in the city.

**EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES**

In terms of Internship Opportunities: SMU tends to be the strongest in this and employment outcomes as well. I heard that many companies often hold seminars and career talks/fairs at SMU to attract the students there. SMU students have also been characterised to be strong public speakers who work very well in the corporate world. Hence, SMU tends to have the best employment outcomes among the three universities. Not to disparage NUS and NTU, the other two indeed offer equal internship opportunities too but the employment outcomes do tend to fall a little shorter than SMU. (Although I think NUS' employment outcomes is definitely comparable)

**DURATION OF STUDY**

In terms of duration of study: SMU allows students to graduate with a Bachelor of Business Management (BBM)(Hons) degree from 3.5 years onwards depending on how long you'll require. (3.5 if you are able to plan mods properly) NUS offers the traditional 4-year Bachelor of Business Administration - BBA (Hons) degree and NTU allows students to graduate with a Bachelor of Business Administration - BBA (Hons) degree in 3 years. This is the main drawing factor of NBS (Nanyang Business School) as career advancements could be attained more quickly as compared to your NUS/SMU peers. A double degree in Accountancy and Business can be obtained in 4 years under NBS while the same double degree in Accountancy and Business would take 4.5/5 years in SMU. 

I hope this clears some things up for you, I'll update if I remember more differences! Good luck!"

I hate staring at a computer for so long- classes, assignments, internships and college clubs are all online and it's driving me crazy. Before corona, I used to have a solid 1-hour commute to college and I got so much reading- from physical books that I borrowed from the library- done in that hour. Last march I genuinely thought this online crap was going to last 3 months max. While I'm still getting decent grades it's only because I work twice as hard and force myself to focus and I'm burning out. When I had actual books it was easier to tune out electronics, switch off notifs and get work done. But my college profs update through email and I'm always on my phone and my internship is virtual so I'm always typing stuff and spend  12-14 hours hunched in front of a screen. I don't want to whine too much because I know others have it worse but it'll be easier if I knew when the pandemic will end so ill have a particular date to look forward to."
l4lhzy,12,2021-01-25,CS summer internship chances?,onoonoononononono,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/l4lhzy/cs_summer_internship_chances/,"I'm awfully terrified that i will be unable to get an internship for summer break this year. I'm currently year 2 with an 'ok' gpa (~4).

The main reason that I think I can't find an internship is my lack of social skills. I am terrible at speaking to people and I have very bad anxiety especially during interviews. Because of this i also have no work experience, nor any leadership roles. I also don't have a CCA.

The only thing I have in my portfolio is perhaps my Orbital and CS2103t projects. But even those are not spectacular at all. (Merely meets the minimum requirements.)

I'm not sure if I even stand a chance at getting any internship. Are there usually alot of people competing for very few spots? What should my strategy be for selecting an internship to increase my chances of landing one?

If i don't get an internship this year it will likely mess up my study plan because of double major. Is there any recourse if i am unable to find an internship at the end of the application period? Will the school ensure that everyone who wants an internship can get one?"

How do I maintain work-life balance?,cat0229,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/l4m14e/im_struggling_to_set_boundaries_in_a_wfh_setup/,"I'm (21) on my third month in my first job as an analyst and working from home. My shift only requires me to work 8 hours a day (with 1 hour unpaid break) but I usually end up working 12 hours, sometimes after I've already clocked out. My one hour unpaid breaks always get interrupted with work and sometimes the only time my eyes leave my screen is when I have to use the bathroom. I really try my best to finish whatever tasks my manager gives me but sometimes I couldn't finish them on the same day/week. I'm on my third month but I honestly think I'm still struggling to do things quicker. Because of my guilt, I can't help but beat myself up and work outside working hours and Sundays unpaid. I've mindlessly thrown myself into a work-eat-work-cry to sleep cycle. I can feel this is worsening my anxiety; out of the 14 working days so far this year, I've had anxiety attacks for 8 days. The only time my mind gets to breathe is during Saturdays, I make sure to ignore any work-related messages and do what I want. But after that, I'm back to dreading my existence.

My manager and his boss recently expressed they were very happy with my performance so they offered to convert me into a full-time employee (I'm contractual). I accepted the offer since it pays pretty okay, the people I work with aren't toxic at all and looking for another job is hard for a fresh grad in a pandemic. While I'm relieved I won't have to job hunt again, I feel so depressed thinking about work. I'm feeling so lost, I don't know what to do to stop beating myself up.

Edit: I didn't expect to get a lot of responses. I really appreciate all the advice.

P.S.
-I'm not from the US. I also work the night shift.

-We do have overtime pay, I just have issues convincing myself it's okay to not get everything done.

-Yes, this is my first job fresh out of college. My internship was super chill so I didn't have a glimpse of the real corporate ""lifestyle"" prior to this.

-Again, thank you so much for the advice. I feel more enlightened."

l4ns62,4,2021-01-25,I feel like my notice period is hindering my job opportunities,muchaadore,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/l4ns62/i_feel_like_my_notice_period_is_hindering_my_job/,"Hi everyone! I hope you’re all having a great day/week, I really love reading this subreddit.

I’ve been struggling for a while with this issue, and really feel like I need objective/outside perspective advice.

I’m currently working my first job after university (I’m U.K. based), been here for a year and two months. My dream industry has always been book publishing. Last year, after graduating, I almost got hired at a publishing house multiple times after being shortlisted for an internship, but ultimately I was running out of money and couldn’t afford job hunting in such a competitive field with no certainties (my family lives abroad so I’m 100% independent), so I landed the job I am at now (which I was and still am extremely grateful for). My company is...not the best, nepotism is everywhere, I’m severely underpaid and I do a lot of extra jobs for free, but I do love my line manager and team (and I have a job!) so I still feel very lucky. However, my notice period (4 weeks + one week for every year I’ve been at the company, so 5) is starting to be a problem.

This past autumn, I started applying for publishing jobs again. Bare in mind each entry-level publishing role gets between 1,000 and 2,000 applications (I’ve been told this by multiple HR people in the field), so it’s insanely competitive. I still got interviews and almost got several roles, which I didn’t land ultimately because my notice period was too long. Plus, a lot of roles I apply to say they need someone to start ASAP (again, confirmed by HR publishing people), so my chances are hindered from the start. I had a third round of interviews last week for a role I love, but as soon as I got asked what my notice period is (they didn’t ask it before in the application process) I just felt my chances crumble (still waiting to hear back but I’m not too hopeful - plus they might still choose someone else based on their skills).

So here’s my dilemma. My notice period can be negotiated with a line manager according to the contract, but this is my first job so I’m not sure how this works. Would it be possible to shorten it by one, two or even three weeks? Has anyone here done that? 

I also considered saving up as much money as I can and quitting whenever I feel financially secure and can’t do my job anymore to focus on job hunting in publishing - which some of my friends said might be the best option. While this would allow me to be considered for more opportunities (including temp roles, which people who do well in interviews tend to get), it also feels so incredibly risky, especially during such a hard year for the job market where I’m blessed enough to have a job - which I don’t like, but it’s still a job.

What would you guys do? Should I just try and negotiate a reduced notice period when and if the time to change jobs comes (lying on job applications about how long it is), or should I quit at some point to pursue the career I’ve always wanted? I’m still quite young and new to the corporate life so I feel a bit lost."

Here is the forty-eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

Capstone research, internships, graduation, and post graduation career. Seeking advice!

Hello. I am a 21F Applied Computer Science major. I am due to graduate in May. I am caught up on my graduation requirements and just need to finish my Senior Capstone. 

Last night, I laid awake dreading the upcoming semester. My concerns are these:

My Capstone consists of coding an application, writing a research paper, and presenting it. I’m running into problems with the coding and am panicking over getting it done as this is what collects the data for my research. I’ve done Stackoverflow, GitHub, Geeks for Geeks, Violent Python, talked to my advisor, and such. I haven’t even started on my research paper. Should I set aside the coding and get started on the research?

I don’t know anything about what we need to do to graduate! I mean fees, degree applications, audits, and such. I emailed academic records and was informed I’d find out in March. I have this irrational fear that I’ll miss the applications and fee deadlines, that I’ll miss the opportunity to send out the invites and such. It’s irrational since these things haven’t even been announced yet. 

I had to let my internship supervisor know that I didn’t work on my project (installing and testing honeypots) in lieu of working on the Capstone. She understood and has given me a week extension. I’m grateful, but I still feel bad!

I am not going to grad school (gap year) and instead plan on working. My advisor has sent out applications to do research at other universities over the summer. These projects include some stipends. Research is my dream career, but I also want to start a full time job so I can start saving for when it’s time to start paying off my student loans. I feel like I should prioritize getting the full time job, but I also feel like the summer research projects would be beneficial in the long run! 

These are my main concerns. I don’t plan on dropping my internship or changing my Capstone (I’ve been working on the internship for a month and the Capstone for six months). I feel like a lot of this is irrational and don’t know why I feel like this. I’d really like some advice on how to handle these issues."

As you can see, I dont have much (any) professional experience and I dont know how to approach this difficult situation.

As part of my degree, I need to do a 6 month internship.

I got an offer from Company A that was one of my backups. I put off replying to accept or reject by asking more questions about the position, on the 19th they sent me a somewhat passive-aggressive email asking me if I want this internship. Thinking they might withdraw the offer, I accepted the internship through email. This agreement has not been formalised in any way (no contract yet), but now I am able to view some of the organisation's files and they also put me in touch with the intern who I will replace. (Another thing that is making this difficult is that this organisation is closely linked with my faculty, making me scared to get a bad reputation with my professors)

Today, I received an offer from Company B that is better for my career development in every way, including a small financial compensation (which I really appreciate given my current financial situation).

Both internships start in the first of february.

I really want to withdraw my informal acceptance and work in Company B, and want to do this as soon as possible, but have no idea how to best do this, given how late I am informing them and that I already accepted it. This is making me feel terrible as I know I am doing something immoral if I reject the first one now, since it might be very difficult to hire someone less than a week away from the start date.

I would really appreciate advice regarding how to do this, and if it is smart to do this at all. I can provide any other details that you think are relevant when deciding how to move forward."

I am a dual citizen, one US and the other a European ally. No criminal history, traffic charges, fired from a job, debt, or drug use at all.

It is in my exact field of study and looks very exciting. I would be working in a brand new, exciting division and they will help cover housing on top of regular pay. The company is very well known. 

The second offer I got was from a mid sized private company, also a summer internship. The pay will likely be the same. It is also in my exact field and does not require security clearance. However, it looks far less exciting and does not have nearly the same name recognition as the large defense company. 

I am also still interviewing at several other companies. 

I am concerned that my dual citizenship may cause delay or even denial in getting my clearence. Browsing clearance subreddits, people seem to have mixed results in getting clearance with dual citizenship. My internship with the defense contractor is contingent on me getting clearance once I have accepted the offer. If I accept the defense job and I am denied clearance, I may be left without any internship for the summer. I posed these questions to my defense recruiter, and told them Im a dual, but they were somewhat vague and said they couldnt speak for what the government might think.  

What should I do? Do I roll the dice for a more exciting internship? What are my odds? Or do I go with the safe offer?"

Sadly I haven't got much luck and I am not confident in my abilities in the field. Even during college, I didn't have many projects or internships I can put in my resume. Last month I got an offer from Revature and they are training us for Salesforce Developer. They would help us get two certifications- developer and administrator, 4 projects along with the regular contract terms of two years and minimum wage until we are put on a project.

I have read about Revature here and though not a big fan, it seems decent. What bothers me is whether training as Salesforce Developer helps me in my career. At the time of the interview, I thought the position would be a full-stack Java Developer but turns out it's not. I am not that much interested in this technology and if they provide me any other curriculum I would probably join it. But before making a decision I wanted to take advice from here. Thanks in Advance."

Aside from me stating the usual (gaining experience in a certain hardware or programming language, possibility for full time hire etc.), the interviewer said there were more options, like having something to show for(presentation or journal paper). I had no idea that a whole paper could be a possibility for an internship! 

Afterwards, I was given interview feedback to really think of good reasons for next time. Im at a loss, what else could a student possibly want from an internship?"

I am very stressed at the moment to wait for the results and have always loved some external opinions

- ETH Zurich MS data Science
- UCL MS machine Learning
- NYU MS data Science
- UC Berkeley MS/Phd computer Science
- Imperial College London MS computing

I am an undergrad in Economics and Computer Science from a high ranked university in Italy. My gpa at the time of the application was 3.89/4. Exams were computationally oriented and I did courses in maths stats CS and ML as well as Economics courses. Work experience at a top UK bank both spring and summer internship. 

LoRs are two supposedly good and one really basic but from the course director.

SoP/ personal history drafted and redrafted explaining my personal goals for the future and the motivation to do research in an academic environment.

No research experience, only a thesis planned which might get to a publication but not mentioned in this way in the docs obviously.

A couple data Science projects on GitHub, one on Covid 19 Italian data and one on two heart diseases datasets, pretty big and accurate with analysis and theory. Other random stuff on GitHub. 

(Plus) Three/ four volunteering experiences with the Red Cross, rugby, and my municipality for Covid. 
One prize from my municipality for the help given.

Any help is much appreciated; fingers crossed for everyone!"

Just looking for some advice from anyone that has recently graduated or just any advice on different directions I could take.

Basically, last semester I was a Sophomore in college and was offered an internship at $15 an hour at 40 hours per week. However, the internship was located about 45 minutes away. I reluctantly accepted, however Covid got the internship cancelled before I could even start.

I am currently in my Junior year of college and have been offered that same internship, (same position and everything) however this time they lowered the pay to $12 an hour for reasons I am unaware of. I just sent them an email attempting to negotiate for higher pay and am waiting to hear back from them.

I don't think I have time to find another internship at this point, and I have no CS work experience so finding a better offer at this time will prove difficult. I have enough money saved to be able to live off of the $12 an hour, its just not an ideal situation.

Do you think I should accept this offer even though the pay is pretty low and the commute time is high? Is it that important for me to get an internship in order for me to get a job when I graduate? Any other opinions or experiences would be greatly appreciated as this is a massive decision for me. Thank you!"

Let me give you a bit of backstory. While I was in college/university, studying IT as a minor, an internship presented itself. A local insurance company set up a classroom and put college kids to work doing QA testing for their software. I initially applied and took the job because it was making almost $3 more than my retail job. I ended up falling in love! It was amazing to be able to find defects and retest, etc. I didn’t get to stay more than five months, due to the fact I dropped to a part time student for my last semester (and they only used full time students). 

I ended up having to go back to my retail job. 

That was just over six years ago. Where I live there are not many QA jobs, or they are all internally posted. I’ve applied to many of them, but since I only did it for a few months previously, I don’t get replies. 

I was an IT minor as I mentioned before. I am quite tech savvy. I stink at networking, but I’m decent at basic coding or reading/modifying code, and took a masters level class on SQL. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I don’t think I have enough courage to relocate. I thought about doing online testing jobs like uTest, but you are literally paid so little for such tedious work. Does anyone have any suggestions at all? I was about to take one of those MicroMasters courses in QA from the University of Maryland Global Program, but then they discontinued it. 

Any help would be great!"

Recently I saw this bootcamp for golang, which offers 1.2k allowance per month for 8 months, 4 months course and 4 months internship.

At the same time, a recruiter contacted me for an automation tester role. I passed the 3 technical interviews and only left with the interview with HR and director. From what I heard from the recruiter, they're offering  around 65k pa. 

So now I'm kinda split between the 2 choices. I kinda like the idea of becoming a software developer, and creating my own applications but the money is also a factor. I couldn't guarantee that I will get the same pay as what the new company is currently offering.

I was in school for computer science up until my senior year where life circumstances forced me to become an online student. The problem though was my school didn't offer computer science through their online program. They did however offer Information Technology with a focus in programming. It was an easy transfer and wouldn't cost me any time so I did it. I never did an internship mainly because I was taking 24 credit hours each of my last two semesters and was pretty busy with that and work.

It feels like most jobs I apply to I don't really feel qualified for and I usually don't hear back from them anyways. The only places I have heard from are the likes of Revature or TCS that which I really don't want to do but figured they were always hiring so I could probably wait a bit on those.

I'm not desperate for the job right out the gate so I have been taking some courses on Coursera/edX mainly to keep busy and continue learning while I look but again I have no Idea what positions I should be seeking right now and just feel lost in general with what to do. I feel like a have a strong understanding of OOP through java and python but most jobs I see have a ton of requirements I never learned.

Any advice would be appreciated."

I don’t know where to start. My family has always been kind of broken. My mother is really abusive and I know there is nothing I can do about it. Right after I was born my mother gave me to my grandparents in Ghana to look after me. My brother was there with me too. I don’t really remember much about that time but I know that there was a nanny that looked after me. At the age of 4 my mother came to Ghana and brought me and back with her to Germany because my brother got diabetes. 

After that I lived with my mother and my stepdad ( let’s call him stepdad number 2) in a house in a small village in Germany for two years. I don’t remember a lot about that time either but I remember that my mother would always beat me and my brother when we refused to call him father. She would literally force us to pretend like he’s our real father. I remember clearly when it was holidays for example Christmas my mother would give me to one of her friends to look after me so I can spend Christmas with them. I would be spending Christmas at a strangers house while they were spending Christmas together and having a good time and as soon as I got home and asked her if Santa got me anything she would tell me that he was there but because I wasn’t there I didn’t get anything.

 After those two years my mother let a german Foster mother look after me for 7 years. My mother moved without stepdad number two to a far away City (like 6 hours away) to work and stepdad number two was still in the small village taking care of my brother. Btw besides my brother who is 10 years older then me I have three sisters. One is 22 years older then me the other ones are twins and are 20 years older then me. Living with my foster mother was kind of okay. I visited my mother every other school break. My Forster mother was an elderly woman so it’s basically common knowledge that she was kind of racist and the whole family was kind of racist besides her husband he was the nicest person. But I think you can imagine getting called all types of racist jokes all the time. Not that but my elementary school was racist as well. My first grade teacher was trying to force me into a school for children with special needs or a learning disability, which she did with all non german students, until my siblings came to school and exposed her racism. After that the school was trying to proof how not racist they are but that’s another story. After that I got into a different class our my new teacher was a literally tyrant. That teacher would literally scream at students, beat then take their backpack and empty it out the window. There was even a new student who was bullied at his old school this teacher literally encouraged everyone to keep bullying him. I heard that he got kickoff the school but I’m not sure. But elementary school was really terrible especially on school events when everyone showed up with their family and I was all alone. 

After elementary school was over and I got into fifth grade my mother got into a big fight with my foster mother over money which caused her to kick me out without a warning. Because of that I was forced to live with stepdad number 2 and my brother. What I haven’t mentioned stepdad number two was back then 80 something and now he’s 90 something. My old Forster mother started to trash talk my family and I for no reason. I should have mentioned earlier that my Forster mother was a big tattletale she could talk shit about anyone. She didn’t care if it was true or not she just loved to talk trash for no reason. One time when my brother was 16 or something she went up to his girlfriends parents to talk trash about him even though she didn’t know him, his girlfriend or her parents at all. She did all that just to talk trash. She even called all of my best friends house &amp; parents to talk trash but they hung up on her. She even screamed at my best friends mom because she didn’t want her to hang out with me. And months later she showed up at my bus stop before school and asked me why I was ignoring her. But after a few moths she started to leave me alone. 

Living with my stepdad and my brother was where my mental health started to decline it was bad or anything but it wasn’t great either. My brother was never at home. He was always on the run or with his girlfriend. My stepdad and I didn’t like each other at all he was constantly screaming at me and I was constantly screaming at him. He was rude to my friends and was a flat out mean spirited person but he got better after time and I slowly started to get used to it. I mean it’s understandable that he’s mean spirited. He lived alone there in his big house where he was trying to live with my mother and she isn’t even there and is always making wrong promises about coming back soon. I was only there for a year until my mother told me to switch schools and move to my oldest sister house. My stepdad was crying about me leaving but my cousin called my mother really angry and asked how my mother would let me live with this elderly old man who could rape me any time. But my cousin was right. 

After that I moved in with my sister and her family. My sister has two sons. One is two years older then me the other one was two years younger then me. Living with her was still okay. Living there felt like I was a parasite. Her husband hated me and he made sure to let me know by constantly insulting me and making me feel unwanted. My sister obviously didn’t want me there either she would always scream at me about how it was my fault that she has high blood pressure because I’m stressing her out so much and about how happy she is that she’s going to kick me out. They were doing family activities without me or cuddle together as a family and I wasn’t invited. Or when they had a Christmas baking at other relatives houses and didn’t invite me because I didn’t belong to the family. The new school was terrible too. I literally had no friends at all. They were all really mean and ignored me for no reason for the fist year at that school. I started making friends in other classes so I wouldn’t be alone all the time. It took me months to make new friends in my class and I only befriended her because she was bullied by other girls in class because they thought her boyfriend was to handsome for her. After that year I spent my summer break at one of the twins houses let’s call her (Twin A) and went on a holiday with them. It was the first time I went on a family holiday and it was really nice. I really felt welcomed and my sister talked about having me live with her and how great it would be if I lived with her. But the most important thing that I remembered about this trip with them is that my sister when my sister accidentally said that Twin B was her favorite sibling and apologized right after and said that she loved me too. I know this sounds stupid but as a 13 year old this made me really happy. This was the first time anybody ever told me that they loved me. After that I was really excited to live with Twin A but shortly after I realized that that wasn’t going to happen. I heard my oldest sibling say on the phone that it wasn’t their job to take care of me that my mother is supposed to take care of me and that my sister should not take care of me. After that I started living with my stepdad again. After that I started living with my stepdad again. I didn’t see my siblings a lot after I moved back with my stepdad. I only saw them once a year on Christmas (when they remembered to invite me. Which they forgot really often but not as much they forget to invite me to family activity or birthdays. Or when they forget to call me on my birthday). 

After that my life basically went downhill. Living with my stepdad father again was terrible. He was depressed and constantly was constantly venting to me about how terrible his life is and how he didn’t imagine to die like this. When I wanted to spend New Years with my friends he would always make me feel bad for it and tell say “how could you leave me alone.” My brother was barely there. Then he started making sexual advances at me. He constantly kissed me and told me I could hang out with my friends if I kissed him. But when I got older and realized it was not okay I started to say no and he stayed away but he still looked and me with those disgusting eyes. He still constantly asks me inappropriate things but I stayed away. I haven’t told that anyone. Spending school breaks with my mother was terrible too. She would constantly beat the crap out of me and insult me. And she constantly brought disgusting men home. One of those men sexually harassed me and I told her but she laughed at me and didn’t believe me. After that I started to look for excuses why I couldn’t visit her such as work, internships, school, exams and more. One time my mother decided to spend Christmas at home and it was by far the worst Christmas ever. My brother broke up with his girlfriend of 10 years and started a new relationship with a woman who was 10 years older then him and my mother was furious. My brother wanted to introduce is girlfriend to us because she wanted to get to know her but my mother lost it and ruined everything. After that my brother left my my mother was still insulting him and I defended him and told her that her behavior was wrong. She started beating be and attacked me with scissors and cut my hair off. She also told me that I ruined her life and because of me stepdad number 1 killed himself. I told my siblings what she told me and they said that it wasn’t my fault and told me the whole story.

Way back before I was even born my siblings had another stepdad. Btw each of my siblings besides the twins have a different dad. He was taking care of my siblings the same way my stepdad was taking care of me while my mother was doing her own thing somewhere else. He was like a real father to my siblings especially to my brother. My mother made him sign me and my brothers birth certificate even though he was obviously not our father. And she made him adopt all of my other siblings. She was barely there and took all of his money. And when my father came around she basically made him sleep on the couch while she was in mad with my father. After that she had me to keep my father but still had stepdad 1 sign the birth certificate. It wasn’t long until she kicked him out the house and when my siblings where trying to go see him she lost it and beat them up. A few moths later he jumped in front of a train. But for some reason my mother was trying to tell me he killed himself because I turned out to be fully black to lightskin. After he died my mother blamed my siblings for his death and beat them really bad. It was so mad my three oldest siblings ran off and my brother begged my grandparents to move back to Ghana. 

Through all these years I started to gain weight drastically. And I stopped going regularly to school and my grades really dropped. My all of my siblings besides my oldest because she was a little but plus size too started to harass me because of my weight gain and my brother started to constantly bully me because my room wasn’t tidy. My grades were so bad that my teacher wanted to talk to my parents. 

Before I tell you how it went on I have to explain something about my friends back then. My best friends where the same four girls who were friends with me in elementary school because I kind of kept us together even though we weren’t in the same school. But in my school I was friends with people from other classes and I was actually cool with everyone in my class but I was only best friends with two of them. One switched schools because she was bullied at her old one but she was friends with everyone especially me and the other one was basically bullied in her friends group so we got her out of him and I was really best friends with her. She was shy but I was trying to bust up her confidence and I was trying to help her be more friends with people on school by getting Facebook. For some reason she stared gaining thousands of Facebook friends trough Facebook groups and thousands of like so peat school started to talk bad about her and I warned her how it wasn’t healthy for her and that people are talking about her and the Facebook popularity wasn’t real life. I wasn’t in school for a few days when I suddenly stared to get treats by all of my classmates. They were insulting me and were mad at me and I had no idea why. I found out that my so called best friend started to talk trash about me in the whole class which caused everyone to be mad at me and everybody stopped talking to me. She did all that to gain popularity from girls who didn’t even like her. And after her 15 minutes of fame were over and the other friend apologized for treating me badly she started to tell everyone that I hit her to get the attention again. But then when nobody cared anymore about her crap and she realized that no one liked her anymore she tried kissing up on me again but I cut her off. I actually stopped talking to everybody in my class besides the boys. I just couldn’t believe that they would back stab me that easily just because somebody lied about me. After that I had a really hard time to make friends because I didn’t trust anybody anymore. 

Because my grades where so bad and I stopped going to school. I had to stay longer in school with everybody else and couldn’t start training for a job. Because I didn’t want to spend the summer break with my mother I signed myself up with the help of my sister for a treatment place ( I don’t know what’s it called in English) to lose weight. I wasn’t overly obese or anything but I was plus size. The place wasn’t only there to lose weight but it was also there for people with psychological problems. I met there gate friend who I could talk to about anything they understood me and I was really happy there. 

When I got back home my mother refused to talk to me because I only lost 10 kg. But school was going great I was starting to do sports again and had really good grades because I was focused again. I still wasn’t friends with my classmates because I still hated them for backstabbing me and the friends that I had in other classes weren’t there anymore because they started to work but life was going good. My friend from the other class convinced me to talk to my other classmates again so I wouldn’t be alone so I did. But I cut them all off right after I graduated. 

My grades where so good that my teacher convinced me to keep doing school so I can go to university. And I did but after graduating I got back into the old rut with my depressed stepdad and abusive mother. I started gaining weight again and started to procrastinate. My stepdad got weak and I had to take care of him while going to school and working.

One thing happened I haven’t told that anyone either but once my stepdad was having a depressed day and was crying about how terrible live is. I was trying to cheer him up but then he tried getting close to me in a disgusting way. And I left and went to bed. He went to his bed straight after in the middle of the night he fell on the floor. I heard how he fell on the floor and called many name multiple times because he couldn’t get up by himself but I was so mad that I plugged my headphones in and went to sleep until the next morning where I realized that he was bleed on the head when he fell. I called the ambulance straight after and he almost stopped breathing because I was being petty. I still can’t forgive myself for that.

I started to stop cleaning my house and staying home most of the time. And even if I wanted to go out I couldn’t because there was always the possibility that something could happen to my stepdad. He wasn’t even eating when I wasn’t there and he forgot somethings. And my siblings only blamed me if something wasn’t going right. 
The relationship with my siblings went really downhill. I barely had any relationship with them but the twins were constantly bullying me because of my weight and told me how no one is going to love me in future and how I’m going to die alone if I don’t lose weight and how I could just kill myself if cared that little about my life. My brother was saying to how I’m not going to find a job when I’m overweight because I not going to fit into a work team because they don’t want anyone overweight. I mean I was used to my mother calling me unloveable and ugly and everything but my siblings were even worst. Once at the birthday of my 4 year old nephew my brother brought a picture of my room out and told everybody how nasty and dirty I am. And the whole family started talking town on my until I cried and locked myself up in the toilet. 

After that I stopped talking to my family for a year until twin A got pregnant and I congratulated her. I stopped showing up on family events because I was scared that they would all talk down on me I even started to spend Christmas with my other friends. 

My stepdads health got so bad that my mother had to come back and take care of him. She started to let her frustrations out on me. One time my stepdad made one of those disgusting advances again he said „can I lick your p****“ and I was so disgusted that I decided to tell my mother and she told me to wait until he dies.

On my birthday which she forgot she got early in my room to tell me to go shopping for her and I told her hat I couldn’t because I had school and when I got home she refused to give me food because I didn’t go shopping for her. And told her that I couldn’t believe that she would treat me like this on my birthday she told me:“I don’t give a **** that it’s your birthday.“ and then she kicked me out the house. My friend picked me up but he made the day even worst by telling me how dependent I am from my mother and how I should be more independent and finally finish my driver’s license knowing well that I have to pay everything myself and that he got everything payed for him. ( he was probably in a bad mood because of his homophobic family and the pressure his family puts on him to have better grades. Sometimes he leaves his anger out on me but at this moments it was uncalled for)


And now I am a university student but can’t study, I lay depressed in bed 24/7. barely move out of bed. Only when I have to go to the bathroom and sometimes to eat. And all the money I had saved up to move out is gone because of COVID my mother wasn’t able to work and buy food for my stepdad and her so I had to give her something.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do I can’t get anything done. I literally have problems with leaving the house so I mostly order food. I’m literally in bed all day and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to motivate myself to stand up. My mother and my stepdad aren’t here I’m most of the time alone in this house. And I don’t know what to do."
l56xai,107,2021-01-26,georgia tech + emory + uga from someone in atlanta :~),sluttyalgore,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/l56xai/georgia_tech_emory_uga_from_someone_in_atlanta/,"I've seen a bunch of people do these for their respective city/state/whatever, but haven't seen GA quite yet!! Don't take this too seriously lol, but since tech decisions just came out, maybe this will be helpful for y'all. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to answer :)

**background:**

* I'm a senior, and I've lived in Atlanta for \~3 years. Before that, I was in a suburb of here for 10 years or something.
* I'm about 3 miles either direction from tech and emory, and I've spent lots of time in Athens. I have friends at all of these schools, so this is a bit of their perspective and a bit of mine.

**general stuff to know about the south:**

* It's not all conservative. I know this sub leans left and that lots of you are afraid about the whole state being Trump country, but it's definitely not. Atlanta is a very liberal city (only neighborhood where this may be untrue are in Buckhead/nowhere near tech or emory), and you'll find that most people are at least somewhat interested in politics because of our history in the civil rights movement and even more recent stuff like our Senate runoff races.
* The weather is *weird.* I know everyone says this about where they're from, but I swear it's fact in GA. The low this week is 25F and the high is near 70, with rain almost every other day. You can't predict the weather here and rain during sunny days is common (some people here say that's ""when the devil is beating his wife""). The humidity is bad. It's sticky. It's hot. And some people love it.
* You better be polite. If you meet someone's parents here, especially if they've lived in the South for a long time, it's ""yes ma'am"" and ""yes sir."" Please and thank yous are big here, and no one wants to put up with a shit attitude. And, honestly, Southern hospitality is real. I've lived in the Midwest as well and spent lots of time up there, and I really think we beat them in niceness down here.
* It's very hard to see outside your city (Athens or Atl) without a car. I'm not saying it's necessary to have a car at any of these three schools, but if you ever wanna explore outside city limits, it's pretty difficult. Atlanta has lots of commuters and lots of highways, so expect lots of traffic and a shitty public transport situation.
* Food! Sweet tea is the default if you order tea here. Chick fil a is the most popular fast food, regardless of how problematic the company can be. Barbecue is best outside Atlanta, but there's a very real hot chicken craze here. Cookout is best for late night food, and you're gonna look weird if you suggest Burger King or something over it.
* So much to do here! There's always (not in Covid-times, but oh well) concerts, museums, and just a lot going on. I'm not gonna stay in state for college, but Georgia is a really great and really special place.

**tech:**

* The kids are smart. And hella burnt out. Most people I know that end up here end up for 5-6 years, and I don't blame them! It's a very hard school, and lots of people get their asses kicked in the first two years.
* The campus is pretty nice. It's not insanely beautiful and not insanely ugly, but there are some cool older dorms. To be honest, I haven't spent a ton of time on campus, but I've worked in Midtown (near tech square) and West Midtown (lots of upperclassmen living off campus and some rando engineering buildings). It's cool. Atlanta is fun, especially if you're not from here.
* Safety concerns: most crime going on around Tech is pretty universal for all of Atlanta. Car break ins and the occasional bout of drag racing. The most dangerous area to be late at night is closer to Georgia State, in South Atlanta, or near Ponce/Boulevard. Tech really doesn't reach any of these areas besides \*maybe\* some kids housing off campus, so just stay alert and don't leave shit in your car blah blah blah
* There's a very real sense of superiority from engineering kids to people in business, psych, and other less STEM-y majors. There's also some bad blood between pre-med and engineering kids but it's all in good fun. Y'all are all smart, I promise!
* So many fucking clubs. Everyone I know that goes/has gone there has either studied abroad, been super involved in an academic competition, or some other equivalent. Students are very involved and despite it being competitive, I've only heard great things overall.

**emory:**

* Ok unpopular opinion but Emory is ugly lmfao. There's one big and pretty courtyard with a big classic university-style building but I just don't like the campus. The buildings seem like... oddly West coast for a school in Decatur, Georgia, and it's just a weird setup.
* That being said... there's a lot to do in Decatur and there's a pretty central MARTA station to take you into Midtown and other neighborhoods. The buses in Atlanta are pretty bad but the train system is good. Lots of food, lots of music, and lots of parks. There are some really pretty trails nearby that always have dogs and fun stuff going on. Emory is ugly, but Decatur is cute.
* Honestly not a ton of locals go to Emory. There's certainly *some,* but compared to the public schools, you're gonna find a lot less Atlanta + GA natives. This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing, just something to keep in mind! It's more racially diverse than lots of comparable schools so that's definitely a positive !
* Sports culture is pretty much nonexistent. I couldn't even tell you if there's a football team (is there?)... but there's some stuff like tennis, and I know that lots of people are active in ultimate frisbee and stuff like that.
* Speaking of frisbee... people here are more liberal than pretty much any other school in the city besides SCAD. Lots of random, Elizabeth Warren-esque interests and infographic posters lmao
* Honestly I'm still not sure why people go to Emory but that's just because I'm from here. It's kind of a random school and while there's certainly great staff and students, it seems so far removed from Atlanta life sometimes lol.
* Great medical school, though! I'm not a premed person, but this seems like a good place for that lol

**uga:**

* It's a classic SEC school. Football and greek life are more dominant here than anywhere else in the state. Lots of preppy guys, lots of hot bitches. It is what it is, and though it's not super diverse, there are endless ways to meet people because of the school's size.
* Like tech, just hella clubs. You can be as studious or as close-to-failing as you want here, so just do what you want with that lol.
* The freshman dorms are gross and super small. You're paying for a true college experience, not something luxurious here for sure. You have to live on campus and at times you'll hate it but it's fun! hopefully lol
* I applied here idk why I'm bagging on it there's some really great programs you just really have to seek out opportunities here if you want to go to grad school or find internships or anything. It's a really big school, which I'm sure you know if you applied, so you just have to try a little harder to find some career related stuff.
* Athens is a true college town, but there's still basic stuff you'd find in a suburb. There's a target there is what I'm hinting at unlike at GCSU &lt;3"

I've always been sure I want to go into academia, since I strongly enjoy research, but I recently read a [a super useful document all about CS PhD's](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) by a Prof. from Carnegie Mellon where she says if you're not 100% certain that you want to invest like 6 years of your life into getting a PhD, it's always advisable to work in a research lab for maybe around 2 years (also added bonus you get to earn some money for yourself) just to make sure that long-term research really is what you want to do. However, I don't really know what she means by research labs, since those big labs like AT&amp;T Bell don't seem to exist anymore. What kinds of research labs can someone like me be looking at? I have a good amount of research experience in my CV, however I've never done a single internship (because I chose to spend my summers doing research with Professors) and I don't know if not having interned at a research lab will negatively affect my chances.

Don’t know if this is just me venting or genuinely seeking advice, but I feel the need to communicate this to people outside of my direct family, so please read if you’ve got the time or have been in a similar situation to me. Sorry if this is really long.

The past three years of my life have been dedicated to bringing back my GPA from a huge pit that I somewhat dug myself. I was going through some pretty intense mental anguish for the first year and a half of college, and my GPA sat around a 1.7. I know everyone deals with issues so I’m not looking for any consolation or going to act like my poor grades weren’t my fault, it’s just that at the time, school was not even close to being top of the list of my priorities. As a result, I was also not able to get into any meaningful extracurriculars since my university is very competitive and the whole process is treated like a normal job application for orgs (which again, due to my GPA, meant I got into none). 

I am still dealing with these issues, but have managed to get my grades up to a consistent 3.9-4.0 for the past 4 semesters, and I am incredibly proud of myself even if others don’t necessarily see what’s behind the scenes. Believe me it was not easy. I also got two fantastic internships which I managed to bag due to some resume trickery, Linkedin magic, and dumb luck in which they didn’t ask me for my transcripts to check my grade. Yes, I know this isn’t the most morally correct thing to do, but I felt as though my grades were truly stopping me from being able to reach my potential as an employee. I excelled at both locations, one being the asset management division of a pretty large bank, the other a MM consulting firm, both based in NY.

This brings me to the present day. I was put into an extremely shitty situation at my most recent position (the MM consulting firm), a role that neither I nor any of the other interns in my class was retained for despite the fact we took extensions into the fall from the summer concurrent with packed course schedules due to the limitations of COVID. This was especially tragic because the whole time they had dangled carrots in front of our faces, ensuring us that the full time offers were on the horizon. I would have applied to other positions but again I have an apprehensiveness to going through standard procedure when it comes to applications due to my GPA.

Now keep all of this in mind while I’m applying to positions starting this year. My GPA, despite being leagues better than it was freshman year, sits at a 3.3. I’m still paying for the sins of my 18 year old self, despite the fact those courses were unbelievably irrelevant to the direction of my career and I am a much more capable individual now with much more experience. The very informal nature of how I got pushed through HR to these amazing positions these past summers no longer exists due to the fact that less people are hiring and full time offers are much more standardized. I’m now pretty depressed and don’t really see a path forward. My advisors tell me that companies will see that I surmounted an initial deficit that I can explain and prove wrong in interviews, but I don’t even make it to the interview stage due to my GPA. I’ve made excellent connections with upper management in some of my target firms only to be written off in a matter of minutes by someone in campus recruiting. My parents now think I should switch career paths, but I don’t want to. I want a job in financial services more than anything, and feel as though I’d be a valuable asset but am blocked from proving it. 

Sorry if this comes across as me whining or self-pitying. I know there are a lot worse situations to be in. But I’ve sent probably upwards of 100 applications at this point. I want to remain headstrong since I’ve heard stories of people sending 250 applications. But when I haven’t had a single interview at a firm that I’ve actually wanted to work at, it’s easier said than done. I guess again, to reiterate, has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you get the fire lit under you or get a position that was indicative of your true value?Thanks for taking the time to read if you made it this far."

I have heard from many that CE equals computer science and electrical engineering combined but I was wondering if anyone could help clarify this?

  (A big reason why I am asking this is because during an interview for a software engineering internship which only focused on coding, I was asked why i am CE and not a CS major. This was after I answered a few questions regarding my experience in coding since I has only just started taking a class on embedded systems.)"
l58emq,1,2021-01-26,Potential Internship Scam Help,iwannakri,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l58emq/potential_internship_scam_help/,"I'm currently a junior in college and was contacted with an offer for an Accounting Internship in this really small firm. There was not much information/reviews online about this firm, but I was desperate for an internship so I went through with the ""interview"" (through text) and the next day I was called saying I got the position. 

However, things started to get suspicious when they sent me some forms to fill out before working. The domain they sent the forms from was different from the one on their website. Also on their social medias, they said to not trust anyone with a different domain, and that they only had one. I was a little skeptical because of this, but didn't question it yet. 

He told me that I needed a Macbook Pro 2019, and that the company would pay for it. He sent me a check through email and told me to deposit it, but when I did, the funds say they aren't going to settle until next week. He asked me if I can pay out of my own pocket for it for now since the funds were settling. I was to pay through zelle to his ""vendor"" which was suspicious to me too. This is where I asked if I can call his business's number because apparently, someone had tried to impersonate him before. He got pretty offended and questioned why I would need to do that since he already sent me a check and I deposited it.

Because of that, I panicked since it looked like I was going to lose the position, so I ended up paying the money for the Macbook through zelle out of my own pockets... (yea i'm dumb). He told me how it will ship out in a day since the vendor is only a state away, which made sense, but he never sent it (I'm assuming because it's the weekend). Now he's asking if I have a printer, copier, and scanner, which I replied saying I only had a printer. Now he wants me to buy a copier and scanner along with the Macbook through the vendor too. 

Honestly, I'm getting sick of all these requests and just want my money back. Do you think it's a good idea to ask for the money back if it's even possible? Should I just take the loss and move on? Should I continue with the offer? I left a few bits of information out, but any thoughts would be much appreciated.

Also, I called my bank to get some advice there as well, and they said I should be careful about checks, because apparently they can be reverted for various reasons. They advised me to wait a few days after the funds have settled before doing anything with the money."

i hope all of you are doing well in corona times i know its though at the moment. 

For the past two years i feel like im in an existancial crisis and i came here to maybe find someone who can share some Tricks or Tipps or maybe was in a similiar position once. 

A little background: im a 26years old business informatics graduate from germany. I graduated last year and in the past two years i went through alot of self reflecting and got diagnosed with adhd after i suffered a burnout. I am unemployed since june last year. 

I am trying to find a job that suites me and my needs since june and i know the current corona situation doesnt really help since i feel like the job market is pretty stagnant at the time. 

The thing is that i struggle alot with depressive episodes and a general feeling of anxiety. Which makes the job search even harder since i feel like im not ready for a 40hour week since the last time i worked 40hours/week (while doing a necessary 6month internship for my university) i got a burnout and broke down. 

What doesnt help is that i dont like the ""big industry"" world and i never was a ""career guy"". I always was the nerd type that just wanted to get home to play video games. Also im way more interested in social oriented jobs instead of working for Daimler/Bosch/Porsche or one of the Consulting firms in my Area. Where i live (Stuttgart) i feel like everything is about career/perfomance/efficiency which scares me and makes me uncomfy. 

One of my biggest problems is that let alone the thought of a job where i have to tackle big projects alone and ""bite"" myself through big Tasks scares the shit out of me. 

So i am bascially searching for a job or a direction for an IT-Background guy which suits me. 

Are here any IT Background Brains who have more knowledge then me and could maybe make some suggestions?

How did you manage to find a job that fulfills you? 

How do you guys deal with similar Crisis-Situations? 



Much love to the community"

Students have asked questions like: 

* How do I land an internship at Amazon? 
* What was your internship experience like?
* What does a typical day look like for interns?

To answer these questions, I created a series of videos during my time as an intern. I thought I'd share it here for students who are interested in the Tech industry!

Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions, since the videos don't cover everything :)

*Advice for landing your first tech internship:*

Don’t (just) apply. Come up with creative ways to demonstrate the value you can bring to the company. This may involve:

* Proactively reaching out to people in industries you’re interested in, to learn more about what they do.
* Showcasing your projects, experiences, and skillsets through an online portfolio / personal website.
* Building a personal brand through LinkedIn by writing and engaging with posts.

I've decided to not use VBA since my skills in it are limited and i feel like it should be easy to maintain after I've left.

So basically I just wanted to say thank you to everyone in this sub for all of the advice given to college students about to graduate! I especially appreciate the “tough love” comments that I’ve read over the past year on this sub. Without reading this sub everyday for a year, I probably would’ve had no shot at landing the position that I did.

I secured an entry level Rotation program at a FAANG, starting later this year. This was the first time I’ve ever gotten hired by just applying through a company website. A little bit about my background, 22M graduated non-target in December with a 3.28 GPA. Prior internship experiences were at a local accounting firm and as a finance intern at a medical firm in my area. Also a couple of clubs and a startup idea, to round out my experience.  

The thing I’d recommend to people around my age that are lurking this sub looking for advice is to block out the haters. I know it doesn’t sound professional but I recall a lot of my peers at bigger institutions literally say to my face that I wouldn’t make it because of my school (my school is really close to an elite university in the area), gpa, and experience. The amount of disrespect I faced from attending a non target was baffling and extremely disrespectful but I blocked all that out and stayed dedicated to my instincts. Something else I’d recommend also, if you do have a low Ish GPA at a non target, try to put an emphasis of your experiences when trying to buff your resume. I made that realization early senior year and completed two internships after having just non applicable work experience on my resume. 


So basically to all of my non targets in this sub, keep your head up, and never give up on what you want to accomplish. There will always be idiots in life that challenge a lot of your decisions. You need to use that hate as fuel to get to where you want to be. Thanks all.

TL;DR: Secured Entry level position by following this sub and blocking out my haters."

Manager appears to not know what he really wants and schedules meetings every single day to talk about nothing?,thrklajslrj,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l5fe8n/is_it_time_to_run_manager_appears_to_not_know/,"I've found myself in a pretty tough situation. I'm working in a very small single-team company(2 front-end devs, 3 back-end devs(me included), 2 interns, manager, designer, owner).

The application we're working on is cool, I like to work with the team, but I and other people just can't get along with the manager. It's not that he is rude, but imo the best case scenario is that he lacks communication skills, the worst is that he is actually crazy. 4 people have been fired from the project already because apparently ""they were not listening to what had to be done"".

He gives unclear requirements to everyone, including junior and intern devs, which leads to major confusions and noone really knowing what to do. We try to ask questions, but answers are always met with even more vague and confusing information.

Then after a while when the tasks hang our manager goes into ""micro-b\*\*ch"" mode and tries to solve the issues by having 1, 2 or even 3 daily meetings, which usually consist of a bunch of good questions regarding what needs to be done, and a whole lot of bad, unclear answers.

**The craziness starts here.**

Sometimes it gets really ridiculous. I and another teammate were tasked with implementing a rather complex feature that has to meet requirements for three scenarios - just to illustrate A, B and C. We've implemented it, tested it, merged it, everything was fine.

Then 2 weeks later our manager is apparently ""worried"" that we don't understand what had to be done. We look through tests, test the feature manually, check the code, well, everything is fine, all three A, B, C requirements work as intended.

The daily meeting comes in and we start talking about what is supposedly wrong and it basically goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\[M\]: Hey guys, well, I don't think that we're on the same page when it comes to this feature, it had to work like this ... *goes on to describe A, B and C exactly how it was implemented*  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Us\]: A, B and C works exactly how you just said, is there anything we're missing here?  
&gt;  
&gt;\[M\]: Well, for one, you know that this feature had to do B right? And C should also be considered.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Us\]: So does A work correctly? You've only mentioned B and C. Other than that, we really can't see any difference. Can you go into a little more detail what is not working as expected exactly?

&gt;\[M\]: Ok, so the feature, ofcourse should do A. When it comes to B and C we will have to talk about it this week. Probably tomorrow.

When I leave these meetings I always feel like I'm loosing my mind, my head physically hurts. We're in an endless loop for 6 months right now, constantly  having meetings like that about basically every feature that was considered done already. I just can't wrap my head around it.

Everytime I try to suggest that he should make a very clear description of how the feature should work, with user stories and so on, he just says that he doesn't want to be involved with the code too much(wtf?).

Everyday I'm more and more confused, there was never even one positive thing this guy said about our work, it's like he wants us to feel like idiots on purpose and always make us feel like we're behind on work, and that we don't do it correctly. It makes me depressed and dread going to work.

Did you guys have situations like this? Is it time to run?"

I just started an internship in cash management and I am trying to make my life a bit easier with VBA but I am not sure how to do it correctly.

My task is that I have to make daily cash reports. This means that there is an excel table and in it the bank information for every company. The banks, account numbers, the amount of money in it etc.

The leaders in the economis department all handle different companies. 
What I would like to do is to make a different workbooks with the different groups of companies that can be sent to the corresponding leader, so they only have the data that is relevant to them. 
I would like to make a VBA code with which I can update the data in those workbooks. My issue is with all the different bank account numbers and how to insert the amount of money on them. I was thinking that I should use ""Do Loop Until"" to find the bank account number in the master table and then copy the amount of money on it to the smaller sheet. 
How can I automatize this? I am fine until the code finds the bank account number but what kind of code should I use for it to copy-paste the amount to the right place on the smaller sheet?
And is there a way for me not to make the some code a thousand times with each bank account number?

P.S: I use the 2016 version."

I'm a third year software engineering student, and I have just finished my first full time, one semester long internship. The company which I worked for offered me a part time extension during my study semester with another team that I haven't worked with yet. I accepted it, and so far I've been working remotely with this new team for 3 weeks.

Now, with the pandemic this is my first online semester and my school work is a lot more intense than I ever anticipated; the work load increased dramatically to the point where I'm losing out on a little sleep and half assing some of my courses. I'm a 21 year old living with my parents with just a $70 monthly phone bill to pay, and I have about $20k saved up so thankfully money isn't really an issue. 

Since college at 17 years old I've always been able to work 15-20 hours with a full course load without any problem, however I am struggling a bit this semester as it feels there is a lot to learn on my own, both at school and at work. I know the minimum they want from me is 15 hours but even at that I feel overwhelmed. I'm supposed to have another internship this summer and the application process is right now, perhaps after my part time job with this team they would've kept me for the summer.

My team already assigned me some projects to work on during my weekly 20 hours but I feel overwhelmed with school. I like the work that I do with them but I feel I am over committing. I could potentially see a future at this company, however there are many other postings from many companies for software engineers so it isn't really the biggest issue.

What would you personally do in my situation? If you were to quit, how would you go about it?"

Tl;dr: Senior struggling with final semester stress. Capstone research, internships, graduation, and post graduation career. Seeking advice!

Hello. I am a 21F Applied Computer Science major. I am due to graduate in May. I am caught up on my graduation requirements and just need to finish my Senior Capstone. 

Last night, I laid awake dreading the upcoming semester. My concerns are these:

My Capstone consists of coding an application, writing a research paper, and presenting it. I’m running into problems with the coding and am panicking over getting it done as this is what collects the data for my research. I’ve done Stackoverflow, GitHub, Geeks for Geeks, Violent Python, talked to my advisor, and such. I haven’t even started on my research paper. Should I set aside the coding and get started on the research?

I don’t know anything about what we need to do to graduate! I mean fees, degree applications, audits, and such. I emailed academic records and was informed I’d find out in March. I have this irrational fear that I’ll miss the applications and fee deadlines, that I’ll miss the opportunity to send out the invites and such. It’s irrational since these things haven’t even been announced yet. 

I had to let my internship supervisor know that I didn’t work on my project (installing and testing honeypots) in lieu of working on the Capstone. She understood and has given me a week extension. I’m grateful, but I still feel bad!

I am not going to grad school (gap year) and instead plan on working. My advisor has sent out applications to do research at other universities over the summer. These projects include some stipends. Research is my dream career, but I also want to start a full time job so I can start saving for when it’s time to start paying off my student loans. I feel like I should prioritize getting the full time job, but I also feel like the summer research projects would be beneficial in the long run! 

These are my main concerns. I don’t plan on dropping my internship or changing my Capstone (I’ve been working on the internship for a month and the Capstone for six months). I feel like a lot of this is irrational and don’t know why I feel like this. I’d really like some advice on how to handle these issues."

I've been looking at open positions on Glassdoor, my schools job portal, and websites for companies but I've been a little discouraged after looking at the qualifications listed for the jobs I want. I've been looking at research positions at companies like Sony, Toyota, and Honda but most seem to want PhDs or an impressive CV with some publications at top-tier conferences. Ideally, id like to do work in robotics, deep learning, and/or state estimation since these are the topics I studied most intensively during my program.

Admittedly, my resume and portfolio need some work, although the entirety of my relevant experience amounts to a single software engineering internship I had with a startup three years ago, and two years where I worked in a computer vision lab on and off. None of the research I did resulted in a publication but I learned to use ROS and PyTorch. I am familiar with C/C++ and I would say I have a few years worth of experience with Python. That said, this hasn't been enough to land a job. 

Anyone currently working in a CV/ML/Robotics role: how competitive is the job market? Is there any hope for me? Should I give up and just start grinding leetcode right now and polishing up my personal projects?"

So around 2.5 years ago, I built a gaming PC, it wasn't the greatest, but it still performed great and has held up today. However, now that I'm almost done with college, and starting to move onto my career as a video game concept artist &amp; animator, I need to shift my build towards something more suitable for that profession. I just landed an internship with a gaming studio, and for the start of that, everyone is working remotely, so I really need something fast so I can keep up. We used a mixture of 3Ds MAX, Blender, and Photoshop at the moment. 

I have a budget of 4,000.

As far as current specs go, I have a mid size case. -Processor is AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6core
-16GB ram ( i know, measly)
-Graphics is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
-A 256 GB Samsung SSD 850 Evo boot drive
-1TB HD
-Gigabyte AB350M-Gaming 3 motherboard
-Fully modular Hive 650S power supply

Now with that said, I have 2 monitors, 1 being a 32 inch beast of a graphics tablet I invested in. I need a new case because part of the tablet connects with USB C, and I'm tired of using a USB 3 to C adapter to connect it. Not to mention, 1 my HDMI ports on this case is faulty. If you have any new case suggestions, I'd prefer it to be mid sized as well, as the desk it's under isn't that tall. I'd also like this new build to be liquid cooled.

So if any of you have experience with workstations, I'd love to hear your suggestions! I've been doing some research online, and so far, it commonly seems like they're suggesting a Ryzen 9 3900X processor, and and NVIDIA 2080Ti. I don't have a problem spending money on these, it's everything else in between that I'm unsure of what to get! 

Thanks for reading, looking forward to any advice that may come. If you have further questions, just leave a comment and I'll get back to you. Stay safe out there!"

l5kiq1,3,2021-01-26,Intern to IT Generalist: Should I push for a much higher salary?,cerebralvenom,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/l5kiq1/intern_to_it_generalist_should_i_push_for_a_much/,"Basic question: I am working part-time at $12 dollars an hour right now, but I am about to move into a full-time position in May, should (or would it be smarter) to push for $20 dollars an hour and a title change?

&amp;#x200B;

Full Backstory:

I started at a local bank as an IT intern last May. Originally it was only a summer internship, but due to the need for more staff, and the amount of projects I had worked on and completed for them, they offered to let me stay on part-time until I finished my degree (non-IT related), and then make me full time upon completion. 

Our IT Department is tiny. There are technically 7 of us (1 IT Manager, 1 SysAdmin, 3 broad help desk, 1 network engineer, and 1 worker who basically only exists on payroll). We manage 4 tenants, and about 650 devices. To make matters worse, I would say that only 3 of us actually work a normal day, and the others, at worst, mainly do nothing but bullshit the day away and wait for a paycheck, or, at best, work in intense spurts, and then stop working for the rest of the day.

Since most of the employees are pretty lazy, it leaves me in a interesting place. On the one hand, I am answering half of the help desk phone calls for 4 company's, and working on their problems. On the other, any pending projects that IT has basically fall in my lap. This means  I get to put my hand into all sorts of projects, and work on basically anything I want to. It's an incredible learning experience for my future career, as I literally do everything. 

So,  right now I am responsible for:

*  all software distribution,
*  leading helpdesk,
*  learning and leading the effort to use a SIEM for network management,
*  supporting all hardware distribution to our remote tenant (all remote workers), 
*  all discovery cases whether they be security or legal related. 
* Being the point of contact for our auditors, and our consultants.  

I have embarked on and completed a number of projects that include installing servers, doing major user hardware upgrades, and tons of software pushes. 

Keep in mind, I am making one dollar more than I was making  when I started as an intern, and I technically only have the title of helpdesk technician. 

As of right now, since I am working part time (25-30 hours a week), I think I am not in a position to argue my salary. However, upon becoming full-time, I will go crazy if I don't start making more money.

I do live in a rural part of the Mid-West, so wages here are definitely lower than other parts of the country, but I want to push for $20 an hour and the title of IT Generalist (or at least IT Technician). 

Will I be asking too much, since I technically have very little prior experience? And is asking to be called an IT Generalist stupid, because it sounds like a made up title? 

Furthermore, how do I approach this conversation with my manager (who is notorious for never going to bat for his employees)? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;  I work harder and do more than 70% of my IT department in about 2/3 the time. I only have one year's experience, and am currently only working part time. When I go full time in May, can I ask for a $8 raise, and a title change?"

I applied for it about 3 weeks about. I've taken 1 or 2 online interviews before and I never got the job even after the hiring managers were constantly emailing me about taking the job.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus I'm a little self conscious about the way I appear on camera."

First, I will like to appologize for this wall of text I can now see that I have made but please bear with me.

Together with an agency, I am working on planning an internship in the US expected to be in May/June depending on the whole situation. They are helping me out with the practical stuff like obtaining a J1 visa and getting me interviews with potential companies. As I am a graduate with majors in accounting and finance my desired field is something within financial services where quantitative finance would be of highest priority. My first choice of stay is in New York since my impression all the time has told me that is the place to be when it comes to finance. I cannot really decide whether my second choice should be Chicago or LA but that is not really the point here, but let me know if you have somthing to say about that. 

At the moment I am of course excited and hope it will work out, but a big concern has come up recently after my last meeting with my agent where he briefly mentioned that many of the financial companies in New York, even the big ones, are planning and some already are moving out of the city and, according to him they are moving to southern states like Florida and Texas due to lower or no state tax there. I am now in doubt if I should stick to the original plan and apply for New York or chose one of the south states, I have read a bit about it and can see that some of his predictions are right, but how is the situation actually? 

I do not know if it is important, but I am from a scandinavian country and I am at around 50% of my decision is wheithed in the right position and 50% wheighted in the location where I can experience something while I am overseas since I have never been in the states before. 

I will really appreciate any kind of response if any of you maybe could tell how the real situation is about companies moving out or maybe even your experiences there.

Thank you very much for taking your time."

I switched engineering majors after my sophomore year, which set me back and made getting internships even more difficult. The only job experience I have under my belt is a summer research gig at my university that I don't feel was very helpful in developing my skillset.

Most of the courses I took in EE were digital circuit design/VLSI. While the classes were difficult (I got B's and A's), I enjoyed learning how computers worked at the smallest level. I didn't want to take additional semesters, so I graduated in four years with most of my classes related to digital design.

COVID decimated the end of my senior year. My senior VLSI design project was cancelled 1/3 of the way through, and my embedded controls project was cancelled before we started (because we need to use the beefy university computers, but everyone was under lockdown and there was so much unknown about the virus, etc.). I was looking forward to these projects and banking on them giving me experience, knowledge, and confidence in my abilities, but instead the semester fizzled out and I feel like I have nothing to show for my education. I had some job interviews before COVID hit, but they didn't go well, so I didn't proceed beyond the second stage of interviews.

Since COVID, I've applied for jobs but haven't even received a reply from the companies. The economy was in a bad state and lots of working engineers lost their jobs, peers of mine lost their job offers and internships, so I sat back and played Animal Crossing for a few months like everyone else.

**Now**

But now it's the end of January 2021, and every day I just feel worse and worse. I feel like I have almost nothing to show for my four years in college. VLSI was already a difficult field to get into, and engineers typically have a MA or PhD, while I just have a BA. I just feel overwhelmingly paralyzed right now. I feel inadequate for the field I studied in, completely unqualified for anything else, and my student loans kick in soon. My parents cautioned me to not go back to school for my master's unless I absolutely know what I want to do (""Don't throw more money at the problem. Get a job first and see if you like it""). And even if I did go back, I believe there's still remote learning for the time being, so I don't think I'd be able to even retake the senior design classes anyway. So I don't know what to do, and I find myself in a state of utter despair.

Nobody in my family is an engineer, so I came here for advice. Am I screwed? Should I give up engineering? Persevere? Am I too hard on myself? Am I not hard enough? Please be honest with me.

**TL;DR**

Recent grad, little experience, no senior design projects, no job prospects, what do?"

I'm currently following a 12 hour tutorial for making a flask web application and the comments say it's the best tutorial they've seen (it seems like people say that about every tutorial though). It's quite overwhelming because there are so many libraries.

I definitely feel like there are several other ways to make the same web app using different libraries. In order to prepare for an entry level job, should I be following multiple tutorials so that I know different ways to do the same thing? Or just practice doing something one way with the same libraries then learning new ways in my first job?

Basically I'm wondering what to do with my time. Should I be watching multiple tutorials or learning one solid way and practicing making several similar apps with the same structure?"

Hello everyone.

I am a 22 year old who graduated from college this past May with a B.A in Economics. I lost my internship to a Financial company in the early days of the pandemic and that made me feel like a complete loser to be honest. I've been working a cashier job at a grocery store to put some money in my pocket, but it is draining (as all retail is) and makes me feel like a failure. I've been trying to figure out what I want to do with my life since I came to the realization that I couldn't see myself in the Financial field and instead, I've recently been looking into breaking into I.T. I have always been fascinated with technology and am the person in my family that people come to whenever they have tech related questions. I built my own pc as well as upgraded a couple of my friends rigs (though I don't know if that counts for much in terms of I.T) I have no relevant experience in the area, so I was thinking of grabbing a couple of certs (A+, Network+, and maybe a Microsoft OS Cert to start off) and selling my soft skills of customer service to help me land my first gig. I am willing to start off at the help desk since I realize that everyone has to pay their dues in this field. Was just wondering if this is a sound plan. Thank you for taking the time to respond to my post and I hope you have a good day/night."

The only language that I have learned pretty much the basics of is Python. I'de say the equivalent to what I know in Python is basically what you can learn in the Intro to Python 3 on Sololearn. (Imagine that, I've paid to learn in school what I can learn for free on that website.)

Basically, every internship I've seen so far is looking for seniors or graduates. The ones that are not (pretty much Intel, they're big where I am located) are hoping I have experience in a bunch of stuff I haven't even heard of yet. It almost makes me feel like my school hasn't been teaching me what I need to know by this point in time. I am currently unemployed, so should I just bite the bullet and work some dead-end job while finishing up school and looking at internships, or is there a possible way I can start to get actual experience from an employer now?

The military recruitment guy called and just wanted to talk to me to see if I'm interested in the military or try to get me thinking about it. They've called me before and I always tell them the same thing. That I'm not interested in the military and I've never seen myself doing that. The people that call normally play nice and just try to chat a bit and he asked about what I'm going to university for. I told him cybersecurity.

This started him telling me about how computer science is a really great field and everything but it's very competitive and basically telling me how I might not be able to land anything after school. I was going for nursing and switched majors and I'm 2 semesters in. All 3 of my CS classes I've taken so far I've made an A in and I've been interested in it all and feel good about it.

Choosing something that I will spend the rest of my life doing is just a weird concept to me in general but it's something I need to do. I took this semester off for a few reasons the biggest one is how covid is still bad but also to work on my mental health and slightly think about if I'm choosing the right path for me. 

Now with all this going on this guy saying that to me really fucking discouraged me because I was already iffy about it but him saying that really just destroyed my confidence. It made me feel like maybe I really am better off searching for something else. I just dont know what to do anymore because I've already switched majors once and dont want to do it again. I mean I like CS and coding is so much fun because it's like a puzzle figuring out how to get the result I want with what the language will allow and I love that but idk. I just dont want to waste my time. I just want to find something that will support me and my future family while still having enough time to spend with them and myself. Like I honestly dont want to work more than 32 hours because my wife will be doing cosmetology so we could afford to have the 4 day work weeks instead of 5. I'm sorry if this post is drawn out or if it's more a rant than anything or doesnt fit in or whatever. Him just telling me all that really just fucked me up and discouraged me more than I already was and I really just lost all direction of where I want my life after that call. I'm just in a bad place and after hearing that it just came across as I'm not going to get a job in that field and I'm wasting my time/money.

I did really well at a large company and at the end of my internship I got two offers, one for devops and other for Android development. I went with Android, and even got promoted 1,5 year later. But lately I've been regretting my choices. The problem is right now I'm unsure if Android is the right thing for me. It just lost it's spark, and working with other technologies is really appealing. But at the same time I'm afraid I won't be able to make as much as I do now (I have a family and bills to pay), specially because I never finished my computer science degree.

What would you do? At this point is it still worth trying to finish my bachelor's degree? I'm just really lost at what to do and I'm looking for advice."

I’m super grateful for any input. Here goes:


I’m 6 months into my first full-time job after graduating. I’m an Application Security Engineer. I read this sub a lot and realize I seem to have lucked out; I absolutely did not have the experience to get this roll but I guess I interviewed well enough and here I am. I have no help desk or support experience. All my internships were software developer roles. 

The problem I’m having is that although I studied CS + Cyber with the goal of one day being an app sec engineer, I never thought I would start my career as one. I’ve been increasingly noticing that while I am performing well, I’m not very interested in my daily work (I’m also not really challenged) and when I do find time outside work to try to expand my knowledge, I keep gravitating towards practicing web dev frameworks + object detection programming. 

The questions: Is it a red flag that I don’t want to learn about Cybersec or how to be a better app sec engineer outside work and instead want to code? Are there any Cyber roles that are more programming heavy (writing code, not reading it?)?"
l66y58,10,2021-01-27,I desperately need to leave from my toxic family,ThrowRA18027,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/l66y58/i_desperately_need_to_leave_from_my_toxic_family/,"**\~SITUATION\~**  
My parents are divorced (both have re-married) and I've lived with my grandma for the majority of my life. I've been fortunate enough to have financial support from my grandma and her sister for my education.

My mother and her husband for most of the time stays at my grandma's house with my step-siblings. Sometimes she gives me (used) stuff and (obvious) advice when she feels nice but for the most part is focused on my step-siblings and treats me as an afterthought.

My father is caught up in his own marriage while occasionally giving me academic books and some stuff like clothes (mostly used) or stacks of academic papers and his life advice in which I have some suspicions he just is being considerably nice to me because he hopes I can continue his ""lineage"" because he doesn't have another son.

My grandma got remarried back before I was born because my grandfather had passed away. But unfortunately her husband is not mentally stable and is the reason for her incurring tons of debt because he easily believes in sketchy people and doesn't have a job on his own and doesn't try to find a job.   
My grandmother doesn't want to leave him for some reason and might have to be because of her being so highly religious. Because of this most of my extended family and my mom won't help her in fear of her wasting that help on her husband. For the most part my grandmother is mentally stable but I think she may have some underlying problems.

For most of the time, this kind of situation never bothered me too much as I got used to it.   
But as the pandemic hit (Covid-19) the problems became much more evident as I had to move from my boarding house to my own home.

I genuinely think all my family members are emotionally unstable, some more than others but all are unhealthy to a very high degree. My family can't discuss ANYTHING without breaking into a fight especially things concerning finance.    
I've tried calming them down, talking to them personally, try to make them talk and discuss about their problems with each other. But none of that has worked for the past year and it seems like they have no intention of being at peace with each other. All this hate and toxicity is directed to everyone in the house including myself.  


These things include but not limited to:  


1. My mother not accepting how I lived my life, verbally abuses me, and has random emotional outbursts for insignificant things. Comparing me to others telling me to be more active when I've tried my best at my studies (good grades, joining clubs, working part-time), distancing my brothers from myself because she thinks telling them to behave is a bad thing (telling them to take the toys back to the box for example). She doesn't care what she says and has no second thoughts on how that would affect me. She even once told me she should have aborted me on one of her emotional outbursts.  

2. My step-grandfather also has emotional outbursts. Both him and my mother are very easily provoked. He can't be reasoned with and if anyone dares to say otherwise he'll use ""shouting"" as a tool to make them stop and listen to whatever he wants. He wastes money so much even when my grandmother is detrimentally in need of it to pay of her debt.   

3. My grandma, she's too kind for her own good. She gives and cares a little too much about joining communities. which aren't bad but she overworks and forces herself to join in and contribute the point where she wouldn't eat, take a bath or change clothes after just to join a really not important zoom-meeting on her laptop after working. I think she does this because she just wants to distract herself from her problems.  
She doesn't want to discuss her financial problems with my mom or any of her much more financially capable family members. BUT with all of the problems she still wants to accommodate her friend in a middle of pandemic for free, pay for house expenses, give pocket money for her husband's smoking addiction, all the while dealing with monthly debt payments. She's working hard to pay it off and I try my best to help her but I've come to realize it would be much easier if ANY of her family members including my mom could just help her and ease her burden. But of course they're afraid of my grandma using it to get into more debt and other reasons. I've told her this but she doesn't want to do anything about it. Even worse, my mom thinks she has more money than she claims and thinks she's lying.  

4. My grandma's sister, is very financially capable but is very distant from both my grandma and my myself.  She doesn't see helping finance my education as charity or as a way to help out her own sister but she's very neutral about it and constantly hints of my university expenses as being expensive even when though I had the price cut down with scholarship programs. At one point she just paid half of my tuition fee and asked me to ask my parents to pay for the rest, fully knowing my situation and the fact that my parents barely give me any financial support.

All this accumulating in constant fights and emotional outbursts with no end. I feel so financially unstable and hopeless in this situation. It's clear I can't stay living with my toxic family and I'm searching ways to move out as fast as possible and be able to live independently without having to rely on my family.  


**\~Question\~**  


Any tips on dealing with this situation? 

I'm open to alternative suggestions for this situation but honestly all I want to do is move out and get away from my family.

At the moment I'm in my 7th semester and I can save up some money with my internship but I don't know what to do later on or how I can efficiently use it because it's barely enough for 3 months of rent and I'm not sure if I have to go job hunting again later on. All the while planning to still want to financially support my grandmother in the long run because she's already given so much to me.  
General tips on moving out, similar experiences, or a full list of steps are very welcome.

I have offers from Bistol, Queen Mary for conversion masters in CS and still waiting for UCL, however I also expect a reply from Bath for their online MSc in CS.

*My options currently are:*

* **Bristol:** 25k £, start in Sep. 2021 and take 1 year (full-time degree) [Link to degree](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2021/eng/msc-computer-science-conversion/)
* **UCL**: 31.2k£, start in Sep. 2021 and take 1 year (full-time degree)  [Link to degree](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computer-science-msc)
* **Bath (online)**: 13k £ , start May 2021 and take 2y, 3months. (half-time degree) [Link to degree](https://online.bath.ac.uk/online-courses/msc-computer-science)

Is it worth it to pay double  to be done 10-11 months earlier? 

If I would go the online route I would try to build side projects and maybe find an internship in SWE but idk if that is possible in the early semesters. The workload for the degree would be pretty low (12-15h a week) so I would somehow have to make up for it with side projects or internships... 

Also the thesis in the online degree is pretty research oriented which kinda sucks as the on-campus full-time degrees normally have more of a project based final dissertation. There would still be some projects to put on my portfolio with both routes though.

Overall I am unsure whether I should opt for the part time online degree and self-learn on the side or go for any of the 1 year degrees (UCL, Bristol, QMU).

I would greatly appreciate some advice."

I am reading books pertaining to everything related to the buzzword ""genetic engineering"". Also I try to watch interviews, and conferences on these things.

Ultimately, my end goal have an *""umbrella education""*  so I would be versatile enough to either

1. Work in a lab but have the ability to research viral diseases, cancer, and biochem stuff, kind of like how Jennifer Doudna discovered crispr.
2. Be able to integrate Computer science in these jobs. Like a career as a Bioinformatic Software Engineer

**OR**

1. If I  find out halfway through college that I CAN'T STAND Biology, then just be able to work a  job like in cybersecurity, or as a software engineer.

# In essence I need to know

* Should I get some certificates? if so Which ones?
* A part time job?
* What are some jobs that I can get right now, to help me gain the experience I need?
* Should I apply for the IBM Summer Internship in my city?
* Get a job working as a phlebotomist or something in a lab?

I REALLY need you all's help. My family doesnt understand that is not ""Unrealistic"", and my my school advisor, academic counselor, career advisor, nobody was able to help me."

l6a48y,88,2021-01-27,My first decision was an acceptance! Even with a lot of bad marks on my transcripts,CakeByThe0cean,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/l6a48y/my_first_decision_was_an_acceptance_even_with_a/,"Sorry this is super long, oops. TLDR; there’s hope for those of us with less than stellar academics, this is my background and what I did to try to offset it. 

Guys this happened two days ago and I’m still in shock. I got into an MS program at a school I never thought I would get into in a million years, which is in the top 3 in America for programs in my field, and I wanted to give some hope to people with not-so-great transcripts. 

Negatives on my transcripts:

-	Took 6 years to get my bachelors (2012-2018)
-	Academically suspended for two years with a freshman year GPA of 1.13
-	Returned to school in 2015, all of my D’s and F’s weren’t calculated into my GPA anymore moving forward (school readmission policy) but they’re still on my transcripts
-	Got sick with mono my sophomore/junior years, causing a lot of C’s in my upper level major courses
-	Total F’s: 3 (counted in GPA: 0)
-	Total D’s: 6 (counted in GPA: 1)
-	Total C’s: 8
-	Total W’s: 4

Positives of my application:

-	Got Dean’s List three times
-	Held two internships during my junior and senior years and gained 18 months of industry and lab experience
-	Have been working full-time in a semi-related industry for the past two years with applicable and desirable skills
-	My letters of recommendation from professors that taught my upper level courses mentioned something about how my grades aren’t a true reflection of my potential (gathered from comments a potential PI from another school made during an interview after submitting my application). This was somewhat intentional on my part, I did choose professors that knew I had mono when I took their classes and that I had started to get treatment for previously undiagnosed ADHD the summer before my senior year.

Neutrals of my application:

-	Graduated with a 3.18 GPA
-	I didn’t submit a GRE score with any of my applications. I have an okay-ish one (153/153/4) but it didn’t seem impressive enough to boost my applications.

I didn’t mention my weak transcripts in my SOP itself because it didn’t really fit anywhere and was more of a 3 sentence explanation (academic suspension, mono, ADHD). Two or three of the applications had a spot to provide explanations of my transcripts and so I mentioned it there. In the interview with the potential PI from another school, he mentioned that he appreciated my explanation and it didn’t bother him at all because I have skills he wants for his research. But he did ask me how he should convince the grad school to overlook my transcripts and I said something about how I shouldn’t be judged based on a 10 year old metric (academic suspension) and how my medical problems have been addressed and that I did show marked improvement overall.

Basically, this post is for other applicants that might be in a similar position to me in one way or another. There’s not a lot of posts about addressing an academic suspension on this sub, let alone posts about addressing more than one academic blemish. 

The best advice I have is to get industry experience and/or non-industry experience with transferable skills to offset a subpar academic record. The second best advice I have is that if there is an appropriate place in your application/SOP, address any substantial marks on your records in a succinct way that shows improvement and that it won’t be an issue in grad school. Be honest but not *too* honest. Nobody wants to read an entire supplemental essay on how you’ve always struggled with [insert mental/physical health ailment] and never knew it. Oh and also reach out to potential PI’s early! I started sending out emails last August and still only got to meet with three interested professors."

l6bm2v,1,2021-01-27,Should I enroll in a Computer Science BSc?,no_more_nickname,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/l6bm2v/should_i_enroll_in_a_computer_science_bsc/,"I already have a degree in Business Economics and working towards getting another one in Business Informatics. I have about 2 years of experience working as an intern in the fields of report development, business analysis and data engineering. I managed to get a job as a full time Data Engineer at a multinational company in my country. I have studied calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, statistics, econometrics, programming, computer networks, operating systems, data analysis, visualisation at uni, and I am trying to learn online as much as I can (webdevelopment, python, data science). BUT I feel like gaining a deeper knowledge in applied mathematics, algorithms, computer science and programming concepts would make me a better IT professional. My Business Informatics studies have covered these topics vaguely, especially the programming and algorithms part. 

In the future, I can imagine myself either working as a Data Engineer/Scientist, or a Programmer. I truly cannot decide it at this point. 

I have a chance to enroll in a part-time Computer Science Bachelor's programme for a tuition fee per term of what is about my current monthly salary. This programme is also widely considered as the best one in this field in my country. I feel like it could give me a deeper understanding of programming theory and therefore make me a better professional. 

Regarding all of this, what you you think? Is it a good idea for me to join this programme?

TL;DR: Already have a degree in different field, and studying Business Informatics (finishing soon). Most programming I know, I learned online or at work. Currently working as a Data Engineer. Feel like doing a Computer Science BSc would deepen my knowledge and make me a better professional. What do you think?"
l6ceqs,2,2021-01-27,What is the difference between Amazon APP and LEAP Programs.,grunkfist,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/l6ceqs/what_is_the_difference_between_amazon_app_and/,"My little brother applied to the Amazon APP program  and got rejected on the coding portion but they offered him the option of applying to the LEAP program in response. He passed the coding interview for LEAP and did well enough to get an offer from Amazon. The problem is that the offer letter says 

&gt; On behalf of Amazon.com Services LLC (the ""Company""), I am very pleased to offer you the position of APP Intern - Seattle.  

Is this a typo? I'm afraid if he asks for a correction to the offer letter it will only complicate matters. If it is correct then what happened to his good result on the LEAP? He plans to call them anyway but I thought maybe someone could shed light beforehand.

Here is a write up for each program.

&gt;**Lab Engineer Accelerator Program (LEAP) Internship Program:**  
The LEAP Internship Program offers hands-on software development experience to students who are making an early commitment to computer science careers.  
· Similar to a traditional Software Development Engineering (SDE) internship, LEAP interns will spend 12-weeks at Amazon working on individual projects that are impactful to their business with the support of a manager and mentor.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Amazon Propel Program (APP) Internship Program:**  
APP offers hands-on software development experience to students who have an interest in software development.  
· You will spend 12 weeks at Amazon, with the first 4 weeks in a hands-on SDE bootcamp, learning how to solve sample Amazon problems. You will spend the next 8 weeks working on technical projects with support of a manager and mentor."
l6d0fk,4,2021-01-27,[Serious] How do you gain confidence to apply/interview when you feel completely incompetent?,Nerdlinger42,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/l6d0fk/serious_how_do_you_gain_confidence_to/,"I'm wrapping up my degree and have some experience. I have very basic certs (A+, Net+, Sec+, Linux Essentials, and ITIL) and a homelab that I document on my blog that I post on probably twice a week or so. I really should be applying to jobs right now but feel like it can't possibly go anywhere based on my skills. Idk why since people have said I'm skilled and easy to work with, I just don't see it I guess? I'd be happy to get a help desk job paying $12/hr to start but feel like I wouldn't be able to do that for whatever reason. It doesn't make sense though since I use windows server at home, I know how to do basic tasks and can use powershell too. I've written a few scripts (easy onboarding/offboarding for example) but nothing that would dazzle an interviewer or anything that would make me hirable.

So many people get their A+ and want to hit the ground running with high confidence, but I just don't feel like I have the skills for it. Theoretically I have a lot going for me with my projects, degree, and certs but I just don't feel optimistic at all and have been losing sleep over it lately. I need help building the confidence necessary that so many people seem to have. My prior internship really liked me and gave me a great review but noted that they smelled serious confidence issues and were concerned about it, I now wish I took that to heart much sooner because this doesn't seem normal for somebody in my position at all. Any advice? I don't think I'll be able to thrive without confidence."

I have a few questions about mandatory internships that are part of the curriculum.

I have to do one for my next semester (Masters in Computer Science).  
I have already received an offer, but the pay seems low (€450 per month), the company said that they also offer student jobs at a pay of €14 per hour, but the reason they can only offer €450 for the internship, is because it's mandatory, and they are restricted by the minimum wage.  


Is this normal? I really like the company and I do want to do my internship with them, I just want to know if the pay is normal or can I negotiate it?  


Thanks in advance."

I recently got given an internship Python coding challenge, which involved iterating through a directory of tar and other files and extracting a specific value that came after a text, then doing some calculations on it. I managed to get an answer that to me seemed within reason - but as the file was so large and data so messy, no way to actually check for sure what the actual answer is.

My problem is, that I achieved the above using two functions, one of which was called inside the other - but I imported modules within the functions rather than at the top.

I have subsequently learned this is generally considered a no no according to PEP-8 and that all imports should be done at the top of a document.

Anyway, I haven't heard back from them yet - but how egregious was this error? Would this be considered a deal breaker for a data scientist?"

Anyway, I am confused as to what I should be doing at this current moment as a high school senior since I just do part time virtual/part time school, and a part time job.

I’ve also got a few laptop lying around that I frankly have no idea as to what I can do to turn them into a homelab (although I could turn one into a virtual machine test-bench, but alas. 

My question is, what should I really be doing to get into the field now, since right now I’m just watching a couple YouTube videos, turned an low powered laptop running on Fedora and just testing out commands/downloading files, and looking at used Thinkpads on eBay. 

Is there ways that I can be more involved so that I can be prepared for the field or should I wait until college to get started on the things that do matter ?"

l6mw1y,2,2021-01-27,Junior in university moving from a more sys. admin internship to a DevOps internship. Am I niching myself?,perhapsasitseems,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l6mw1y/junior_in_university_moving_from_a_more_sys_admin/,"Hello! I’m currently a junior and I’m interning at a company under a Linux Sys. Admin. It was only supposed to be for the extent of last summer but my boss/mentor asked if I could extend until December, then extend again until the start of next summer where I will be jumping to a different department and as a DevOps intern. I think I impressed them with the code I wrote over the internship, my school assignments, and being able to talk about my projects that I worked on during the course of the internship. Obviously, being able to navigate Linux servers (what they work on) and being in the company is a huge plus. 

I’m thankful for the internship I have because it gave me a variety of experiences. However, at the heart of it all, I knew that I was most at home and excited when I was coding or creating scripts to automate processes. As such, I’m very excited to bridge the gap of what I learned with what I want to do more of, as well as just learning more things in general. 

I’ll define their “DevOps” since I’ve seen it’s a smattering of definitions depending on the company (as said on this sub). A couple things were mentioned (seriously forgive my naivety) but it was something like building an application for docker containers..? Would I prefer working on the front end, the back end, the API layer, what tools or framework would I use if I had that choice, etc. 

Anyways, of course this is all great to learn but I wanted to ask am, I just niching myself into a hole? If I don’t enjoy this, will this experience be valuable for other roles and what roles would that be?"

I joined the military after high school then realized I wanted a job where I can get paid to think, so after finishing my enlistment I enrolled in school to pursue computer science. During my time in college I didn't really find any of the material interesting. It was just something I was \*doing\* because it was better than doing nothing, especially because I had the GI Bill. I graduated with poor grades and no internships, got a job at a warehouse and feel like I'm back to square one with not much idea as to what it is I want to do for a career.

My thoughts about what I've done so far:

* military was pretty dreadful for the most part, the exhilarating moments and camaraderie will never amount to any normal civilian job and is something I highly cherished, but i need more mental stimulation
* college was ok, no particular subject or class piqued my interest and i realized i have 0 passion for technology, programming, computer science, etc.
* retail, manual labor, etc. are jobs i would hate to work in the long run because i feel like i'm wasting my potential

I don't even know why I mentioned potential as I don't envision myself becoming a surgeon or climbing the corporate ladder, but basically all my life I've felt lost and at 25 I still feel lost and at least would like a job where I can wake up and feel like I want to get shit done. I'm applying to software developer jobs with little to no luck, but most days I can't help but think, ""maybe I just hate work in general and need to suck it up?"" or ""maybe tech really isn't the path for me, and I should stop trying so hard to pursue something I have no passion for?"" Anyone else feel similarily?"

I'm a third-year at a state school studying computer science and minoring in mathematics. I have really wanted to be a software engineer for at least 2 years. If you told me 8 months ago that I wouldn't have at least gotten 1 interview I would've thought you were absolutely crazy. However as of today that is the case. Although I haven't sent out as many applications as some of the other people I've seen on this subreddit, I anticipated a little bit of a better response rate. Currently, I've applied to almost 80 internships. At first, I was trying to find the ones where I knew all of the technology specified on their requirements and ""bonus"" sections. Then once I wasn't hearing back I started expanding my horizon to anything tangential.

## Luck?
I have been denied quickly at positions where I far exceed the job requirements and had a referral from someone in the company. For one instance, the connection said that the hiring manager had just gone on vacation when I applied and the person who was taking over for the week denied my application before he could reach out to the department. It made it feel like I was just getting unlucky at everything.

## What I've been doing
During this time I had been working as hard as I could to boost my resume, skills, and knowledge. I have been listening to an algorithms course on youtube from MIT when I workout daily, programming in java on LeetCode answering 2-5 questions per day. I started building and I am almost finished with an A\* Pathfinding algorithm written in Python that has a dynamic user interface written with Tkinter. My primary focus is a social media product I co-founded with a few of my friends from university.

## What I've learned/how I've grown
Through those experiences, I've seen tremendous growth over the last 8-10 months in my programming skills. I remember when I first started grinding on LeetCode I thought I was going to quit programming because I spent 5 hours on an ""easy"" question that had a 5 line solution. At this point, I can't find an easy question that isn't trivial and I am solving a lot of medium questions without having to reference an answer. I am taking an algorithms class currently at university and I can't even pay attention because I read the syllabus and already know the algorithms well. I can tell the functions I've written for my iOS app are some of the most advanced things I've ever read and they're used by a almost hundred people daily.

## Critique + resume link
I've thought my resume has expressed the level of my technological skill properly but perhaps not. Its attached to this post hiding sensitive information. If anyone has critiques on my resume or my daily routine. Please let me know.

Next week I return to college in which I'll be taking a programming class focusing on C++. I'm somewhat anxious that once college work starts to pile up I won't be able to keep up with my goal of learning JS. As of now I'm telling myself that I'll be easily able to learn C++ and JS at the same time, but I know once midterms/projects role around I'm most likely going to leave JS behind. I've put a lot of work into trying to understand the fundamentals of JS and would hate to forget all of it and have start over in the summer, also, I'm hoping to get an internship sometime soon and having JS on my resume could be very helpful. So my main purpose of writing this is to ask you guys what you would do in my shoes. Should I attempt to learn C++ and JS at the same time, or should I just focus on one language at a time?

I’m interested in engineering , and plan to pursue a career in Civil engineering. 

I’m currently in a program in my college that will allow me to transfer to a University that provides an engineering major . I just have to complete all of the course requirements and have the appropriate GPA. 

My GPA is set , but I’ve been looking at my course requirements and , there are so many prerequisite math classes that I have to take. Most of their credits won’t even transfer to the University I plan to apply to for Engineering .

It’s discouraging because :

1. I’m currently on a scholarship that has a set number of years that I can use it for, I only have 2 years left before I have to start paying for College. But the extensive amount of math classes ,make it so that I stay longer , and keep getting classes that don’t have any transfer credit.

2. I only need Calculus 2, Physics, and Chem 1 to transfer to that School. I already have chem 1, and will be taking Physics and Calc 2 next semester.  But the program that I’m in requires me to take more classes before transferring , which will make the transferring process longer. 

3. The university I plan to apply to is Georgia Tech, and I wanted to find an engineering internship during the summer to make my chances of getting in a little higher for next year. But I’m a math major and I’m not sure internships will approve of that.

So, should I stay in the program, or should I get my basic requirements and attempt to get out right away?

Also, Is it possible that I’ll be able to find an engineering internship as a math major? This semester , I have engineering graphics, and I’m learning AutoCAD and engineering processes, would that help my chances at all?"

Fall 2019 intake. Hoped to secure an internship sometime after my first year, which would've been super helpful as I don't have work experience. But then COVID-19 happened and the job market is in tatters now, just as my luck would have it.

With 2 and a half weeks remaining to secure an internship (prospects looking bleak at the moment), my family is asking me to consider doing a PhD, as I'd be graduating with a Master's degree in Summer 2021.

The thing is, I went for my Master's right after my Bachelor's, and was looking to secure a full-time position in the US and make use of my OPT. This is exactly what I told my family too, as they've been asking me to do a PhD even before I started my MS but I wasn't interested at that point in time.

While getting an internship or junior position would be the next best thing, I would like to keep improving myself while applying.

Many thanks in advance!"

This is my first time posting here. I am in need of some help with a school project. I am in my final semesters as a cyber security student, and as part of my course work we have to do an internship. Now, this place I work at is not really cyber security related and I am having troubles finding someone in the industry to help me fill this out.

If there is anyone out there who is a cyber security engineer that can fill out this questionnaire I would really appreciate it. You can just copy past it and PM it to me if you want.

My current position: I'm currently a junior in college majoring in data analytics with a concentration in business (really its just a Management information systems degree but instead of the usually business classes, I take statistics and computer science coursework) and I transferred from a community college.

 What I want: To get into a masters in financial engineering/mathematics . Can't do this for bachelors as most of these degrees are only offered at a master degree level. Also heard that competition is tough to get in. 

My problem: Had some personal issues while in community college. My GPA from my CC isn't too stellar (below 3.5 but above 3.0). My math (got a 2.0 for Calculus 3) and computer science grades are horrible (my last computer science grade I got was below 3.0).

My desperate solution: Right now it seems to me that my hope and dreams are gone. As such, in a desperate attempt I came up with a desperate plan:

* I'm going to start getting my shit together and get good grades in my junior and senior year (Ikr genius plan). 
* I'm going to take a math minor (this means 3 additional math classes) to make up for my bad math grades during my CC days. As for my previously bad CS grades, I'm hoping that my CS classes in my junior and senior years will help show that I have since improved.

Cons to this plan: 

* I may end up doing subpar anyways
* I may end up getting rejected anyways for my masters anyway in which my extra effort would be wasted
* More expensive (I'm an international student so prices add up real quick for me, my parents are paying but I do care for their money).
* My graduation might be delayed by 1 semester. (blessing in disguise? This might allow me to take an internship in the summer before graduating. Might be helpful? Heard less opportunities of internships after graduation. Will internships in being admitted into a masters program?)

With that said, is it worth it to take the math minor?

Thanks for reading my post. Don't know what to write for TL;DR sorry :("

Some background knowledge: 

I’m a sophomore so return offers are not important to me and I actually hope to get a different experience from whatever internship I go to next year. 

The pay is very similar so it isn’t a factor. 

They are both unsure of whether they are in person or virtual but I expect them to be virtual and honestly don’t mind. 

I am curious about fintech so I was leaning towards Bloomberg but I honestly just want to get the best introduction to the industry as possible and will go with whichever gives me that and allows me to learn the most. 

I don’t know what team I will be on in either scenario.

https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/klpy9h/my_experience_trying_to_find_a_summer_internship/

where I described sending 190 applications and getting no offers. 

Well, I just got off the phone call from a hiring manager and I've been hired for a summer internship (software @ large corpo) and I can't believe it finally happened. My two cents are 

- What they say is true, it's a numbers game. The interview/offer I got was from complete luck. The more you apply, the more ""luck"" you have. 

- Cover letters, at least for Software, aren't really that useful. I found no correlation between callbacks from cover letters submitted. 

- Career fair has a higher rate of reply, but you must also blind apply. Here's what I found from the following methods

1)Career Fair: Higher rate of reply, but I've only landed 1 interview from a career fair (after meeting a dozen companies). I feel that Career fairs can be incredibly (especially at larger universities) crowded with hundreds of students trying to go for each company. Also, I feel COVID making career fairs virtual (plus a decrease in companies) made this situation worse. 

2)Networking: I also did the classic LinkedIn reachout w/ message as well as trying to find any former alumni who worked in an industry. I tried this for about 10 or so jobs, but each one of them turned into dead ends; ""We aren't hiring interns at this time"", ""I'm sorry...""

3)Blind-firing: Literally google any company you've heard of, navigate to their careers page, put on some music, and start grinding applications. Use 2-3 tailored resumes (I feel that trying to go into more 3 specialties is kinda too much). For instance, [Software Resume], [Embedded Resume], [Manufacturing Resume], [IT Resume], etc. and select the appropriate resume for the appropriate position. This was how I got my offer. Went to big corporations careers page, blind applied, did the screening/interviews and finally landed the job. 

Those are just my thoughts (and I could be totally wrong), but I'm just so relieved to finally secure a position. I swear, this internship process has been one of the most stressful in my life. When it came to applying for college, at least there was knowledge that you could go to community college if you couldn't get in anywhere good but it comes to internships (especially as a junior), you either get somewhere or you're screwed for the job market when you graduate. 

I know the words ""don't give up hope"" sound cliche, but it really is true (or maybe it's just survivorship bias)."

l75bga,152,2021-01-28,PSA: Low-income Applicants,AffectionateChairs,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/l75bga/psa_lowincome_applicants/,"Hi,

I know this message might not reach the people who need it the most, but it's worth a shot.

EDIT: I just read about someone who thought they had lower chances at getting into college because they were low-income. $POST 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Please ❤️. 

Thinking about going to college is a privilege. A lot of people don't understand that. If you're a low-income applicant who really wants to go to college to possibly increase the amount of opportunities you get in life, *you have a chance.*

Saying that the colleges in the U.S are an ""uber-competitive crapshoot"" is accurate if you're an Asian from the Bay Area, but I think it's time we look at the other side of the coin. Today, I will ramble about the beauty of ✨holistic review ✨, ✨need-based aid ✨, ✨choice✨, and ✨available resources✨.

# Holistic Review

Some people may begin to think that their background is not considered, it is. Things like working and taking care of family are good ECs. Just portray you. Colleges know where you're coming from. They factor that into account. You don't have to have 3 NPOs, an internship at Google, and published research to get into these schools, you just need to show that you did the best with what you had.

# Aid

A lot of applicants are demotivated by the insane sticker prices of colleges. Gladly, we have a system that gives need-based aid for students. Full ride to Princeton? Full ride to Stanford? Full ride to Harvard? They got you. Elite private institutions are amazing vessels for low/middle income applicants to break the cycle of poverty through generous aid and excellent opportunities. Scholarships from state schools? Scholarships based on financial situation? They're there. The money is always there for you. Just fill out the forms and ask for it.

# Choice

Some people on A2C cringe when they hear the words ""state school"" or ""community college"". It's *perfectly fine* if this is the only feasible option for you due to whatever reason. Pursue it! Private universities are also good options.

# Resources

A lot of things in the college admissions process have fee-waivers, this includes things like standardized tests, sending in scores, application fees, etc. Make use of these. Make use of every single thing you get for free. For crafting your application, A2C is a great place with a bunch of resources in the wiki. Standardized testing prep on the Internet. I understand this process of researching the college admissions process isn't this easy, but if you can, research as much as you can.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to work to provide everyone with the resources they need to succeed in college admissions, so that everyone knows how to play the cards they received. If anyone has any more tips, please comment them below! I hope everyone is a little more hopeful now. Stay sane. Stay safe. Peace."

l78ni5,18,2021-01-28,Accepted First Software Developer Position (.Net),Trucetht,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l78ni5/accepted_first_software_developer_position_net/,"This is to serve as some encouragement and guidance for new grads, upcoming grads, and anyone trying to land that first job.

I applied for 37 positions and out of the 37 I had 8 interviews and of those 8 I had 4 offers(MD, VA, WV, and CA).

About me: I am graduating this February with a BS in CIS, 3.3 gpa. I have 1 internship (.Net &amp; SQL Server) and 1 externship(basically an online internship). I also have Fiverr Xamarin work over about the past 8 months that I was able to display.

To start, I did not have any coding interviews. All of them, maybe because they were all entry/junior level .NET roles, asked more about terms and if you knew concepts they used. 

Resume is the biggest thing, I have seen this posted multiple times but it really is the deciding factor at the end of the day when it comes to receiving interviews. If you have to, go to career services, YouTube, pay someone, anything that will help you.

Concepts and technologies that I was asked about during my interviews include [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core 3.1 and 5.0. Every employer asked me what I knew about it, my experience with it, and to explain it. I have done multiple Udemy courses(employers enjoyed that I invest in myself and knowledge of the concepts). I do not have experience with it professionally but being able to discuss it from a project is what they were looking for. Hit on MVVM and MVC. Be able to discuss how each of them work together. Talk about SQL Server, stored procedures, views, aggregate functions, and middleware. Knowing what entity framework an dapper are will impress them as well as an entry level dev.

Razor Pages, only 3 or 4 of them asked about it but it does seem like the direction the web forms is moving in. I have worked with them in my downtime and was able to explain the different parts, client and server side as well as controllers.

Agile environment was a big one, just look it up and be able to explain how it works.

GitHub, being able to understand branches, commits, pushes, helped a lot as well as they explained that.

Be able to use other languages, I know python a decent bit just because of fun personal projects with selenium. The employer  went with seen that on my resume and asked me about it. Letting them know that you enjoy working with other languages automatically puts you in a better situation as they always have multiple projects with different language and being versatile helps. Although I main will work on .NET apps, they said I will also be trained to work with data analytics and python.

Summary:

Focus on one stack especially at the beginning. A quote or phrase that stuck with me from one of my professors is: Don't be a jack of all trades. No one wants a ""Jack of all trades, master of none."" Competition is tough out there and is only going to get tougher. You need a work ethic that sets you apart and outside projects are great.

If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will be more than glad to help as much as I can."

They gave me some advice and input career wise since I only have one semester left (graduating Spring 2022) to take advantage of school job fairs. Here is the gist of below:

1. Know what company(ies) you want to work for and build projects based on their technologies/frameworks and/or projects akin to what they build. If the project doesn't scare you it is too small. Consider you'll be working at this company for about 4 years. 
2. If you don't get, ideally two, summer's internships in you will be underbid and hiring will be difficult.
3. The first four jobs will decide the way the rest of your career is in position and pay. 
4. It's not just about getting hired, but getting hired for your worth so other companies don't continue to underbid you.
5. Usual information about difficulty of getting hired and competition due to remote work applying to the entire world as a general idea. 

Any thoughts, refutes or corrections you'd make based on what I was told? Personally, not dead set on FAANG, and would be fine with a company like Tesla or Oracle. My understanding is that you continue to leverage one pay to another and be good at what you do while avoiding being pigeonholed into IT."

I   recently applied to GM's software developer intern position and I just receive the HireVue behavior interview. I know that the next step will be a coding challenge if I can pass the behavior interview. I am wondering if anyone did the coding challenge recently and how was it like. I researched and found a few pieces of information but I am wondering if the coding problems are different now. Do you have any suggestions where to practice? How difficult are the questions?

Also, can you use Google when you doing the Coding Challenge?

Thanks in advance."

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my story:

Studied computer engineering in a foreign country, hated coding at that time. Graduation date 2014

Worked as a software engineer for less than a year, coded ABAP (Irrelevant)

Worked as a systems engineer at a bank, on IBM Mainframe servers. No coding, all system management (Irrelevant)

Left the country in 2017, went to Europe to study CS as my grad degree

I met ML and DL. Loved them. Also started to love coding

Focused on ML and DL only. Got a project with Bosch, worked at Audi for my thesis as a student (all in DL) 

Graduated in July 2019

Long immigration journey to the US

Got my work permit in June 2020

&amp;nbsp;

Looking for Entry Level Generalist Software Engineer/ML Engineer/ Data Scientist positions since August 2020

I can find references for almost all big tech companies

Not a single offer, I’m applying +30 positions each week

&amp;nbsp;

Completed Interview Cake

Read and practices Cracking the Coding Interview

I have been Leetcoding since April-May, solved almost 400 questions (15 hard questions, the rest is easy-medium 
equal distribution)

Practicing mock interviews on Pramp

It took a long time to remember the basics (I forgot almost everything) and got comfortable

Tech stack: Python, SQL, ML and DL libraries

&amp;nbsp;

Completed onsite with Amazon, got rejected (no reference)

Apple rejected after the phone interview with a team member (reference)

F5 ghosted after onsite (reference)

Countless startups rejected at the end or during the interviews

I couldn’t pass resume screening for the other big tech, or simply didn’t apply because I don’t trust myself anymore

Failed at many online assessments (on hackerrank or codesignal)

Worked as an ML Consultant for a month for a friend’s startup. He gave me a research job for a future project idea because he had pity on me.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought about Q&amp;A, Front-end, Full-stack, Back-end, Web programming, but I don’t have any experience with them, plus I prefer to stay at ML as before that I didn’t enjoy programming. I don’t want to go back to IBM Mainframes.


&amp;nbsp;


I think I’m in a very unlucky position as 

1- I can’t be an intern, not a student anymore

2- I am not qualified for new grad positions. It’s been over a year since my graduation date

3- Over-qualified for software apprenticeships

4- I can’t be qualified for the rest…


&amp;nbsp;

It’s really coming on to me not having a job since forever despite my education and the amount of time I spent for job search at the age of 31, living in the US with no money, studying the same topics, solving the similar questions, telling the same stories at the interviews… I want to throw up and run away.


&amp;nbsp;


I think I lost all my hope, and I can’t motivate myself anymore. It’s clear to me that I’m not good at this, can’t be a good programmer, and my stupid inconsistent little experiences are not enough for any position in anywhere in the US


&amp;nbsp;


So, do you think it’s time to give up?"
l7bhnn,2,2021-01-28,Anyone ever left help desk for another help desk type role? I feel like I am wasting time in my current position. Now seeing many jobs popping up... Long Post..,rmccoy12,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/l7bhnn/anyone_ever_left_help_desk_for_another_help_desk/,"  

I've been wanting to post this question for a while and I think this is a good time to ask.

Background: So, I decided to get into IT professionally in 2018. I Found a boot camp and received the CompTIA Trifecta and MSCA Windows 10. Bach degree in M.I.S. Currently Studying for CCNA. 

Chicago area Age: 35

\- **MY First IT job was more of an Internship May 2019 - Nov 2019** \- I was an Infrastructure Admin at a Software company. I dealt with Share-point. Adding and deleting in AD and Assigning Office 365 Licenses to users. We used ESET, Unifi. I monitored the network to a certain degree. I Changed guest and main WI-FI passwords etc. The head IT guy was there about twice a week and was in meetings most of the time. He left for another job a few months before I did. I was placed in front of some new to me, technologies but more less just stood there googling and you-tubing my way through at tasks I was given.

**November 2019 - I was Hired in a** **Help desk role also Temp position at a large college.** This was more of a structured IT team. We helped each other out, dealing with about 100 or so users. Changing out small network switches, imaging systems, adding users and computers to AD. Responding to tickets, Ram, hard drive upgrades etc. Covid came and we all went remote in March 2020.

**May 2020- I was contacted by a diff department at the same college.** This is a full time with benefits position and even though I felt the salary was a bit low. $42,000 I told myself, how could I turn it down especially during a pandemic. And the fact I felt that I grilled them a good amount in the interview (obviously I did not) I said, ""hey I am still new to IT and it could be a great learning experience. I settled into mostly doing all help desk tickets. I remote into a user’s computer so that they can download software, installing printer drivers, suggesting IT purchases. It is really just not much else to do. 

There are no senior or upper level IT members, there are a few Grad students who have database backgrounds. I am not sure. My manager does not have an IT background or title. So, we help each other as much as we can. But like I said its very minimal Troubleshooting.

**My interests are SyS Admin and Security Analyst or possibly something cloud related I wouldn't pass over being a Network admin either.** **I Am looking to look into getting more familiar with Python, Linux, PowerShell.**

I am very thankful to even be employed the main question is now that covid has been here for a while, I am starting to see and be contacted by recruiters and post alerts from LinkedIn, Indeed. etc. I sometimes suffer with anxiety about making these types of decisions. I know we all do. And the grass is not always greener but some of these jobs are in the upper 50-60k range, so its easy to see why they are appealing at least from the outside. I am coming up on 2+ yrs. of IT experience and that's not even counting my Certs and Collège education. I have yet to be on a team that I really have learned anything hands on from, besides the couple months I mentioned above. And that's what I feel would help at this point to further my career.

With everything I mentioned, the pandemic, etc. What are you guys' take apply for more help desk type roles or go for Jr Sys Admin etc.? Wait until I pass the CCNA? Once again sorry for the long post and extra detail lol"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
Was there any ""fuck it, I quit"" moments you had or any realization that came to you before you decided to quit?|I fell through a factory roof pretty early on. Luckily my tripod got wedged in the hole and I didn't go all the way through (30 foot drop onto rebar). There were some moments where the pregnant character in the film is using every drug under the sun. Those were tough as a filmmaker/human. But I never really got close to calling it quits. I think I pushed a lot of stuff to the background, choosing to deal with it later. Which I am now, for better or worse.
 |Oh. I read that wrong. Quit teaching?
 |Yeah. I was accepted to a teaching program here in NY and the whole process really turned me off. It was a huge money-suck, leading up to an even bigger money suck. And while I loved teaching abroad, I became further disillusioned with the US educational system my first few weeks into the master's process.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Why were you disillusioned?|How teachers are treated in the US. How I was about to spend 100k+ just to be able to teach. Many more things.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
NY teachers are paid based on experience and the union has created high barriers to entry to protect themselves from an over supply. It's a good job once you have the time in, and most have a second side hustle for the summers when you're not working. The trick is working in a bad school and then keep looking for a sweet deal in the suburbs. Six figure salaries are attainable in NY for teachers, which is unheard of in most of the US.|Good to know! Thanks. Maybe ill get back into the game if this falls apart ;)
^(the below is another reply to the second answer)|
If you don’t mind my asking, was it Teach for America?|nope i did a TEFL program
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Interesting. I fell in love with teaching in the US then became disillusioned with it in SE Asia. Came back to America and went back to teaching for a while before I just wanted to travel more.|Interesting. What turned you off in SE Asia?
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
LawHelmet: So disillusionment with how teaching is institutionalized lead to teaching everyone who bothers to watch about the opioid crisis. I’m watch and I know about the crisis. Nice one duder ________________ [deleted] ________________ nemineminy: It took me a few tries, but I think OP was saying, “You quit teaching, but you are still a teacher. Now you teach via media instead of in a classroom. I watched your film and have learned from you. Good job.”|Perfect. Thanks ;)
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Fuck this sounds sad all around... I want to watch your doc, but the thought of an hour and a half of watching peoples lives spiral out of control, maybe after some kitten and puppy videos... Are you at least doing better? I hope you don't have to sell your blood anymore|Yeah, it's certainly a darker film but I've been told the end is uplifting and even hopeful! Give it a go ;)
 |I'm doing well, thank you!
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Have you listened to the podcast Nice White Parents? If not, I highly recommend it as it might resonate with you.|Will check it out today!
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Impressive documentary|Glad you liked the film and thanks for the support! I was an English and Math teacher in Thailand and Spain before coming back to the US to do that masters course.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Where did you teach abroad?|Thailand and Barcelona.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
As an American teacher other countries are looking really nice right now.|;)
Do you have concerns about the footage you shot being used against your subjects for legal purposes? Custody battles, arrests, etc? Not just the finished doc, but all the additional raw footage as well being subpoenaed and you having to testify? I ask because I have worked on projects that that has happened on.|Great question. I can't get too in-depth but it was certainly an issue we were concerned about and ended up dealing with in post. There is a lot of creative leeway with docs and filmmaking in general, but we had a lot of work to do after our ""film first, legal later"" approach.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
“Legal later” as in, let the subjects goto court and try and defend themselves? Or like, you and your team actively protecting them?|Actively protecting them in the edit.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
[deleted]|While shooting, for the most part. In post production we handled it in depth.
I'm not even an amateur filmmaker but how did you even learn it all from youtube alone? There's so many stuff to consider when filming. From formatting, color, lighting, sound recording to post production etc. It seems overwhelming in terms of knowledge and expenses.|Yeah it was a lotttt. I think that I learned more on the ground, just doing it, than anything else. I taught myself editing first, using mostly youtube, and then started my film, learning on the fly.
 |However, I wouldn't say it was overwhelmingly difficult. Sure I made many mistakes with sound, lighting, lenses etc etc, but the end product barely shows any of these. So I would say it's easier than it looks on paper.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Incredible stuff. Bonus points for courage to do this all without knowledge. What about violent addicts? I mean there are some addicts below rock bottom that you can't even communicate. Did you encounter any and if so how did you avoid? Other more reasonable people around helped you?|Thank you! I never had a single bad experience with addicts, where my personal safety was ever in question. Needle pricks, stepping in holes, sure...but I was never robbed, jumped etc.
 |I also learned how to spot and avoid these situations. It was a small city and an even smaller drug community, and I was generally well-liked and trusted within their circles.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Yeah addicts are people. I have met some aggressive ones I guess you could call them but they are usually too busy just surviving to do any harm. I think that’s the point of your documentary right? To view addicts as people which they are. I am a recovering addict so I kinda know. I have met some very intelligent, beautiful people who also happen to be addicts.|Spot on. It's a slice of life film that hopefully causes the viewer to see be a little more patient and a little more understanding to those suffering from addiction.
^(the below is another reply to the original question)|
As a professional filmmaker, when it comes to documentaries, it's the editing that makes the movie. The other stuff is good to know, but if you want to make a documentary, learn the editing and visual storytelling stuff :)|Totally agree. A background in even basic editing will help you immensely.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
or a wonderful editor 🙃|Yes, that's THE most important part. Our editor Kait Plum was all in from the start (before we had a budget) and really came up with something special.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I thought you said you had no crew?|Hey, editors are considered as post production crew (not on the ground and coming on after everything is filmed).
Hi Hasan! I came across your [interview](https://nofilmschool.com/blood-plasma-interview) on No Film School just a few weeks ago. I'm a big fan of theirs, just like you. **Question**: Are their any other sites dedicated to film that you like to follow?|Hey! Yeah, I learned so much from the No Film School / Indie Film Hustle type outlets. I'm also constantly on publications such as Indie Wire and Metaflix for my daily film fix.
I am looking forward to watching this; it sounds absolutely fascinating. Post Industrial America is an interesting topic in itself, and I saw below it is what led you to the film's subject: the opioid epidemic. What did you teach befor you quit? I am guessing High School History? (I used to be a Lit teacher; 12 years).|Good guess haha. But I was a second grade English and Math teacher in Thailand and then Spain. I've always had a (morbid?) curiosity with crumbling factories and cities. I'm not sure where it came from but this urge to explore a decaying Americana was certainly heightened by living overseas for seven years.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Ah that's cool; I taught in Vietnam (Lit and Drama) and Phuket (same subjects, both private British international schools) and am also now back in the West. Coming back to the UK after being abroad does make me view it differently. Sometimes I feel like we are witnessing a decline of the West, or at least a significant socio/economic shift (think I read China's Asian Dream and then Prisoners of Geography in close succession and this has contributed somewhat to me thinking this too). Anyway, all this is to say I look forward to watching the film as it sounds very interesting and well done for getting it made and out there!|Well said. Yeah, I taught in Phuket also (not BIS though). Life was too good...had to get out while I could ;) Thanks for the support!
2 part question: What would you say to doc filmmakers trying to find a good story to follow and get involved with? I’ve been trying to start with smaller projects, but would hope to get more involved with a long term or feature length project at some point. Just haven’t been able to find any great starting points. Have you ever had a project you wanted to work on so badly but it just fell apart, for one reason or another? What did you do to learn from that?|I'm not sure where you're from but I don't think you need to embark on some huge, breaking news story as a starting point. The opioid epidemic is barely in the news anymore because everybody and every publication have put out something on it. So in that sense, I was late. I think what made my movie successful was the story and characters that were projected onto a backdrop of the epidemic.
 |I'm new in the industry so thankfully both of my projects (including one I'm wrapping now in the Middle East) have been a ""success"". I am prepared for a project down the road to go belly up though, as that's the nature of the biz. And I'm sure I'll be heartbroken haha. As filmmakers, we invest so much time, money and heart into these stories and characters.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
For sure! I didn’t mean to generalize a story to be some big piece. I usually prefer slice of life approaches with story telling and letting others do their thing. I’m over in Chicago so narrative/commercial stuff is dead in the water right now. Been trying to find individuals/groups to help with my work/tools. Usually the best stories unfold on their own and it’s always a pleasant surprise to be there when those surprises happen. I appreciate your advice! I only hope for the best for your future work and success!|Yeah totally get that. Tough times in the film world. Especially indie. Thanks for your questions and good luck with all :)
Hi, I am interested in watching this. Apple store says it’s not available in Germany. Are there plans for a release in Europe?|Hey, thanks for the support. Yeah, we are only live in North America but will have our worldwide release within the next few months. If you follow us on instagram (higherlovefilm) we will announce soon.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Why does it take months to make a YouTube video available in Europe?|That's what our distributor decided. It's pretty common and we had no say in the matter.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Remindme! 60 days|Will do!
Trailer is fantastic! What were your first steps to finding the people featured in the film? Were they pretty open to being recorded?|Thank you! I didn't have any choice but to just walk down the streets and knock on doors. The motel scene at the beginning was the first day I met ""the group"" so they were pretty candid from the start. They all provided me with an incredible amount of trust and eventually it was almost like they didn't even notice me sitting there with a camera after a while.
 |I think for a city like Camden, and especially for those suffering from addiction, they feel ignored/forgotten and the camera finally gives them some agency back.
I wish I could get someone interested in the same type of project but from the perspective of chronic pain patients that this heroin/fentanyl crisis is damaging. The war on drugs is really just ""we figured out how to make money on both ends of the equation."" The number of CPP's driven to suicide after having their meds taken or involuntarily tapered is way bigger than people think. One thing I experience often is being treated like a drug seeker in the ER when I'm having an attack of pancreatitis. Did you encounter many people trying to work ERs for drugs during filming, or was it all stuff coming in from other countries in the form of fentanyl or fentalogues?|""we figured out how to make money on both ends of the equation"" is really a great way to put it and so true. Might steal this for a future screening Q+A ;) Do you mean someone suffering from drug addiction trying to work the ER / healthcare system in order to get drugs?
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Yes, and also people faking injury in order to get pills to sell. I typed out a longer explanation but don't want to clutter your q&amp;a with my depressing story. Enough to say even when you have a documented history of a very painful disease, going to the ER is a lesson in learning to suffer silently at home next time.|I would love to read it, DM me if possible. Thanks for commenting.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
As a vet with a blowout back and a federally regulated job that precludes any illicit drug use (marijuana or street acquired opiates), I end up lying in pain, using my sick time to stay home from work when I have a back spasm episode. I usually end spending about 7-10 days a year in this condition. 10 years ago, I could have gotten a 30 day supply of hydrocodone and managed my symptoms. Now I get naproxen or Tylenol, and possibly muscle relaxers, which other than causing me to fall asleep are worthless. I don't really care what junkies do with themselves, they will just get fentanyl or shitty Mexican tar heroin if they can't get Oxy.|Damn, sorry for your ordeal, I can't imagine. Yeah, there is certainly a vital role that opiates play in the lives of many who truly need them. And I understand that, such as in cases like yours, doctors are becoming less inclined to prescribe them, fearing blowback amidst the opioid epidemic.
if I rent this on Prime (AUD $5) how much of that do you get?|I'm not sure of the exact numbers because they differ from platform to platform. I would guess about half of that when it's all said and done.
 |Indie filmmaking is expensive, even when you do it like I did. Expensive and full of companies/people trying to take advantage.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Have you considered offering your film through something like [gumroad?](https://gumroad.com/features/pricing) Might be able to capture more of that revenue that way|Always up for new ways to sell my stuff. Can you explain gumroad briefly?
Okay, as an unmotivated artist with a lot of ideas and a comfortable job, very simple question: how did you motivate yourself to leave comfort and pursue what you felt was important, and how did you maintain that motivation for long enough to complete the project?|I left Thailand and then Barcelona because I was getting too comfortable with my life as a teacher in these amazing cities. I can't really explain the motivation that first set me on this path but I knew that I had a lot in me that wasn't being utilized and/or explored.
 |I've maintained that push by having a giant chip on my shoulder, provided by an industry that insists on you paying your dues, inching up the ladder and constantly telling me there was no way I could make it as a first time director with no experience.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Ah. You got...justifiably mad, set out to prove them wrong, and did. Hm. I guess I need to find something to prove ... Thanks for answering so frankly.|Oh, I also got dumped. So go get dumped, it will give you some ""I'll show you"" juice.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Ah hah! Ahhh. I can relate. I started a theatre company last time I got dumped, then got with a new guy too soon who ruined the fuck out of it. Stay single, get mad. Interesting anecdotal experience. Hee. Can't wait to watch your docu, dude. How do I do it in a way that gets you money?|Hahahah great stuff. Amazon, Apple TV..any of those VOD options really. We get the same-ish cut from all.
 |Thanks for the support!
Do you have any plans on doing another documentary? Would you base it on drug addiction again?|I'm currently wrapping up my next film on the Yazidi genocide and coinciding ISIS captives still missing. I've been filming between Turkey, Iraqi Kurdistan and Syria for the last year.
 |I would love to explore the subject of addiction in further films and Higher Love is currently being turned into a narrative.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Epic, man. I am trying my best to continue filming about Japanese culture here while teaching English. It’s inspiring to hear you made it out of the English Teacher slump in such a grand fashion. I’m excited to watch your content.|Thank you! Keep chugging.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
My dad spent significant time in Sinjar working with the population there. I’ve never seen him breakdown like the day the news of the Yazidi genocide came across American news waves. How can I follow this project?|I was just in Sinjar! Wow. Follow me on instagram, we are launching a page for that particular project shortly.
 |And that day truly was heartbreaking. I can't imagine the emotions your father went through.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Is that forbidden side to of the world beautiful?|Incredibly!
Do you feel a little icky about buying and using equipment and then returning it on day 29? Edited for clarity|In retrospect, I do. I always kept the gear in perfect mint condition, (it was usually a computer to edit) and I stopped doing it towards the end.
lablaga: I don’t mean to make you feel badly, I just wondered because I would’ve let that problem hold me back. What you created is probably worth feeling a little icky. Congratulations on your accomplishment! ________________ [deleted] ________________ hi_im_vito: I used to work at Best Buy, screw them lmao. Plus now your stuff is open box which is good for savvy customers.|Perfect haha!

Super cool story! How much income would you guess selling plasma brought in? Did you just crash on someone’s couch while filming?|Yeah, my extended family is still in the area (we are originally from Camden)so I crashed with my uncle most of the time.
 |Plasma brought in about $100 per week. Enough for food/gas, a drone, and a few lenses.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Did you return the drone, too? No judgment. Just curious.|Drone #1 met its demise in a fiery wreck in the old paper factory.
 |Drone #2 had too much damage to return.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
Thanks for answering my question! What’s your take on donating plasma? Obviously needles are no big deal to you 😂|I didn't mind the needles at all, of course haha. I used to actually HATE needles. Got over that real quick in Camden.
What made you decide that this was a story you wanted to tell/explore? And has it changed you as a person and how you view the world?|It didn't start out as a story about the opioid epidemic, but rather the fall and fallout of a post-industrial America. So that was what I originally set out to explore.
 |What I witnessed and filmed has changed me a good bit, of course. I've learned to be a little more patient and a little more empathetic towards places like Camden and the people who are struggling within them.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I'm interested in watching your documentary when it's available in Australia. Here is Australia, when the government launched a ""war on drugs"" campaign, it backfired and saw a significant rise in meth use and addiction. I believe documentaries like yours helps us all understand what could be done to help those affected, instead of enacting policies that sound like a good idea.|Thanks for the comment. Totally agree. The War on Drugs here in the states has been a complete and devastating failure, as seen in cities likes Camden. We should release in Australia within a few months. Thanks for the support!

Looking forward to it! All the best on your current and future projects.|Thank you!!
^(the below is another reply to the second answer)|
It's funny how far reaching the affects area of the opioid crisis and how many people just don't see it or understand. I live in Dayton Ohio so I am too familiar with the issue, our overdose numbers were staggering. I'm looking forward to watching your video and have a lot of respect and emotion just for the title alone. I think we need videos like yours are invaluable and probably what we need to see whenever these speaking about these places and people. Frontline did a documentary on our city not long ago and I was really disappointed. I think we need to have more understanding and call one another to a higher love for our neighbors.|Thank you for your comments, I couldn't agree more. I hope to shine a light on these issues whether it's in Dayton or Camden, Flint or Gary. And yes, I hope that we are all able to look at these cities and people with a little more patience and a little more empathy.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
How did you meet Daryl? While you were filming?|Yeah I met him while filming with Nani, who we met first.
Whats the craziest thing you saw?|A single episode doesn't come to mind. Lots of ODs. Thousands of injections, drug deals, etc. Little old me was SHOOK the first few weeks filming.
 |I fell through a factory roof once (the city timelapse in the film was just before this) and luckily my tripod caught on some shingles, probably saving my life.
I ran the streets for years. Never got into heroin but most my ""friends"" upgraded to that while I was in the joint. One thing that stuck with me was when this dude overdosed but nobody wanted to help him because they didn't want to get in trouble. They just wanted to leave. He would have died. I managed to get him to the park then used the pay phone to call 911 and dip. He was saved. This was 20 years ago. Dude ODed few years ago but least he got some more time.|Well done. Yeah, this happened often in Camden, unfortunately.
Do you cover how this opioid epidemic has affected chronic pain patients? I see a lot of folks on Twitter who can't get pain meds. I'm talking about cancer patients, people who've had hip replacements, chest surgery, etc. The DEA has doctors scared to prescribe meds and it has resulted in some cruel deprivation of even a 3 day supply of opiates. Those who suffer from debilitating pain on a regular basis have been cut off or forced to undergo spinal shots to get them.|That is an aspect that I didn't realize until recently, during our festival run, when someone brought it up. One of our characters (Tye), started using pills after she was shot. That then turned into street drugs when she couldn't afford her medication any more. So while the film doesn't cover it, I will certainly do some digging into how the epidemic is effecting those with chronic pain.
Are you from NJ?|I was raised on the NY/NJ border (on the NY side) so sort of. My father and that whole side of the family is from Camden though. Most still live in the Cherry Hill / Marlton areas.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
What made you decide on Camden and not let's say Patterson or Newark?|Yeah, great question. Those cities (and many across the US) are struggling in similar ways...especially Newark. I think hearing stories of Camden growing up is what originally planted the seed. It was a touch of morbid curiosity for sure. And once I got there and met the amazing people I decided to stay for the long haul rather than turning to another city/episodic.

Camden isnt even that bad these days though compared to wilmington or north philly|Yeah. Spent a good bit of time in Kensignton north Philly. It's pretty bad up there.

Kensington is hell on earth at a level most average people in America just can’t comprehend.|So true. We got out of the car, after a year in Camden, and were stunned by what we saw. Very sad. A lot of good people doing amazing work there so hopefully they can get it turned around.

Oh man, next documentary on what's going on in East Ramapo school district! Orangetown for me.|Amazing idea. Yeah...bad, bad stuff. Co-production with me?
I see you used a A7Sii. Did you ever have any overheating issues? How many batteries did you carry with you? How was your audio capturing experience?|Oh man, at first yes!! So many lost clips due to overheating. Some things I used that seemed to help: I updated the firmware and filmed with the screen extended away from the body. I changed the batteries out when they became warm, even if they weren't done yet (I carry 8). I kept the battery door open.
 |But I still have them occasionally when I film in hot places. I'm in Iraq finishing up my next project and it's happened a few times. For audio I used a shitty Rode for most of it and had a LOT of work to do in post. Now I use the Rode Vid Mic Pro+ and it's a dream.
Since Higher Love, do you find more professional filmmakers or indie filmmakers lining up to work with you? Or has it remained a bit of the same?|I have been approached by a few big producers/networks who want to work with me on future projects. I'm currently wrapping a film in Syria/Iraq/Turkey about the Yazidi genocide and it's a co-production with well-known channel.
 |Pretty surreal. None of this happens without Higher Love of course.

Yea congratulations for sure. How did you get hooked up with John McDowell? It’s just a surprising pairing to see an established name working with a new filmmaker.|John is the man! And an old friend of the family. His doc ""Born into Brothels"" was the first doc I ever saw. My parents dragged me to it as a child and I hated it. Now its a favourite.
 |John is a legend and a musical genius. His score for this film couldn't be better IMO.
How do you feel about the fact that the entire documentary has already been uploaded to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) for everyone to watch for free?|The range of emotions reading this post was incredible.

Hi , I wanna shoot a documentary regarding the how is the life of the homeless during the pandemic in İstanbul but I don’t know where to start with the interviews (how to even get them accept an interview ) And I have no gear other than my phone . Is there a way I can solve these issues ?|Hey, what an amazing idea. And an amazing city! I've spent a lot of time in Istanbul. That's exactly where I was at when I had started. No gear or experience. I would find someone you would like to interview and approach them without a camera of course. Tell them that your working on a project about ____and you were wondering if you could learn their story.
 |I learned early on to fake it till you make it, so don't tell him it's your first time doing this, or first time with a camera. Exude confidence and it will make you both more comfortable.
 |If he/she says yes, use your smartphone as a camera, get a tripod and a friend's phone for external audio. If it goes well, rent some cheap gear the next time around.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thank you , I have been entering shit ton of camera giveaways so I could solve the gear issue but could win one . And yeah it is a beautiful city with beautiful people.|Most iPhones shoot in 4k. I use one for some shots on my current film. Good luck!
Most questions have been directed towards your film, but I wanted to ask you about your experience with teaching. What's the story? What made you go into teaching, and then what made you leave the profession?|Ahh a nice film break ;) I graduated from Villanova with an English degree and writing/journalism concentration. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I moved to Thailand to teach and fell in love with it.
 |I continued onto Barcelona and then back to New York, where I had been accepted at Columbia Teachers College. However, I quickly became disillusioned with the program itself and the education system as a whole in the US. Mostly, I couldn't picture putting myself 100k in debt to be treated as poorly as our educators are and to be in a system I didn't believe in any longer.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks so much for the great answer! I can totally understand the disillusionment. Looking forward to checking out the film!|Thanks for stopping by!
 |Thanks for the support!
How much do you love that Steve Winwood song? Bring me a higher love, ohoh|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c__noWWtdZg
 |That's actually where the title came from haha. It was our credit song until you know, they wanted a lot of money.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I’m looking to use a popular song as well in a doc and was hoping you may divulge a ballpark number of what they wanted for rights to use this song?|10-15k USD. Minimum. If it's for a non profit or something just for youtube they might go lower. But anything in festivals and/or with distribution that's my best guess.
Perhaps this is addressed in the documentary but how was the support from the family and have their views changed with your major life choice now that your work is being recognized?|The family I filmed with? The people I filmed with were all super supportive of the film, and remain so to this day. Daryl (protagonist) especially.
 |My family? Always supportive. Couldn't have asked for a better support system throughout 3 years of no income and being in a good bit of danger.
How you built the guts? I want to discover people and culture, feeling like college is a linear prison corridor, yet i dont have the guts to just move. Were you financially relaxed before taking off?|I had a bit of a nomadic childhood so I think I had built the courage to just set off. I will say though, that NONE of these places are what the media portrays. I just got back from Syia and Iraq, where I'm wrapping my next film, and can't say enough about the people and culture. Yes, that's obviously a dramatic example. Don't go to Syria right now.
 |I didn't have much savings, no. Under 5k.
What award did you win? It seems like every movie ever made has some award attached to it.|Slamdance Film Festival: Grand Jury Award Best Feature Documentary
 |2x Brooklyn Film Festival: Spirit Award, Best New Director

 |Crossing the Screen International Film Festival: Best Feature Documentary
 |Atlanta DocuFest: Best Director

^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Cool. Congratulations!|Thanks! I didn't mean for that to come in list form, or to seem braggy. I just copy-pasted it from our site :)
Why did you quit teaching?|Copying from another answer:
 |I graduated from Villanova with an English degree and writing/journalism concentration. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I moved to Thailand to teach and fell in love with it.
 |I continued onto Barcelona and then back to New York, where I had been accepted at Columbia Teachers College.

^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I’m always curious as I am a teacher of 16 yrs. I think the disillusionment stems from the idea we think teaching is delivering content but actually social work.|I think it was more from how teachers are regarded in the US vs abroad. In Thailand, education and everyone in the educational system is regarded with an incredible amount of respect.
 |That was the root of my disillusionment, but I'm sure it ran far deeper. So I got out.
Any advice for someone looking to get into documentary making? / insights from the film biz ?|Don't let the film industry and their ""pay your dues"" bullshit scare you off.
 |Just go do it. Learn the basics, buy a camera, find a subject that really interests you. What's the worst that can happen?
 |Be careful in this indie film world. Lots of leeches and the likes who want to milk you out of every last dollar.
I’ve been teaching in Camden for 8 years now. This is the 2nd documentary I’m aware of about the “City Invincible.” Have you done, or do you plan on screening your film in Camden? Have any of your subjects seen it? What was their reaction?|That's awesome, where do you teach? Rutgers? Yes we are planning on having Camden screenings. Covid put a wrench in that for now.
That is an amazing trailer! Much more gripping than most mainstream Hollywood trailers with insane budgets. How did you get past your fears and doubts to dive in without a safety net and try to make this vision a reality?|Thank you! I backed myself into a corner on purpose and didn't give myself a plan B. A lot of people in the industry scoffed at me and wouldn't even give me an internship. I used that chip and continue to use it to this day. And I got dumped, so I got that ""I'll show you"" boost haha.
The trailer looks great and I'm looking forward to watching this! As a fellow Sony user, I'm curious.. what picture profile do you shoot on?|PP 7! With S-Log assist on. Thanks for supporting.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
PP 7 is S-log 2 gamma, right? I'm just about to start filming a documentary (one man crew, run and gun style) and I'm torn between shooting in Log vs shooting with one of the Cine profiles. Did you ever run into the typical Log issue of noisy shadows?|Yes. My colorist (who did an incredible job) told me to keep shooting in Log because it allows him more flexibility and creative license.
[removed]|Sony A7sii with mostly 24-70mm Zeiss.
The trailer is haunting, and I look forward to watching. Couple questions: I'm curious, what did the subjects of the film get out of it? I'm not necessarily talking about anything monetary, I'm just wondering what they were hoping to get out of it by agreeing to be filmed? (if that was ever something you discussed with them) Also, did you show them the final cut?|There are a lot of things that go into characters agreeing to be filmed, and money is usually not one of them. I think in forgotten cities like Camden, people want to tell their story. To regain some agency. Then, of course, is an element of ego...to be on TV and have a film crew following them around.
 |I made the final cut available to everyone in the film. I know a few have watched it and loved it.
Very inspiring story bro. Three questions please: 1) Do you have any recommended links that you personally used to acquaint yourself with the fundamentals of filmmaking? Links to “editing movies” would be great but I’d love to know where you picked up lighting and sound tips etc. 2) Based on the knowledge of filmmaking you now have, what advice and tips would you give to your younger self if you could go back in time? Specifically to save him heartache with mistakes that could have sunk your project? 3) If you won the lottery and could go off and shoot your dream project with a dream equipment list what stuff would you buy and what film would you make?|I'll come back to this when I do some digging into my youtube faves. I don't know if I have a favourite, as I would just type in things like ""what is peaking on A7s?"" or ""what's the difference between frame rate and shutter speed?""
 |Off the top of my head Matt Johnson is amazing (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9rUqSA8Wu6dutv0H6fBCA) and NO FILM SCHOOL was probably my go-to podcast/website/forum. Check out Indie Film Hustle podcast as well. Alex Ferrari is the man.
 |Advice for a younger me? GET BETTER SOUND! NOT ALL CAN BE FIXED IN POST.
 |My dream equipment list is pretty basic, as I like to film everything myself, run and gun style. I would say Sony fs7, top rode mic, and the newest Mavic drone. And for what project? I'll have to think on that as I'm currently wrapping my ""dream"" project ;)

 |Keep an eye out next year ;)
Hello Hasan, Did any of the addicts ask that you pay them? What was their incentive to allow you into their lives?|Certainly, especially at the beginning. We would help them with gas money, food, etc though.
 |I think the incentive is that it's a chance to share their story. And of course, to be in a movie.

I sometimes think people in these circumstances want the chance to be heard and somehow feel validated as a human.|Spot on
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|
When you say “we” - who else did you have with you? Did you eventually build up a crew to help with filming?|Yeah I went alone and spent most time alone. Towards the post production end of things I brought on some help.

l7bzu2,5,2021-01-28,Been learning programming off-and-on for years and feel barely functional as a programmer.,Mudpill,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/l7bzu2/been_learning_programming_offandon_for_years_and/,"I've been learning Java off-and-on for years now, even taking multiple courses innit. Indidnthe Helsinki MOOC, I've done a course on Udemy, and I've taken multiple programming coursees from the actual college that I am currently enrolled in. 

However, my actual ability seems so juvenile. I mostly only write programs that output to the Java console, I've messed with GUIs before but Swing feels so unnatural to me. I don't know any real 3rd party frameworks or libraries, I don't know any backend or how to interface with other programs or databases, I don't really know any algorithms or data structures, I basically don't know anything at all that a jobbwould want from, AND I have no work experience. 

It feels like I just have been stuck in this beginner's space for so long and everytime I learn, I am just relearning all the basics once again. 

The problem for me is that I don't know how to progress. I'm not sure what to learn, how to learn it, or when I've learned it. I mean how, as just a guy at home, do I learn to interface with a database? Or create a fullstack development when I have no problem to solve? I don't even know how to package my software or upload it to GitHub.

I feel like all I learn in college is just theoretical stuff and actual basics of programming, but I never learn any practical knowledge.

I just want to be able to get a job and I don't feel marketable at all. I honestly don't feel I have the stuff to even be an intern. 

I know I'm cut out for it though, I have confidence in my ability to learn, but I just don't know what to learn.

Can someone offer some advice, or maybe even a roadmap of what to learn?

Thanks."

I’m always finding myself tweaking my resume every week or the other. I’m heavily into data analytics and hopefully data science, with an interest in cloud engineering at the end of the day.

I find recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn because I currently work help desk for my college, but I feel like my resume scares them away because it’s optimized towards data engineering and it’s easy to tell I’m not looking to work help desk for long. 

I’m also struggling to get my foot in the door for an analytic position so it would honestly be nice probably have help desk positions, I guess. I’ve tried free internships, still nothing. 

My question would be how do I lump in the three fields in a resume without appearing like a confused person?

l7ffvw,2,2021-01-28,Am I screwed if I can’t major in Finance,jkim088,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/l7ffvw/am_i_screwed_if_i_cant_major_in_finance/,"My school is a semi-target for IB, but it has a separate business school for undergraduates. Only 30% of people get accepted every year, so most people, like me, are forced to go with our second choice majors such as economics, computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, political science, etc. 

The truth is, I loved learning about business and finance last semester, so I really wanted (and had) to get in to be on the most direct path to working in the finance field. Out of the majors listed above, econ has the most similar requirements to business programs, so I might as well major in it. But I think econ is way too focused on theories and logistics rather than applying it in the real world. The business school is also well-known for preparing their students for internships, interviews, resume, etc. There’s only one degree available (BSc in Business Administration), but they allow you to concentrate in specific disciplines such as accounting, auditing, finance, leadership, entrepreneurship, etc. And my passion lies in finance and accounting.

I know it’s not the end of the world that I can’t major in finance, and I have plenty of time as a freshman. But now I’m in a more difficult position, I’m looking for words of wisdom from people who are working in the field. I’m mostly concerned about whether I should transfer to a school that allows you to major in business with no separate application (even considering going abroad but ultimately want to work in America), and what I can do from now to maximize my chance of getting in.

So lets begin with the good. I am 27 (M) she is 28 (F).

My ex and I were together for 6 years. I became very close with her family and siblings. Constantly going over to their houses for family events, dinners, and doing double dates with her siblings and their partners. Each week we made sure to go on a date forsure and spent many other days throughout our entire relationship. My ex and I were best friends, she doesnt have any friends. We took trips each year together, we got 2 animals together, we lived together for 4 years together. I would always do romantic gestures like leaving things on her car after work, or flowers randomly, or bath and spa nights. I put her on a pedastal and did my best to make her feel truly loved. 

We never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things. Thats how well we fit together. Similarly we had many of the same interests and even tried each others interest. I was there for her through tough times when both of her grandparents tragically passed away. I was an usher to walk the caskets down, which can tell you how close I was to her family. Each year I went with her family on family trips. 

Further, we had similar values. We both didnt smoke, didnt do drugs, highly valued our religion that we share and had many similar world views and values for relationships. We valued each other enough to stay in communication every day no matter what by texting or talking. When we lived together, it was never an issue with cleanliness, cooking, etc. We both did our part and never expected the other to have to do such. We had similar future goals and dreams (travel, marriage, family, living on a lake, etc.) 

I can continue, but lets just say that we both felt very happy and in love together. We both expressed this daily. I never lied to her, I never cheated on her, I never did many things that would hurt someone outright. Further, I always tried to support her with her trauma and her own issues.

Now for what happened:

My ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.

She grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and wanta to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. 

My ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.

So no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have 3 things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.

First thing:

My ex and I go to my cabin. She gets on an ATV with my cousin, I make sure they both have helmets and I tell my younger cousin she needs to drive very responsibly because my girlfriend was on it. She said thats okay and I even told my ex if she would rather drive with me she can, yet she was alright going with my cousin. 

15 minutes later they are involved in a head on collison with a truck going around a very sharp turn at like 15 miles per hour. I was following them in my car and I was behind them by like a few hundred yards so I didnt see it happen due to the curve. Anyways I ran to my exes side. Held and compressed her leg as she was bleeding. Fast forward, I followed to the hospital and went into her room and waited the whole time with her. She was able to leave within 2 hours and had a tear in her muscle behind her knee, as well as a traumatic brain injury, and further a deviated septum.

We go back to my cabin, and I pretty much take care of my ex the next 24 hours til we leave for home. I helped her bathe, get dressed, made meals, grabbed ice or heat stuff, and even tried cheering her up by watching comedies she likes. 

After dinner my aunt (mother to my cousin) asked me for help. I asked what for and she explained to me that my cousin didnt finish her test to drive the ATV before we left. I told her that I feel uncomfortable doing that and so I opted out. An hour later she asks me again but now tells me that if I dont that the state could sue my grandparents. My grandparents live month to month on their retirement and social security, thus I felt obligated. Later I found out they had insurance and that she was manipulating me. However in this moment my ex felt like I broke her trust by taking this test that I felt obligated to take. She felt like I intentionally set out to cover it up that my cousin should not have been driving. I see where she is coming from but also I felt pressured into it by my aunt and I explained this to her but she said it hurts her still and her trust was broken. I apologized by writing her a letter explaining how I never intentionally meant for that.

Now fast forward 2 months, my ex is still healing and I bring up possibly going to my cabin for a holiday and asking if she wanted to go. She said absolutely not, because my uncle and cousin may be there. I said I understand but this worried me because I was thinking about our future and how it would work regarding family occasions. I brought this up to her and we had a disagreement about it. I asked if they could come to a future wedding of ours, or if we held a family holiday would they be able to come? To which she said again absolutely not. I expressed how I felt about this considering this uncle was the one I was closest to. I said do you think in time your feelings will change? And she said no because of the permanent damage she felt from the accident. Then she brought up covering up for my cousin and that I should never speak to them again because of the pain they put her through via the accident and trust breaking. I took about a week to consider everything. During this time she thought and convinced herself I was choosing them over her BECAUSE I was arguing with her about them being in my life for future events. My family members also never reached out past the first week following the accident and she felt hurt by this. Yet, I reached out constantly and was supporting her healing process. I even wrote to her parents my apology for the damage she had been dealt. Unfortunately I will touch upon this later but her dad banished me from their house and family events.

I blocked my cousin, aunt, and uncle and sent them a long message regarding everything. Up to this point 2 months after the accident I had not spoken to them, and had been supporting my ex's healing progress. So not only did I not speak to them, but I blocked them and wrote what they did wrong and how it was not acceptable. Thus in this moment choosing her over my family members. She came back at the end of that week despite all of this and said my actions showed I chose my family over her and she felt very hurt by this. She said my actions to argue against her for people who hurt her was clear to her how I felt. These arguments were never yelling or anything, it was simply me asking if they would be able to be at certain events and my reasoning why I would appreciate them there. And even after me making my actions clear about not speaking to them since, and blocking them, she still felt betrayed because as she said, ""my actions are clear and you chose them over me.""

Well we dropped this topic moving forward because she was focusing on healing and I blocked them. Yet she still seemed hurt. Now her father is a great person, yet he is strict and he has autism. She never shared with her parents all the details. Simply the details of the accident. Before the accident I was at her house 2/7 days in a week I would say because that way my ex and I could see each other because she liked being at home. Then 2/7 days at my house. And 1 of those 4 days we would do a full date all day or all night. Anyways, since the accident her father grew very resentful to me. Despite my apology in writing, and even in person. He would argue with my ex that she needed to break up with me and that I was not a good person because I let her get on a dangerous machine. Mind you my ex is 27 and I am not controlling thus I did what I could by warning my cousin to be safe and giving them helmets. So her father blamed me, and he told I am not allowed over to their house. So now, my ex and I only saw each other at my house and less. Even so, my ex told me that she had to lie to her father where she was going because he would consistently yell at her to break up with me because I am not a good person for letting her get hurt.

Fast forward 3 more months, were still doing weekly dates and still having sex frequently. We are getting into a better place as we close into graduating. At this time, we were at our parents doing internships. I still am not allowed over and she is even having me pick her up a street over because she did not want her dad to see when we would spend time together. This was hard for me but I never argued about it and just understood despite how bad I felt that her dad hated me when I didnt cause the accident. We are spending less time together because of her father on her back, and because she doesnt prefer to always come to my house (I have smokers in the house and she hates the smell, as do I but I need to deal with it until I could move out again) i would always spray and light candles to make it better.

Event 2:

Now another month forward we are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that we are unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it must have failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have an anxiety disorder which she knew about. My panic is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and intrusive thoughts. These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: ""I am so grateful and happy for this. I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me even more then they were with the accident."" She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure some things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I push myself to work and find a career. She agrees but still seems really sad. 

I see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her thats okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast have of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby our of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. 

After seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month looking for work 8 hours a day. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat. Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.
We give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.

Another week and at this point we are going together to all of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I want to keep our baby, but if not then I still want children in our future. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision.

Finally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.

A week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. 

The day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. 

It happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.

We do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs, and still doing our weekly dates as best as we can with covid and not being able to go to her house. 

Fast forward 2 more months. And she got a job! I am still looking because in my field (teaching) they were distance learning and not in need of subs nor teachers. Soon summer was upon us and she was working 40 hours a week.

Event 3:

Well by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion, the previously mentioned betrayal she felt from the accident, and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. 

Well for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours). 

She had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things. 

Now to the most current thing:

Still in this realm of feeling sad due to time spent, and everything, my ex and her family go on their family vacation. The one normally I always go on, yet I was not even invited and my ex never brought up considering inviting me. They leave for a week and I am happy for them to be going.

When they return I plan a date for my ex and I the following day. It goes really well until the end. She begins telling me about the trip and how her sisters friends went. This made me feel sad and left out and I began to cry. I explained that I just felt excluded from her life the past few months. Especially now between the bbq and the trip where other people not even affiliated with any family member aside from being friends with them was invited. As well as the lack of her inviting me to do things we use to do together.

She is mad and tells me it is completely out of her control. And I tell her I understand completely that part (cabin/bbq) yet I wish she would try to invite me to more parts of her life I can be a part of.

The next day she is majorly distant, and so I call her and she tells me she is pissed at me. I give her a few days. Then we meet up and essentially she tells me that she doesnt know if she can give me what I need anymore. Going on to tell me that she doesnt see a future together, she doesnt want to have children with me, doesnt want to get married. She tells me that she spent a week having fun and that I ruined it by bringing all of that up. Then that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.

2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you.

A week later we meet in person to talk about the break up. We talk for 3 hours. During this talk, she tells me many things that floor me mentally but I simply just take it because I didnt want the possible last moment to be negative. 

She tells me that she has had so much clarity the last 3 weeks. She said that she realized first that I broke her trust and that really hurt, but then being she was in such a vulnerable place from this moment with the accident that when she had to decide about our baby, that I WAS THE REASON she chose to have the abortion. She goes on to say that my actions showed her I didnt want to have our baby with her, that my actions of having a panic attack and being distant were clear to her (despite me never once thinking I didnt want to have our baby with her). She broke down telling me this and I simply told her repeatedly I am sorry you believe that but that was not the case and it seems what I tell you, you do not believe. She said my actions were clear. So she essentially blamed me for our abortion, and the accident. Yet I chose her in the accident by both supporting her and blocking my family, as well, with the abortion I was supportive of her and keeping our baby, not to mention she never brought this up ans her reasons were focused on her parents opinion and her fear of that.

Then she goes on to say our relationship became so toxic the last year that she now needs to find herself and heal. That she needs major space and time and that maybe in the future we could be together. Then she said she may need years of space from me to have a clean slate from what I did to her. She said she loves me, that I am an amazing person and I will have a great life. She will always care about me and is grateful for the amazing times we spent together. But she said she needs to do what is right for her. 

She removed myself, my friends, and all of my family members from social media. Removed all of our photos and posts. Did not block, but asked me not to contact her. Which I have respected for months now. She said I can keep the animals and all of our belongings in storage from when we lived together. She has 0 friends as I believe I mentioned before because she has trouble both connecting and trusting them. But her one sibling that I am still friends with has posts on her wall that my ex posted and tagged her in so I can see them. They are about essentially ""Someone who loves you wouldnt do this, or someone who loves you shows you in their actions"" and other stuff seemingly out of resentment towards me. 

Since our breakup I have felt deep deep remorse, for our abortion, and the blame she put onto me. As well, grief, from her leaving me and outright projecting so much of her pain she never mentioned previously onto me.

I have been doing better each day, working 3 jobs now, planning trips, and my future. Been on depression medication that helps also my anxiety for months since our breakup and seeing 2 therapists weekly. 

So of course this was a long story. Sorry. But I wanted to get it out of my mind since I havent been sharing this with anyone except my therapists. 

What is your take on what has transpired? I am struggling deeply with all her blame. I feel like I was supportive and she told me I was not as much as I could have been. Meaning I didnt meet her expectations and ultimately she concluded by that, that I was just downright NOT supportive at all. Which like I said I feel is so untrue :(

TLDR: My ex and I had no issues, then it all fell apart after an accident, her abortion, and a lack of spending time together this last year. She blames me for being unsupportive and says I was not there for her when she needed me."

Not sure whether the internship or the ranking of the school is more valuable.

So I am going into my first year of Computer Science later this year and I've got a selection of 3 schools. For context I live in Canada and these are Canadian Universities. At one school I've got an early acceptance as well as a school sponsored internship with Shopify that are all but guaranteed at this point, but the school isn't particularly well known for it's Computer Science program. It's not a bad school by any means, all 3 of the schools are in the top 20 in Canada for comp sci, but I've got better options. Along with this internship comes a full ride scholarship and a decent salary, keeping in mind that it is an internship, but with the other two schools I would have to actively look for internship opportunities as well as take out a loan to pay for school. The other schools are reasonably higher on the ""rankings"" I guess. So my main question ends up coming; to do I go with the school guaranteeing me an internship and a scholarship, or choose a higher ranked school?"

It’s definitely a risk, but I think it could also expedite my new career much faster as well. I only have enough time for class and never any time to prepare, much less apply for internships.

I was just curious and wanted to see how stressful your SWE internship experiences have been. 

I've done two prior internships, with opposite levels of stress. The first one (defense) was almost completely stress free (no pressure for interns, great WLB for FTs), and another (fintech) that was very stressful. I'll be interning at another fintech company this summer. How stressful have your internships been, and do you think the type of company/sector influences this?"

Got one interview through on campus recruiting and converted it. So I am going to Bay Area for PM in a big tech company. However, if I couldn’t have gotten this offer (knowing it was biggest chance I put my best in the case interview and cracked it), I would have been in a terrible situation right now. No calls till end of January. 

Now, I am wondering if I don’t convert my internship offer next year, how will the FT search going to look like. I have 2 main questions. 

1) Do you think PM internship on a big tech allow me to at least receive some calls for FT recruiting?

2) What did I do wrong? Is it my background or is it my actions? Both? Is it the market? You can be cruel."

I'm going to call the boss (who is the CEO/founder of this start-up) B, the intern who hired me C, and so on.

I was trained on my first day, and was set to work (work that wasn't in my job description, but for the most part, I know that interns are give a lot of grunt work). Since then, I have essentially worked 9-5, and more recently 8:30-5, and sometimes B pulls me into meetings at 4:50 telling me to get another batch of work done by morning.

I was promised an offer letter by 1/25, and it never showed up.

What broke the camels back for me, was when I learned that I was going to be taking over the hiring process of new interns (for a job I hated, and disrespected my time) because the two interns who worked there now, were leaving.

So I'm going to put my main legal question here, I guess. I looked over the unpaid internship fact sheet from the department of labor, and number 6 really stood out to me.

Essentially, my knowledge of the company is limited, but there is the founder/CEO ""B"", there is her son, who does some work and I would hope is getting paid, and then another person who I would hope is getting paid in some capacity (it feels more like a business partner relationship). And then there are the interns, who are unpaid, doing part-time to full-time work (full-time for me), from my perspective, and what I learned from the other interns (who have left by now) are the only ones keeping the business afloat. Literally, it is the interns who do the work of prospecting new members, emailing current members, running the business from a worker level.

So on the fact sheet [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships) it says:

6. The extent to which the intern’s work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.

I am not really complimenting anyone's work, and nor is anyone else. I started looking into this last night, and thus far, I have hired 2 interns through my email address (which supposedly can also be legally fuzzy and bad as I was made aware of).

B is really nice. I'm sure she doesn't mean for this to be illegal, but it really feels like she treats me like a full time paid employee.

I also know nothing about ""the law"" in terms of anything, it just seems like this is something that I should look into and ask about, before anything gets worse.

l7y4n6,1,2021-01-29,Can hard work be enough to make it in a field filled with super-smart people?,MrMeMan555,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/l7y4n6/can_hard_work_be_enough_to_make_it_in_a_field/," 

Hello everyone, I wanted to come and ask a question that's been nagging at the back of my mind. Am I too dumb for computer science? I would really appreciate some input on this. This is a bit wordy, but I want to be clear.

Basically, I've enrolled in my local school's computer science undergrad program with the intention of applying to their master's in computer science program next year (I've started the undergrad in case I don't get into the master's program). I recently completed a psychology undergrad from the same school, but with Covid further constricting already limited opportunities for Ph.D. roles in my state, I've decided to switch paths. For some background info, I went to a compSci magnet school in high school where I did okay and found that although I wasn't a super quick learner, I actually liked programming once I caught on to it.

But, I'm wondering if I have the intellectual horsepower to make the cut in computer science. Throughout my life, I've never been the smartest guy in the room. In fact, I think I am completely average when it comes to things like math and problem-solving. Where I've always made up for this is my work ethic. I've simply put in the time to do something well, no matter how long it took, and it's paid off in lots of ways up to this point. (I'm 28 and have been in the workforce for quite a while. I've been promoted to management roles several times, was offered rare and solid internships in my Psych program, earned a near-perfect GPA in that degree, etc.

But, my concern is that work ethic alone won't be enough to make the cut in when it comes to getting a CompSci degree and making a solid living afterward. To clarify, I am a systems-based thinker, things like programming and calculus make sense to me and I enjoy them, but it takes me a while to catch on to them. So, in a field with so many intellectual giants, can an average guy like me get a good job and make a decent living if he's dedicated?

Thanks for reading."

I may be over thinking this too much but I don’t want to mess up this opportunity. Yesterday I had an interview for an internship with a government agency for a cyber security position. I think they really liked me and that I have a decent shot at the position. At the end of the interview he was talking about next steps and between being nervous and excitement about how well I did I can’t recall if he said he would reach out to me in an email requesting my availability of that I should email him my availability. I have a draft email with my availability and something along the lines of “thank you for taking the time to interview me yesterday, here is my availability as you requested..” the interview was yesterday at 2 and they haven’t reached out yet.

Anybody who lives/ lived in any of the following cities please comment ABOUT what is living like in these cities as a teen or young adult and i ll edit it in andalso if you wanna add more cities , please lemme know:

**NYC :**   NYC- FUCK THE MTA. Thats it.

local food joints are a lot cheaper and far more worth it. try going to parks if the ones around you are safe (yes, there are a lot of parks in nyc. playgrounds and small fields and whatnot). learn how to walk fast because people will be very annoyed at you (rightfully) if you walk slow

DO NOT BE TOURISTY YOU WILL WASTE SO MUCH MONEY (and im 99% sure that 99% of us will be broke college students)

  I kind of only have subway advice from the days before the plague lmao but: No need to fear New Yorkers, just put on your lost tourist face and almost anyone will help you out with directions or whatever. The subway fare recently jumped an extra dollar to $3.75 which really really sucks, but most colleges are located in Manhattan so you can probably just walk to a great deal of places. Ignore the rats and they’ll probably run away; your bigger problem is dick pigeons that have no fear and stare you down in the middle of the street til you walk around them. Also, generally speaking you’re better off (more comfortable) just standing on the subway than squeezing yourself in the middle seat. Also if you’re on an evening rush hour subway packed like sardines and the poor tired conductor is yelling at people trying to get on that there’s another train right behind this train, they’re usually telling the truth. Just get off and wait, because that next train is usually so empty you can even sit down. For Christ sake don’t lean on the poles, and it’s ok to stand by the doors as long as you get out of the way when people are trying to get off. 

**washington DC :**  georgetown is lovely! there’s so many fun things to do around here and during spring when the cherry blossoms bloom it’s absolutely gorgeous! the museums are super fun (i recommend the spy museum!) and the zoo gets new baby pandas every 2 years!!!! if you’re a poli sci major or business major, the internship opportunities are endless! DC has such a vibrant community and it’s such a fun place to live. there’s never a dull moment. make sure to stay out of some more dangerous areas downtown, that’s the only thing i would say is an issue. you can take the train anywhere you want, and basically everything is accessible. the food is so great too!

I'm like 15 minutes away but im still there a lot

the metro's pretty expensive for what it is, but you can get around most of the area pretty easily without too much hassle (esp compared to trying to drive into the city)

there's a bunch of free stuff to do! all of the museums are awesome (esp the botanical gardens &amp; the sculpture garden nearby, they have ice skating in the winter!)

there are always a ton of tourists and families around the mall (at least precovid)

some parts are actually so poorly designed and really difficult to navigate, but that's mostly the richer residential areas (almost cried doing a driving lesson there)

food's pretty good but a lot of places are crazy expensive

there are some places you should definitely avoid but it's sometimes hard to tell that you're headed into them esp if construction's going on

if you are going to georgetown uni, pls pls pls try and get out of georgetown/NW DC and explore more of the city! Georgetown (the neighborhood) is expensive af and if you spent all your time buying 15 dollar salads and shopping from the boutique stores there you will be bled dry come the end of freshman year. Seriously, DC has so much culture that isn't captured in the racially and socioeconomically homogenous region of NW DC (Adams Morgan, Georgetown, Chevy Chase, Kalorama).

Highly recommend exploring all the museums (they're free) like National Gallery of Art, Natural History Museum (a classic😌), Museum of the American Indian, and Newseum (gotta pay for this one but it's worth it imo). After the museums, check out the U Street, Shaw, Logan Circle, Petworth, and Columbia Heights neighborhoods. There're a lot of cool murals that celebrate the black history of the city (DC used to be called Chocolate City). There's food from all over the world: delicious Ethiopian food in Silver Spring, MD and literally Georgian, Uighur, Uzbek, asian fusion, mediterranean, etc. restaurants all around the city, you just gotta go look for them. Eastern and Union Markets are good places to explore with friends, as well as the Wharf (go to the fish market for hush puppies and clam chowder instead of the developed area). There're a lot of great coffee and music places (Tryst, Songbird, Black Cat, Velvet Lounge, basement concerts) for like 18+ and 21+ year olds. Idk if you like clubbing Ultrabar allows 18 year olds but there are also 40 year olds who frequent those places so watch out? You can kayak at the Navy Yard, go to Zoolights, get food and walk around the city (its a pretty walkable city) if you're going on a date.

Know that DC is very much a city that's tailored towards 20 year olds. There's animosity between locals and transplants (a lot of people from around the world not from DC live in DC) because gentrification is pushing a lot of black and brown folks into the edges of NE and SE and SW. Everything around the National Mall/GWU closes after 7pm (when all the commuters from the burbs go home from their day jobs). GET OFF THE RED LINE AND EXPLORE OTHER METRO LINES PLEASE.

**Seattle:**   if i’m being honest it really has gone downhill in the past few years, and a LOT of people are moving out of the city to get away from it lol but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some perks! the downtown area is nice by pike place and on the water, and there is some great shopping/small businesses. the area by UW’s campus can be sketchy but U-Village is a super cool area for shopping and dining!

**LA:**  as someone from california who has spent a lot of time in LA, i personally hate it . it’s nice if u like the city and don’t mind smog and traffic but personally, i love open spaces and nature. also a lot of LA is dirty imo and it’s very expensive

You don't have to pretend to like boba if you move to southern California. The ones that always make a big deal about it are typically the ones that do it to compensate for their lack of personality from my experience.

LA is a car dependent city, and it's pretty limited where you can go using public transit depending where you go, and what area you live in. Also be mindful of where you are going, avoid places like the ""jungle"" or the ""projects"".

Food can get pretty expensive, so try to balance it out with cooking your own food or food from the dining hall if you have a meal plan. But also check out areas like thaitown, koreatown, little tokyo and other similar areas.

If you're from out of state, stay at the dorms first, and ask other people about which apartment options are the best and affordable. But this also applies to people instate as well.

**Pittsburg:** 

(I don’t go into the city itself much but I live in the region so I’ll give this a go) I like it but I’m kinda biased. I’ve noticed a strong sports culture and good food, and quite a bit of city pride. Driving in the city is a pain from my experience (which, admittedly, isn’t frequent), but public transport isn’t great either from what I’ve heard. Has nice parks, and if you go to CMU you get free visits to the Carnegie museums. Lastly, avoid Homewood.

Edit: forgot the weather. Yeah, not the best, it’s pretty gloomy but I’m used to it, take that as you will.

Edit 2: I’m going off of both my experience and general impressions, like how I many not go to Homewood, but have heard about it on the news for crime more than some other areas and have been told to avoid it by others.

 

**Southern California:**

Wildfires are getting worse and worse every year. Before, we would only see them on the news; now we evacuate. Even if you don't have to evacuate, the bad air quality makes it horrible.

As far as the beach goes, it can get super crowded during the summer, but honestly that doesn't bother anyone too much. If you know the right places/the secret beaches, you can get an entire beach to yourself. Honestly, the beaches here are so beautiful (except for the ones that have too much seaweed :/) and I'm going to miss the beaches so much next year when I go to college :((

There are boba shops everywhereeeeee. Everyone loves boba. Even if you don't, pretend you do.

We go crazy when it rains!!!

One critique of LA specifically: the city plan is wack in terms of public transportation. The city is too spread out to make public transportation feasible, but the streets are too narrow for traffic to be avoided. There's basically traffic all the time.

 

**SF:**  you WILL need a jacket, it doesn't matter that it's the bay area, the fog is cold. Also ridiculously expensive. Still, it's really close to a lot of gorgeous areas and great hikes. There's definitely a lot of homeless people, that part isn't exaggerated. The food is the BEST, there are so many options. There's so many fun things to do in the city and nearby and you definitely won't run out of ideas.

 Born and Raised here and can say I throughly enjoyed it. I will be do my best to honest about my city. There is a thinly veiled facade of anti-racism here. While there is little hate crime or overt racism, this is a city where 5% of the population is black yet 30% of the homeless population is black. The working class struggle against the rich who stagnate progress on issues from housing to policing. It is absolutely expensive here, especially if you are not local and don’t know where to find cheap food and goods. Homelessness and crime is a problem here, though not quite as big as the media portrays it. The crime and homelessness is centralized in a specific area, which is avoidable and I would absolutely not recommend going to. Beyond our faults lies an amazing city, however. We value community based organizations and locally owned business. There is an incredible amount of things to do here, as well as in the rest of the Bay Area. San Francisco has all major sports teams, and an incredibly active population. Out here, We run, we hike and we bike. We enjoy the luxury of being able to be active in such a breathtaking area. Whether you want to surf in Santa Cruz or hike in Muir Woods, they are both an hour and a half away from San Francisco. Finally, the locals love the Bay. If you want to blend in, buy a Ben Davis jacket, San Franpsycho t shirt and SF Giants hat. I hope this helped and I hope you come and make your mark on this amazing city. 

**Also dont call it ""frisco"".**

**BOSTON:**  Honestly it’s a very solid college town. Perfect size and everything. Students can easily hang out with students from nearby Universities, and it’s super easy to get around with uber and the MBTA.

Boston is very public transport friendly. Great boba/food. Easily walkable too imo. Good shopping/things to do in general. Pretty expensive in the Financial District where I lived. I never felt unsafe walking alone at night in the Financial District at least.

**CHICAGO:**  Chicago: Love the heart of downtown and has many solid things to do, good food(absolutely love the pizza) , good people, good times, good food. There are a lot of homeless people on the streets which might seem scary at first but they won't bother you if you don't bother them! It can get a pretty sketchy in certain areas, but most of the schools truly downtown are pretty separated from it all. I absolutely love the Chicago suburbs, while it might seem like some of the smaller towns don't have much to do, its usually a quick trip to the city or larger towns.

In Chicago, there are these golden weather periods where everything is perfect and the trees are green and everyone's out (even during the pandemic, albeit safely) and I think ""man, this is the best city in the world, why do I wanna leave this place"" and then November hits lmao

Also, go to a Cubs game. Wrigley Field is an experience you will remember.

**TORONTO:**   UofT is so so nice! It's got an old campus feel with nice old architecture and all but the buildings are spread out throughout the downtown area so you never feel secluded at all. Everything is within walking distance but there are also subways and buses and streetcars running everywhere if you need (although waiting for them can be a major pain sometimes). The city is so multicultural so there's every kind of food from every country you can imagine! Museums/shopping/parks/restaurants are everywhere so you'll never get bored. Winter is horrible though, it's super cold and just depressing while summer is terribly hot and humid. Toronto's pretty expensive though, depending on where you're coming from.

**Vancouver:** This city is actually so nice but pretty expensive. You've got the mountains, beach and big city all in one place making it perfect to do outdoorsy activities but also just wander around town. UBC is kind of isolated but there are buses that take you everywhere and it just makes it feel a bit more like a campus. Definitely some areas are a bit sketchy but overall it's a safe city with tons to do and amazing food. It rains a ton here but the temperature's mild year round.

\-The UBC campus is super nice! it's really pretty and the weather there is pretty mild, both in summer and winters, although it does end up raining a LOT during winter. HUUUGE asian community, especially in the richmond area, but that also means REALLY good asian food. a lot of the recreational stuff in van is like hiking/going to the beach/biking etc, since vancouver has forests, mountains and ocean, so be prepared to be active. public transport is pretty extensive, although sometimes you end up waiting 25 minutes for a bus. downtown is also pretty nice, but there' certain areas/streets (hastings, etc) that are quite sketchy. avoid those. living costs are also quite high tbh.

**Montreal:**   love this city so much. Awesome size, affordable, diverse. Great bike infrastructure, restaurants, summer festivals, amazing Metro system. Beautiful architecture, very LGBT friendly. Downtown is very bilingual. Lots of clubs (drinking age 18), incredibly low crime rate, lively downtown, such a happy feel everywhere as soon as the weather warms up at the end of April and the terrasses open and everyone's eating outside in their jackets loving the sunshine. Winter's cooooold, ngl. You've gotta embrace it and skate outside on campus, on the river in old Montreal, in the parks, cross-country ski on the mountain, or just hunker down and study for 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

**MIAMI:** Miami is both amazing and horrible. The weather can be fabulous and the nature is so vibrant. When the sun is out it feels like you're living in a ""indie"" snapchat filter that raises the saturation. So much diversity; the cultural melting pot of America. If you want to meet people from around the world and see more cultures then come here! You better know some Spanish, because now more people speak Spanish than English down here. If you like the beaches and you can deal with the heat then Miami is perfect. Also get used to rain and you have to be comfortable with nature; ants and lizards and bugs and roaches will come into your house. Also a great place if you like art as we have many large art festivals here.

BUFFALO

ROCHESTER

**ITHACA:**  I was born in Ithaca, but it’s been a few years since I’ve visited so take this with a grain of salt.

First of all, it’s gorgeous. Even though the town lacks in accessibility (it’s at least an hour away from major cities), it has some of the best scenery I’ve ever seen. There’s waterfalls (yes, waterfalls!) nearby and it borders Cayuga Lake as well. It gets really cold in the winter, but summers are literally perfect.

Ithaca is dominated by people associated with colleges (students, professors, etc.), and the town reflects this as well. I remember there being a lot of restaurants with options ranging all the way from vegan to Greek and there’s a pedestrian mall called the Ithaca Commons. Overall, the people are super nice, and if you decide to come here, it will definitely be 4 of the most memorable years of your life.

NEW HAVEN

**ATLANTA:**   One thing I will say is that the roads are absolutely CRAZY. they'll be 5, 6 lane roads just running through the city and its a nightmare when you arent sure where you're going.

**AUSTIN:**

Austin is cool, but so many people have expectations that are just way too high. If you go and look up “best city in America” I guarantee that Austin will pull up on at least one. Austin isn’t bad, but it isn’t the idealistic wonderland that it is made out to be. It’s a real city with real issues, and just because you went for SXSW doesn’t mean that you will love it.

The Awesome: lots of interesting food choices, live music if you’re into that, excellent job opportunities after college, like a combination of Nashville, Seattle, and Texas hill country

The meh: housing prices aren’t necessarily terrible compared to places like DC or NYC, but it is much much more expensive here than in the past. Almost everyone’s houses have doubled in value in the last ten years. Do not come thinking you’re getting a cheap experience. Definitely more expensive than Houston and Dallas. Another thing that isn’t awesome is people tend to be pretentious, but not like in Dallas. It’s more pretentious in a hipster way, whereas Dallas and LA are places that are pretentious in regards to money.

The awful: traffic is terrible, because the population growth has far outpaced the infrastructure development. Another major issue is the homeless downtown. If you go to UT, expect to see several homeless people on and around campus. They are trying to solve this issue, but the crisis is worse than almost anywhere else not names Seattle or Portland. Also, tons of people wear UT merch despite never have attended the school. THE WEATHER SUCKS, in august almost every day is over 100 degrees. Winters aren’t even that mild a lot of the time like some would expect (Although it’s been warm this January). Weather is not like Miami.

Other things to know: overwhelmingly liberal downtown, suburbs tend to be mixed. Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are pretty close by, but leaving the state of Texas from Austin is at least a 5 hour affair.

DENVER

**DALLAS:** Uhhh Dallas is not public transport friendly at all. You need a car on campus. The DART tram goes through downtown but it can feel sketchy at times if you're alone and the stops aren't super conveniently located. Parts of Dallas also have really high crime rates but downtown and uptown aren't so bad. Oak Lawn is also a great location for nightlife/convenience in general but far ish from the universities. Rent is increasing at a relatively fast pace. Increasingly diverse foodie scene. Dallas suburbs are a better mix of lower rent but still good access to entertainment/shopping/food if you have a car and can drive (especially Plano/Frisco/Carrollton)

**\*\*PHILLY:\*\***Philly is a beautiful city. If you’re going to Upenn please don’t walk off campus too far. If you’re going to Temple, rip. Go to magic gardens, every indie trendy philly teens home. Living in philly shapes you as a teen, it really is kind of like a culture. Don’t get a cheesesteak from Pat’s and don’t tell anyone you aren’t an Eagles fan.

**Baltimore -** The bad reputation we have is completely overblown; Baltimore is a really fun, charming quirky city that has a very distinct underdog personality to it. Charles Village, Hampden, Mount Vernon and Station North are all fun areas to explore—lots of vintage and thrift shops, trinket stores, places to eat, etc. All of these neighborhoods are extremely walkable as well. Once COVID goes away it’s always fun to see movies at either the Charles or the Parkway Theater in Station North or visit the BMA, AVAM or Walters Art Museum. Public transit isn’t great, but if you don’t have a car either the bus or the light rail can take you to the places that have the most action going on. No one goes into the Inner Harbor except tourists. Areas around JHU are completely safe as long as you aren’t doing anything stupid like looking at your phone at night with headphones in while walking around. Please make sure to be careful when you’re around roads though! We’re known to be absolutely terrible drivers haha.

**Blacksburg, VA (V tech):**  I sent a summer on campus at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg Virginia and staying there was so nice. There are so many activities to do and on the weekends people and families visit campus to play with their dog or hangout downtown and the vibe is so amazing. There are farmers markets, hiking trails, so many farms for fruit picking. It's a college town in the middle of no where so there is just so much for Blacksburg to offer!!

ETC.

I'm preparing for applying for coding jobs soon and I am wondering if anyone has advice on what kind of roles I can reasonably aim for and how to prepare. 

I suppose it's natural for me to aim towards Data/ML jobs, though I am open to anything really. 

Right now most of what I've been doing is leetcode problems (python algo stuff mostly, but some SQL too). I've looked at some ML books and tried my hand at a few ""projects"" just for practice (mostly exercise level stuff, nothing fancy).

I did do a coding internship - but that was in 2013. So I'm not sure I will put that on my resume since I may not be able to give good answers to questions regarding it. 

Thanks for any input!"

I'm currently about 50% through a documentary I filmed on my own dime with my own gear. Now that I need to do things like motion graphics/audio mastering I'm finding I've hit a wall, and I cant afford to pay anyone to help me. How did you get over this inevitable hurdle? Its one thing to grab a camera and shoot, but the part where you need to survive to finish it is something else entirely.|I hit that wall also. What I did was, I edited the first 30 mins of the film into a sort of extended sizzle. Music, basic coloring etc....just what I could do myself. I then it to people who fell in love with the project and agreed to continue on with backpay.
[deleted]|Find a subject or subject matter that really interests you. Then do a little research on cameras (most iphones are now 4k) and go out and do it. It really is that easy, and can be done for almost no money.
 |Watch youtube tutorials, learn to edit (easier then it sounds), and go knock on some doors. You can always go back to the rat race :) DM me, I would love to keep chatting and lure someone else out of the ratrace.
How did you deal with getting it into festivals or what was your process of distribution like?|That was certainly an experience. I was a first-time director and our small team was also pretty green, so we were unable to play the politics/name game. So we did blind submissions to the A/B tier ones and crossed our fingers.
 |Luckily we got into Slamdance and won the grand jury and it all snowballed from there. We also got a distribution deal at Slamdance.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
That’s awesome. I am currently working on my own documentary and am truly inspired.|Cool! Hit me up on instagram if you have further questions about the fest scene etc.
Very inspiring! The hardest part for me is when we have to get the film out there. How did you plan for release?|Thank you!
 |We knew we had a great film but getting it out there was really tough for us as well. We didn't really have a plan or any money, so we just blindly applied to the major fests and got lucky with Slamdance. I would NOT recommend that to any first-time filmmakers.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Awesome! And yeah makes sense with those big fests. To follow up, do they then set you up with broadcast/streaming or is that a whole other pitch you need to make?|There are a lot of details but simply, the road we went down:
 |Festivals, approached by sales agents at fests, get good press/screenings at fest, choose best sales agent, sales agent takes it from there.
What city was it? You somehow neglected to mention it in your blurb and I’m feeling dickish|Good catch. Camden, NJ.
Im a teacher myself and am curious, did being in that profession influence/inspire your drive to make this documentary and, if so, did it aid in your ability to make such a successful documentary?|Yeah, I taught adults (night class) in Barcelona and that really helped me down the line with confidence in interviews. If you believe it, they believe it.
 |I don't think the teaching profession lead me to doc film but teaching abroad and the travels that ensued certainly opened my eyes to other cultures and made me even more curious. And I started making travel films with one of the first go-pros, which was probably the original seed that brought me here.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Very cool. Thank you for putting yourself on the line to help address such a serious issue. And thank you for responding. Peace and love.|Thanks for stopping by and for the questions
I'm not sure if you're still answering questions but there's a film I've always wanted to make (I won't bore you with the details), but knowing how niche of an audience it would attract I have never delved in to it as I know it would be a money and time pit. But, seeing how you walked away from teaching to dive in to making your film, I'm feeling adventurous again. I'm curious though, what provisions did you have in place, if any, for if the whole thing went to shit? And while you were traveling and filming, what was something that came up that you wish you'd have planned for? I'll be watching your film this weekend, so thanks for posting!|I'll be here all night, as the world burns ;) I didn't have any plan B, no. Which is why I think I was able to make the jump out of teaching. I guess I could have gone back to teaching, or writing, but I never really thought about those as options.
 |Something that came up while traveling and filming that I wish I planned for? Well I didn't plan for anything, so everything was a surprise. I guess I should have known how hard it would be to try to start a travel show with your (now ex) gf, with no money, or real plan. Ahh to be younger and in lust. ..
 |Sorry, losing my mind. Thanks for the support I hope you like the film!
Just watched the trailer and looking forward to watching the entire thing! If you're still answering questions I have a few technical questions at the tip of my brain: 1) What apertures did you find yourself shooting in a majority of the time? Especially curious about your approach to low light scenes. 2) Speaking of low-light, what was your preferred method of dealing with SLOG noise in the shadows? 3) Did you lean on the A7SII autofocus much during this shoot? Have a lovely day!|The A7sii is amazing in low light and I of course tried to shoot at as low of an aperture as possible. But the majority of the time I shot at F8 and also used a great adjustable ND.
 |For slog noise I keep fstop as low as it goes and keep the ISO down as much as possible. I then like to add a tiny bit of external light, whether that's a door cracked or an iphone light off to the corner of the room.
 |I leaned on autofocus while I learned the camera, as it was one more thing to worry about when I legit had no idea how to film. You can see some focus pulls that were NOT intentional but now ppl think were an artistic choice haha. As I gained confidence, I went to manual.
 ^(the below has been split into three)|
From a photographer would like to venture toward photojournalism/editorial 1. How did you build trust with the subjects?|They sort of just let me in from the start (that motel scene at the beginning of the movie was my first night with ""the group"") They all provided me with an incredible amount of trust and eventually it was almost like they didn't even notice me sitting there with a camera after a while. I think for a city like Camden, and especially for those suffering from addiction, they feel ignored/forgotten and the camera finally gives them some agency back.
2. Did you have contacts before going on or did you just go in blind?|I didn't have any contacts and went in blind.
3. What was the most difficult part throughout the whole process?|I think the most difficult part was having to sit back while people destroyed their lives. Especially when that also deeply effected others, such as their children and unborn babies. Those were certainly the toughest parts to film and still stick with me today.
 ^(the below has been split into two)|
I guess I have a cpl questions: 1. What got you interested in addiction itself— and filming it? Did you experiment with them at some point in your life, or had loved ones to be affected by drugs, maybe?|I didn’t set out to make a story about heroin or street drugs, and in fact, it didn't start out as a story about the opioid epidemic at all, but rather the fall and fallout of a post-industrial America. I would still go so far as to say it’s more a film about love and addiction, projected onto a backdrop of a post-industrial city struggling with the current epidemic.
2. Do you have any opinions on the drug war? (do you think drugs should be decriminalized?)|The drug war is a complete failure, and yes, I would push for a similar model to that which Portugal has implemented with great success. Let's see what happens in Oregon.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Ty so much for your insight. Plan to see your film and I hope a lot of others do too! Good luck and Godspeed in life!!!|Thank you! And thanks for the support.
Have you ever used Heroin/opioids? If not did you ever feel tempted while making the documentary?|I never have used them, no. And never felt the urge to while filming.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks. I have difficulty watching these types of things because of past addictions. I make it through but it puts me in a difficult head space.|Understood completely :)
Where can I watch in the UK?|Our UK release is coming soon! Some people on this thread have had luck with VPNs.
Hey there! As someone quite familiar with Camden and just now seeing this AMA, I wanted to ask why you chose Camden specifically for this?? Also having spent the time that you did both in this city and on the issue, what are your thoughts and feelings about Camden as a city, and legalization of drugs in a broad &amp; general sense?? Looking forward to watching!|My father and his side of the family is from Camden, NJ, although they left in the 70s. They all remained in the general area and they have so many good/bad stories about Camden so it's always been a place that I've wanted to explore.
 |Also, I didn't have a budget and Camden was close enough where I could go make my first film without too much overhead. But once I got there, I fell in love with the place and the people.
With all your research on the opioid epidemic, did you see a lot of people who were using them for actual pain management and were successful and using responsibly? I feel like pain management patients get lumped in with heroin addicts and puts a stigma on their treatment. Do you have any thoughts on that after putting this together? Thank you.|I was not aware of that aspect of the epidemic until our festival run, when it was brought up in a Q+A. However, there have been a few comments regarding it in this AMA and I'm gonna dive into it.
How many years did you teach before your realized kids aren't the future, robots are?|Taught for about four years. Realized this on day one and just went along for the ride.
How'd you know lightning was gonna happen *right there*?!|Stood out there for a while haha. It was a pretty big lightning storm and I knew it would come my way eventually.
Hello fellow Rockland native! What steps do you think we collectively as a society need to take to curb such rampant destructive drug use?|Hello hello Rocklandite (is that a thing?)
 |It's obviously a very complicated subject with no simple outs. But briefly, I would push towards a system that focuses on rehabilitation rather than punitive measures. See Andrew Wang's proposal or the model Portugal implemented ten years ago with incredible results.
Hi, this looks amazing! Question, how long did the whole process take? From deciding you want to tackle this project until completion then submitting it into film festivals?|I decided to go to Camden and left the next week. I filmed for a year straight then came back trying to work freelance/raise funds. Then I went back and forth the next few months on weekends.
 |Start to finish (festivals) ? 2.5 3 years. Would have been 2 or less with proper funding/crew.
I’m so excited to watch this tonight with my husband. He grew up with a lot of exposure to the hardened real world and I was incredibly sheltered. Ironically, I used to attend Junior national rowing regattas in Camden in high school, so I’m incredibly nervous to see what was just streets away from my polished times in the city. Now for my question: has your worldview shifted negatively or positively (or not at all) based on your experiences? Were you exposed to the challenges others faced or were you more sheltered as a kiddo?|I was not sheltered as a kid at all and grew up in a pretty nomadic way, being exposed to many different cultures/peoples and their struggles.
 |So while these new experiences no longer shift my perspective all that much, I love that I work in a field that gives me the opportunity to share these stories and people with others, such as yourself and your husband.
 |Make sure you get back to me after the viewing with what you thought ;)
I haven't watched it, but I plan to later on. I am always curious about documentary participants. Did any of them glorify their addictions, and life obstacles, almost as if they were a celebrity due to the camera?|That's a great question but I don't think our characters did that. If anything they downplayed their obstacles and struggles, probably out of shame.
 |Enjoy the film, would love any feedback when you're done.
Is the city really all that dangerous? When I was a kid I was told the colors gangs would drive by me but to be honest the drug dealers pretty much kept to themselves because if they didn't the cops just came in and busted everybody.|No, I think it's probably overblown. The city and the people are amazing and resilient.
Wow how cool! Fellow teacher (although still teaching) here and I'm currently being tasked to put together their video production crew. Any tips for teaching video production? Any possibility of getting an interview with you? 🥳|Oh I would love to! Let's hop on a zoom with your students. Or just you haha.
Did you enroll in Teach for America or New York City Teaching Fellows Program? (I did. Thought I would quit or transfer out in under 5 years. I stayed for fifteen).|No, I did a TEFL course abroad and bounced around between SE Asia and Europe. Thought I would stay 6 months. Stayed nearly 4 years.
That's pretty cool. Did you do this as a result of something else? It reminds me a bit of Chris Arnade's journey to do Dignity.|It was just where I was at in my life, I needed to make the jump into something I loved or be stuck forever.
 |I haven't heard of Chris Arnade but will check him out!
How can I watch this in the UK? This looks like a very powerful film.|We haven't released abroad as of yet, but that's coming soon. If you follow us on social we will announce when we do. OR, I've read in this thread that ppl are having luck with VPNs.
 |Thanks for the support!
Did you generally feel pretty safe, or no?|Yes. Especially after the first few months.
Do you think you’ll ever return to teaching? I’m interested to know your thoughts on if/how you’d return to the profession.|My mom wants me too that's for sure.
 |I absolutely loved it and would consider it down the road as a part-time gig possibly.
Any options to be able to watch in the UK? None of the links on the website work|Yeah it's North American only :(
 |We will have our international release within the next few months. I've read that some people on here are having luck with a VPN.
Too late to the party, but what YouTubes did.you watch to ""learn all things film"", and what did you shoot on?|I didn't have one specific channel, bounced around a lot. I can dig a little deeper to find some of my favs though.
 |Shot on Sony A7s.
Did you pay the people in your documentary?|No.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Are you doing anything to help support them with whatever profits you may be getting from filming them? Just makes me think of the weird confusing thin line of being potentially exploitative as a documentary filmmaker, specifically when documenting communities we aren’t directly from or familiar with.|Yeah it's really tough. We supported them in other ways throughout the filming process and since. Help with rent, gas, etc. We have also helped and will continue to help all of them getting into programs if/when they are ready.
Do you have any plans for your next Documentary? Or will you try something else?|I'm currently between Iraq/Syria/Turkey wrapping my next documentary about the Yazidi genocide and missing 3000 Yazidis in ISIS captivity.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
What has that experience been like?|Eye opening. Wonderful. A bit scary.
I just ""drove"" through Camden on Streetview, and wow, you are brave! What was the most threatened you ever felt by the residents of Camden?|Never! I went in there scared shitless but towards the end I was just worried about stepping in shit or onto needles. Or falling through a roof again.
 |The city is struggling and has been for a while. But the people are amazing and incredibly resilient.
Wow dude. Amazing. Super inspirational. What is the music/song used in the trailer?|Thank you.
 |It's an original score by the amazing John McDowell. We are working on getting the soundtrack onto spotify.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Brilliant. I can’t wait. It’s very beautiful. Also, when you where shooting at night how well did the Sony do? Did it need much tinkering or did it just do pretty well running on Auto?|Thank you! Yeah it's great at night, but you have to play with the settings a bit. I tried to shoot night scenes with my 55mm fixed lens at 1.8 Fstop. But even with my go-to 24-70 most night scenes came out great! Especially after I learned what I was doing.
Were you wearing body armour when in Camden?|I had a vest that I would wear when filming with police or swat. I wore it to certain drug houses as well to start with but ditched it a few months in.
Is there any way us fans down under can watch the film where it’s not region blocked?|Our international release is coming soon! Some people on this thread have had luck with VPNs.
which camera did you buy?|As7ii. Still my go-to
Was quitting your job impulsive or planned?|Sort of planned. The film part was impulsive though.
which awards did you win? how long did it take for u to make this why did you pick this area, did you know about it?|Slamdance Film Festival: Grand Jury Award Best Feature Documentary
 |2x Brooklyn Film Festival: Spirit Award, Best New Director

 |Atlanta DocuFest: Best Director

 |About 2.5 years start to finish. And my father was from Camden, so I was always curious.
Did you have to set boundaries with any of the addicts when it came to helping them acquire drugs? Already rented and watched on YouTube, I’m so proud of Daryl. Amazing work!|Thank you for supporting and yes Daryl is an amazing human! I'll talk to him tomorrow and pass on your words :)
 |Hard boundary was that I would never pay for it.
Are you receiving unemployment benefits?|Tough for freelancers. Tougher for freelancers who haven't had any real income while working on passion projects ;)

 |Read again. I'm not on unemployment.

[Most dangerous cities?](https://www.tapinto.net/towns/camden/sections/law-and-justice/articles/camden-sees-crime-drop-over-past-decade)|Improving, possibly.

OK but compared to a city like Tiajuana Camden looks like a daycare.|Sure, but I did say, ""one of AMERICA'S most dangerous cities"" in the blurb.

Hey! I live near Camden. I worry about the title of this post and that it might permeate stereotypes for BIPOC. Are you concerned about that?|Hey, thanks for the very valid question. Hope you're doing well down in/near Camden.
 |I don't think the title perpetuates any sort of stereotypes about Camden or BIPOC, no.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
I think it's the title of the post I'd caution you to look at and how you portray danger. Or dangerous environments.|Noted. I would add though, that it IS one of America's most dangerous cities. I wasn't using hyperbole.
Fresno?|Camden, NJ.
Has the success so far with this film made enough money to continue and live from? Is the future looking like more bootstrapping, or have you found sponsors or connections make enough to keep doing this? Looks like a great film. I'll have to give it a watch, and keep an eye out from the next one it sounds like you're working on.|This film was used as a stepping stone into my current project, which has more support and I will actually be able to pay myself.
 |While filming HIGHER LOVE I had to get a part time and then full time freelance position towards the end.
I live in Camden but not in Camden. I have accounts I visit there and one thing I learned real quick is to keep your eyes low. If you accidentally pull up and see some guys hanging out in the corner, they saw you pull in and are trying to figure you out quickly. If your wondering why they’re looking at you, don’t stare at them trying to figure it out. Just continue on with what you were doing. Think about it later. Other times, I’ve had to pull over to do some work stuff real quick and turns out I parked in front of someone’s house, who doesn’t like visitors. I didn’t notice them watching me. I pulled away and this dude jumped in his car and sped after me and cut me off. Stopped me and yelled “were you writing down my cars information?!” I had to explain what I was doing and the dude said alright and left. That being said, I’ve also met some incredibly nice people day and night. They’re all trying to get by. Where you able to meet the nice side of Camden? IE the people who live there? I can’t wait to watch the shit out of this.|Yes, I met many amazing people in the city. Thanks for the support! Hope you enjoy the film and that it rings true to someone from the city itself.
I know I’m late to the party but had to comment. Your trailer is amazing and I’m going to watch the whole thing this weekend. I’ve always been fascinated by abandoned places and grew up not far from Camden. I have been in NYC for over a decade now and abandoned places are not something we see here anymore but, we certainly do see abandoned people. I feel like your documentary is bringing those people to a wider audience. I feel like you give a story to people that most are comfortable labeling as junkies and moving on. There’s a person, family, and traumas when you dig deeper and that’s far harder to ignore/write off. I really loved how you value and highlight their humanity and give a voice to a largely voiceless and marginalized community. I guess that really wasn’t an AMA more of a comment so here’s my question… single/married? And... I’ll let myself out...|I'm going to steal some of this for my next in person AMA if that's ok haha. Really so well put and couldn't agree more.
 |Single. Marriage in the future if this job allows ;)
Have you ever tried opioids or other hard drugs? What made you interested in the lifestyle to film it?|I have never, no.
 |It wasn't the drug use or addiction that attracted me to the project, but rather the amazing characters and their stories.
Hey Hasan, I think the idea for the film is amazing. I went to college and lived in Camden, NJ for three years and so I always love seeing it represented. When I first decided on Camden, I had some preconceived notions about the city and while it is one of the most dangerous areas in the country as you mentioned, the city has a beautiful underbelly filled with history and vibrant residents that should be the key to changing the narrative. My question is what were your thoughts and biases going into the project regarding Camden, and did they change by the end and how?|My biases were probably exactly same ones that the rest of the America (or those who have heard of it) hold. Hellhole, nuke it, pull themselves up by they bootstraps, etc. etc. Of course, not to this degree.
 |That's why I chose the opening radio Opie and Anthony montage that I did.
 |But that's why I wanted to go explore this city and meet these people, because I knew that I probably had it wrong and that the media had it wrong.
 |And I/they did have it wrong. Sure it's a city with its struggles but it's a it's a resilient city filled with amazing people. Walt Whitman, Campbells, the ship yards. Cities like Camden built America and now have just been left to rot.
Hi! Have you seen Lost Boys? documentary about Finnish opioid addicts? http://catalogue.ses.fi/movies/lost-boys/ Any toughts on that or the earlier film from the same director: [reindeer spotting](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1584813/)? Any toughts on these? Im eager to see your film as well, it's important that these documentaries are being made all around the world to spread the knowledge about this terrible disease.|I have seen it. Or parts of it of both.
 |I will have to watch again and see what thoughts I have. But I remember being inspired by his access and raw verite style.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Lost Boys is a lot different, more artistic and political. The message is ""it's not all about the drugs"" Poor boys from Rovaniemi Lapland travel to do drugs and meet up with poor girls of Laos. Some kind of love affair. And yeah, cheers from Rovaniemi.|Cool I will rewatch. Cheers from Harlem, NY!
How did you get access to the subjects in the film and get them to participate? Just wondering if maybe anyone reading this (commenting late) knows how that side of things work? Unless I was being given money or drugs, not sure i'd want to be filmed at my lowest point in life. Film looks really well done!|Great question. I think it is a combination of ego and truly wanting to get your story heard. With many, many other facets piled on.
Hey, thanks for being so thorough and answering so many questions for posters. What software did you use in the beginning for editing and arrangement? Did you do all of the initial stuff yourself? (Color grading, audio work, etc.) Or, did you end up working with someone else or hiring for contract work?|No problem! I'm enjoying it, surprisingly :) I used final cut pro x to start and then moved to Premier Pro. I used temp music, doing basic coloring and audio tweaks myself. Once I had a 30 minute cut, I brought on a real editor, colorist, composer, audio tech, etc
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thanks for the reply dude! Was the switch over to Premier easy/worth it for you, or would you have kept using FCPX if you had continued to do mostly solo production?|So easy and so worth it. I liked FCX but everyone in the industry was using PP so I had to switch. I would advise you do likewise or workflow between parties will be tough.
How do you deal with filming conversations or scenes that are hard to witness? Any time I'm in that situation I feel somewhat guilty for filming such a tender moment even when they've agreed to be filmed on paper.|It was really tough at times, but I do think the camera provides a bit of a filter. A way to remove oneself.
 |I do find that I am now dealing with a lot of things from my time filming there. So I guess I pushed a lot of the more traumatic aspects aside so I could finish filming.
I'm late to the show but I'm wondering how you went about getting distribution. I made a film (zero budget) that's about to be distributed on American public television. Who do I go to for the next step? TIA|We went the festival route. So festivals, sales agent, distributor, VOD platforms.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Thank you and congratulations! Can’t wait to watch it. My film is: www.findingthevirgo.com.|Very cool I'll check it out!
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Any chance you can share the name of your sales agent?|Sure. DM me
I just rented the film on Amazon. For a 48 hour rental it cost $4.99. How much of that rental fee will you see? Or did they pay you to put it on their site? I’d rather just send you the money directly|Thanks for the support! It varies platform to platform but I would guess about 70-75 percent on average.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Great film. Would be dope to see an update in like 5 years|Thanks for watching! I agree. I can't wait to follow up with Nez especially.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Man I hope the best for Nez. Seems like Daryl is a good father. Ps I’d love to see a newer version of Dope Sick Love (on HBO) major vibes off your film. If you haven’t seen it check it out|Yeah I love that film!
Hi, I'm not able to watch the documentary in my region but are you able to explain very briefly how there can be an opioid epidemic to a non american? Getting such drugs where I live wouldn't be easy.|Oh I love Germany, lived in Bremen for a bit. Follow us on social media as we will announce our international release soon. We really want to get this story out to as many people and places as possible.
 |There are SO many factors that go into the opioid epidemic, but doctors overprescribing pain pills to patients, who then eventually turn to the much cheaper street drugs, is probably a good place to start. Also, big Pharma in our country should be held most responsible.
This is very timely -- what's the best way to get a hold of you for someone who wants to do something very similar, but about a medical issue? Hayyyyy :)|Thank you! Find me on instagram (higherlovefilm)
How did you go about distributing this film across all of the listed platforms? Amazing work. Did the film festivals help with distribution?|Sorry missed a few somehow. We did well in the festivals and were approached by sales agents and disributors.
Dude, come on. It's 2021. Why region lock this when you're releasing it digitally? What do you expect to gain from that?|I wish it was my choice! Trust me, we want this out as widely as possible. It's the choice of our distributor to sell different regions at different times, we had no say in the matter.
Were you ever afraid during work that something might go wrong? Get attacked or ambushed? How did you deal with it?|Copied from below:
 |I went in there scared shitless but towards the end, I was just worried about stepping in shit or onto needles. Or falling through a roof again.
 |The city is struggling and has been for a while. But the people are amazing and incredibly resilient.
How close did you come to pairing the relationship of the Vietnam War to Increased Opioid Usage in America?|Many of our interviewees (while we still had interviews in the film) made that connection. Specifically, the DEA head first brought it to our attention.
I am an addict and have been in recovery for 6 years. Was it shocking to see the lifestyle first hand?|I would be interested to see your reaction of the film. And good on you, 6 years is incredible! Congrats.
 |It was at first shocking but I became numb to it after a few weeks.
Did you ever use drugs before deciding to make the film or was this your first exposure to drug use?|I've done drugs recreationally before but this was my first real exposure to hardcore addiction and drug use.
 |I had never seen someone inject, for example. Or OD.
How with no crew did you end up filming dangerous criminals without getting into danger yourself??|We built mutual trust. They are humans just like any of us, who have just fallen on hard times.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
Yeah of course, just admire your approach to this. I've seen people struggling with drug addiction and the lengths they will go to, to get cash or their hit, is a risk to be caught up in those areas. Big kudos to you for your moral/respect. Can't wait to watch the film - waiting on UK Times..!|Thank you my friend.
Did it make any money? How did you afford not having a job for the making of the film and now?|It's making money now, but it's been tough, not gonna lie.
 |I've freelanced and had a salaried position at a big editing house off and on since.
What gear did you use for this? How did you like filming with your camera?|A7sii with 24-70 Zeiss.
 |Rode Vid Pro+ camera top mic.
 |DJI Phantom 3 (till it caught on fire after crashing into a pool).
 |Yes, I loved filming with the A7s and use it still.
You are crazy! What were you feeling when the film was ready?|Complete relief. But I didn't get to really enjoy the ride until the festival run.
did you get a cheesesteak from Donkey’s?|""a"" ??!?!
Looking for interns for future projects?|YES.
What kind of camera did you buy?|Sony a7sii
What is next on your journey?|I'm currently between Syria/Iraq wrapping a film on the Yazidi genocide.
did you visit the aquarium?|I haven't. Those places make me sad. Especially with the Norcross tax thievery that made that particular one happen.
Amazing! Dogs or cats?|Dogs
Why not Chicago ?|Camden was a short drive. Chicago was an airplane ticket ;)
 |But you make a good point. Camden could be any number of cities across America.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|
It would be cool to do a series about it maybe one day it’ll be picked up by Netflix or discovery channel like true crimes|Agreed."
l8ave2,1,2021-01-29,Internship at a promising startup vs. full-time at a big bank,wavyship88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l8ave2/internship_at_a_promising_startup_vs_fulltime_at/,"I have an offer for a big bank after I graduate in my dream state. The total compensation is great (around 100K in a Medium COL), although they're not a tech company. I really wanted to work at a tech company since they really value tech. I've had an interview for a tech startup (series C with around an 100M valuation) that look very promising. They have a solid engineering blog and podcast, have a causal environment and seem to be very open to remote work. I've had one of the best interview experiences at this company too. They've been around since 2011 and are stable. I didn't pass their interview for full-time but I got offered an internship.

Do you think it's too risky to take an internship after I graduate? I'm not dead set on this company but I'm thinking taking the internship could give me more time to look for full-time jobs. If I did this I'd study Leetcode more immediately after I graduate. I may not have to delay my graduation date but I may decide to and drop 1 easy Gen Ed class so I can say that I have another semester of class.

I've had interviews at many tech companies: IBM, Amazon, Bloomberg, Datadog, eBay, Cisco, Qualtrics, Intuit, etc. but I got rejected. I've gotten better at Leetcode but I still have a long way to go. I've done 67 problems (like 44 easy, 25 medium and 1 hard. I'm working on doing more medium). I still still have another Amazon interview and possibily others as I'm still studying."
l8b1yk,1,2021-01-29,Which masters degree would be best to pick? (Continue with CS or pick a different major),freakinyou,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/l8b1yk/which_masters_degree_would_be_best_to_pick/,"I am currently an undergraduate CS major. I am not the worst but not the best either, average at it. I do have internship experience and doing well or fine academics wise. Next school year would be my senior year. My university has special program if students qualify where you can take classes that will count as undergraduate credit and graduate credit. Upon completion of undergraduate degree, you are converted to that graduate degree program you pick without having to actually apply for admission into that graduate program.

My goal is to get a job after my undergraduate and gain some actual real world experience and see what I want to do with post graduate studies after a year or two. However, if I struggle to find a job due to me struggling or job market being very bad or change mind, I would rather have a plan B, which is start my graduate studies.

Would it be best for me to pick the graduate program for Masters in CS, or some other masters program? A MBA interests me, but I have heard that it is not worth till you have some experience in the real workforce, not sure how true that is. Plus I think it would not be good for me to graduate with a MBA and looking for my first job in the CS world for junior positions. There are some other STEM degrees in the business school, but I am unsure of how technical they will be. Some of those MS degrees were by the name of Business Analytics, Info. Tech. and Management, or Financial Tech. and Analytics. I can provide links of their coursework if asked to. I am unsure if those degrees will be worth my time. I do not plan on programming forever as my old age nears in the future, but I would rather invest time in a graduate degree that provides me education that would be hard for me to study on my own. I feel like half of the business content I probably would learn from experience for the business or manager related positions that these STEM business degrees provide.

I thought to get other people's perspectives about my thought process. Which direction would you guys suggest for me to pick if I had to pick a graduate degree?"

This is my first post ever on this forum and I’m not sure if this is the right place to post about my concerns on being an aspiring developer and I am seeking some advice. Forgive me if this post is out of place.

I’d like to receive advice from other developers who have more experience than I do and are willing to take the time to judge my portfolio/projects. 

A little bit about my experience: I attended a coding bootcamp for 4 months in January 2020 and afterwards I took on a 2 month internship as a full stack dev at a tech company and have since then continued to teach myself code and build projects. 

It’s been 1 year since I’ve written my first line of code and I have recently started applying to jobs with some phone interviews coming up but I have just been doubting myself lately.. I’m nervous about the interviews and I’m not sure if my projects amount to the experience level of a junior developer. 

I would be so grateful to get some input from other developers as to how I’m doing after 1 year of learning full stack web development. I have recently built and deployed a movie finder application and I’m not sure if it’s a project worth showcasing to employers. Is it impressive? Is it lame? How can I improve? 

All of your input, criticisms and advice would be greatly appreciated and welcomed!!

TLDR: I have been learning full stack web development for about 1 year and not sure if I’m ready for my first dev job. I have a few projects on my portfolio and would love some input from other developers as to how I’m progressing and if my projects are worth showcasing to employers.

- Screaming angry med withdrawals because remembering to take them in consistency is so hard, it’s not true but I feel like I hate myself, I hate everyone and everything. 

 - Dropped out of comp sci last semester (my senior yea)  because f**k remote learning (...well actually I didn’t withdraw from school, I never made the decision, forgot about it and just let it ruin my gpa...after taking out another loan). I was actually good at coding too but lost so many internship opportunities because news flash they do care about GPA, you can’t just work really hard to be really good. 

- I lost everything I own from trying to escape living with my parents (who call me lazy after I’m burnt out from overworking myself to save myself from being swallowed by the pandemic) 
I tried moving in with a narcissistic partner impulsively thinking that if I changed my environment things would get better and I’d be productive. (I was actually desperate and vulnerable). He tried to coerce me into marriage and took advantage of my body in exchange for living there, when I stopped going along with stuff he abandoned in a hotel and I lost everything I brought with me to move in with him. Like everything, clothes, shoes, my car title, ...every art supply I’ve ever bought in dreams of escaping my computer science career. 

- I know everything in the book about trading but I’ve lost so much money because of impulsivity and lack of forming a routine. Just a genius with inferior results. Almost 5k down  (...which crazy enough is actually very good for the amount I trade)

- And then just today I failed another driving test, that would’ve changed everything and given me a chance at a new start. When I started to cry in the car the person testing me showed no compassion, got irritated?!?! (I literally just needed some patience) she argued with me, and ended up saying “...that’s why you didn’t pass your test, you should drop the attitude”

I’m so tired. 

Potential, so much potential for just this DAY. Not even going to talk about for my life. It could’ve been the end to an era but I hit the traffic cone. I hit the traffic cone trying to back up. I’m 21. No license. I have to rely on everyone to make anything happen. I’ve been trying to get an appointment at the DMV for 7 months but SCHEDULING IS SOOOO HARD. I MAKE REMINDERS, I DO EVERYTHING, I go crazy having 1000000 alarms everyday. Literally because of COVID. 

The other day I realized I might actually also be autistic too, lIke HAVE I BEEN MISDIAGNOSED THIS WHOLE TIME?!?

first they said depression, then they say depression and anxiety, then they said bipolar and gave me f**king bipolar medication that it’s rejecting from my body horribly. 

All I do is pray to God that how bad I feel about myself current doesn’t continue to manifest. I feel like I ruined my life just trying to make things betters, I don’t even know what to tell the doctor, can I get more meds for trauma? Anxiety? Pain? I don’t know. 

I do not want to be here. Anywhere. I asked a mentor if adhd ever goes away...he said no.

PLEASE pray for me.

Extra because I’m just sitting here in the waiting room : 

But yeah to explain how I got to the hospital...I had to make an embarrassing call to an employer that fired me  and BEGGED that they just helped me get unemployment approved by not saying they did. It’s actually my only hope. (Unaffirming that though) but they said wait an hour for a response...I was coming down on my meds I took that day, after skipping like two or three days...the anxiety kept building up and I kept imagining the rejection, at first I thought I was just sad but the more emotional I got the more my body ...tingled... then my thoughts got faster and faster and faster then I had to scream just to shut them up, I wanted to punch and hurt someone, I kept screaming, then I realized I was having a meltdown...

I was actually going to take more meds to tranquilize myself to sleep (random micro-dosed antipsychotic “just for sleep, why do they even do that???”) but I forgot... I thought it was just my regular anger at life? 

I started throwing things, trying to take it out on my dad for ignoring my screams, I actually felt like I was over exaggerating my anger but it kept coming...

I threw my iPad and it cracked. I looked at the cracked screen, you know how that makes your skin crawl? Well imagine already having a withdrawal and adding more stimulating feelings. The rage. The rejection. I just kept spazzing. I HATED IT. I HATED THAT I BROKE IT. I felt stupid and uncomfortable and I couldn’t escape the feeling. Like spikes all over my body. (It was also cold) 

I was not okay. I kept screaming my everyone in my house was ignoring me, thinking I just wanted attention, 

My mom walked passed me and said “yeah that’s a withdrawal.” She kept telling me meds were bad but bro I need to work??!!!!

screamed 3 times and told my dad to call the ambulance before he actually took me seriously.

Honestly the wave is over and I don’t even want to be in the hospital, they keep asking me if I’m suicidal, (um hell yea...but that’s how y’all got me the last 3 times)"

Pros of UMBC: I got a 36,000 dollar scholarship and will probably get into the honors college. 

Cons of UMBC: lame college life and less internship and job opportunities. 

pros with UMD: I got invited to go to the honors college. Lots of opportunities and activities. 

Cons with UMD: it will cost a lot more, and I will probably not get nearly as big of a scholarship. 

I really want to go to UMD, but I don’t want to put myself in debt for the next decade just for nothing. Will UMD be worth it?"
l8c2ns,1,2021-01-29,Do I deserve this upcoming job interview? Am I screwed?,Icy-Oil235,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/l8c2ns/do_i_deserve_this_upcoming_job_interview_am_i/,"A little background: I am a student pursuing Computer Networking. I went to University for a year, decided I would take on too much debt, and went to Community College the next year instead. I also have my Security+ that I decided to sit down and study for myself out of interest.

I used to lab A TON at Uni. I was the highest grade student there. Put me in front of a switch and I can configure the world with it. Theory? Nailed down to a T.

Well, COVID, and 8 months of zero activity in the field, and I decided to apply for an internship at a company for Network Security and Consultation. They require basic layer 1-3 concepts, and TCP/IP models, IT systems, protocols, network devices and applications.


Well, I go to practice in a lab today for the first time and as I plug my console cable into the FastEthernet port like an idiot (I was nervous, and I was used to patch paneling into console ports,) I realize just how much knowledge I have lost.

The problem is that this position calls for a Bachelors or better. I am obviously going for an Associate’s, and plan on getting my CCNA and gaining experience/vesting in the field before obtaining a bachelors down the line. I was so surprised for this interview because my application was denied at first, so I do not know if my Sec+ saved me, or they were impressed.

I wrote that I had experience in Layer 1-3 networking, and subnetting, and Cisco command line configuration because I honestly do. But I am so rusty on those skills that I am certain the hiring manager will think that I lied my way through the application. I really am a hard worker and will work hard to re-learn, but there is so much to brush up on. I know re-learning will be much easier though.


Do I deserve this position? A chance at it? It feels like this was all a mistake. Would it hurt to the let the interviewer know that the absence of practice has caused my skills to become rusty? Is it okay to say “I don’t know?”"

l8fkqw,150,2021-01-30,"I wrote a guide to tech off-campus placements in India after going through 80+ applications and getting 4 offers, including a FAANG-level offer.",pizzafapper,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/l8fkqw/i_wrote_a_guide_to_tech_offcampus_placements_in/,"I recently completed a giant off-campus job hunt and noticed that a lot of people (especially freshers) were clueless about where to find good tech jobs in India.

Since many colleges have poor placement records, I’ve written this guide to push you in the right direction. It’s divided into 3 sections:

I. **Pre-Application**

II. **Interview/Prep Process**

III. **Post-Interview (Negotiation)**

After 80+ applications, 4 job offers, and having joined as  Software Development Engineer at Swiggy with a FAANG-level offer, here’s what I’ve learned:

## I. Pre-Application Process

First things first, you need to understand the game. Off-campus is a numbers game, meaning you need to apply to a large number of openings. This **does not mean** you compromise on quality. Have a basic standard — but whichever job application crosses it, you can apply to it. Having more interview experience or more job offers is only an advantage.

## Where to find job openings

1. **LinkedIn** — I had the most success here. Obvious, but needs to be spelled out.
2. [**Angel.co**](http://angel.co/) **(AngelList)** — I found my first job on AngelList, and you can find openings in startups (including well-funded ones) here. They focus more on skills and experience rather than the college you come from, and you learn a lot at a startup.
3. **Applying to company websites** — This is quite underrated. Get a list of companies you like and want to work in. Find their careers page, and apply to recent openings. It’s that simple. This is how I ended up at Swiggy.
4. [**Hirist.com**](https://www.hirist.com/) — There are a lot of good openings here. They have a filtering feature that allows you to choose which technology you want to find jobs in.
5. [**HackerEarth.com**](http://hackerearth.com/)
6. [**Cutshort.io**](http://cutshort.io/)
7. [**Elitmus.com**](http://elitmus.com/)
8. [**Instahyre**](https://www.instahyre.com/)
9. [**Internshala: Fresher Jobs page**](https://internshala.com/fresher-jobs)

## On the kind of companies to apply

This depends on how many opportunities you have, and how desperate you are to get a job.

As basic advice, **have a standard**, something like ‘I want to work in frontend or devops’, or ‘I want to work in a product company’, or ‘I’ll only work if I get 5L so I’ll only apply to companies that can afford me’. This will narrow down your application process, and help you **be realistic about your goals**.

It also helps to track the companies you’ve applied to by making a spreadsheet. Google ‘job application tracker’ for templates.

## Writing a resume: practical tips

If you’re making your first resume, it’s always better to use a template than start from scratch.

A well-written resume immediately catches a recruiter’s eye. I like the templates available at[ **latexresu.me**](http://latexresu.me/). They’re well suited to most people’s needs.

What works well:

1. **List of completed projects**: Make sure to have a link to its code repo. If it’s live, then a link to that is even better. Describe your work in detail, and mention all the technologies you used.
2. **Internships or research publications:** A good way to get internships is to hop on websites like LinkedIn where they are posted frequently. A common way to get research published is to collaborate with a professor on a project.
3. **List of skills:** Don’t have stars/ratings beside them. Just a list. Only write those which you have used on at least 1 project. Not those you watched a YouTube video of and are now a ‘pro’ at.
4. **Tailor resumes** according to the position you’re applying for.

What doesn’t:

1. **Submitting a multiple page resume**. Your resume should fit on a single page, as recruiters have little time. They shortlist initial candidates by skimming through the page.
2. **Putting your photo or home address** — it’s not required. Period.

## How can you improve the chances of your resume being seen?

1. **Ask for referrals**. They are EXTREMELY helpful and help you jump ahead of people who are only applying with a resume. The employee referring you gets a bonus if you’re hired, meaning they have a direct incentive to refer. If you don’t know whom to ask, employees at big companies on LinkedIn regularly make posts willing to refer people. You can also connect with current employees at your desired company, network a bit, and then request a referral.
2. Another way which can have varying levels of success is to **directly message a recruiter/manager/CEO** about the job, on LinkedIn or via email. It has helped me in the past and could help place your application on the top of the stack. P.S. This works better for small startups.

l8fssq,6,2021-01-30,Graduate early or stay in longer for an extra summer intenrship?,theme57,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/l8fssq/graduate_early_or_stay_in_longer_for_an_extra/,"Here's my situation, I made a post earlier about what my prof said as advice to me and wanted to ask what may be a better option.

Situation:  
I am set to graduate Spring 2022 and was admitted into the school Fall 2020. I didn't realize this till just this semester. I have a few small WIP coding projects (decided to switch to Comp Sci before transfer around Jan 2020) and am focusing on Java and Python for backend.

Professors/students at the college say the internships are direly crucial for my chances of getting hired at, after, or before graduating. My friends in the industry say personal projects matter more and getting school out of the way ASAP is more ideal.

Option 1:  
Graduate Spring 2022 with only 1 internship under my belt IF I get one this summer.  
Pro: I have the degree and can spend more time building projects and applying to jobs.  
Con: Lack of internship(s) may/will be a negative when applying. Can't think of anything else.

Option 2:  
Take fewer classes between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022 so I have potentially two summers worth of internships under my belt.  
Pros: More chances land internships and utilize school resources.  
Cons: No degree means Jr / entry roles aren't an option yet, and internships aren't guaranteed."

Honestly surprised, because to be honest i’m a pretty average student. 3.3 gpa, only tech experience is a co-op im doing at a startup, and only have like 2-3 projects which i only did for class. I have a few questions about this. 
1. I want to have the max amount of time to prepare for the interview so how would I ask the recruiter for that? 
2. I barely have any interview experience, my only cs related interview was for my co-op (still surprised i even got that co-op). How can I better prepare for the behavioral and technical questions (other than leetcode) ?
3. Best way to answer “why do you wanna work for us”? Because really i just wanna do it bc its good for my resume but obviously cant say that.

I’d really appreciate any help on this 🙏🏾"
l8hmn3,10,2021-01-30,"Dealing with Deferrals, Jealousy, and Disappointment",ricecookerrabbit,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/l8hmn3/dealing_with_deferrals_jealousy_and_disappointment/,"I was having a really hard day today. Like REALLY hard. I got deferred from UMich and received a transfer offer instead of an acceptance from my dream school Georgia Tech. A month earlier I got deferred from Pepperdine and Santa Clara University, two schools I was almost sure I was going to get into. In short, I kept getting this feeling that I was halfway to getting rejected from everywhere, and that nowhere truly wanted me. 

For context, I am from an extremely competitive community. All anyone can talk about is school/college, and all our gossip is centered around extra curriculars, internship opportunities, and cheating circles. Obviously there are other things that go on in my town, but this is all that I have come to surround myself with. So you can imagine, after getting these deferrals, I seriously began doubting myself. I’m sure you all know that there’s an influx of applicants to almost every school this year which caused a record high number of deferrals. Because of this, I didn’t know where to put myself—deferral because of yield protection? Deferral because they couldn’t decide? Or deferral because they just couldn’t read my application in time? When Michigan decisions came out and I saw how many people got in...and how I didn’t...I began feeling a certain type of way. I’ve always been somebody who wants to be happy for others, even if I’m not friends with them. I guess it’s always been more for myself to feel happy for others, but when I found out that someone who had a similar gpa, extra curriculars, race, gender, got in, I felt so jealous. I didn’t necessarily think that I deserved to get in more than she did, but I definitely felt that she wasn’t much more special than me. 

I spent all day crying about how jealous and disappointed I was at not getting something I wanted. This makes me sound super selfish and spoiled, and perhaps that may be the case, but this is the way I saw it: I worked hard—just as hard—so why did I not get in? My jealousy stemmed from disappointment in myself, and though jealousy is an ugly feeling, it wasn’t at all an inherently wrong feeling for me to experience. I told my friends about how I felt, and one of them said, “Consider how many people are jealous of you and what you’ve accomplished. That Georgia Tech transfer offer? I’m sure so many people would kill for that.” And honestly, while that might’ve be a toxic way of thinking, it really helped. Not because I now have some sort of bragging right, because I don’t at all intend on waving my transfer offer around as some sort of trophy (after all, I still got rejected), but since I realized that other people’s success doesn’t take away anything from you. 

This is such a cliche lesson so I’m sorry if you read this thinking I would be some enlightening force—I’m clearly not. However, I truly believe that this lesson is something that is incredibly hard for people to learn. As someone who always wanted to be happy for other people, I didn’t take the time to be happy for myself and what I’ve accomplished. I wanted so badly to be happy for other people to show how content I was with myself, but it’s hard to convince yourself to feel a certain way when the circumstances you’re experiencing tell you feel otherwise. So I guess at the end of all this, my advice is to basically let yourself go through the emotions; let yourself cry, scream, be upset, but also let yourself be content. A rejection or deferral isn’t the end, and even if you feel that it is, then know that they’re okay and often beneficial to have happened. Somebody else’s success does not take, and will never take, anything away from yours. If you’re truly meant to be a successful person (which I believe everyone is), you will be. Anyways, I got into my 3rd choice school (UT Austin) and I am very happy about it. I’m not committed yet, and if I happen to get an acceptance from Michigan later on, then that’ll be great too, but I no longer feel chained to this idea that somehow I was less deserving of a certain result than somebody else. Hook ‘em Horns, and fuck you Blue!"

I graduated with a BBA in Financial Engineering last year and still haven't been able to secure a job due to the dire economic conditions (based in Lebanon).

I also completed my FMVA (Financial Modeling and Valuation Analyst) certification and just passed my CFA Level 1. I'm also taking online python courses and currently pursuing a research analyst internship.

I've been out of a job for over a year and getting desperate for some income. I've tried applying abroad to GCC nations but unfortunately, they aren't taking any Lebanese employees anymore. I've also asked a friend from some guidance abroad (Canada) and he told me it's very hard for someone to sponsor me since he needs to prove that I have skills he can't easily find there, and I'm still inexperienced since I'm a fresh graduate.

As a last resort, I'm trying to secure any kind of remote finance job. I've been scouring LinkedIn for a couple of months and unfortunately, everything I found requires me to be based in said country.

I am looking for some advice regarding my current situation: I am 26 years old and study economics in germany. Next up is a mandatory internship for 6 monhts, which I want to complete in accounting.   
Now my biggest issue is the application process. I just don't know how to sell myself. And I have a lot of fears , mainly of not being good enough and being overwhelmed. I also need to hide the fact that I was in therapy because of depression for 2 years which prolonged my study time.   
I do have good grades though and sucessfully did a voluntary exam, which is relevant to accounting. I worked in a Pub for some years and I also worked in federal voluntary service for one year after finishing school. Before studying economics I studied applied biology for 2 years (without a degree).  
In general I am really good at doing things well, just not at convincing others about that other than showing it with the work I have done.   
For application purposes I do not only have to sell myself, I also have to somehow convince the other person that I really want to work in their business. To me it feels like there has to be a lot of exaggeration when it comes to that. I mean, I do want to work in accounting and I enjoy the analytical work and the number's world. Just not to the extend that I would do it 24/7.   


That was a lot about me and I was hoping that maybe you could answer me these questions:

1. How much ""bragging"" about one's abilities is appropriate? Does everything have to be proven by examples of one's achievements? (typical ""I am super motivated"")
2. To what extend should I describe their business and explain why it is fitting to me?
3. What things are better left unsaid?
4. How do I cope the fear of not making it in the job?
5. Maybe from the HR point of view: What expectations do you have for someone like me?
6. To people in similar situations like mine: What is your experience? Does an applicant have to have the burning passion in their eyes?
7. Am I wrong with thinking that I am way too old for where I am standing in life right now?
8. Are their any general tips you can give me?

That being said I have started practicing a lot of coding questions and improving my knowledge in data structures and algorithms. However I feel like I won’t be ready for a Technical interview for a while. What would you guys recommend doing for the interview? Should I just do it for practice or should I say I’m not ready and tell them I won’t be doing it .

My dad won’t like it due to not being used to me having a partner and my mom has been especially weird about it. So I don’t know if it’ll be better to wait until after I graduate college in May 2022 or to stick to current timeline of this July or August. 

Hi guys! So little background: I’m currently 19 but by the time I move out I’ll be 20F and a senior in college. I live roughly an hour away from campus. I’ve lived with my mom for the duration of my college career so far, and I’ve discussed potentially moving out for a multitude of reasons. Not all of them known to her but basically I feel like a grown up kid. I mention maybe going out somewhere and she’ll be like “hmmm no I don’t think you should.” I also act as a therapist and go between her and my dad (over the road trucker driver so he not home too frequently). When he is here, I usually can’t get work done at all. My whole schedule is thrown off by having to cater around him. I basically split my time between being home and at work, even pre COVID. The issue is that I don’t make enough money a month to cover expenses on my own, but if I move in with my boyfriend (of three years) we can. (he’s not in college and also an OTR truck driver and he can make bills in one week). He doesn’t currently have a place so he usually stays in our spare room when he is here, so it almost makes sense that if he got a place, I’d just go with him. This would benefit me in being closer to school (in the city) so I could hopefully be a little more involved my last year and be more central to internships and any potential job I get, because it’ll most likely be in the city, not the suburbs. My boyfriend will be gone a lot of the time but I’m okay with being by myself so I can focus on my work, plus my mom always says it’s a good experience to live by yourself for a while. I understand it’s not ideal to have him pay the bulk of the expenses, but I feel it’d benefit everyone. And it just seems to make more sense to do it this summer instead of the next. I just feel like since starting college I’ve been more infantilized than ever and like I’m almost being held back. Also, I do have a hefty savings and can take out loans if necessary. They don’t pay for my school and I don’t really need their help, so there’s no bills they’d be footing. The only two things is I’d still be on their car insurance policy (I pay my share) and phone, but I’ll be switching phone. When I’ve mentioned moving out to my mom, she never seems happy. When I mentioned doing it before my boyfriend gets off the road (he only plans on doing it until I graduate and find a full time job then has solid plans) she would be like “well why would you want to live by yourself? just tell him if he wants his own place then you’ll check on it once a week.” She likes my boyfriend but she doesn’t seem to like the idea of me leaving. As for my dad, he’s just now used to the idea of my having a partner. He’s ignored the fact that I’ve had a boyfriend up until late November, so moving out sooner would be less time for him to be okay with it. Moving out when I graduate would lead to to more of a positive moving out experience from both parents, but I don’t think I can wait that long. Also, I have a sister who’s almost 25F and moved out a year ago and lives on her own using student loans. So the live by yourself comment she made has been very hypocritical to what we’ve been encouraged to do before. Also, if I did move out, I’d be moving to my sister’s apartment complex since they got great rent prices. Do you guys think it’s a good idea to wait until after school or do to it this summer? I’m open to advice. I don’t like to step on toes, but it seems I will be."

Would you say the program culture is good? Are people really competitive and ""work is lyfe"" or more balanced? Are their intramural sports for grad students? 

How heavy is the course load, really? If I don't come from a strong mathematical background am I gonna get body slammed? I work more on the computational end, are their strong computational mentors affiliated with the program?

How many years of guaranteed housing?

Does this program encourage summer internships?

What's TA-ing like, and what classes do ya'll TA?

So I graduated in 2019 with a bachelors in healthcare admin/policy. Out of college I had an internship within a major hospital and then after the internship I worked as a medical receptionist/provider support staff at this same hospital. I worked this position for 1 year and 3 months and have recently voluntarily separated with the company.

I quit because #1, I was unhappy at the job and it was “soul sucking”. I’ve been going to therapy for anxiety and depression, which I am associating majority of the blame on this job.

The second reason, I had aspirations to become a respiratory therapist or nurse. I am currently enrolled in taking a full 1 year of pre-reqs in which I will need before applying to any of these programs.

I right now am leaning towards respiratory therapy, which is a 2 year program. So in total I have 3 years of school (and quite honestly not enough money saved up). My plan, with the 1 year of pre-reqs, was to shadowing nurses and Respiratory Therapists to determine if I like the type of work.

I am now having regret, asking myself, why did I just decide on a move like this without pursuing other sectors of my degree such as an Administrative Assistant, HR, or Insurance. Thinking back now, this would’ve been a better option because, it’s not going to put a gap in my resume, and I’m not going to be wasting time and money. 

So now, with this 3 year commitment, I am kinda in a panic that this was completely impulsive and dumb. Thinking about the reality of 3 years of school is incredibly demotivating and as of this last week I’ve been struggling to do any type of school work.

The pre-reqs right now are fine difficulty wise, but I feel like I’m not learning properly and find myself googling just about everything just due to convenience. 

Unsure how to move forward"

* Creating and setting up networks, subnets, route tables, security lists, instances ect. 
* Simple bash scripts
* Jenkins pipelines 

Obviously all this stuff at a very light surface level since I am new to most of it and an intern. Having played with these technologies a little bit I find them pretty interesting, and after doing a little research seems that this kind of stuff is right up the alley of cloud architects/ engineers and would be interested in pursuing this type of job. I tried to read up a little bit on postings in my area and it seems like most of them want at least several years of experience. 

Are there entry level versions of these roles? Or do I need to pursue being a software dev/ sys admin for a few years then use that experience to get these kind of roles? Based on my limited research certs are pretty useful for these roles, are there any ones that would be especially helpful to pursue as a new grad/ entry level job seeker? Any general advice welcome and appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

Hoping to get some insight on long-term effects on my choice here.

Background: Math, CS, Robotics, previous backend SWE internships, some research experience but no publications. 

I've always been interested in the intersection between hardware/software and think that the self-driving car space will boom within the next 10 years. Choosing between:

* ""Infrastructure SWE"" at major self-driving company (one of Aurora, Cruise, Waymo, Zoox)

* ""Perception SWE"" at an AV-related company/team in adjacent field

The first choice will obviously set me up for a role at a relatively well-known AV company, but I'm concerned how much the focus on computing infrastructure will pigeonhole me in the future compared to a ""perception"" role, which might seem more impressive?"

I’m currently a junior majoring in accounting, but due to having lots of high school credits and community college courses from high school transfer, i’m going to graduate with 156 credits at the end of my senior year. I understand for my state specifically, i’d have to take another accounting course to satisfy the CPA eligibility before that time, but its something i’m willing to do. 

For the majority of my graduating accounting class, to get the 150 credits, the path my school lays out is a 4+1 MS Accounting program that I would apply for sometime in the coming months. 

I discussed the situation with my advisor last week, and he really made it clear to me that since most students in the major have to go for the MS program either way to meet the 150, that I would be the odd one out in the upcoming recruiting process. They really push the program, and with recruiting for 2022 already underway, I’m really anxious that my time to make a decision is dwindling. I was under the impression that summer 2021 recruiting ended, however i see that KPMG has some open positions. So I guess in a nutshell my questions are:

TLDR;

1. Should I apply for the summer 2021 position at KPMG, or look toward 2022 internships? 
2. Do 2022 internships even apply to me if i graduate then, and don’t plan on getting the MS? Would I be able to start in the following fall/winter? 
3. Is the MS even worth it? For me it would mean paying another $15,000, and losing out on a full year of salary when I could’ve started sooner. But my school tried to brush away those concerns with “it pays off in the long run” and “recruiters look for the MS”. 

Sorry for the long post, just trying to explain the situation in as much detail possible. I’d really truly appreciate any help/advice from anyone!"

I am trying to transition from mechanical engineering to CS (software engineering specifically). I graduated about five years ago and have worked for all of it in the industry. I think much of my value comes in writing small macros, apps that connect things. So instead of doing it part-time at my job, I want to do it full-time.

I started studying software engineering hard in the last year and so. I read through Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming by Mark Lutz and feel like I know Python from the inside out. Last spring, I finally decided to start a bachelor's in CS to transition to a software engineering career. I analyzed my situation and figured that doing a bachelor's in CS would be the best way to go forward over doing a master's or going to a boot camp.

I am finishing up my first year in coming May. After I graduate, my goal is to work for a unicorn or FAANG in the USA as a Software Engineer.  I am probably looking at jobs like this one below utilizing Java, Java Spring, AWS, microservices, etc.

[https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c2f875088103d863&amp;q=Software+Engineer&amp;tk=1etajkt0jt4ja800&amp;from=web&amp;vjs=3](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c2f875088103d863&amp;q=Software+Engineer&amp;tk=1etajkt0jt4ja800&amp;from=web&amp;vjs=3)

I think that I should ensure that I work with a modern tech stack. I want to integrate machine learning into my software engineering career, but that is still a couple of years away.

Here are my plans for the next two years:

* Get an internship/part-time job in the Summer/Spring of 2021
* Start the Leetcode grind and build out the trading bot project in my resume at a professional level.
* Get an internship at a top company utilizing a modern tech stack in 2022 (preferably as early as January)

If I can do the three above, I feel that I will be very well positioned to achieve my main goal.

**Here are my questions:**

**First,** I am struggling with what to keep or not include in my resume. Here is an anonymous version of my resume: [https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6739/zFZvKY.jpg](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6739/zFZvKY.jpg)

I have primarily worked with VB.NET and WPF at my work, which is pretty outdated, but I guess some professional coding experience is better than none. I would really appreciate your advice on what to keep and what to delete from my experience section. My skills section also probably needs some work.

**Second,** I have solid reasoning as to why I thought doing a CS bachelor was my best option. But I would be lying if I was not concerned about how I come across to the hiring manager.

I did not pursue Masters because I was missing too much CS knowledge, and my grades from mech engineering bachelor were not good enough to get Masters at a top school; I verified this with schools I wanted to get into

I'm not too fond of Bootcamp because they are too shallow for my liking, and I can get that knowledge independently.

**Third,** my trading bot is really the only project I have worked on for a long time in terms of projects. My first version was okay. I know a lot about Python than I did before. I want to build a comprehensive trading system that utilizes fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and sentiment analysis to recommend trading ideas. I am interested in algorithm trading, and I think a trading bot is an excellent project to showcase my skills. Is it a good idea to put all my eggs in one basket and focus on the trading bot? Or should I instead spread my attention to multiple side projects?"
l8yc5o,0,2021-01-30,I’m scared to share my accomplishments on LinkedIn.,Suspicious_Guest344,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/l8yc5o/im_scared_to_share_my_accomplishments_on_linkedin/,"So I have this issue I’m still in college however I have accomplished a lot of amazing internships, big awards and networked a lot but I never post anything online. I know I have to start branding myself since I’m in the public relations/ marketing space but I just can’t do it. I feel like if I start posting everything I’ve done all the people I’ve met I’m just giving away all my connections and everything I’ve worked so hard to get. But at the time I feel like I’m playing small and not letting people know who I am and what I can bring to the table. I feel my competition sees me as a threat which are other students and professionals in pr/marketing so I play small and pretend I don’t do much or even say much. I want to brand myself especially on LinkedIn but I’m just worried about the copycats and people seeing me as a threat. 

I’m not the type of person who will go over anyone to accomplish stuff. I’m the type of person who works quietly and gets stuff done. At my past internship, my supervisor didn’t like that everybody would come to me for my opinion or ask me for help and I was just an intern. At another place I interned the CEO didn’t understand how I knew a lot of people in the music industry and I could tell she did not like that they also knew me. So because of those two experiences I’ve been playing small so people like me at work."

l8zf7v,74,2021-01-30,How to become a Data Scientist?,jeppbautista123,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/l8zf7v/how_to_become_a_data_scientist/,"Hi long post ahead,

I will try to list down possible steps on how to land a job as a data scientist, no matter if you're a career shifter or a fresh graduate. These are all my personal opinions based on my observations and this will not guarantee that you'll receive a job offer for a data scientist position. Pero keep on pushing mga kapatid. Ohers may add their own tips if I missed any.

**How I became a Data Scientist:**

\- Passionate about data science since college, was forced to get a job immediately after graduation because I'm a breadwinner. Data Science jobs for fresh grads are a rarity back then so I took a job as a software engineer just to rack up experience, constantly joining Kaggle competitions and studying about DS. Finally got a job as a Data Scientist after 2 years.

Now, **How to become a data scientist:**

1. **educational background** \- If you already have a degree on BSCS or BSIT or BSIS or any other computer studies course, then that's already an advantage. BSCS is the better course if you're pursuing a career in DS. If your educational background is not related to the courses above don't worry proceed to #2.
2. **learn the fundamentals -** The next step for you is to learn the fundamentals of data science thru reading books, watching ds courses (youtube, udemy, coursera,etc). I have no specific suggestion for a tutorial or content creator to follow, but **look for tutorials in DS that has a good blend of Statistics and Machine Learning**. Don't focus too much on ML there's more to Data Science than fancy machine learning algorithms. You could also try taking up a short course such as [DOST's SPARTA](https://coursebank.ph/sparta/), or taking another full-blown degree like [BS Data Science](http://math.mapua.edu.ph/Programs) or [MS Data Science](https://www.aim.edu/programs/degree-programs/master-science-data-science).
3. **rack up relevant experience** \- *How can you gather DS-related experience if you couldnt even land a DS job? Get a* ***DS job*** lol.
   1. You could look for internship on startup AI companies here in the Philippines. I'm sure they'll be willing to accept interns but the allowance is not a guarantee. See my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/jxhgx8/internship_for_data_science/).
   2. Build up your profile. Join Kaggle competitions, join hackathons, get publicly available data then do some analysis, then do some machine learning, then post your analysis and results online thru blogs or videos.
   3. If you are currently employed, try proposing data science related projects to your supervisor.
4. **apply, apply, apply -** Send your application to any job posting that is looking for a data scientist. *Data Scientist fresh graduate?* **APPLY!** *Data Scientist 3+ years relevant experience?* **APPLY!** *Senior Data Scientist 5+ years relevant experience?* **APPLY!** This step is probably the most tedious and frustrating part. Data Science is still a pretty young field and there's not that much demand for Data Scientists currently especially for freshers. Just keep on sending applications and whenever an opportunity for an interview arise, always give your best. Just for motivation, I have recorded (almost) all my job applications since 2018 in a spreadsheet and just to summarize: I applied to 60+ job posting, got interviewed 21 times, got the job offer 4 times. You'll never fail in a job interview, you will either pass or you will get better. Goodluck!

But still no Luck. Presently, I am planning to learn a new language (Javascript). But I just don't want to do few courses and learn theoretical stuff. I want some practical exposure side by side to execute what I will be learning in my course. What should I do now?

Would have to take out loans if I went as an out of state student (maybe worth it?).

How impacted is the GPA requirement at UTAustin and how difficult are finding internships? At my current Cali school min GPA for Comp Sci is 3.9 for community college transfers.

Should I accept the (eventual) offer and start working with just a bachelor's degree, or continue towards a master's at my university? Part-time work isn't possible because the job and the university are located in different cities.  
  
Pros of accepting the offer:  
- I'd be able to properly start my career as early as this autumn  
- I will be able to move to Helsinki which I like better  
- 5 years down the line I could become an EU long term resident which would open up more work and study opportunities in the EU  
  
Con:  
- Not having a master's degree might limit my career progression and I would have no guarantee of getting accepted into a master's later on"

2. Why do you want to study media? (This was based on my answers to the ""tell me about yourself"" question)
3. What's your favorite book? (follow up question on how it impacted me)
4. What are your favorite classes and why?

7. Why Columbia?
8. How do you hope Columbia will impact you / how will you impact Columbia? (this one.... was kinda hard I def did not answer as well as I wanted to lol)

I know I know, I was not very passionate in studying when I was in BS. Instead, I always focused on applying internship and building resume.

Since junior year of college, I started internship at the company(one of global fortune company ranked within 50 if that matters) that I am working rn for 1.5 years (full and part time) as a Software Engineer Intern. And now I am working as a Test Engineer (SDET - Software Development Engineer in Testing) for 1.5 years.Basically, for last 3 I have been working closely with automation testing and building CICD pipeline for our product and will be for next year as well.

Beside that, I have small mobile application project that I worked on for my friend's startup.

Zero research experience..

However, I am now thinking about going back to school. Will have about 70k in hand by next fall. (I am a international student would be paying out-of-state tuition and not sure if it would be sufficient).

Beside getting a good score in GRE, what can I do to get admission in to some reputable schools for MS in stat or CS? (I know it would be hard to get into MS Stat with that major GPA :()

Thank you everyone in advance for your advice!"

Chapter 2: Considering options with a clearer head.

After the battle, the little aliens spent some time cleaning up the killing ground and I spent some time cleaning up my brain. It was time to make a choice, guilt and self loathing or doubling down on all the murder. So I killed somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty sentient beings. Awful, truly awful, for something so heinous, I should really know the exact number. To be fair though, it was in a war. A war I had no place in and was not in the right state of mind for. I should feel guilty. I should want to feel guilty. On the other hand, I was basically the Jordan of that battle. Fifty sentients and I was still shrugging off the mental and physical effects of cryo sleep disorientation. Just think what I could accomplish if I set my mind to it and actually trained. This kind of serial killer thought has me actually hoping there is still some cryo sleep disorientation left to rest off. I don't think I just want to be like this now. That I was fiddling with one of the energy ammo cubes that was soaked with blue alien blood probably didn't help.

I'm supposed to be a mechanic, how can I justify going around breaking things, breaking people. Not that I think there is anything on this planet that I could actually repair. Stupid garbage guns should probably just be scrapped to start from scratch. The hover carts were the most functional thing I'd seen so far. They were also covered in that garbage plastic but beneath it they seemed more robust. I could build my mighty trebuchet on one of them for ease of movement and aiming. Assuming this planet has decent metals. Or usable hard woods. Come to think of it I don't remember seeing a single big rock since I got here. It's all been gently sloping rolling planes.

Tug kept me company as we watched the other little aliens consolidated the ammo from one of the carts onto the little free space of all of the rest, freeing up one car. My hopes of being able to take a nap while riding the empty cart were dashes as the little aliens loaded all the corpses onto it. They didn't seem to be able to properly process all the blood. Every now and then several at a time would wander off and stare into space for a while with what I took to be a haunted look. The shouty commander wasn't even yelling at the for it.

“What's with,” I said as I gestured vaguely at the clean up effort, “all the squeamishness.”

“Ah,” replied Tug, “Our guns kill clean. Shut down the brain. Stops all functioning. Just a blip and the enemy turns off. Doesn't even effect plants when we miss our target. Your methods are effective but very...messy”

I gesture over at one of the still mostly full ammo hover carts.

“Do you normally need that much ammo for a single battle of two hundred, uh, what are you guys called anyway?” I asked.

He laughed at me. The audacity of this little alien. Laughing, at me. I could punt him into space.

“You have already decisively won the battle for us, but you only just asking about us now? We called Hechupp. It means six-footed in our older language. When I asked your name before, do you remember deliriously saying” He said, building up a mocking grumbled wooziness in his voice, “Ach, that information's classifered, need ta know basis only, and ya don't need it.”

“Uugh, no I don't remember that.” I said, rubbing the side of my face, “But I believe it, unfortunately.”

“Well?” He asked.

He looked at me expectantly. I rolled my eyes at him. The gesture seemed to translate, but all it did was increase the giddy look on his face.

“Fine. My name is Brennan, I'm a human colonists from Earth.” I said.

“I don't know what any of that means.” He said, his smile faltering.

“It doesn't really matter right now. It just gives you something to call me. Anyway, the ammo.”

I gestured at the carts and he swiveled his big head to fix his tiny eyes on them. Their neck wasn't overly long, but they could swivel their head a lot further than I expected at first glance. They might be able to do a decent owl impression if their eyes were bigger. They must have a lot more vertebrae packed in them to pull it off. Or maybe their bones were actually a lot softer and less dense than mine.

“Ah, right. We brought four filled carts for battle. Battle that size would normally have us down around  half a cart left. It takes at least month to make that much ammo. We spent maybe a forth of a cart total today, including all the blood soaked ammo that is now suspect. We recovered all three of their carts, two thirds full. You really set us up in a good position for the siege.”

He hopped up onto his stubbly legs and scurried back off to help with the clean up.

I yelled after him, “It was a joke. I didn't actually mean it. I didn't even say all that out loud. I don't really want to do a siege. ”

Several of the other Hechupp around looked at me confused. I grumbled something that probably ended up unintelligible at them until the scurried away.

The second march was just as bad as the first. In some ways it was worse. Apparently the first march actually had some amount of urgency. For every third or so of my trips up to the front of the column they also took a break for fifteen or twenty minutes. I experimented with the lower gravity for a bit now that my balance was starting to come back.

“Nothing so huge should ever be so light on it's feet.” Tug told me, “Almost hard to believe what you did in battle, seeing you prance around now.”

“I'm used to somewhere around three times as much gravity as this.”

He made a disgusted face, scrunching his skin up even further around his beady little eyes.

“How you so tall with so much force pulling down on your bones?”

I shrugged at him.

“Calcium maybe? I'm not a biologist. I'm not even that tall, I'm fairly average as far as my people go.”

I held my hand up a full head above me to demonstrate the higher end of height for my people. I don't think he believed me.

About half way through the march I found out why they were taking it so slow. A group of ten  Hechupp with two additional hover carts showed up. One and a half of the carts were full of food. The non food half of the second cart was full of random supplies The newcomers were very surprised at how quickly the battle had gone and how well stocked the ammo carts still were. After they heard the stories they seemed even more terrified of me than the ones who actually witnessed the battle. Tug brought me a little sealed meal packets the Hechupp soldiers were dining on. I sent him back for six more after devouring the first one. If the meal cart pushers argued with him I didn't hear about it.

One of the food deliveryhechupp also delivered some small rectangles to the commander and some others on his war counsel. To me it was about the size of a cell phone, but in the commanders hand it was more like a tablet. After studying it for several minutes he grabbed a set of saddlebags from the random supplies and through them over his lower back and stowed the tablet in one of the pouches.

After the meal, once all the meal packet trash was loaded back up on the cart it came on. The meal carriers took it and the hover cart with the casualties back the way they'd came. They left the cart with the food and other junk. I waved them goodbye. It turns out shuddering universal. Only after they were gone did I realize I missed my chance to nab some cool serial killer style trophies. I could have done some arts and crafts and made a necklace of tiny alien hands or something. Ah well, maybe it was a sign I wasn't really cut out for that sort of thing after all. I told myself it would have been more work than it was worth. The blood soaked ammo cube would have to do as a reminder of my first semi lucid days here.

Getting to the city we planed to siege took another three days. I probably could have made it in less than half a day if all the Hechupp weren't slowing me down. Hechupp camp was very cozy, they slept four to a little tent. One out of every eight carried two tents strapped to his back, the rest carried meal packet in saddlebags. Each tent, when set up, bumped up against three other little tents in small organized clusters. I had to jury rig two tents together and take three bedrolls laid out sideways just to stretch out anywhere close to comfortably. I was lucky the nights didn't get very cold. I pilfered one of the tablets and spent my free time trying to figure it out. I still hadn't much figured out the tablet by the time we reached the city. My fat fingers made navigating the ui accurately and consistently virtually impossibly. The commander started to make a fuss about all the supplies I was helping myself to. I just tossed the blood soaked cube up and down and asked if he really wanted to fight about it. He grumbled about taking it out of my pay but otherwise backed off. I would have to follow up to find out if I was really getting paid, but it didn't seem like the time for it. I had assumed my position here was like an intern or a mascot, fed and watered but otherwise in it just for the experience.

The city really wasn't that much to look at when we finally arrived. It only had one building over one story tall and the Hechupp stories were only around a meter tall. I assumed the two story building was some sort of government official building. The city was wide though, sprawling out several kilometers in either direction. If the Hechupp lived anywhere close to as cramped in as these soldiers did, I estimated a population of at least fifty thousand. We were supposed to siege this place with two hundred guys and one monster? The city had a wall around it, but to me it was really a fence with delusions of grandeur. The fence was shorter than the buildings right next to it, though despite it's lack of height for me, it looked like it would be quite the obstacle for a Hechupp. They did not strike my as climbers.

The army spread out around this side of the city and started setting up camp. They placed their little tent clusters in a line this time, running along the side of the city.

An hour after our camp was set up, the commander gave his tablet to one of the grunts. The grunt waddled over to the gate to the city and knocked. After a moment the gate cracked open slightly and the grunt slid the tablet through. The gate closed back up and grunt waddled back. I looked on, baffled. I looked at the gate, looked down at Tug by my side, looked back at the gate, back to Tug. I gestured my bafflement towards the situation with both hands.

“The tablet will have an account of the battle and our list of demands. So the city Governor inside will know what he is dealing with and our demands.” Said Tug,

“And they aren't afraid you will like sneak in a bomb or something?” I asked.

“A bomb? How would you make one so small?” He replied.

“Poison gas then, I don't know. Any amount of guile or subterfuge.”

He looked at me like I was stupid.

“I could ruin this entire planet with a modicum of real warfare.” I grumbled under my breath.

“What was that?”

“Nothing. Plotting the downfall of your entire species. It would be super easy.”

“Suuuuuuuuuuure.” He replied, with a big grin.

The shouty commander stood before his troops and called them to attention. Everyone but tug and I formed up, we loitered around near the back.

“You lot know the drill,” Shouted the Commander at maximum volume, “Should be a few hours before they finish reading the demands, decide what to do, and get back to us. If they believe us about capabilities of the monster giant, then.”

“His name Brennan,” Called Tug, from where we were standing, cutting the commander off.

“Bren-non, what kind of name is Bren-non?” Shouted the commander.

“Irish I think, but I never really cared enough about that stuff to look into it.” I called back.

His stare bored into me and seethed with disdain. It was delightful. I gave him a big old grin.

He focused back on his soldiers.

“As I said, a few hours should give us our answer,” He said, “Stay vigilant, look threatening, until then.”

It was almost night by the time we got our answer. I had climbed one of the ammo cube piles just to see if I could and to work on my balance, so I saw it first. Four hover platforms, three in front one in back, were rising up next to the government looking building. The three hover platforms in front had what looked to be large cannons on them. The one in the back had a dome covering it with tubes leading to each of the cannons. Someone stole my siege weaponry hover cart idea before I even had it. Insidious.

“Cannons!” I shouted from my perch.

The commander looked where I was pointing then started yelling orders louder and faster than I had yet heard. No word yet if his volume could be turned down, but its heights contained depths yet plumed. The soldiers formed up as the commander yelled. They stood at attention, three solders deep and nine abreast, in several large groupings with huge area in between them. A glow started to emanate from the barrels of the cannons. I attempted to hastily dismount from my perch on the ammo cubes. I made it a third of the way down before an ammo cube betrayed me and my footing slipped. I tumbled the rest of the way down. In the lower gravity, the fall wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting. Everyone else was looking towards the city so my pride was saved too. Small miracles.

I ended up on my back looking up as the blast from the first cannon sailed way over us. Apparently size didn't help much with the accuracy of their munitions. I got up in time to watch the second blast from start to finish. The cannon had been lowered compared to the first one and the blast came a lot closer. It still sailed well over even my head and off target to the right. The giant ball of energy was close to blinding as it first exited the cannon. It quickly lost its light as it came at us, it was nearly half its starting size when it clipped one of the ammo piles and only half went on to impacted the ground well behind our camp. No fancy burst of light on either impact, it just fizzled out leaving the grass on the plane undisturbed. I waited patiently for the ammo pile to go up with an ear shattering boom but was disappointed. The third energy ball clipped the troops on our far flank, leaving around fifteen Hechupp sprawled dead on the ground as the light cleared. The solders were breaking formation to go gather up the dead. I went to find Tug.

“I would like several explanations. I don't care where you start, I'll let you know when I think your done”

Tug was looking on in sadness at the fallen troops, but perked up upon hearing my voice. Tug adopted a very pleased with himself look that he had become the one I sought answers from.

“Cannons powerful, could take out large chunk of army if they hit good, but use a week worth of ammo fuel crafting per shot and still have accuracy problems. They likely out of ammo enough for another shot. Formation was to limit damage if hit, they could have gotten a lot more without your warning, if they lucky. Governor must be dying of fight of you. Didn't even send us a back off letter. Commander going to be mad, but you score points with him for your warning. Anything else?”

“Why didn't the ammo cube pile violently explode when the blast hit it.”

“Cube has no nerves for energy to work on. You think we risk bringing giant explody pile to battle and leave it in range for enemy to shoot at?”

“I guess I hadn't though about it.” I replied, sheepishly. “What now?”

“Now we sort out a plan of invasion.” Tug said, “We likely have around a week before the cannon is a threat again.”

“I'll probably just do it. I'm going to go talk to the commander.”

Tug looked at me confused as I made my way towards Commander Shouty. I made my pitch and Commander Shouty reluctantly agreed.

I'm in my final year pursuing a bachelor's in electronics and instrumentation currently, I'm working as a computer vision intern at an asset management company which also counts as my final semester project. I built a feature(working prototype) for an upcoming product, and my team lead said he was impressed with my learning ability and for completing the task within the deadline. I had to take a 15-day break to complete my 7th end semester exams. I'm starting work from tomorrow and would like some advice.

1. I worked around 10 hours a day(WFH), a good portion of it spent on reading documentation and understanding the codebase. Is it okay to work over 8 hours since it counts for my project or do I still stick to just 8 hours a day?
2. I read that having a mentor would surely help, how/where do I approach someone asking them to be my mentor? 
3. Do I ask my lead regarding my weakness and strengths and then take that as a base and focus on learning from that?
4. So far if I faced any blocks, I ensure I search and try out all the methods listed, and if I'm unable to progress I report back to my team lead saying ""this is where I'm blocked and these are the things I tried so far"" and ask him for suggestions. Is this the right way to go about it?  


Apart from this are there any other things I should look out for to ensure I'm on the right path and progressing?   
Thank you for your time, everyone!"

However, I generally believe I graduated knowing as much as the person who watched coding tutorials on YouTube or taken courses off udemy. I still struggle to build a webpage that has really nice modern UI that isn’t buggy. I look at others who built web applications and it looks so nice. However when I try to do the same thing, even after hours of tutorial videos, it looks like shit! It looks like a child’s arts and crafts after they learned to use scissors and glue. I spent money on udemy videos to learned react js and omg it was the most confusing and difficult thing and I hate myself for not understanding such concept. College taught me to use Java,c++, html, css, JavaScript. But they mean absolutely nothing when most of the work were simple. The hardest for me was data structures however, I literally found it easier than learning frameworks such as react js. It’s so confusing and I don’t know why I have such trouble wrapping my head around react js or web development in general. It’s honestly the most difficult thing I encountered in my college career. When I was working with my college assignments, I was able to think logically and implement it without any help from google. It was straight forward and understood it to the bone. However, when it comes to web development I find my self googling for hours and hours just to find a way to over ride a style from material UI. omg don’t even get me started on responsiveness. Building a website is hard enough and now I have to learn to make it work with the phone?? 

I fake my hours for my internship and lower the hours than I actually spent. If I work for 6 hours, I will put down 3 hours because how do I explain I spent the remaining 3 hours of their money for my dumbass who couldn’t figure out how to position one div to the left. I should be efficient and everyday after my internship, I watch videos and videos trying to understand react but I’m just getting more and more confused. I have so many questions about it and I’m tired of googling every single thing. I want to work as a developer like anyone else. I watch people build beautiful websites that looks like production level in like 5 hours. They’re so talented and I hate to say it but I’m just so jealous. It would have taken me MONTHS if not years to make it as nice. Now imagine that same person in the YouTube video given a month to a year to build a website. I can’t imagine...

I’m just ranting because I spent my time in college learning about my degree and it breaks my heart to try and find a job that requires all these technologies I never even was told about in college. Now I have to spend more time learning them but it’s getting too late and I need a job. 

I feel like I left college with nothing to stand for but a degree that reminds me what I could have been...

EDIT: Wow I didn’t think this would get this many upvotes! I wrote this at 5am after overthinking for a few hours. I slept thinking I would get maybe one or two responses but didn’t think I would get over 100 responses and over 500 upvotes. Thank you guys for responding and I will read every single one 🙏🏼🙏🏼

Why I think this is career related is because most of my degree I did a lot of theory based courses, and I feel like I didn’t get too much practice with coding. I also didn’t get an internship which could have helped in filling that gap. In particular I’d love to learn how to develop software in a professional manner, I’m down for mostly anything because it would help me determine what passion to pursue in software development. 

A little about me, most of my degree I dealt with C and C++ although it’s been a while since I got to code in these languages. Right now I’ve been picking up some basic JavaScript in the hopes of learning some front end web development. I’ve got plenty of time cause I don’t have a job, I’m a fresh grad and I’m super stoked to receive some professional guidance in software development. I’d love to give my best and dedicate my time to learn what I can to help with side projects you might have. Thanks for hearing me out. :)"

I had to stop my job search because I had a serious physical health issue that also collapsed my mental health. I am still currently unable to complete daily activities like feeding myself, basic hygiene, sleeping enough, etc. due primarily to my severe depression.

My parents are financially supporting me during this period and I am aggressively addressing both the physical and mental health issues. But my recovery is taking so much longer than I hoped, and I am terrified that I will hit a point where it becomes impossible to enter the field at all because my post-graduation gap is too large for me to get interviews. I am not ambitious and simply want a programming job that will provide me health insurance and enough money to live nearby in an apartment without roommates. I have one cat that I need to support as well.

What are your thoughts on this situation - should I be panicking or making other plans? How long do you think I have left before it becomes insurmountably difficult for me to get a software engineering job?"

I wasnt able to swerve quickly. Thought of the worst, my sibling right beside me still shaken. Seconds later saw the girl got up crying with scars around her, promptly sent her to the hospital. Needlessly to say, a simple police report escalated to a court hearing, the child's parents and the bias nature of inspector for our case made it so, as the car was registered under my mom she had to go for a trail with  which would soon follow with mine in the coming days. However, the judge decided to dropped the case after  much evaluation after knowing the situation was made worse than it seem due to a one sided viewpoint. But at that point the damage has already been done, my mom's job was already in jeopardy, shes works as a civil servant and this accident has tainted her reputation almost to the brink of potentially having to be fired. However, she managed to hold onto her role but she had her benefits, bonuses and allowance for the year be denied and now she is a record offender all because of me. Then covid struck, lockdown was in place. My potential interviews were put on hold indefinitely. However I never got hold of a respond till now. Job hunting essential became a daily routine. Then October seem to come by along quickly, still jobless at that time I had soaked up all the lectures and talk my parents kept on giving me of how Im not trying hard enough or how covid was not the issue but it was all on me as to the reason Im still jobless. However truth be told, I only wished to collect enough to fund for the repairs as my parents were behind on alot of payments and unable to tend to the car.Come mid October, got a call for an interview for a role as a supervisor at a local retail outlet. Was not expecting much, but knew right away why there were many vacant post for it. Work was a gruelling 12 hour shift between office work and having to tend to alot of manual work since we were short staffed for most shifts, and on my single rest day I felt wide awake at times being restless from the phone calls and texts i get from managers and suppliers. It was alot to handle with the bare minimum pay probably enough for student loans and basic grocery for the month, I succumbed to the pressure and resigned late december before the christmas festivities. But right before chirstmas was given an opportunity to intern as at a small goods trading firm. Had a short pleasant interview on the phone with their HR whom prompt gave the position to me on the spot which was a suprise. Reported to duty on the 4th of January this year, I was given the full extend to my prompt employment. I was assigned to one of their branch which was struggling to earn and turn a profit for years, only 8 staff have remained. I was quickly given a run down of their work. Essential i was tasked to fill the role of their marketing team but I had no team whatsoever, manager then told me they expect to see results by mid this year. However he was so unbothered in helping me out with their accountant as well as the other staff being so unbothered to help me out. Now stuck with a bunch of marketing project plan proposed by my manager whom only gave me little to no advice in which he expects me to have results by March.Have been frantically self learning my way around the tasks given. Cried some nights as I was lost and didnt know what to do with pressure mounting.Early this year as well my father left his work of 25 years as they were unable to pay him in almost 4 months. Then came today was involved in accident whereby my father's car that i was using got rear ended by a speeding truck at a red light. Car was totalled however me and brother came out unscathed , now awaiting insurance claim from truck's company. External damages can be reparied but it has left a deeper impact on me, traumatized me to the core left me shaken even as Im typing this. Dead end job, almost cost my mom her job, caught in two serious accidents, mounting student loans, lost a friend as well to covid last year and now completely clueless on where Im heading in life.

l9gaho,2,2021-01-31,25 M. Management consultant unsatisfied with his career. Can be worth it go back to university again?,Pako996,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/l9gaho/25_m_management_consultant_unsatisfied_with_his/,"Hi everyone,
I am a 25 years old Italian guy with a master degree in business adminjstration (not an MBA, Just the italian ""laurea magistrale"") who is currently working as a management business consultant.

I'm really unhappy with my career. I worked for 6 months as an intern at a big four and then went to another smaller consulting firm where I've been working until now. I have changed since, because of the covid outbreak,  the big four in april offered me an internship again.
Now, for over a year that I've been working in consulting I feel like I'm not satisfied with my career in the business world.

- The salary is low considering the degree I hold (that is like a master). If you then relate it to the hours worked it is actually a real exploitation.
- Working hours are not respected and I often find myself working until 9 P.M., but without any extraordinary paid, (making 12 hours of work but being paid for 8). It was the same situation in the big four and it is the same in the current company, for me but also for more experienced people. 
I feel like for a year I am no more enjoying my life, I work a lot, get paid a little and don't have much time and much money to live (since I moved to Rome to work, and rent and life are very expensive here).
- I don't enjoy the working activities (interviewing the client managers/employee, attending lots of meeting, writing documents and preparing lots of slides). I have always thought that consulting was an analytical and problem solving job but in most of the case it is Just giving the client some standard answer with lots of business word and with some nice slide. I feel like that  most of the projects are Just jobs so boring that the company decided to outsource them.

These 3 are the main reason I am getting tired of all of this. The more I talk to collegues or consultants in other companies, the more I see that my feelings are common to lot of people inside the industry.
Older collegues told me that they would accept any job opportunity outside consulting, since they are tired of being exploited and having to fake liking the job (but unluckly Italian job market is not as dynamic as other countries' and it is not so easy to switch in another company). Most of them have a family and they can't just quit, so they just hold on.

I am maybe exagerating and have a too pessimistic opinion of consulting, but I don't want to arrive at 30 years in the same situation of my collegues, being locked in a job I don't like. 
I have also tried to find another job but I can't find any opportunity outside consulting. It is like the majority of business economics students in Italy just end up working in consulting, While I would enjoy maybe much more to work in finance or as a controller.

It might be that consulting is Just not for me, since there are also consultants that seem to like their job.
That is why I am trying to analyse myself to understand where the problem is and what I could do to improve my situation.

I consider myself a quite introvert and analytic guy, and I don't like all the formalisms and useless stuff we do in consulting. I am very good in logic and in math. In fact during my studies I have eccelled in finance, accounting  and economics classes. I also enjoyed learning how to use Excel and the basic of programming. I am an INTJ/INTP personality, if this can help.
I chose to study business economics because I thought there would be more analytical stuff to do in the real world. I enjoyed accounting and finance classes the most, but I can't find any job where I can do what I studied in there. I wanted to try in Corporate finance but they only hire from top private schools (Luiss and bocconi here in Italy).

Since I want to shake this situation I am thinking to start studying again (luckily in Italy we have almost free education) in a more technical and analytical field. 

I have 2 different ideas on what to do:
1-My first Idea was to try with a master in finance abroad, since that would allow me to spend only just another year studying and, hoefully, change my career path. I am saving money for this, but I am afraid to end up in another consulting like environment with all formalisms, long hours, and no analytical and interesting activities.
2-The other Idea is to start studying engineering. I am really thinking about it since it seems an environment where I can exploit my analytical and problem solving skills. But what is holding me back is the fact that it is really hard and that I would have to study at least other 5 years. I am quite scared to make a mistake and end up not enjoying it too. I am also scared that at 30 years I would be considered too old by companies and will not be able to have a good career.

I would like some guidance with my situation. I would like to know opinions by other people that have had the same feelings I have now or that have studied a master in finance or engineering and can tell me what is like the job they are doing and if they enjoy it.
Or maybe from people that were in a similar condition and decided to go back studying in another field at 25 or more years and don't regret their choice, 

Just to give some more information. I am not scared to work long hours if it is a job I enjoy and where I see a monetary or self growth prize. What I don't like in consulting is the fact that I work long hours, without being payed, to align slides and prepare documents that my manager often makes me change thousand times and these activities teach me nothing and don't help my professional growth.

Thanks to everyone that can give me their insight on my situation and can help me giving the proper direction to my career."

Between lack of posted internships and smaller HR departments due to layoffs, engineering students have been put at a sincere disadvantage.

I guess the whole reason why I make this post is just to ask at what point do you just give up trying to get an internship for the summer? I'm a junior EE and as such an internship is vital to securing job offers. I've applied to over 200 internships with only 3 interviews all of which ended in rejection. I've had my resume reviewed countless times on different subreddits, with friends majoring in HR, and even a few HR people I know in the industry.

At this point I'm not even sure what to do. I just wish finding an internship wasn't so much out of my control."

I recently graduated with an Economics undergraduate degree, am 24yo, from Hamburg (Germany), and want to pursue a career in SWE. I plan to work in Berlin after completing my studies. I have completed a couple of online courses like Harvard's CS50 and Codecademy am am certain I want to pursue a CS degree.

The way I will go about is by completing a non-consecutuve MSc in Computer Science in the UK. it allows non-cs student with a good quant background to obtain a MSc in CS. These programs usually teach many of the contents that a BSc would, but in a shorter time.

Anyways, my dilemma is that in spite of the current COVID situation, I don't know whether I should pursue an online MSc and move to Berlin where I have lots of friends, or move to the UK and start an on-campus degree in September and move to Berlin afterwards. The main issue is the difference in time to complete.

The online degrees can only be done part-time (2 years, 3 months), while the on-campus degree would only take 1 year for the same material.

**Option 1: Do part-time online CS master from May 2021 - Aug 2023**

One the one hand I feel like taking 2 years, 3months is not a bad thing per-se because I am coming from a completely unrelated discipline and I could build up my portfolio with side projects, visiting Hackathons or other conventions, and looking for internships during my studies. However, I don’t know if I  can even get an internship without experience in SWE. The workload for the degree would be pretty low (12-15h a week) so I would somehow have to make up for it with side projects and internships. I would also have more time to build connections etc in Berlin, which is somewhat convenient because I plan to work here after my studies anyways.

On the other hand, It is a pretty long time and I could probably also land a junior position after finishing the degree in 1 year (Sep 2021 - Sep 2022) and for the 2y option it is crucial that I land internships.

**Option 2: Full time CS master Sep 2021 - Oct 2022 and move to UK**

If I choose this route, I would probably just spend the time until Sep with pre-studying for the course. I would take the course at UCL London and people tell me the workload of these 1 year CS degrees is absolutely insane (9-12h a day). The professors specifically advice not to do anything on the side like build own apps or work. So I would basically go in , do a 1 year degree and have a MSc but not have any relevant work experience in the field. I would however have some projects on my portfolio (The ones i completed during the course).  Another issue is that I have no guarantee that in-person teaching will take place in Sep 2021. In the worst case scenario I would move to London just to sit in my room and watch online lectures.

After my studies, I would then move back to Berlin and try to land a junior developer position. Overall,  I would be done approx. 11 months earlier compared to the part time Online degree.

**The programs are:**

* **UCL**: 31.2k£, start in Sep. 2021 and take 1 year (full-time degree)  [Link to degree](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computer-science-msc)
* **Bath (online)**: 13k £ , start May 2021 and take 2y, 3months. (half-time degree) [Link to degree](https://online.bath.ac.uk/online-courses/msc-computer-science)

Reputation wise, UCL is a bit better.

**So:**

Is it worth it to choose the 1 year degree to be done 10-11 months earlier, or should I take my time transitioning into the field?

I would greatly appreciate some advice."

I'll split this up into my current understanding of the pros and cons between UTD and A&amp;M to try to get a sense of the whole picture.

A&amp;M Pros: Great alumni network, has a Food Science Major (which I find appealing as a fallback if I find out marketing isn't for me), closer to home, many of my friends as well as my twin will be attending

A&amp;M Cons: Dorms worse in comparison to UTD, kind of in the middle of nowhere (less internship opportunities in comparison to UTD?), class size is larger



UTD Pros: I have an Academic Excellence Scholarship for $10k the first year (that I think renews each year based on GPA?) , better dorms in comparison to A&amp;M, good access to internships due to location

UTD Cons: Further away from home, not as diverse choice of majors if I choose I'd like to pursue something else

As far as the actual business and academic programs are concerned, I don't know which one's better, so any input there would be greatly appreciated.

I feel like this might boil down to choosing whether I value the positive experiences associated being with my family and friends, or choosing somewhere with better opportunities- but I have no clue if either college holds an edge over the other in that regard. My brain is kind of all over the place, so any advice or perspectives as to where I should attend are appreciated.

I am 24 and I never finished college. I was in the workforce for 6 years and while I did well, COVID made life hard for a lot of people (including myself). Got laid off.

So, I thought the logical next step was to finish up college. I took classes in the past (currently sitting at 65 finished credits) and got a 4.0 last semester. Weirdly, I am even more depressed as I feel like I'm wasting my life in this system.

I feel like I'm wasting my focus on something I don't want to do. There is no ""degree"" that I can get to teach me how to be a business owner (what I want to do).

What I came to realize about having a job is that your upside potential is pretty slim. It's like 1:1.1risk to reward ratio if I were to put it in math. You either lose it all (your job) or gain 10% in a promotion, career advancement, etc.

But, if you were an entrepreneur, your risk to reward is literally 1:infinity. You either lose it all or make a lot more than you've ever imagined. I like this risk ratio better. 

**Laid of June 2020**

This is the first time I've been out of work and I just now realized how brutal the rat race is. I don't know how to explain it, but most schools/employers will always leverage your desperation into making unfavorable circumstances make it a gain for them. I applied for hundreds of jobs, but only get rejected by each and every one of them.

So I re-enrolled into college.

Now I'm trying to apply to internships that pay less than $20/hr and I live in D.C...(and suck up even more time) throwing out 100+ resumes and I still get consistently rejected. I can't live off $20/hr.

**August 2020**

So, I grabbed my balls and started trading while in college with $10,000 (sold my car, but still had my savings). Now, people may say ""omg, don't day trade you'll lose your money!!"" - well, I did. In fact, I lost it all. Lots of hard lessons. Then, I started out with $500 finally refined my strategy. Gains initially were slow, but I made it back and made much, much more (than my prior savings). It took me about 6-7 months to really get the swing of risk management, emotional management, exits, entries, etc. Not going to lie, I was glued to my computer the whole time (college + trading).

**January 2021**

Now I'm sitting at a net worth of my ""future mid-career"" salary x3-4..in less than 6 months. My whole plan for going to college was to school &gt; get a better-paying job &gt; to save enough money to start my own business. I'm taking 22 credits in college (most of the classes are in-home, open-note tests for most classes) so I don't think it'll be difficult.

I want to keep trading because I love it and I'm making consistent money from it. The downside is that I'm not really ""improving"" any skill. And to be quite honest, I stop viewing it as trading as I also to TONS of research. More like active investing. I stopped trading day-to-day but now I just invest and I end up multiplying my investment 80% of the time. I'm pretty good at figuring out what projects will do well long term or short term. 

I know that I am not an ""employee"". I knew this when I was 18. I like to control my own destiny. If I turn 50 and my business goes under, then so be it. But to be quite honest, if you have a good investment strategy in the next 5-10-20-40 years, it's actually not hard to make a great retirement savings net.

I love these topics: technology (specifically blockchain), fintech, and investing. I can read about this stuff forever because I have never loved to learn about something like this so much. 

The question is, now that I have/can make the capital I need to start a business, should I want until I'm done with college (end of 2021) or start now and be more successful in the future with it??? I'm still young, what should I do????"

**Interviews**

Georgetown: I was very bubbly and he was kind of chill but maybe he thought I was a bit too excited. I did well even if a bit too long.

Barnard: A few awkward beats cause it was my first but a decent interview. A little short. 

**Essays**

I really really love my essay. I’m gonna be straight: it was 9/10 with some incomplete ideas but one of the best things I’ve ever written. I talked about my Mexican identity and feeling disconnected because of being white, but finding myself through my grandfather and visiting him before he died. He had blue eyes and I made the connection between my skin and this trait.

l9plkn,1,2021-01-31,23 and struggling to find a proper job,NebNegreb,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/l9plkn/23_and_struggling_to_find_a_proper_job/,"Hey y'all. I'm 23 years old and have just recently gotten an Associate's Degree in TV/News/Media Production, towards the end of last year. I'm looking to find a good entry level job and move to Charleston SC. However, I've been having some trouble finding good jobs in the area. I don't know if it's where I'm looking or what. I was mostly trained to shoot and edit video, and some other related skills. When I look for media jobs in Charleston, I keep seeing a lot of unrelated stuff like ""Jewellery Assistant"" or ""Social Media Assistant"", things I wasn't trained in at all. I've been getting discouraged cause Im hoping to find a job pretty soon, if I want to move out of my parents' place at some point this year. I've been thinking about learning graphic design as a side job, but that would take time and would have to be done alongside a main career. There's a few news stations in Charleston, but when I apply nobody gets back to me (and from the reviews I've read, those few stations can be a really stressful environment with potentially low pay).

I guess I just don't really know what to do. Should I keep trying to find a job in this field, or should I try getting one of these free programs done to get more skills under my belt?? [https://www.tridenttech.edu/landing/free\_tuition\_eligible\_programs\_Fall2020.htm](https://www.tridenttech.edu/landing/free_tuition_eligible_programs_Fall2020.htm)

When I think about the kind of work I enjoy doing, it's working with equipment like cameras, editing software and computers. I did an internship for school where I helped out on school events with shooting video, hooking up and troubleshooting audiovisual equipment, etc. I applied to a part time job doing essentially the same work, but I've been following up and nobody's called me back. I know I'm young and just starting out, but I'm feeling really discouraged if it's been this long and I still don't have a proper job."
