---

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 Years ago planetary scanners detected a strange object in motion in interstellar space. All routines failed to classify it as an asteroid or any similar body, as soon as improved scanners were calibrated, the object in question was determined to be of possible alien origin and was promptly reclassified as **Object 0**.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Brief isolated outbursts of panic occurred planetwise as the doomsday prophets declared that ""The End Is Nigh!"", and that an alien invasion was sure to come, to destroy our young spacefaring civilization. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This ship and crew were selected as the finest among the research institutes, and I was appointed as Captain. Our mission is simple, yet could change the course of history forever. We are to approach the object, match its orbital speed, and verify the reports of alien origin. If said reports are confirmed, the object is to be secured in the Anti-gravity Vacuum chamber and brough back for analysis. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We are now approaching Object 0, will report after contact.

&amp;nbsp;

**END OF REPORT**

---

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Captain, we are approaching Object 0. Should come into view soon.""*

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The veteran captain, who had commanded hundreds of research expeditions, retracted the recording equipment which he had just used to update his Captain's log back into the console, and laid back. He hoped that he was emanating a figure of calm and professionalism, despite the fact that his mind was racing with thoughts, his heart beating as fast as the moment he was informed that he was to lead the expedition that would could change everything forever.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Match orbital velocity, bring us to 50 units of distance and 0 relative speed.*"" - his calm and ragged voice being answered by the shuffle of his busy crewmen, bringing the spacecraft into position.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Velocity matched. Object remains in course. Activating lights ... now*""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The crew stood in awe as soon as the lights came on. Object 0 was most definitely an alien object. A probe, clear similarities with our own designs. A comms dish stood, battered and pierced by tiny asteroids and by stellar particles, the signal it transmitted long gone. The hull itself suffered the same fate, being battered in multiple points, the craft slowly spinning as result of some of these impacts. Markings and paint could be seen on the body, eroded to blurs by the stellar winds.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Just... how old must this thing be?""* was the only comment that rang across the bridge

----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was the discovery of the millennia. *We are not alone!*. The top minds of the entire planet pounced on the object, hoping to discover its purpose and creators.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Soon enough, a golden disc was dislodged from the side of the craft, reminding us of the very probes we had flung out during our spacial infancy. The material had stood the test of time, and the markings on its surface were readable, albeit untranslatable. There were traces of radioactive material, which told us that this tiny probe was over 5 billion years old.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It took a decade until we were able to start decoding them. A young intern who had spent many nights in its youth staring at the pictures of the disc managed to translate one of the markings, opening the floodgates.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Whoever made this disc knew that they could not use their own symbols and writing. No one else would be able to decode this message. However, there was one language that could be universally understood, the laws of physics and science. The smallest of markings talked about the hydrogen atom, using its universal spin movements to set up a basic time unit. The first whispers of another intelligence were coming to us.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Another simple diagram was translated after a year, a series of lines, with a message encoded in binary, told us of several pulsars and the rate at which they pulsed. Such old records, those interstellar clocks were surely dead, but using jump drives to travel to light-years worth of distance and other methods, the faint signals were tracked, mapped and its meaning finally uncovered: a map. The lines converged into a single point. Telescopes looked at the location, and a faint glow was detected. A white dwarf, the remains of a long-dead star. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The world stared in awe, as the countdown for the warp-drive reached 0, and the research craft headed towards the location marked on the map. Billions of breaths were held as the images flooded in. A solitary white dwarf emitted its faint glow, the corpse of a dead star, several planets of different sizes orbiting it. Soon enough the scans were complete, and the research team headed for the one closest to the star.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A charred world, its life burned long ago by the death of the very star that had once provided it with heat and life, and yet, the presence of civilization was undeniable. Remains of satellites, constructions, colossal cities abandoned as the apocalypse of the dying star threatened to consume all. Sentient life had once inhabited this place. The proof was undeniable, we were not alone. But where was everybody?

----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Captain! We are receiving a signal! There is a body orbiting the star at exactly π degrees of inclination!""*

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Set course, now!""*, the shaking voice of the Captain shouted hopeful.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The whole world watched as the new probe came into view. This one had a huge rectangular block, giving it a very unusual form for a spacefaring object. But it was clear that it was far more recent than the one they had found, its markings were clearly visible, the hull almost unscathed.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As the scientific craft attempted to communicate with it, the huge block came to life with light, its role as a screen revealed. Standing there, a message recorded many years ago, an alien stood proud, its features very similar and yet noticeably different from the investigators. As it spoke, its voice was transmitted for all to hear, and intercepted by the newcomers.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Of course, the Rakkish scientists and population were completely unable to understand a word of what was being said, but for the first time in millions of years, the voice of humanity was once again heard across the galaxy:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""You found us, or what's left of our cradle at least! I always knew good old Voyager wouldn't let us down!""*"

I don't have any side projects to talk about. I have some work experience but nothing related to CS or Stats. The only thing close to it is that I was a desktop support intern for a company. 

I am generally a shy guy and not good at starting conversations. I have never been to a career fair and sort of scared. I know my peers are ahead of the game than me in terms of projects and extra activities. I know about the imposter syndrome, but it just seems like that they are doing some pretty neat side projects. 

What advice do you have for me?

I recently started an internship at a major ISP in my country. I've been having issues with things like laptops, desks, internet and I was wondering if this is common at other large companies that aren't Tech Giants.

For example, my current work laptop is an ancient Toshiba with only 4gb of RAM and a super slow HDD. My work consists of web development as well as dev-ops stuff such as Docker, Kubernetes and OpenStack so you can imagine it's super impossible to do anything when u need to simulate a Kubernetes environment on a dev machine with only 4gb of RAM, hell, even just webpack-dev-server + chrome is already too much.

The corporate internet is also impossible to deal with. The only internet access is via a proxy (http/https) so I can't use ssh/ftp etc. SERIOUSLY!

I can't access any corporate services such as Email from my dev workstation (linux) because it's not the SOE Windows image. I can't access wireless for the same reason so i'm developing with the fucking guest wireless.

I've been here over a month already and I still don't even have a desk. It's called 'hot desking' where basically everyone has a desk but you, so you need to snipe others and just ignore they have pictures of their kids and sentimental items that you need to push aside to set up.

I'm super frustrated and will 100% not work at this company post internship, but I'm desperate to know if this is a common experience at large companies so I can avoid this in the future.

prior to this internship I worked part time for a super small soft. dev. agency and it was wonderful! So at least i'm hopeful!"

Until the second semester of my freshman year, I wasn't even interested in CS, but after taking an intro to python class, things changed.

The deal is I worked mostly at a grocery store during the summer after freshman year, and I didn't work on any projects as such. For my sophomore year though, I'm currently taking a Java class, and I've decided to go to a couple of hackathons, also joined a couple of coding and tech clubs that are genuinely interesting. I know it was a bummer to have wasted my summer this way, and for now I'm working for my university dining, so you could say my experience is not very relevant. Now with these credentials, should I even try my luck at any internship? I know I'm not in a position to choose, but any company would do for me I think.

50lfz9,1,2016-09-01,Potential Drastic Change in College and Life Direction,rabbitjellynopeanuts,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/50lfz9/potential_drastic_change_in_college_and_life/,"So throwaway account because I don't want some of my friends to find me. I just started my junior year in Electrical Engineering and have come to the realization that I do not want to be an engineer. I had a very good internship this summer and have slowly come to the conclusion its just not for me. Hell, I even had a dream interview with NASA the other day. I just don't feel any excitement or passion for it anymore after seeing what my work life will be like. A few weeks in and I already have no motivation to do my work, and it will only get done when I absolutely have no more time to procrastinate with. The only saving grace is if I can get into project management of some type or leverage my degree and good grades to change into a different field. With my lack of commitment, those good grades may go away though. 


A major reason for this is that I have changed so much over the past 8 months. I am not the same person that started engineering several semesters ago. I am far more social and outgoing, and am always looking for adventure and excitement. I am willing to work hard, but I struggle to see the point in hard work for no personal satisfaction, and the next two semesters are hell for my major.


Another choice is to switch majors and become an Econ major or a business major (focus on Econ/data analytics). I can do the Econ major in 3 semesters due to some credits I already have and graduate in 4 years or take an extra semester for the business major (more practical courses than pure econ). This would be very difficult to do though and I would be booked with courses. 


A change would also potentially alienate some of my friends (I am in a Professional Engineering Fraternity) that I really care about. I'm afraid they will think I am quitting, and I pride myself on being able to work through the struggles that school, work, and life throw at me. I'm afraid that I am failing myself and will throw so much hard work away. I am horrified that I will make the wrong decision.


And there is another voice in my head whispering to take a leave of absence from school and explore the world or volunteer somewhere. I have a major scholarship for school that I would lose if I am gone for more than a semester, but I could drop this semester (maybe medical leave or something) and take off for a few months to return in the spring, perhaps with some clarity in life. 


If anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it. I can't think through this well and my gut isn't helping me either. I really feel lost here.

I am in a sort of situation that I have come to realize most people who post here are in: not great GPA, pretty decent extra-curriculars. My EC's are pretty unique and I'm using a throwaway just so that my friends (who know my reddit account lol) won't see this. 

Demographics: Chinese male, Cali, Competitive school (same-old...) No hooks lmao. Rising senior.

Intended Major(s): CS, Economics, Statistics, potentially Operations Research? (idk enough to apply to engineering schools, so I may not yet)

Academics:
ACT: 34 SAT: 2270 (720 CR, 800 M, 750 W, 9 Essay) single-sitting 
SAT 2: 800 Math 2, 750 Physics
Class rank: unavailable, but top 11-12% of class UW/W GPA: 3.67/4.15 (Weak, ik, but upward trend). Coursework:7 AP Exams taken (AP Calc AB, Calc BC, Comsci A, Statistics, Physics C Mechanics, Physics C E&amp;M, World History (lol got a 3... let's not talk about that) ). Honors and AP mainly

Awards: At least 10-15 Awards from robotics competitions, some state business tournament good placing and awards, AP Scholar w/ Distinction

-Captain of FRC Robotics Team (9,10,11,12). Won awards and went to Worlds 2 times. Led a large group of kids and wrote business proposal to gain a lot of money for funding for my team. I am currently trying to coordinate a tutoring project using robotics to teach underprivileged kids about STEM and programming and such. This is a big part of my life and I really became great at helping others learn and attacking situations analytically. 

-President of FBLA (10, VP in 11th, P in 12th). Won regional awards, in charge of the club. Lots of duties and too many to list here, but generally, I enjoy it a lot. I lead a special stock-education part of our chapter, where I teach my classmates about stocks, because I really enjoy discussing them and reading about them. All in all, I really enjoy being in this club :)

-Science Education Club where I became in charge of a tutoring project that works with our local elementary schools, as well as helping a lot to coordinate science fairs and school related events. 

-Teaching kids Computer Science A separately from school. My responsibilities include grading tests and holding study sessions with my other friends (who are teaching it with me). All kids got above a 4 and placed into higher compsci classes. Totally gratifying and fun. 

-Flute Player since 6th grade (6-12). In top orchestra of school/district (1st Flute), in top local orchestra in the region. 
Won 1st place in a solo competition. Private lessons from grades 6-10. Performed at pretty esteemed concert halls.

Volunteering:

-Local hospital for 84 hours as a patient escort.

-Local tutoring center as a teaching assistant for 100 hours. Grades and taught kids math concepts, worked with the database and actually learned how to use Excel extensively here. 

-Robotics Summer Class at local STEM center for 50 hours. Taught kids about robotics and helped them out when they were making their robots (programming, mechanical problems). Did inventory and cleaned up too.

-Church's summer camp for 75 hours. In charge of kids and taught important lessons through fun activities. Volunteered at 5ks and other fundraisers for this organization too.

Summer Activities: 

-Pre calc course (at the same tutoring center where I volunteered lol) which allowed me to take calc AB as a sophomore.

-Volunteering at church summer camp and robotics summer class to get into honors societies.

-Summer internship at Financial Services company this summer where I worked with statistics and back-tested their databases. I also worked with customers and tried to sell financial products to them, which required a lot of research (you can't sell something if you don't know everything about it!). Lots of fun, learned a lot, and I think I'm going to write about it in a supplement at the very least. 

Final thoughts:

I think that I can easily write about how I'm great at helping others and teaching, because that's a general trend in all of my extra-curriculars. What are my chances at the following schools? I'm mostly applying to east coast schools because my family is moving there once I'm done with high school (dad got a job offer in NYC for a hedge fund and my mom is currently looking for a position in that area too). 

Schools: 
1. Rutgers University 
2. UC's (Berkeley, LA, Davis, San Diego, Riverside, Santa Barbara)
3. Cal Poly SLO 
4. Cornell University
5. Brown University
6. Dartmouth College
7. Columbia University

I ended up getting an offer yesterday: 67k starting pay, 5k signing bonus.  I would not start until after I graduate in May, but I need to decide before Oct. 1, so in a month.  So there would be about an 8 month gap between accepting the job and starting.

I would be fine with that except they can't tell me where I would be working.  I would spend 6 months right away in their entry level training program in the midwest, then after that I would be put where there is an opening.  They said that they would try to match my location preferences, but the office I want does not have as much software dev going on as other offices, so I could end up anywhere.  If that's the case, how can I accept the pay without having any clue about cost of living?  67k would be fine in Indy; not so much in Seattle.  

I don't know if it is wise to accept my first offer, especially when I would be sitting on it for 8 months.  What if something better came along?  On the other hand, although I have a 4.0 gpa with an internship under my belt, it might be risky to assume that I will get plenty of other offers.

Extracurriculars:

-NHS


-A very dedicated member of FTC Robotics for 4 years, team leader for 3 years and I run the social media for our team. I helped get our team over 20k in sponsorship before my sophomore year. I have taught the basics of building and programming a robot to 3 years of new members and ensured that they grasped the concepts of FTC.


-Was a member of our schools MATE ROV underwater robotics team, where we would have to create a robot that could perform underwater tasks in a certain amount of time, the competition was at the NASA buoyancy lab in Texas and we placed 5th overall!


-TARC, team engineer so I essentially designed the rocket.


-Student Council all four years, helped plan two blood drives and various fundraisers, elected as Vice President and am working with the president to set up a council of clubs to help enrich our schools clubs affiliations with one another!


-We have a PG17 committee where a group of students plan the trips and fundraisers for our graduating class, I am the Vice President of the group and primarily am in charge of talking to companies and organizing fundraisers and events such as a Black History Movie night or after school bake sales! This year I am focusing on planning the carnival for homecoming and secured the venue for our school prom.


-I spent every Saturday for 9 months going to a Somali cultural center in my area and assisting a group of girls who had recently migrated to the US. The assistance composed of teaching them how to use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, giving them the rundown of how to college application process in the US is like, and helping them with improving their grammar and basic school work.


-Built my own gaming rig

-I spend my free time taking apart scraptops I find at thrift stores and inspecting their hardware elements. 


-I had a one week internship at a local university, I helped in the IT department and assembled and cleaned computers.


-Lots of volunteer work at my Turkish cultural center; I taught a water marbling class and set up booths at various festivals.


200+ hours of Volunteer service that doesn't include my work at my cultural center.  


SUMMER PROGRAMS:


Over this summer I stayed by myself for 8 weeks in Austin, so I could attend these programs:

- I attended Create@UT over the summer, where  over the course of 5 days, I got to meet members of UT's Women in Engineering program, visit the buildings for each Engineering Major at UT, meet engineering professors at UT, attend a Computer engineering lecture, and do various hands on activities to learn about 6 different majors( Aerospace, computer/electrical, Petroleum, Chemical, Biomedical, and Civil).


- I attended Girls Who Code's summer immersion program at the nearby Austin Community College, where over the course of 7 weeks, I learned learned essential computer science concepts (conditionals, while loops, classes, etc) and applied them to Python, Pygame, C++ programming, and HTML/CSS/Javascript creating a 2D scroller game, a robot on wheels that avoided walls, and a web portfolio using Bootstrap amongst other projects. My final project composed of a text adventure/visual hybrid game (think Oregon Trail) using Pygame, with interesting visuals and 4+ different endings, that i coded and illustrated myself!

- The summer before Junior year, I was given an opportunity to travel to the Balkans, otherwise known as old territory of the Ottoman Empire. I was able to visit Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia , and Albania and visit old historical sites of the ottoman empire and learn more about each countries cultural history! After the trip, I returned to my hometown of Turkey and got to stay at the dorm of a local high school and attend a few religious classes over the course of a month!  (Not sure if this counts).


I also need help figuring out which schools I should apply to, because Im really bad at figuring out what schools I match up to.

Thank You!!

50ns4b,2,2016-09-01,Please Help: Transfer Process,ThePaulitician,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/50ns4b/please_help_transfer_process/,"I am strongly inclined to transfer immediately after this semester to a school back home.

I am a native of South Florida and I attended the summer semester at Univ. Of Central Florida (UCF) and am currently attending the fall semester here as well.

My situation for going to college was largely based off the fact that I had a lot of AP Credits. I took 15 AP Classes in high school and passed all of the exams except for 2.

I originally intended on majoring in engineering but switched to Radio/TV on the first day of summer classes. I had taken AP Chemistry, Physics 2 and Physics C: Mechanics in High school and only passed the Physics C: Mec exam. I had decided that at the end of the day, the teachers can only teach so much in an engineering/science setting. Every one of these AP Sciences I took always had a first-year teacher or a teacher who was a rookie to the class. Now, they were smart and knew the material, they just struggled teaching it as it was very difficult material. And it would ultimately be up to me to teach myself and try to get help. I tried to get help, but then realized it was *just not possible* for a student like myself. I really had never seen such challenging, unfamiliar material to the point where I didn't even know where to begin some problems. So I decided to switch to Radio/TV because I am good at public speaking and already have some advantages with YouTube and connections to current students that are also communication majors (these students are not students at UCF though).

The summer was a questionable experience, but it was easy and I got 2 A's. The fall, however, is just as easy but I can't seem to get this topic of transferring off my mind. I had to change some classes for fall and was actually **running out of classes** due to the amount of AP Credits I came in with. Therefore, **the only way I will even be able to attend UCF in the Spring 2017 semester will be to declare a minor.** This is because the Radio/TV program here is application-based and requires a certain amount of credit hours obtained *at UCF.* So I would only be taking classes in Spring for that requirement.

I really just don't see much of a future for myself here. UCF is a great school for a lot of people, but **I just don't see a future for myself down the road here.** The University is in I guess what most people would call an expansion stage; a large portion of this campus is under construction and the school has recently developed connections to funding and internships almost exclusively for STEM Majors and are now looking at opportunities for other majors. Our President is getting very old (no offense to him, but he took the position of President in 1992!) and he's been a good leader that I feel he will be hard to replace. He wasn't even able to attend most of the Opening Ceremony here for freshmen as he left the stage early barely under his own control and he studdered with the teleprompters. This school also has a lot of resources and tuition paying for things I do not even use. There is a *huge* drug and alcohol prevention program, a Pride (LGBQT) place to name a few things and I just have no use for that. I'm sorry but this is college and I have no pity for people who are alcoholics or drug addicts for the most part and the money in my tuition that goes to that is just not reasonable to me and I'm not offensive to LBGQT people so yeah... On top of this, the Radio/TV program is seeming unstable to me. The first day of COM class, my professor showed up late with a very petty excuse and they subbed in another teacher who didn't know what she was doing for the most part.

All this worries me about a future here.

I'm strongly intent on transferring back home to FIU in Miami. Their communication program is application-based too but has less requirement including the credit hours. I also would find a job with the Miami Marlins and Florida Panthers to try to get a background in sports (the portion of radio/TV I want to go into) and it will also give me connections and the opportunity to work for a team if I can't find a job with my degree. Plus, it will be cheaper and I won't be paying for these ridiculously priced meal plans and stuff. Living away from home is expensive and I didn't realize how different it can be until now. I'm not homesick as I've done very well here as you can tell, I just think I have better opportunities and a path down the road back home at FIU instead of here at UCF. My brother graduated 3 years ago and still has not found a job with his degree and I just would hate to see the same thing happen to me.

The problem with this is going to be convincing my parents about it. They are very ""helicopter-ing"" as the UCF First Year Advisors put it. I originally wanted to go to a community college for one semester  (to avoid this situation) but my parents insisted I go to a normal school. My parents have this sort of pride I guess with me going away to school, but in all hoenesty, they won't be able to afford this place after the first year and they refuse to admit that.

I have until November 1st to submit a transfer application to FIU and I am confident at this point that I would want to submit one. I got a partial scholarship here to UCF and I have no doubt that I'd be accepted at FIU at this point.

Help!

How should I approach my parents about this?

For transfer students, can you tell me what influenced your decision to transfer?

I also am very not looking forward to making the trip to the advising office to talk about this. I'm not looking forward to the ""Are you sure? UCF is a great place to be!"" speech.

Thanks for reading this."

Hey so I was offered a job at a large company not traditionally in the tech industry I worked for over the summer as an intern. While I love the city they will place me at (Seattle, WA) and I think a decent starting salary of 70k I have some concerns. First the deadline to accept will be in early October thus limiting my ability to look at other companies by quite a bit since the interview season does not kick up until October. Two the actual placement is into a rotation program where I have no control over of what I actually do( I do enjoy the fact I get to try other things) my concern is I may end up in a team where I really won’t do what  I want which is Software Engineering but that may be a false thought. Three the starting salary surprisingly enough 70k is great but I guess I have it in my head that if I am going out of an ivy league school with a degree in Computer Science I should making a tid-bit more in a place like Seattle(again may just be my imagination). 

I feel like I am being quite grateful for a job offer this early on but I for some reason I am having a lot of concerns the paramount being is this not the company I was hoping to work at after spending close to 4 years of my life in a meat grinder school and not have the ability to interview seriously with companies I really want to work at. What are your thoughts and more specifically your thoughts on accepting the offer and keep interviewing regardless and if a job pops up in a place I really want to work should I go for it?

I guess I am feeling intimidated by the entire process due to every job listing a lot of things I have heard of but have not had direct experience with.

I'm sure this has been posted tons of time but I wanted to hear what everyone's experiences is like to land their first IT job. To give y'all a quick background on me... I've been working in sales/account management for the past 10+ years. I played around with computers but never did anything too crazy with it. I took an A+ course back in 05/06 or so but never took the test (I should've). Fast forward to now, my last two roles was in account management with companies that sell Firewall and Networking gear. I've been able to hold my own on most of the conversations I had with customers but I still needed help when it got too technical.

I am currently enrolled at my local college within the CIS program but I shift gears a bit and now taking Helpdesk Support classes and hopefully complete the program by Summer 2017. Aside from that, I am taking my 901 next Wednesday (wish me luck!) and hopefully pass and take the 902 in October. With that being said, what else should I be doing? I've been looking for internships, speaking to recruiting agencies that place IT folks but haven't had any luck. I am for sure not giving up on what I'm doing but a little motivation would be nice!

Again, I am based out in the Bay Area. Anyone looking for a Jr person or know of any internships?

--------------

So I'm 26, a math major from a good school that graduated in January of 2014.  I had one internship in NYC while at college, but that insurance company barely ever has any openings.  I'm currently working at a Barnes and Noble part time, been there for about half a year now.  

The time between my graduating and getting the part time job was filled with an infinite number of job applications, interview rejections (whether they be full time or part time jobs), and worries about it looking more and more hopeless for any companies wanting to hire me.  I've contacted lots of friends, but no one works anywhere that would have a job related to what I could apply for.  

My resume is solid, my interpersonal attitude and interview skills are fine, and I know my biggest weaknesses are the lack of experience, lack of connections, and broadness of my major, but I can't go back and change any of that.  I suffered from some extremely serious health problems in college that left me hospitalized a few times at the worst, and that clearly hurt my chances at stellar grades and more internships.  

So I'm not sure what to do.  I've been getting less and less responses from insurance/financial/tech/etc companies since I've started working part time, which makes it even more discouraging to go into work every day.  It honestly feels like I'm trapped there now since I can't find any full time job.  

I've considered almost every different job option you can think of, teacher, actuary, underwriter, business analyst, financial analyst, even going back to grad school etc etc.  I've been applying to any and all options I can (and I half regret not signing up for grad school in the spring when I started at B&amp;N, I assumed I'd have a real job by now) but I'm not sure what else to do.  

So does anyone have any suggestions of how to get out of this part time ""trap""?  It's not a terrible job, the people are all so nice and I love books so I enjoy being there, but sometimes I get home to my parents' house and it just hits me that I'm not getting anywhere with my life, seemingly no matter how hard I try.  I hate that feeling.  "

Need help deciding.",eldigg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50pwp0/two_job_offers_conflicting_advantages_and/,"I'm pretty new out of college, graduated in December 2014 from no-name state school, and I had an internship at a very small software company in town.  I got an offer and accepted a full-time software dev position at a large insurance company, right of school.  I've worked for them nearing on two years.

I've generally disliked working for the insurance company (old tools, old software, people who haven't kept up with modern tech, yearly release cycles).  I'm good friends with a number of people there, which has mitigated the dislike.  However, two weeks ago I moved to a newly created department within the same insurance company.  It promises modern development practices and a large number of experienced and passionate coworkers; we have been told that since it has good people in it, we'll be somewhat able to define our own tooling/processes etc.  I've met most of the people I'll be working with, and they all seem intelligent and team players.  It is a large opportunity within the company (so I'm told).

Here's the conflict, the place I interned at contacted me and offered me what is essentially a technical architect / software engineering position as they do an application rewrite.  They're very small, it would be me and two/three or so other new hires (which I've been offered to have input on their hiring).  This would bring the company to about seven employees.  There would be considerably more freedom in choosing tools/language/frameworks, and the work would probably be more interesting.  However, it's about 10k less salary, and only offers health insurance.  I have concerns about company stability (since it is so small), and due to a health condition I absolutely have to have decent quality health insurance.  Another concern is the possibility of not having a good mentor.

I've spent a long time trying to figure out which is better, but it is very hard not really knowing what to expect with my new position at my current company.

tl;dr Conflicting advantages/disadvantages, having trouble deciding between two companies."

I just finished an internship at a well known tech company in the bay area with an outstanding evaluation and a potential return offer which  they have considered my situation and I think? agreed on bringing me back. I am also in contact with another company that I interned for that is also excited with potentially bringing me back but they do not know about my current situation yet.

Currently, I have these paths in mind for the summer before going back to school:

Taking the return offer and intern for the same company again.

Pros:

* There looks to be a high percent chance that I will be received back by the team
* It is a well known tech company; from the word around, if I were to have them back to back, it would reflect as something positive on my resume

Cons:

* For the same company though, I am looking to intern at another team instead, I don't know how the process will go
* Not sure how the visa process will work since technically I am not in school? and I am not a US citizen

Trying out and apply to other companies for the summer

Pros:

* Diversity in experience, maybe I might land with a top tier company with my current resume
* Securing another location for potential full time after I graduate

Cons:

* Have to use the time off to prepare for the interview process
* I might not even be qualified for many because I am technically not in school at the time
* If I end up with nothing, pretty much in some ways, I have wasted a noticeable chunk of time

Going back to school for a non-degree term for elective courses

Pros:

* Refine me in the school environment
* Allows me to learn courses that I normally cannot take due to my schedule

Cons:

* It costs money
* Not sure if I want to be in school for 8 months in a row, (although this will not be a full load)
* I might have a gap in my resume where it is noticeable to the employers when I apply for jobs internally through my school for my next internship

Take the summer off

Pros:

* More time to reach my goals

Cons:

* If I were to reach my goals earlier, I will have a summer where I am doing nothing?
* Not earning anything to help pay for my tuition
* I might have a gap in my resume where it is noticeable to the employers when I apply for jobs internally through my school for my next internship

Overall, I don't know which route would be the best to take. Although I probably may go back, I also do want to take a step up and get a different (potentially better) internship to expand my resume and portfolio. Which path(s) do you think should I take and which one will benefit me the most overall? (career and personal wise)

We got into several fights throughout high school because of that. I ended up being really scared of telling them my thoughts because they'll criticize them as well as a lowered self-confidence because they say God will take away everything good I had if I disobey them or be ""too proud"".

Over the course of my first 3 years in universiy, I tried to please my parents as much as possible by doing nothing but school, only looking at jobs and website they'll be happy with. I actually got into a fight with them because they forced me to show them my browsing history and saw a bunch of video game sites. Needless to say, those years were the most miserable years in my life. I always got a summer job only because of my parents or their friends. I also ended up having to do an extra year of school because I fucked up too many courses because of me lacking drive. I ended up developing a habit of not telling my parents anything they didn't like and to be a people-pleaser.

When PEY (a year in my program for taking time off school to work) came, I ended up at a job I got through my parents' friends. Needless to say, I was fucking miserable. During that time, I ended up deciding on my dream and applied to the Canadian Forces Reserves. Over the course of a few months, I got another internship, and I also got sworn into the military. By the time I got back to 4th year, I realized I fucking hated school and that I'd rather jump out of a building than go for a Master's like what my parents wanted. Long story short, I managed to trudge through the school year and kept my Canadian military application and swearing-in a secret.

I got shipped out to basic training in June and ended up getting my phone taken away. The next time I called them, they were hysterical because they thought I went missing. I wasn't sure what happened, but I realized I didn't give a flying fuck about what they thought anymore. Even though we had a fight, I felt free for the first time in my life because they had zero power over me. I made friends during that course, and I did my best. My parents did come up to visit once, but only because I invited them. It was the first time we were on even terms instead of them looking down at me. I ultimately graduated top of my class in basic training, and my instructors said I'll have a great career in the military. 

Needless to say, my parents saw me in a whole new light when I got back home. They admitted that they thought the military wasn't right for me and that that they'd have been happy if I passed, they weren't ready at all for me being the top recruit. They finally said they'll support me if I decided to use my engineering degree to pursue a military career.

This summer was the first time I felt good about myself. The top recruit award didn't just boost my confidence in myself as a Canadian soldier, but also in myself as a person. It was the first time I found self-confidence instead of saying to myself I didn't deserve success. This school year (also my last) will be the first year I feel confident, and it'll be the first year I actually do something I enjoyed rather than what my parents approved of.

p.s. I had a few drinks, in case anybody notices I'm kind of inarticulate."

(Part 1)",j0hn217,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/50r3in/i_thought_this_was_a_prank_but_now_i_need_help/,"I guess I'll start off by saying that, everything else I'll share notwithstanding, one of the worst parts of my current situation is that I was really looking forward to the extended weekend, and taking some time off from work and hanging out with friends. It's been a while since I've gotten out of a city setting, and spent some time in the outdoors, near a fire, with people I actually care about. I travel a lot for work, and it seems like when I do actually get time at home, I spend it working in my home office while I do laundry, and begin packing to leave town again. Lots of airports, lots of hotels, lots of rental cars. 

Earlier today, I caught a really early flight from out west back home to the Midwest. I knew that later this afternoon, it would be nothing but me, and a few lifelong friends from elementary school packing up the car, and heading to the northeastern part of my state, where there's a popular peninsula community on one of the Great Lakes. Campfire, hikes, cold beer, and conversation from today through Sunday. This group of friends, all of us being about 30, are the type where we can all ""let down our guard"" a bit, tell bad jokes, etc. 

You know the type of friends. The people who've known you since your mom was still picking your outfits. 

In the midst of my packing, I remember looking at a portable charger sitting on my desk this morning that my cousin had given me as a Christmas gift.

""Should I bring it,"" I asked myself out loud, as if doing so would make the decision clearer. Don't laugh, this was a serious decision! I know myself well enough to know that, given the opportunity, with nobody around, I am still attached to my phone, and will still sneak in a work e-mail or two. That mindless action of swiping up on your phone and searching for wifi.  Don't pretend, you don't do the exact same thing to save on your data charges whenever possible, or have the fear of your phone dying when you just ""need"" to Google something.

Whatever, I threw the portable charger, AC adapter, and white cord into my backpack, zipped it up, and told myself I wouldn't tempt myself. ""Shit,"" I remember thinking. I almost forgot my stainless steel coffee mug, too. I quickly grabbed that and was out the door. 

The plan was to pick up my friend Jay, and drive to our hometown, only about an hour, to meet a couple of our other friends, Ben and Katie. From there, we'd hop in Ben's large SUV, and then nothing but the open road. Tomorrow, we were going to meet our friend Greg at his house, who now lives on the peninsula with his new wife. 

Well, we pulled up to Ben's place, and they were waiting next to his SUV, on the sidewalk, with their bags neatly resting by their feet. 

""Christ,"" I said to Jay. ""Either they're shooting the shit and haven't packed the car, or something is wrong."" 

Yeah, something was definitely wrong, I thought, just as Jay said, ""Well, Ben is beet red in the face, and already cracked a beer. That's not a good sign."" I pulled up behind them, put the car in park, and we got out. 

""Check engine light is on,"" Ben said before swilling down the rest of his luke-warm can of cheap beer, and greeting me with a hug. ""You mind driving? I don't want to risk it if it's something serious,"" he asked.

""Not a problem, we'll make it work,"" I replied quickly. I just wanted to get going. The drive would be cramped, now, but it's only three hours, and I'd be driving my new car, so what do I care? We threw our bags into the trunk, somehow fit the cooler in there, too, and hit the road. 

Once we got out of the city traffic, Katie helped me navigate the scenic route north. We made the decision to stay off the interstate, and were hugging the coast of the Great Lake the entire time. The views are stunning. For those of you who haven't been near one of the Great Lakes, it's almost as beautiful as the ocean. Endless water over the horizon. I could only catch a few glimpses when I was driving, though, since I had to keep my eyes on the road. 

Except for one pit-stop for fire wood, ice, and a bottle of bourbon, we made it there in 3.5 hours, and pulled up to the ranger station, where a tall, lanky guy in a green uniform put out his hand to stop us. We paid him the fee, filled out the form, and we were ready to go. 

""The tower is closed for repairs, but everything else is open. Should be a great night to check out the sunset from one of the bay-side bluffs,"" the park ranger said. I couldn't wait. Do you remember that restless feeling when you were a kid, the night before a field trip or something fun? 

""Sunset? Bluffs? Let's do it all,"" I joked. 

""Hey can we get a site with the electric hook-up,"" Ben asked. I caught myself sneering at him because I knew if we had a site with an electric hook-up, I would be even more tempted to charge my phone and ""check-in"" from time to time. 

""You got it,"" the ranger said. It was a done deal, and now I'd have to exercise some real self-restraint.

The night couldn't have gone more perfectly. In the evening, the temperature dropped down to about 60, and the highs would be in the mid 70s throughout the trip, with no humidity. We climbed the scenic tower, even though we were told not to. You can't visit this particular state park without climbing the giant wooden tower. Likely a stupid  move after we'd been warned, but we survived. The ranger was right. The sunset was breathtaking. A myriad of oranges and reds popping out of the horizon as the sun seemingly sunk into the water. You could actually feel the warmth of the rays on your face. 

Once it got a little darker, we saw the ranger truck shining his light on the tower.

""A white walker approaches The Wall, my lord"" Jay whispered. We all giggled as we sat on the observation platform, hiding. I peeked back down, and the small pick-up the ranger was driving was gone. Must have just been a nightly check, or something. 

We made it back to camp, sipped on a little bourbon by the fire, caught up with one another.  Katie just started a new job in logistics, Ben was still working as an accountant in the same firm that hired him as an intern back when we were in college. Jay was bartending and just recently got accepted into the police academy. 

Ben has been known to drink a lot. Some things never change, as they say. ""I don't feel so good,"" he said at one point. 

""Don't you puke on my shoes, Harry,"" I joked, quoting a 90's Travolta mobster movie. That got a laugh, and definitely made the situation less embarrassing for Ben, who eventually did the ""puke and rally"" technique. I think that's more common in our state than any other, unfortunately.

I can't tell you how refreshing it was to be around people I have known for 25 years. All of our families know each others families, and we've all shared so many of the same experiences, good and bad. We talked about Katie's mom, who passed away abruptly when we were all in college. God, I think that might have been the last time we were all in the same room together. We also did some bad impressions of elementary school teachers that we had. 

At one point, I just sort of dazed off, watching the three of them interact, laughing 'til they were red in the face, and so on. It hit me: I really needed this. Even with traveling so much for work and being around people constantly, then coming home to an empty apartment, I've been really concerned about what direction my life is headed. Maybe this trip was exactly what I needed to break some of the loneliness I've been feeling...that overwhelming feeling of stress and having nobody around to talk to just seemed to disappear, even in the short time we'd hung out tonight. Sometimes in the midst of wondering where my life was headed, I just wanted it to all go away.

""Alright, I've gotta piss,"" I said as I looked around for a flashlight. 

""Don't break the seal,"" Jay yelled. I couldn't find a flashlight, so I grabbed my phone, swiped up, and clicked the little flashlight icon. 

""I'll be right back,"" I muttered as I scurried off. 

There is a convenient little pathway through a very short strip of woods, maybe a quarter of a city block in length, leading from our campsite down to a semi-sand beach. The flashlight turned off, right as I was ""aiming,"" so I swiped up to turn the light back on. Fuck, there it was. I was pretty buzzed, and saw the wifi icon, and thought, let me just open the ""mail"" app, check once, and make sure no last minute work e-mails came in while we were on the road. ""After all,"" I bargained with myself, ""I'm taking tomorrow off, so something might've come through that needs my attention.""

I searched for a wifi connection, and sure enough, ""Free,"" it said. I can't tell you what a relief that word is, especially when I spend $5 here and $10 there for wifi in-flight and in airports. Such a scam. 

I clicked on it, refreshed my mail. Nothing. Great. I sneaked a quick cigarette while I was by the water, and took a moment to let it sink in. Here I was, in the middle of nowhere, with great friends, and not a care in the world. It was so quiet, save for the sound of the lake. 

I made my way back to the campsite. 

Nice, a practical joke. They were gone, fire still going, and my beer sitting right where I left it. Their bags and camp chairs were gone too, though. And only my tent remained.

What a bunch of pricks. 

""Okay guys. Funny,"" I said quietly to myself. 

""Fuck 'em,"" I thought. I sat back down, and opened another beer. Nice, there's that bottle of bourbon, too. I smoked another cigarette. For you smokers reading this, it was the type that hits so perfectly after you've had some alcohol, in combination with the cool, outdoor air. Or maybe it was because this was the first pack I've purchased in nearly a year. Probably a mistake, we'll see.

As a half hour went by, I starting to get a little pissed. Alright, granted, the joke was good, and took some effort. And, if they had been kidnapped or if something was wrong, I would have heard shouting, a struggle, something. The spot where I went to pee wasn't that far away, and again, if somebody had abducted them, would the suspect really be so meticulous as to have them round up their stuff?

I sat there and gave myself the decision to have one more swallow of bourbon once I finished my beer, or climb into my tent and close my eyes. I decided to go to bed. It had been a long day of travel for me, having started on the west coast at 4AM. I knew eventually, they'd come back when they realized I wasn't paying attention to their prank. The fire was small enough now that I dumped a little bit of water on it, and it started to sizzle. I got into my tent. The wind started to pick up. That noise. My god, it reminded me of something out of a scary Halloween movie. The strong wind rushing through the trees, coupled with just feeling very alone suddenly. 

Another half hour passed, and now I was starting to get a little scared. What finally got my ass out of the tent was that my head was starting to throb, and the smell of the smoke was just irritating me. The wind was blowing perfectly in the direction of my tent. 

Maybe if I contacted them, they'd know the gag was up. I group-texted all of them. 

""Okay, joke's on me. Ha ha. Let's call it a night tho so we can be at Greg's on time. Wanna do an early morning hike?"" 

I put on my hoodie, and went and sat in my chair, and chugged some water, checking my phone intently for a reply. I peed again, this time behind my tent, and felt my anger level begin to rise with every moment that passed. I convinced myself they'd respond, or agree that the joke had gone on long enough. But nothing. 

I started walking down the narrow dirt road that even my car had a hard time fitting down earlier today. It probably goes without saying, but it was dark and quiet. The type of dark where you're not sure if something is wrong with your eyes. And so quiet.

Perhaps somebody in a nearby tent invited them over for drinks or food? Maybe a ranger came by and told them to evacuate? I have no idea, but I'm humoring every possibility. But if that happened, why would they leave without me? Are you kidding? 

I made it to a nearby campsite. Vacant. I walked to the next campsite. Vacant. In fact, I still couldn't hear or see anybody else when I stopped. I decided to get back to my car and drive to the ranger station. I don't know why, but this might have been the eeriest moment in the dark. As I slowly drove up, I could see a green blinking light in the station. It's so dark out side that the tiny LED illuminated the interior of the whole booth-sized station. What's weirder is that I got this feeling like I was just here, with my friends, choosing a campsite, and getting ready for a great weekend.

""CLOSED,"" the sign said. ""OPEN DAILY 7AM-8PM"". I tapped on the glass just to make sure there wasn't some 24-hour emergency staff on site, and peered inside as best I could. Nobody.

Driving back just now, it dawned on me. It's basically Labor Day weekend. These sites, every one, should be full. 

As I write this, I'm at our site. I'm waiting and hoping there's some logical explanation for this. I've sent a few more texts, and I've also tried calling each of their phones. I tried calling Ben's phone first because I thought I might be able to hear it in the distance- he has this obnoxious ""boats and hoes"" ringtone from Stepbrothers. I couldn't hear anything. I even tried to call Greg, but he works until later. All of their phones must have been turned on, though, because they went to voicemail after a normal number of rings. 

I'm going to try to close my eyes for a bit and figure this out. Who knows, it's still early enough in the night that I probably won't be able to sleep. Maybe I'll make a fire? But I don't necessarily want to draw attention to myself? I'm getting increasingly frantic now. I know it will be easier to navigate during the daylight, though, and try to find some tracks or anything that might help me. But should I wait that long? 

In the morning, I can check back at the ranger station, or drive out to Greg's place. Hopefully at that point, they will have returned, and I can humiliate myself in front of the r/nosleep community when I post an explanation and have fallen for some ridiculous hoax. 

I'm newer to Reddit, but I know how helpful you all can be, just based on reading responses on other posts. If you have any idea what might be going on, please help me out. I'll update you as soon as I know more. 


---------------------

Update- 12:27PM: I don't know if any of you will see this, but I'm okay, and I have located my friends. I'm with them now, but something huge is off. I'm going to try to get in front of a computer tonight, and give you the long version.

50rair,1,2016-09-01,Worried about the future,PussyMoneyWeed_,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/50rair/worried_about_the_future/,"I've spent the last 3 years of college partying my ass off, dicking around on financial aid refunds, and generally making no progress toward setting myself up for the future. The result of that has been a 2.8 GPA and experience that consists of nothing but a high school summer job working for Baskin Robbins and an ongoing volunteership for an online crisis hotline that admittedly, I did mostly to feel good about myself. I'm not sure what I'm going to do after graduation - I'm an econ major with a business minor, originally intending to do investment banking or something else in finance for the money and prestige (like I'll ever get in with my GPA and no experience), I'm interested in cog sci more than anything and wish I had majored in that instead, and I'm considering computer science as the practical path that asks for more hands on experience than anything. At this point it's far too late to change my major without taking an extra year if not more of college. Worst of all, I was okay with all of this for the past 3 years.

Fast forward to today. I started dating a girl a couple months ago, and I can actually see a future for us. In fact, we've talked about getting married in the future once we both have stable jobs (at first jokingly, but now seriously). That's when it hit me, along with the fact that I'm about to be a college senior, that I do not have my life together at all.

It feels like I have so much that I need to do. I've been told that I need to gain practical skills, so do I start self-studying CS? I also need to find an internship, but where would I even start? I never got involved in any clubs and I dropped out of my frat early on because I was an ass and joined only for the parties, which turned out to not be that great. At the same time I probably need to find a job, for money if I need an extra year of college, or at the very least work experience (despite not necessarily being in my field). I just feel like I have so much to do with so little time, and I'm especially having a hard time because my girlfriend just left to study abroad until December.

Please help me Reddit. What should I do?"

I'm currently studying in New Zealand (think lord of the rings!) as a first year Software Engineering student. My academic position is currently good - I have received scholarships to study at my current university and am passing with GPA of 3.75. I know, I know - early days. The successive years will destroy that GPA! Fair enough. However I feel like my lack of projects are limiting me for potential internships.

As some background for my course, we are using Java predominantly and have had a small foray into C. We will learning some python next year alongside continuing Java but I'm thinking about taking a head start on that before summer, I digress. Personally in my own time I have done web dev stuff - HTML/CSS, JavaScript, bit of PhP. Some C and Pascal in my younger days when I was being personally taught programming. So pretty much - nothing major haha!

I'm thinking toward the summer (Christmas for us down under) where internships are often offered. My formal previous work experience hasn't been IT related, simply because I haven't felt like I've had the knowledge to enter the industry (it has mostly been bartending work). I have always been interested in IT from a very young age so I don't believe it's an issue with feeling commited. My main concern is that I haven't done personal projects outside of university that are documented on GitHub or any other VCS. Some things that was notable I guess was creating a basic robot using RPi's and C to follow a line, solve a maze etc. However, nothing I personally drove. I have a few ideas for this summer but as I'm thinking about an internship over the summer, I can't tell prospective employers 'oh I'm going to do this thing but I haven't gotten round to it yet...'.

I think what's probably relatively common in my situation is my current feeling of ill-preparedness and incapability. Which is why I reach out to you, the likely more experienced and knowledgeable. Have you been in this situation before, how did you solve it? Do you recommend I wait another year? Do I take up a menial data-entry job? I'm currently liking the OOP we're doing in Java right now - it just makes so much sense and love it. Maybe even a direction to fire myself for the future.

I am 100% willing to drop my prospects of a Junior Software Dev internship for a foot in the door in the IT industry itself if I do need to.

Much appreciated and apologies about the wall of text

50tq5a,1,2016-09-02,How do I become a better Release Engineer?,samort7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50tq5a/how_do_i_become_a_better_release_engineer/,"Five months ago, I was hired by a fairly big internet company to be their new Associate Release Engineer. Prior to this job, I had been an ESL teacher for 3 years, a self-studying programmer for 1 year, and a Computer Science student for 6 months (I was trying to switch careers as you can probably tell). I had initially applied for a Software Engineering internship position, but the company felt that I was promising and wanted to hire me on as a full-time Associate Release Engineer instead.

From the company's end, it was a generous, albeit risky move. Their current Senior Release Engineer was switching departments and they needed to replace him but finding a seasoned veteran at a reasonable price is difficult, so they decided to hire someone fresh and train them up for the job. That someone was me.

They are aware that I am new to the job and  that I have a mountain of learning ahead of me, so I do not feel pressured by them in the slightest. However, its the aforementioned mountain that is causing me the most distress. There is so much to learn, and it all comes in the form of a system that has been build upon since almost the beginning of the internet. (No joke, this company has been around a *long* time.)

I only understand the whole development process from a surface level. The whole system is custom-made with custom tools that have no documentation because they've only ever been used by maybe 8 people here. I try to read books on Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration, but they are all written about how those systems *should* work which is very different from how they actually work at my company.

My team consists of 4 people - my supervisor, two senior release engineers and myself. The senior release engineers are both located off site so I have never seen them in person. My supervisor is a great guy, but he was also recently moved to this department 8 months ago and he is still learning everything too. The only real person I can ask is the former Release Engineer who set everything up, but he's in a different department now and I hate bothering him all the time.

How do I go about learning this huge system with all these moving parts? What resources can teach me how software is developed and moved through the different pipelines to release? Where can I learn what packages are, how they're made, what artifacts are and why they are important and all the other stuff that comes with programming that isn't programming itself? There's just so much stuff to learn. 

I'm doing my part when I can. I resolve tickets I understand and create documentation when I learn something new. I even made a tool to help examine build boxes and converted it to a C# MVC app (my first great achievement). But all the inner workings of the core development and build process are just so enigmatic. I often sit at my desk not sure what I should be learning next or how I should go about learning it.

Just for reference - my company uses the following technologies which I've slowly begun to absorb as I can:

Jenkins, MSBuild, Perforce, Confluence, Jira, CCNet, NuGet, Artifactory - however, its not the tools I have trouble with, but how they all interconnect.

I'm not stressed out, I just want to be a more effective employee.

So I graduated in May with a BS in CS at age 27. In school I was never a rockstar with side projects, never had an internship, but got good grades. I would say my lack of projects/internship was due to a combination of a lack of ""passion"" for the field (not that I hate it, it just doesn't really excite me like it does others) and also just feeling lost every time I tried to start something on my own.

Since graduation I have not really done programming, because while searching for a job, I had major anxiety problems I was getting treated for, and the thought of picking up a computer to program literally made me feel sick with anxiety. My problem has always been lack of confidence in my skills. I don't think it helps that I'm older than most graduates but still lack experience, which adds to the feeling of being behind everyone else.

But I still got a job just based on doing well in the interview, which entailed talking about my school experience and common behavioral questions.

The fact that the job I got is geared toward new grads and mentions ""continued learning"" with a mentor as part of the deal hasn't really eased my mind at all. Probably because the process didn't include a whiteboard interview, which makes me feel like I'm a fraud who lucked into a job because they didn't bother to check if I know what I'm doing. I kind of wish they had, so that if I'm not qualified, I wouldn't have gotten hired. I know this probably sounds ridiculous to people who are still searching for work and can't get it. In addition, the pay is higher than I was expecting to get, which really makes me feel like they made a mistake by giving me this job and are going to be expecting a lot.

I only have a little over two weeks until the job starts. It's in a new language (C#) than what I primarily worked with in school (Java). I feel like I'm totally rusty in addition to already not being very knowledgeable. I just don't really know what to do. I would probably consider backing out of the job if that was an option, to give myself time to get back into programming, but it isn't, because I already signed a lease and everything. 

Basically I don't even know what I'm asking for here, I guess just any advice for how to handle this predicament I've gotten myself into."

However, I feel like there is a bit of an overwhelming gap between what I know and what I should know..

I've already started looking at internships and FT jobs to apply to and I can go through a book like Cracking the Coding Interview and have a decent understanding of Data Structures. 

When taking courses through my university though, all I've learned is command line C++ and am currently taking on OS programming and Web programming (+ some other knowledge based ones).

Is this gap in knowledge to be expected before becoming employed? I ask this because a UI class I am currently taking assigned an open-ended project to program any app(desktop, mobile, or web) with a good UI with any language that teammates and myself would be comfortable with. Yet, I don't know where to start since all I was taught was CLI C++..

50usx0,3,2016-09-02,Help with appeal letter,throwfaraway994,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/50usx0/help_with_appeal_letter/,"I cannot take the remaining classes (34 credits) needed to graduate because I am not admitted to my major. I was not admitted because my GPA is .1 short of the requirement. I retook classes last semester to improve it but fell short for a variety of reasons. My federal aid runs out this year and I also will fail SAP requirements if I do not finish my degree this year. So at the advice of a couple people I am asking my school to temporarily allow me into the major with the stipulation that I meet the GPA requirement at the end of this semester. I don't want to come off as making excuses. I would really appreciate if anyone could offer any advice for improving my letter before I submit it. I am trying to keep it pretty brief, let me know if i should expand or remove any topics I covered.



Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is throwfaraway994 and I have been a student at school since September 2013. I transferred my sophomore year from different school. I will be entering my fifth year this fall. I am asking for major status for the fall 2016 semester. Over the course of my college career, I have faced many struggles and challenges in being a successful student. Over the past summer break; I have made many strides and preparations that will allow me to reach my goal of becoming both an engineer and successful student. 

The primary issues that impacted my success in college thus far have been financial and personal. Initially, my mom was able to help me pay for college but could not afford to after my third semester. I have worked part time the entire time I have attended school and work full time (usually internships) during the summer to pay for my rent, tuition, food, etc. Working these hours in addition to my mom’s income kept affecting the amount of aid I received from FAFSA. As a result I received less and less aid each year, which resulted in the need to work more hours during the semester to pay for more tuition in addition to my other expenses.  Additionally, I will have exhausted the little aid I receive at the conclusion of the 2016-2017 school year.

Additionally, I was recently diagnosed with ASD. I am high-functioning and have developed many coping skills over the years which allowed me to go undiagnosed for so long. This has impacted my academic career in many ways I did not realize. I worked with a professional this summer to identify why I struggle with certain things as well as create solutions for these issues to allow me to be more successful going forward. I will use these strategies both inside and outside the classroom.

I meet all requirements for admission to major with the exception of the GPA in core courses; I stand at a 0.1 below in that category and a 2.72 overall. My primary goal this semester will be to get that GPA over the requirement to allow myself to continue in the major. I take full responsibility for my shortcomings and have made every effort to address them.  I am positive that given the chance, I will be able to succeed where I have fallen short before.  Grant me temporary major status for the fall 2016 semester and I will do right by myself and by the College.

I have made many adjustments that will aid me in being successful during this academic year. I will be using outside funding to supplement my financial aid, in order to dramatically reduce the number of hours I need to work. This will allow me much more time to study, participate in study groups, meet with professors, TA’s and tutors and overall be more able to focus on my academics. I have study groups planned for my classes as well as dedicated study hours. I have also reduced the number of extracurricular activities and responsibilities I will be participating in.  Additionally, I have improved methods for keeping track of assignments, future tests and project due dates to ensure nothing is overlooked. I have an academic plan for the both the fall and spring semester (see attached). 

I truly hope that this shows I am dedicated and determined to being a successful student at school. I will put forth all the work and effort necessary not only to graduate from school this spring but also to becoming a great engineer and alumni member of school. Please do not let my past bar me from a successful future. I have taken many strides and steps to ensure I will be successful this year. I truly believe I can be a great engineer and ask that you consider granting me major status.
Thank you,

Throwfaraway994

Embedded/computer engineering, trying to find work, thinking about switching to data science/machine learning",narrow_blue,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50wds6/what_should_i_do_embeddedcomputer_engineering/,"**Background**

- I graduated Portland State University in 2010 with a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a 3.0 GPA.

- I converted an internship at Intel to a full time job as a firmware/BIOS/BSP/hardware bringup engineer. I quit in 2014 after 3½ years because I was super depressed

- From 2014 to 2015 I did a lot of rock climbing and spent a year teaching English at a university in China.

- In late 2015 I returned to the US and took the first 6 month contract job that a recruiter threw my way. The work was unchallenging with little room to grow, and I guess I felt it was beneath me after working as a full time employee.

- That contract ended in March. I've spent the past 6 months burning through my savings and working on an unsuccessful relationship.

**About Me**

- I don't need a prestige job at Google. I do like having money.
- I'm picky about living in a place with restaurants, culture, public transit, bike infrastructure, and access to the outdoors
- It's important to me to work with smart people on challenging problems (not bit twiddling in C).
- I'm averse to work that seems evil or pointless.
- I don't have a great degree of self discipline.
- My CS skills end at sophomore level data structures. My experience has all been single-threaded bit-twiddling in C.

**What I've done so far**

My plan had been to get on with Microsoft's hardware team. After a couple employee referrals I've yet to hear anything back from them, so I have to assume they're not hiring right now.

- I interviewed with Google in January with no preparation
- I failed a take-home pre-screen with a Portland-based IoT startup
- I phone screened with a team at Apple in June, it seemed like things went fine but they were looking specifically for a power optimization guy
- I repeatedly put off interviews with Lab126 until one or both of us got distracted and forgot about it
- I started a batch at Hired.com last week. I haven't gotten any interview requests yet
- I started last week responding to all the sketchy contract recruiters. So far they've been sending me positions at Intel

**Plan**

With the hole in my work history growing, I think it makes sense to find a contracting gig in Seattle metro and use UW's continuing education classes to make the switch to data science or machine learning(?)

I'd be open to working at a startup. How does one find those jobs?

**Question**

How is embedded as a field? I'm interested in developing embedded devices and it seems like technical leads are in high demand, I'm just not sure how to get the experience necessary to take ownership of a project on my own.

Is the market for embedded much stronger in the bay area? Should I be focusing my efforts there?

What steps should I take to find work in Seattle?

I recently worked at a small tech startup in Burlington, VT as a software engineer. My two fellow employees and I signed full time employment offers after working there as interns. We were given a very clear signed document from our boss / ceo which outlined our pay amount and dates we would receive pay each month. 

Our boss was unable to pay us on our first pay date, and made up an excuse for why (which we have saved as email documents). Then he was unable to pay our second month, and now the third. The reason for why he is unable to pay changes every time. We were patient with him at first but it has gotten out of control and we just want some pay for the work we did. 

One of us still works at the company, me and one other person quit a few days ago. 

My question is: is it possible to sue our boss for failing to keep his promise on paying us and misleading us into working for free? Could we somehow take legal action to get the pay and perhaps damages for the time we were not paid?

We are young guys who have no experience with legal action. I'd really appreciate any advice! 

Thanks all."

I had a good GPA (over 3.6), no real internship experience but paid research/design stuff instead. 

To be more specific, I'm in love with Colorado and I spent the three months since I've been out of school trying to get a job there. It's not happening, I've got job offers around me instead (MI), guess I'll have to try again in a year or something. Not that I'm ungrateful for what i have as a new grad, I'm just curious about what it takes. 

So if you folks with experience could give me some insight, I'd appreciate it :)

1) Does the current location of the person matter a lot?

2) Is CO just saturated with experienced engineers? It'll obviously be a popular place, but I figured the tech industry was big enough there to support lots of new incomers. 

3) Is internship/work experience fairly necessary to find a job out there?

4) I tried removing my address, putting ""Looking g near Denver, CO"" on my resume posted online to make it easier for recruiters out there to find me. Assuming the things above aren't major setbacks, is there something else I could do to make it easier for recruiters in a specific area of the country to find me/my resume online?

I also have enough credits to graduate with my econ degree this fall. 

I could apply for CS Master's programs which would start this spring and hope to transfer to a PhD later on, but this will probably be too difficult because my spring GPA was low (3.1, bad semester), I haven't proven myself in computer science yet (I only had one CS course in the spring; I skipped the entry levels and am now taking mid level courses), and I only know one professor well enough to get a very good letter of recommendation.

Alternatively, I could apply for graduate programs starting in the fall. If that happens I will have proven myself through fall coursework and CS projects. But should I apply for an MS or should I apply directly for a PhD? And if I do this, what should I do for the spring - continue my undergrad for another semester taking more relevant classes, or leave to do research and self study on my own, or take some kind of internship?

* Not from CS branch, but have good programming skills. Good at C,C++. Also worked with OpenCV, so have some idea of Python as well. Two mini projects were primarily programming based(Image Processing using OpenCV/Python).
* First internship at [TCIL](http://www.tatatinplate.com/). It was a technical one where I worked on assembly line automation(data from PLC on assy line to SQL database).
* Second internship which I am currently doing is at Aerospace Department, IISC Bangalore. Working on a project which employs machine learning.
* Have 10 months of volunteer experience at a recognized NGO. Primarily conducted workshops and was their tech guy.
* Hobbies include commercial flight simulation(fly as pilot on [Air India Virtual](http://airindiavirtual.net/vms/). Also, keep a regularly updated blog. Started a tech club at my college and member of the core team.
* Pretty good with quant + english. Taking tests on [Testpot](www.testpot.com) and consistently score above 95%ile. So aptitude shouldn't be an issue.

For the entire year, I'm taking all the classes I should of taken last year, so basically doubling up on courses. I've already taken object-oriented programming in Java, but all did a lot of other programming on the side. 

Since I am on track with declaring, but should of taken half my classes last year, how would I explain this when talking to recruiters, interviewers, etc if they *do* ask? 

My target internships are made for underclassmen, basically explore programs. I feel like I'm not at the level I need to be, but I will need as much experience as I can get. I'm also a Asian-American Female so it's only helping out as much as it can as many internships want minorities.  Should I say I was a pre-med before hand and became more passionate about technology? Another reason behind my academic delay is because I was assaulted last quarter and was too anxious to take any of my finals and ended up dropping out of school momentarily and it is shown on my transcript. I don't want to have to explain all of this to them, but I also don't want them to think I'm not serious and being extremely slow with my coursework.

What should I do here? 

If I stay with the job, I may end up with a lower GPA but they may bring me on after I graduate (I've been told by others in  the organization that my team is interested in bringing me on full time after graduation).  If they do bring me on, I could get a masters, etc, for free via tuition remission (I work at a branch within my uni). I probably wouldn't even be accepted if I applied due to my GPA, but I could get accepted to other schools supported by the tuition remission. 

If I quit, I could get my GPA up, especially if I prolong my stay for another semester or two (which would suck but I feel I'd be in a better position overall). I could even cram in a summer internship before I graduate. 

Also, I do kind of need money to help with bills form time to time. Living at home and my family is poor

I have a lot of experience with Excel, VBA and SQL and I'm looking for career paths that would use those skills.

512kts,2,2016-09-04,Should I quit? Boss/manager bullying. + LONG rant,skittles_23,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/512kts/should_i_quit_bossmanager_bullying_long_rant/,"Hi reddit, I need some opinions here... super long rant incoming. Please and thank you for giving me your time to read through all of this... The last two paragraphs are a TL;DR.


I work at a fast food minimum wage job. I get worked like a dog and very rarely am appreciated for what I do for my co-workers and workplace in general. This is my personal opinion but I work harder and put more effort into the job than 80% of the employees there, even though it is minimum wage and have little growth opportunities. In fact, I work so hard that I usually make THEIR position at least 2x easier; it's as if I'm taking on half their role on top of my own). As for the other 20%, I work as hard as 15% and maybe 5% of the employees put more effort than I do. Naturally I am a hard worker and I often have to catch myself when helping someone asking myself.. would this person help me as much as I help them...? and the answer is often no except for like 5 employees out of approx. 50. Depending on shifts I don't see these hard working allies very often or at least not for long. I'd also like to mention that all my supervisors and both managers KNOW I work hard. I had different supervisors praise me for making their job easier and less stressful because they know they don't have to worry about me and know I will do my job.

Where I work is very fast paced obviously and I can understand the negative environment/mood that arises when things are not getting done at an adequate ""quick"" speed for positions in drive thru for example; you want things fast but only fast enough to be HUMANLY POSSIBLE. Apparently my managers (2)/owner(1) of the shop don't understand this concept because they're so stuck up on a numbers game of ""how fast can you serve the customer""/""this is the 'IDEAL' time needed to serve a customer"". I get it, ""ideals"" are everywhere but the question is: are they humanly possible depending on 1. how much items the customer orders, and 2. how many people are working to fill the order. 

If the order is big and there are not enough people filling the order then be considerate to the workers that are trying their best to fill it as quickly as possible. Of course it will take longer if only 2 people are filling it when to match the ""ideal time"" you would need at least 5 people working simultaneously to fill it. How can you expect those 2 workers to work at the pace of as if they were 5 people? How about you consider the time it takes to actually MAKE the drink or food they ordered? Here's a example with numbers in it. If the ideal time to serve a customer is 25 seconds INCLUDING greet, cash handling and give items you're already looking at about 5-20 seconds OR MORE gone depending on variables like:

1. Are they using cash/debit/visa? - sometimes they don't punch in their code right and need to reset it, sometimes their card doesn't even work in the first place (constantly declined); sometimes they go through different cards trying to get one to work

2. How many items do they have? - Obviously if they ordered one drink it will take 1-2 seconds to hand it out whereas if they ordered like 3 breakfasts, 5 drinks, and some cookies, it will take a few seconds longer to hand out if all the items are ready. Sometimes the customer isn't even ready to receive their items even if you're holding it out for them. ie. I've seen people sit there and count change at the pace of a 3 year old, dig into their purse to find their coin pouch, old/fat people struggling to reach for the items with the hand farthest from the person at the window making both our lives harder (???? why do people do this, I don't even...), ETC.

3. Did they get everything they ordered? - Sometimes they sit there assuming or arguing the person at the window didn't give everything they ordered when they have everything in their car and we can see it.. come on. Sometimes, people order extra things at the window which take time to fill. If they order at window the item doesn't magically and instantly appear in-front of them. Sometimes, the order taker didn't catch everything they ordered and it becomes a mess depending the mood of the customer (angry rude ones vs calm and collected ones). 

4. Are people using the machines that I need to complete my task? - If someone else is using the ""slushie machine"", I have to wait until they're done making their drink before I can use it.

5. Did I run out of supplies? - things like lids, cups, sugar, ice coffee, etc. This is generally the people in the store fronts job to stock and have constantly supplied but it's either they're lazy or busy at the time you run out of them. If I run out, I have to go to the back and grab more supplies and what does that take? Oh right.. TIME.  I can't teleport items to me and neither can you.

There are so many more variables that could interrupt the smooth flow of filling the order and clearly you can see that it's not always humanly possible to complete big orders within the ""ideal time"".  I got two hands and two legs. Give me a fucking break. That is the logic of the workplace and why it's not always possible. Anyone who has worked in fast food must know how this feels right? Unless your managers were super kind.

Now that that's out of the way, lets talk about the managers (2) and owner (1) of the shop bullying me. Based on the logic of the workplace explained above, you'd think your managers would be a little considerate based on the situation you are in (mainly how many people are helping you and how many tasks you need to complete on your own). You'd THINK they'd say to themselves ""oh yeah that's a lot to complete on their own, it will take a couple of extra seconds""... NOPE. One task, get it done in 5 seconds; 3 tasks, get it done in 5 seconds; 5 tasks get it done in like.. 6 seconds tops! Two hands, two feet. IT'S NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE. If things aren't done within the ""ideal"" (which aren't humanly possible need I say again), I get petty remarks like ""what are you doing"", ""It doesn't take that long"", ""why are you standing there"" Blah blah blah. In fact, I wasn't ""standing there"" I was brewing tea, coffee, restocking lids/cups, making hot drinks, etc. Just because you don't see me running around with my back faced to you doesn't mean I'm not doing something. BTW, if I AM standing there doing nothing it because I can't hear the customer through the shitty headsets we have that are broken and missing parts that are probably older than I am (the owner of the shop is super cheap and would refuse to by a new broom for sweeping that you can get for like a dollar at the dollar store until its completely broken - he'd even use tape when its broken so maybe it has to be broken twice/three times before he gives up a dollar for a new one). 

Today, the manager that was in actually had the audacity to make some really petty remarks at me like ""when are you doing to do your job properly"", not once, but TWICE. Both times were not my fault, and my co-workers that were responsible for the mistake even admitted to it, yet I was to blame, again. I always take the blame for things either not in my control or get blamed for my co-workers mistakes. I often explain why it's not my fault (not to place the blame on someone else but to explain why they should calm their tits) but the managers aren't having it. Once they pick someone to blame, it your fault no matter what. No logic involved. I looking at you so you did it. You were at the crime scene which you murdered everyone even though there's someone with  bloody knife standing next to you. NOPE, FOR SURE.. YOU DID IT. I don't understand. Loading Logic.exe .... Error Not Found. The managers aren't always rude and annoying but they are, more often than not. It's one thing to play your role as manager but we're all human and they should know better than anyone else.

The owner has the same logic and if anything he is the one who blames me the most. He nitpicks at EVERYTHING I do. He literally follows me or checks up on my tasks and waits for something he can find to blame me for. I even get blamed for things that aren't even a fucking problem. I get told ""this is how you should do it"" when he makes the task even more time consuming and inefficient when I am in the process of completing the task efficiently. The very first time he triggered me was when he told me ""don't do this"" and then the very next day I saw him do the thing he told ME not to do. WTF. It just went to hell from there. It's like he always finds something to say to me, but it's always negative. It's gotten so routine for him to find something to say that nowadays when I see him standing and watching me I literally just stop and give him the ""what now"" look so he can say what he's dying to say and then gtfo. He also talks to you in a very condescending tone and only likes you if you treat him like a king and always make him feel like he is right. He doesn't like you if you don't give him that treatment, which is probably why he doesn't like me.

Maybe the managers and owner should... you know, actually go nitpick at people that aren't even doing their job and wasting time rather than bothering and blaming someone that IS doing their job. I feel so under appreciated and bullied. They don't do this to many other people and if they do its only once or twice. I think they find it easy to pick on me because I usually hold my tongue and in the beginning when I was new I rarely argued back and just took the blame simply because I didn't want to play the blame game like they always do. Nowadays I do find the courage to defend myself but again it rarely helps because there's no logic here. 

This has been an ongoing problem. I've wanted to quit a long time ago (I've been working there for about a year), but family prevented me from doing so until I had another job lined up. So you ask, then why aren't you looking for other jobs? I have been, but it's not easy. I don't want to go for another fast food place obviously, and general labour is easy to get into but I'm not that strong. Basically I don't want to feel depressed again at a new workplace with similar aspects.  

I've told you my problems and now it's time I told you a little about me. I'm in the early 20's and I have actually finished a 4 year college degree last year in an industry that isn't super well paying but ""ok"" and something along the lines of what I liked doing as a hobby/wanted to learn more about. I couldn't (and can't) find a job in my field because everything that interested me relating to my field always called for someone with 2-5 years exp. As a fresh graduate I didn't have that exp. I have a couple months exp from an internship. The same problem still applies to me to this day. Not only that but I can't say I'm extremely happy about my degree. It's what I thought I wanted to do and maybe the fact that I can't find a job in the industry just makes me hate it even more. I am very demotivated. The interviews I've gotten relating to my industry, they always found someone better and with more exp and I am in an endless loop of disappointment and discouragement. I have been a very pessimistic person since I was around 14 y/o and have become depressed more and more as years rolled by. At first I thought it was just a teenage phase but I soon found out this is no ""teenage blues"". I have periods of time where I get major depression and think about suicide very often. I am very scared of death so I never thought I'd actually commit suicide. This year is actually the first year I actually looked up ways to commit suicide in the most painless/quick way because I really wanted to just end it. 

(BTW, in case you think this may be valuable information, I don't have many problems with my family. We are middle class, maybe a tad bit below it but we get by. They love me, and I love them, however they are not always supportive of my emotional status. I think depression is not ""real"" to them, and I know some people must wonder if you are privileged to have a roof over your head, food to eat and a family that loves you, HOW could you be depressed? To that I say that you have to keep in mind that not everyone is the same in the head. I am super a sensitive deep down even though I try to show that I'm not. Again, I am pessimistic and have been for a very long time. I am an introvert who is often shy and awkward and it's hard for me to open up to people. I have no one to talk to about my emotional status except one or two people.)

I usually try to stuff my depression at the back of my mind and drown it out with things like games but as I got older and reality came closer and closer, the depression as been slipping out and making its way out to punch me in the gut. The workplace situation made the depression a lot worse than it was and brought it out more often than not. I had a period of time (around Dec to March) where I would go home after work and lock myself in the bathroom and just cry once I got home. Sometimes I couldn't hold my tears and actually cried in the car ride from work. I am someone who is very troubled by being yelled at or blamed for things that aren't even my fault, but now I've somewhat become hardened at the bullshit that happens at where I work right now. Even giving some words of encouragement to trainees after they've been blamed or yelled at. This doesn't mean I'm not sad and mad at myself for still being there. Fuck, even now when I think about it I want to cry. It was something to do while I tried looking for another job so i wasn't just sitting at home all the time.

You must be wondering why I'm still working a minimum wage job when I have a degree. ""Are you not trying hard enough?"" Probably. Like I said, I've been rejected so many times it's very demotivating. Am I weak-willed? Maybe. I haven't completely given up but I'm at some breaking points here. Even finding other jobs that aren't relating to my degree are hard because they're always turned off at the idea that I can't start right away (having to give a two weeks notice and all). What kind of bullshit is that?

All in all... I am sad at my position in life right now and rather than depressed at this time, I feel more angry at all the bullshit and bullying I get at work that has been ongoing since the very beginning. It has impacted my mood a lot. I dread going to work and they don't respect my availability. It is super draining to be there physically, mentally and emotionally. I have periods of time that last over a couple of months were either I can't fall asleep and if I do it's as you would image.. hard to get up after getting 30 mins-1 hour of sleep. If I have the day off I would sleep for like 12 hours and wake up wanting to go back to sleep or just not getting out of bed in general just because I don't want to do anything as I wake up apathetic. I eat in smaller portions than I used to, I lost my appetite in general but only eat because my body says I need to. I lost joy in what I liked to do on my days off and kind of just waste it by watching videos on youtube in my room. 

So my question is... as the title asks. Should I quit? I don't have another job lined up but I have enough money saved up to pay my bills and stuff for a little over a year assuming I don't buy much (which I rarely do). I won't get kicked out of my home, probably just looked down upon for being jobless. I am going to try something new that is something I want to do; it may or may not earn me money (will take a couple months to see results), while also looking for new job opportunities so it's not like I'm going to be doing absolutely nothing. I don't want to think I'm worthless and this is all I can do in life. I feel like I can do better if I just have time to recover my mental state. I feel like I don't deserve to be treated this way at work and they are taking advantage of me because of my natural kindness. 

If you made it this far and read through everything, thank you. I know it was a very long rant but this is a serious issue to me as you can see from how much I typed about this.. I need some opinions because the mistreatment is starting to hit me hard again. Please let me know what you think and any personal stories/words of encouragement. Sorry for typos/grammatical/punctuation errors. I hope you understand what I mean.

TL;DR
.
.

I'm being mistreated and bullied at work (fast-food woo ho...) and often blamed for things out of my control and for the faults of others. Even with explanation and proof, I get blamed. This is on a daily basis. I am naturally kind and hardworking and because of this I feel like they find it easier to bully me. Today one of the managers even asked me ""when are you going to do your job properly?"" TWICE. I work harder than 80% of my co-workers for a minimum wage dead-end job and rarely get appreciated. The managers and owner of the shop seem to have a special hate for me as it seems they pick on me out of everyone the most. Been at it for a year and a year too long. I suffer from depression that I usually keep at the back of my mind but sometimes it resurfaces; the fact that I get mistreated at work doesn't help. I actually have a degree (graduated last year) but its hard for me to find a job because of the exp they want in applicants are 2-5 years exp. I don't have that and wonder how I can get that if no one is willing to hire someone at entry level positions. -_-

I'm a very demotivated person and sometimes enough is enough. My family doesn't support me quitting because I don't have another job lined up and they don't believe depression is ""real"". Should I quit? I dread going to work and it is super draining to be there physically, mentally and emotionally. Working here has taken a toll on my mental health that is creeping up to my physical health slowly but surely. I won't get kicked out of my home, just looked down upon for being jobless. I don't want to think I'm worthless and this is all I can do in life and I have enough money saved up to pay my bills and stuff for a little over a year. I am going to try something new that is something I want to do; it may or may not earn me money (will take a couple months to see results), while also looking for new job opportunities so it's not like I'm going to be doing absolutely nothing.

So far I do not have much success in getting an interview and I feel like visa sponsorship is the biggest obstacle for my applications.

I plan to work in the US after graduation but it seems that my choices are limited to big companies due to the visa sponsorship problem.

One option I have considered is to apply for multinational companies in other countries first and apply for relocation to the US one year later. However, I am not sure what countries have a higher chance of success for the software engineering industry.

If you happen to know what countries are good for the relocation option mentioned above or you know other ways to increase our chances of getting a H1-B visa sponsorship for non-US citizens, please let me know.

I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am.  
  
I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them?

I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence)  and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something.   
  
As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face.  I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. 

For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her.   
  
I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship.  
  
Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end.    
  

  Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing.  
  
It is as if the world is intentionally turning its back on me.

Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me.  
  
  
I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people. I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything. When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year. I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead?  
  
I can't find any strength in myself. I don't know what to do.

51775b,2,2016-09-04,Getting a masters in software engineering or computer science to switch career directions... Major advice needed ASAP please!,ajp91,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/51775b/getting_a_masters_in_software_engineering_or/,"I have an undergrad in ""biomedical engineering"" and am looking to switch directions with a masters program. My undergrad was very broad (I feel like I'm half a biologist half an engineer). I first went the bio research direction, and started a PhD in biochemistry because I like it in theory, however one semester in I realized the chem/bio lab-work was not my forte. 

Since then I have been trying to figure out what I should do next, and can't find a field I am very passionate about. Some career directions I have considered that seem ok have been marketing, economics, compsci/software and manufacturing engineering. By process of elimination I ended up on programming, because I was pretty good at it in the few courses I took in my undergrad and it seems to be a safe choice job-wise. I still feel apprehensive about it though... 

So now comes the decision of whether to go with a compsci or a software engineering program for masters. I think software engineering would provide the benefit of being more versatile (allowing to possibly switch fields and take other engineering courses throughout the masters) whereas in compsci I would most likely end up strictly coding. However, the compsci program has the benefit of an internship option that would be very helpful.

If anyone has any other factors I should consider in this decision or some advice on the issue it would be much appreciated!

Also, courses start this week and am currently enrolled in both sets of courses, so I need to choose ASAP! Thanks!!"

This situation made it easier for me to get a job, because the interviewer would understand what I'm saying.

Now, 10 years later, I experience the opposite. The last dozen or so interviews I've done have been condusted by what seem like people who are interns. I know there are people out there who are more knowledgable than me; I can go on youtube and watch a conference presentation and I can get a strong feeling that the person talking is much more experienced than me, they just aren't interviewing me for any jobs.

I feel like the biggest reason why I'm having so much problems finding a job is because less experienced developrs have a hard time understanding what I say when I answer questions. An experienced develoepr knows what I'm talking about, and a conversation can commence. If the person interviewing me has only 1 or 2 years of experience, they only know what they've read in blogs and college text books, and when I say something that they have never read about, they automatcally think I must be full of shit. I'm at a point in my career where all of my beliefs are based on my experience, everything taught in schools and written in blogs I've left behind.

However, on my first day of work, I was approached by my boss, telling me that he might not be allowed legally to hire a 15 year old, but since I am 3 months away from turning 16, he kindly offered to pay me off the books until I turn 16. I told him I'd look into the legality of hiring me, and I'd get back to him, and I did a bit of research. Technically, since an arcade is either considered ""retail"", or a ""recreational establishment"", I am not allowed to be employed until I am 16.

Now, Im a pretty legal-savvy person, so I started trying to look for some sort of loophole, to where I could work, but legally, and I think I found something interesting, but I wanted to run it by you guys.

So, from my research, I found that ""interning"" is a very gray area in terms of legality. If I work it out so that its a ""paid internship"", for my work experience benefit, not an employment, is it still subject to those types of labor laws.

I know asking you guys for loopholes is not the most ethical thing to do, but I mean its an arcade... not like a meat slaughterhouse, and I'll be legally allowed to work there in a few months anyways.

State is Connecticut, and if you have any other suggestions, please let me know.. Thanks."

However, after many years of of comprehensive although not-really-resume-material programming experience, I find that I really don't like doing projects, when I could instead be reading to *understand* everything a bit better. 

I really enjoy the productivity I have when the system is in my conceptual grasp. You could spend three days - or worse, three weeks - on a tricky bug arising from some subsystem you're using, or three hours learning about how that system worked in the first place. After my courses in algorithms, code planning &amp; testing, etc. my productivity and enjoyment has increased ten-fold. And I anticipate this to improve further as I learn more about OS, networking, compilers, databases, etc., where I'm currently reading.

The problem is it has no credibility to say ""understands X, Y and Z"" on a resume. Working on projects for me feels like a huge drag. I feel as if it is the most labor-intensive and indirect way to justify my knowledge when I could be doing something fresh, and in a more condensed manner. Is this common?

I've been assigned a daunting (at least to me) task.

The company develops applications that have a very computation heavy side to them. Some of these computations can take days. They have asked me to look into cloud computing to reduce these computation times. Specifically they mentioned Amazon's EC2, Google cloud platform, and Azure and also asked me to consider an in house solution.

I'm completely flustered. All my prior experience has been in web development (I've never deployed or set up any applications, just worked on existing ones). So my knowledge is strictly in programming/app development. When I researched into building my own cloud infrastructure it seemed way out of my league! When I looked at the services EC2/GCP/Azure it seemed a little bit friendlier. What I'm having trouble getting my head around are these questions, any resources or docs are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance =). 

- How do I get machines in the cloud to start doing work (for example, I've seen the console interface for EC2, where i can log in with an account and 'start' an instance, but how do i work with that instance and get it to execute scripts/ run programs etc.. Furthermore, how can I do that programatically (instead of using a console).)

- How will the computation engine run on multiple machines. Is this just a matter of dividing input data and running the same program on multiple machines at the same time ? Is it dependent on the nature of the code ?

P.S Don't hesitate to tell me to read a 500 page book, I feel like this can be a great learning opportunity and I want to seize it."

I have a question regarding patchmanagement/detection. I work as an intern for an ISP and they are looking to implement patch management. Specifically the detection of older patches, so it's intertwined with vulnerability management. We do not want automatic patching and an allround monitoring system is already in place. I have been looking at tools like Nessus, GFI languard, Nexpose and a solarwinds solution. These tools work fine with windows, linux and some cisco appliances.  The tricky part is that it also needs to scan more specific appliances like infoblox systems. Does anyone know if this is possible, or will we have to start coding outselves to recieve info from these systems? The goal of the solution is to produce reports so management knows what systems might be a liability. This might be hard if we start coding ourselves.

Background: I have a BSc in International Business Administration  and an MSc in Business Information Systems. During the last months of the MSc I interned at an early stage startup. I have zero background in CS, but I have taught myself R, Python, HTML and CSS over the past year.

The position was initially meant to be purely data analytics. At some point I took initiative and started working on some simple additional features for their webapp as well. Most of these made it into production.

At the end of the internship I was given a job offer for a combined backend development/data analytics position, which I happily accepted. I suffer from a major case of imposter syndrome, but I figured my coworkers are better judges of my ability than me.

However, I am slightly worried about what comes next. Will other employers be willing to overlook my lack of CS background and give me a shot based on a single internship/job? Will this result in lower compensation? Any input is welcome."

Anyway, this is a story from my time working in a small business, doing all kinds of computer related work, but for the purpose of the story, you only need to know that we had a small computer help center. You could either call us when you had a problem, or simply walk into the front door, explain your problem, fill out a form, and let us take care of it.  
After working there for a bit, I was put in charge of two interns around my age. Now, most of the work we did in the help center was really simple, and the interns would always get the simplest stuff we had. Building a PC from parts we would give them/installing OS/missing drivers/removing viruses etc.

Basically anything an intern worked on was something a semi-techsavvy end user would be able to do themselves. I assumed that anyone applying for an internship in a computer help center would be able to do it without any help. Apparently I was wrong.

Just keep in mind that the conversation is translated to English from my native language, hence them having problems with English words. Words that were spoken in English are put in the """" quotes.  
&gt;Me: Ok, so what I need you to do is install all drivers that are needed, and check for updates of the ones that are already installed.

Immediately they tense up.
&gt;Intern1: Uh, drivers?  

&gt;Me: Yup, I know it sounds too easy, but don't worry there is no unusual or outdated hardware or software in there to trip you up, no suprising catch. In fact I am pretty sure the network drivers are already on this flash drive, so you can just install them and then download the rest without needing to use any other computer.

I put the flash drive in, and they hesitantly navigate to the Install directory on the flash drive, it has 3 files.

&gt;Intern1: Is this the thing we have to install?

&gt;Me: No, that is the Java installer.

&gt;Intern1: Oh, obviously it is this one!

&gt;Me(now a bit suprised):No, that is the .net installer, it's the one in the middle. It literally has ""Network"" in the name, do you not know what that means?

&gt;Intern1: No, we don't know alot of English.

Now I am absolutely sure these two are going to be hard to deal with, while there is a handful of sites that offer drivers, applications and tutorials in my language, most things simply cannot be found there, and you need to know atleast a bit of English to do anything but the most basic stuff.

&gt;Me: Oh, well install it, so we can move on.

A bit of fumbling through the English installer and a restart later.

&gt;Me: Ok, so you do know how to find out what drivers you need to install, right?

*silence*

&gt;Me: *sigh* Ok, go to the Device Manager.

Nothing. Even though Windows 7 is fully translated, and I used the translated term. They are looking at me like I came from Mars.

&gt;Me: Wait, neither of you know where the Device Manager is? Intern2, you were quiet the whole time, where would you look?

&gt;Intern2: I don't know, I'm not really a computer person.

After this I had to go outside for a bit of fresh air. The mind workings of a person that applies for an internship at a job that deals just with computers, without being a ""computer person"" are still completely foreign to me."

I had an in-person interview for an engineering internship position. It was a small company in Portugal, the interviewer was in his 60s. Things started going downwhill when he looked at my CV and noticed I had studied abroad in Brazil for a year. He asked me why I didn't want to stay there, I answered and one of the things I mentioned was that the market in our field had plummeted anyway due to the crisis and the business opportunities had dried up. 

The interviewer told me I didn't have any loyalty, he had 3 kids in my age range and knows how we operate. Young people nowadays just want easy things without putting any work and run away when things get difficult. Mind you, the position I was interviewing for had availability to move abroad to work in international projects as one of the pre-requisites, so I was expected to work outside of my country anyway. 

He went on a rant about how young people ruined our country with their laziness, they are unworthy employees and that's why we are going through a economic crisis. He said we needed more tough people like the Portuguese who were kicked out of our ex-colonies and came back ready to do real work in the 70s; not like this generation who only wants to sit behind a computer and do easy work (The position he was interviewing needed 3D modeling on a computer, of course).

Then, he complained that people should sacrifice for their country and stay during times of crisis. Things got more crazy and he said he despised refugees, they are cowards and, if he was Syrian, he would grab a gun a fight for his country like a man should do. He asked me what were my views on the refugee crisis, but cut me off before I could answer and said he bet I wanted them all to come to Europe, since we young people are so idealistic, don't understand anything about how the real world works and his kids were pro-refugees.

I feel like this was all a prank."

I had originally figured that my GPA and class experience would help me out, particularly given that internships are intended to be entry-level work, but unless there was something else I did wrong last semester, I feel that I need to put together a set of code samples to be more competitive.

Anyway, my question now is, what is worth putting in a set of code samples for a portfolio? Most of my completed code consists of very simple programs for homework assignments, usually performing a small set of simple actions and outputting to the console. Are these kinds of programs worth listing as code samples, or should I aim for displaying more robust work?

Second part of this is the group final project for one of my CS classes last semester. I know these types of projects are definitely worth listing as code samples, but the one I participated in was... kind of a disaster. Due to a combination of inexperience, time pressure, and a group member being exceptionally difficult to work with, the program ended up being a disjointed, barely functional mess, with key features heavily jury-rigged or even dummied out, a messy, disorganized code base, and an even messier GitHub. Does the poor quality of the code overshadow the fact that we made it in the first place, or is it worth displaying with perhaps some sort of disclaimer admitting the poor quality and calling it a learning experience?

However I can't just work without being compensated for my time especially considering I'm a full time student. I've tried emailing my bosses, I've emailed their bosses, and no one is giving me any information about when I will be paid. Nothing. I was told that it's definitely a paid position. Should I just tell them I will stop working until they pay me or just suck it up and keep working for the experience? I'm afraid it may sour relationships with my bosses if I stop working but this is bordering on illegal."
51bnx6,0,2016-09-05,Need your review on the interview I gave today!,ragingWater_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51bnx6/need_your_review_on_the_interview_i_gave_today/,"Hi guys, So I had my telephonic interview a few days ago, and wanted a general view from you guys on how it went. The interview was supposed to be 45 minutes but ended up at the 40 minute mark. At the start of it I was asked to introduce myself, I had something in my mind which was around 5 lines (This was a technical interview for a Software Intern) after which the technical questions were asked. The first question was an implementation based question which I had already seen but this time the question had a twist (we had a shared code-editor) . So I explained my approach and was able to code it in around 5 minutes (this includes the time required to explain the approach as well as code it). He made me dry run the code on a sample input and the code didnt have any problems and the interviewer said ""It looks good"" and asked me the next question. The next question was to find the sum of three numbers in an array whose sum is 0. I had previously seen the same question, but rather than acknowledging it, I tried my best to explain the approach, starting from how to solve it for 2 numbers and then proceeded to tell him if I can fix one number in the 3 number tuple , how can we search for the remaining 2 numbers in the array, by first sorting the array and using 2 pointers. I asked him if the approach was good enough or if it needed some refinements. He asked me to go ahead and code it. I did the same but this time he did not ask me to dry run the code and said ""it looks good"". We were at the 25 minute mark now and had around 20 more minutes to spend. So he asked me regarding my previous internships and some more personality questions.We had a fun discussion about my previous internship. By now we were at the 35 minute mark. He enquired if I had any questions for him, I did and asked him ""about the challenges which he faced with his work"" and ""what do you look for in candidates"" . We were at the 40 minute mark when the interviewer himself said ""I will be ending the interview a bit early, and your recruiter should get back to you in a week"". So honest opinion, how do you think I fared? And are there any negative markers ?"

The job is absolutely fulfilling. I love my coworkers, boss. The company culture is excellent. The product we are developing is very unique. We are always told by the bosses that the product idea is excellent; that time and time again, we have validation by the targeted market. I have learned so much working here its like I transformed into the tech expert I never thought I could be. From learning. The lack of resources forced me to learn development in multiple languages, multiple operating systems, low level programming, high level programming. I'm developing as a really effective communicator. I became so much better as a professional its just unbelievable. I'm eternally grateful to my boss for taking a chance on me.


But the lifestyle I live is unfulfilling. I moved in with my parents because the job is in the same city. A city that I really dislike because of how small and boring it is. 


My friends are all living in bigger cities doing NEW things. Sure I'm getting paid well. Sure the company might explode with success in the future. But today, I feel unsatisfied. I feel hungry. 


Some of you will say that my idea of living in a new city is overrated and that I should find things in my city. Already tried that. Got into new hobbies. I go out as often as possible. But its still not fulfilling me. I think I need a change of scenery to really drive myself.


I'm really confliced here guys. I save so much staying with my parents. I might regret leaving this startup. Is there a way to evaluate how successful we could be? Is there a rational and logical way to evaluate my situation and then come to the decision of staying or leaving?"

As the title states, I am currently a senior in the Mechanical Engineering program at my university, graduating next May. I was wondering how others in this sub/the engineering industry have found the most success when it comes to applying to internships or full-time careers; in the past, I have relied heavily on engineering conferences. This year, however, I will have to make a decision on a job offer (returning to my internship) before most of these conferences occur, giving me less time to search for other potential jobs, as well as fewer outlets by which to do so.

Those who have been through the application processes or currently are dealing with them, what's your best advice on getting a hold of good career opportunities and getting your foot in the door? 

I'm currently doing what I can with contacts from previous years, as well as family connections (my dad has gotten me in contact with someone from Boeing who says they are looking around for me, but who knows what will happen with that). I also do online applications every year but often find that these never turn into anything even as much as an email.

So, what's best? Online applications? Cold-calling companies you're interested in? Finding contacts? Or are there other methods as well? I want to try and take advantage of as many opportunities as possible.

I specifically am targeting the aerospace industry, but I would like to know other's advice on this topic in general, and hopefully it will also be of help to others in this sub in the same situation.

Thank you for your input!  "

Or should I hold off at a better time?,cbo92,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51dhmv/is_a_dc_internship_a_once_in_a_lifetime/,"I was recently fortunate enough to be offered an internship in for a congressman in my home state. At first, I was ecstatic that I was offered a position on Capitol Hill, especially from a congressman in my own state. The more I think about it, however, a few concerns are raised. Namely:

1. I need to pay down my debt. I have been barley getting by for close to six months and have ran up credit card debt in addition to student loans I already had. I recently moved out of an apartment and back to my parents to try and pay down debt/save some money in the next six-12 months while I look into pursuing a masters degree at local schools. This internship, which is unpaid for three months, would require me to take out a loan with my family and pay them back, which I don't want to do for comfort reasons. 

2. The congressman I would be working for is very conservative, and while I don't consider myself at all a dire hard liberal, but I don't agree with many of his policies which tend to be Republican standard. All that being said, he seems like a genuine man and I wouldn't mind working for him but I have seen other posts suggesting you work for the party you would want to be in business with long term only.

3. As mentioned before, I was planning on pursuing a Comp Sci Masters to complement my Finance bachelors degree. My real interest is in public policy research and I think I can leverage those two degrees into something in that area, particularly data analysis. However, the interviewer told me I would also have an opportunity to research legislation while there, and that they would try to hook me up with whatever kind of position I wanted post-internship.

*TL/DR* Is it worth me putting my plans on hold and straining myself financially for a three month DC internship? Is this really a once in a lifetime opportunity, or can I get myself in a better situation financially while building up some practical skills (i.e. formal training in programming) and expect to land a similar roll later on?"

It's a long post, but I'd really appreciate some ideas.

Basically, I'm a gappie at an Australian boarding school - what this means is, I'm an on-campus staff member, taking a gap year before uni - basically, I'm a glorified intern. However, it is paid - we get a monthly salary that's nowhere near minimum wage, and the rest of our payment is through a house that we're given for the year, plus services like water, electricity, and internet.

Originally, we were on the school's staff wifi at home, because the former gappies had broken the hardware or something (no one would give us a straight answer as to what exactly was wrong) but after a month or so we got a new network that was faster, but still had the same restrictions as the staff internet for the school, which includes, among other things, gaming services like Steam or Battle.net.

Since we're a residence, and part of our payment is in internet access, it's a bit annoying that we're not provided all services, but when I've talked to them, I've gotten two separate excuses: 1) the network can't handle the load of gaming, and 2) the profiles haven't been set up to allow for gaming. The idea that it would take up too much bandwidth is ridiculous because this is a school that holds about 500 people during the day while we work, and drops to about 60 altogether in the evenings, all of whom except for the two of us are banned from anything high-intensity, and because we've been able to download big files (like 25 GB) and stream HD shows and movies at high speeds on multiple devices at the same time. The issue with profiles is, I believe, that our IT department is incredibly lazy - every time I go in there to ask about it, they're messing around on Reddit or something, then say they're too busy to fix it.

So, what I've asked them for is to have our gaming unblocked on our private network after 8 o'clock, since that's when the students all have to hand in their devices and go offline anyways, so we wouldn't be taking bandwidth from people who need it, and possibly over the weekends or school breaks. I know it's a long story to get up to this point, but my question is basically is it possible for an IT department to do something like this - as in set up the network to unblock certain services within a certain time frame?

I've been assigned a daunting (at least to me) task.

The company develops applications that have a very computation heavy side to them. Some of these computations can take days. They have asked me to look into cloud computing to reduce these computation times. Specifically they mentioned Amazon's EC2, Google cloud platform, and Azure and also asked me to consider an in house solution.

I'm completely flustered. All my prior experience has been in web development (I've never deployed or set up any applications, just worked on existing ones). So my knowledge is strictly in programming/app development. When I researched into building my own cloud infrastructure it seemed way out of my league! When I looked at the services EC2/GCP/Azure it seemed a little bit friendlier. What I'm having trouble getting my head around are these questions, any resources or docs are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance =).

- How do I get machines in the cloud to start doing work (for example, I've seen the console interface for EC2, where i can log in with an account and 'start' an instance, but how do i work with that instance and get it to execute scripts/ run programs etc.. Furthermore, how can I do that programatically (instead of using a console).)

- How will the computation engine run on multiple machines. Is this just a matter of dividing input data and running the same program on multiple machines at the same time ? Is it dependent on the nature of the code ?

P.S Don't hesitate to tell me to read a 500 page book, I feel like this can be a great learning opportunity and I want to seize it."

So, onto some history about me... I had rigorous studies back at high school. Got into the top 10 colleges  in my country. Just completed my Bachelors of technology in Electronic and communication Engineering. Have a job in IT starting this December.

I started to hate my major since my 3rd year. My grades fluctuated a lot, I had been the topper in one subject and just passed in another. Professors kept asking me why I'm wasting my potential. They said I was very smart and intelligent and was wasting away my life by not getting good grades(in subjects I just passed) and not doing undergrad research work in subjects I liked and topped in.

My parents were dissapointed.... finally did some research work in my final year, as my friend has insisted on having me as a projectmate. I didn't like the field(nanoelectronics), but nevertheless took it so that I could publish a paper and that would give me an upper hand in getting into a master of science program in the US.
Paper publishing got delayed and I had applied to universities abroad because I had to tell something to my parents and the relatives-lurking spectators of my life.

Got rejected by all the universities. Have a job in IT...a field I don't give a fuck about. My job starts this december.
 My parents know I'm utterly confused. They know I don't want the job. They want me to be happy and stable in life.

So they(my parents) suggested I should prepare for CAT- a  competitive exam to get into the prestigious Indian Institute of Management- since I'm capable of getting in.
I said no, since in my opinion there's no point in getting an MBA  when I don't know the kind of jobs my subordinates are doing and plus i don't want to start my own business. I observed that people get an MBA to start a business or lead an existing one.

Then my parents suggested I get into the Administrative services since I will be a great fit for that too. I know the kind of luxuries and ammenities and 'prestige' one gets in that career as a close friend of my familys' is in the services. But I don't want that due to reasons such as corruption or getting caught in the corruption scandal of your higher-up, being limited in your efficacy at the job due to powerful higher-ups-most of them corrupt. Plus I had no purpose for choosing that career.

So my parents gave me the supposed ""freedom"" to choose my career. 
I was not sure where to start , I was not passionate about anything. I was and still am the sought of person who never knew what I wanted for the next 40yrs of my life.
The thing that scares me most is when my parents say I have to stick to one job for life if I want stability or success. And I have soo many interests ... I'm like a jack of all trades and master of none.

Anyhow, I used to be good at drawing and painting and arts in general. I self-learnt illustrator and photoshop and people said they liked my work. So I interned as a graphic designer at old and big comapany. It had very commercial vibe, and even the designs I did were constrained, artisically. I completed my internship and decided this cannot be my job full time. I got some freelance work after that. So did the feeelancing at my home ,to my parents slight discomfort and weariness about whether I was thinking of freelancing full time. 

Then I was unsure where to head again. My parents were presenting me the same options as before MBA or civil services. I refused. 
 
However I hit a point where I had to reveal to my parents ,my longstanding interest to be an actor. Something that made my parents feel dreadful and pained ,like someone hit their heads with thors hammer...
So I was also unsure about acting. I have always liked those great actors and their skills and acting finesse, but I have dreadfully hated the other stuff that gets attached to the profession-loss of privacy, affairs, casting couch, directors producers or actors asking actresses for sexual favours in return for a role, burnout,etc. Beside its hard to get big in showbiz. Also its a very unprestigious profession , specially for women,as per my parents. I know its difficult ,moreso for a woman who's starting out. 

So I am doubtful again. But nevertheless my parents gave me the option of doing a diploma in method acting. I found a good institute and have payed for the 6 month course.

The classes start next week and I'm dreading the possibility of having taken a wrong decision and of wasting my parents' money! Plus , I feel acting might not mentally stimulate me like studying does.

My parents are tongue tied when relatives or friends ask them what have I chosen as my career. There's so much of societal pressure, I feel I am hurting my parents and at the same time hurting myself by admonishing myself for taking so much time to think about a career I want rather than a career the society/parents expects is fit for me.

I'm soo much in a bad place now ! I need some help on how I can reach a decision to pursue the career of a lifetime! What do I do now ?!"

51gsti,1,2016-09-06,Associates or Bachelors?,oldlimedemon,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/51gsti/associates_or_bachelors/,I'm currently enrolled in an associates degree program in computer information technology. I eventually want to become a systems administrator but I notice most job postings ask for a bachelors degree in a related area or equivalency with at least 2 years of experience in field or related area. My college has a program that partners with local businesses and has led me to an internship which will also lead to full time employment after my graduation to my understanding. So my question is would my associates degree and a few years of experience in the field be enough to stand on or should I just go for the bachelors? Thanks in advance!

I have basic knowledge of how programming works and plan on completing my degree at a slower pace because the current company I work for will pay for it. I will be doing 60 credit hours over these next 4 years (post baccalaureate program). 


I have a couple questions for everyone here. 


What advice could you give someone who is changing careers into software engineering? 


Any specific tools that I could use to help me learn the most? 


How can I set myself up to transition into a good job as a software engineer? (80k+ pay, good benefits, flexible work, potential to get promoted, good culture) 


I would like to do an internship at a large company post grad. (If not the one I'm at now) What can I do to network with people who can help me get a position like this?

There is also a Bachelors without the year placement but the placement seems an obvious choice. 

My real question is, does a Masters really 'overweigh' a Bachelors or would the year placement be a lot more valuable when trying for a post graduate job? 

P.S - I'm in the UK.

Edit:
What if I could do a master's and summer intern during the four years?

Edit 2:
After speaking around, another option that arose would be to complete a BSc, get a job and part time study for an MSci which might boost my future career prospects?"

I'm currently doing a Bachelors in Arts in Math/Econ with a minor in Statistics at a State University. 

I have no job experience what so ever in this field and I have not done any Internships. Academically I am not the best I only have a 3.118 Cumulative but a University GPA of 3.70 for the past year.

I'm concentrating most of my course work in quantitative classes doing upper level statistics courses (multivariate, regression analysis etc.)  that requires statistical programming and a couple of other Econ courses with the same emphasis such as Econometrics and Forecasting.

I will pretty much have the same skillset as a person with a Bachelors in Statistics in exception of doing complex proofs and numerical analysis. 

Ill be skilled STATA, R and SAS by the time I graduate.

I am planning to pursue a Graduate degree in Statistics afterward since i wont be so far off from obtaining one.


Preferably I would like to work in Finance.

51hoz4,3,2016-09-06,Pros and cons of going back on or staying off stimulants,jsista,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/51hoz4/pros_and_cons_of_going_back_on_or_staying_off/,"I am conflicted as to whether I should go back on meds. I started taking stimulants about 2.5 years ago and it felt amazing. For the first time in my life it was easy to concentrate, understand what I read, and be productive. I've been balancing a life as a PhD student, a consultant, a research assistant, a project manager, a mentor and an intern. Since I started taking stimulants, I never had a drug vacation until now. I just spent the last month unmedicated and I've learnt a hell of a lot about how the meds affect me and reminded me of who I was before meds. Now, I'm not sure I want to go back on them. 

The pros: mindfog is gone; I can focus everyday; I can understand everything I read (as opposed to the opposite); I can focus on conversations; I'm productive; I can focus on my clients and my surroundings easily; my anxiety is reduced; I sleep better; my tolerance to  frustration is increased 

The cons: I'm less excitable (and i was normally a very excitable person); my emotions are flattened, things that are amazing only feel great and things that are devastating are just bad; my sex drive disappears which is not great for my relationship (but my s/o is amazing and understands); I'm less creative;  I remember fewer events in my life; I'm exhausted after my meds wear off, I crash hard; and it's hard to feel motivated to do anything social. 

So I feel like I'm in a tough spot and with  this upcoming academic year being busier than ever (dissertation proposal, comprehensive exam, etc) I'm scared of not being productive. But at the same time, I missed feeling things so intensely as I used to and I miss having intimacy with my s/o.  I didn't really have a question, I just needed to unload a bit and with who better than people who might understand what I'm going through. Although, feel free to share similar experiences! It would be great to hear what others have done in similar circumstances. "

I graduated from UCI in June of last year (2015) with a degree in CS. After I graduated, I looked for an entry level position or programming/software development internship for 3-4 months, without success. After a while I started looking into alternatives (I couldn't afford to go on without a job) and I'm currently a substitute teacher for LA Unified. My current occupation pays the bills, but it's no where near where I want to be. My biggest regret is that I did not look for internship positions while in college. I have no professional experience, and I feel this is my biggest issue.

What are some steps I can take or things I could do to get back on track? I'm looking for any advice/mentorship that could potentially push me in the right direction.

Here are some things I'm considering:
-Pursue a Master's degree (My biggest concern with this is recommendations, after being away from school for so long, I don't know that there is anyone I can ask for a decent recommendation).
-Begin a side project (I have a few ideas for a mobile and/or web app, nothing ground breaking, but maybe it would help convince employers that I am passionate and capable.)
-Apply for internships (I'm more than willing to be a part of an internship that will help me demonstrate and refine my skills. However, most require that I currently pursue a BS/MS)

I would very much appreciate input from current industry leaders/players, or maybe even someone who was in a similar position. Thanks in advance."

I could just commute to NYC (an hour or two away) but I'd rather not live there or have to commute. I hope it's not the case that all of NY besides NYC is just a tech wasteland.

It might also be a factor that because there are no jobs or internships here, I've not been able to have any jobs or internships. One internship opportunity was actually open that supposedly was looking for CompSci majors a year or so ago (local power company), but I didn't get it. I've tried getting work experience online, but the only offer I ever got was someone asking me to work for free (potential equity or something else equally worthless) for their sketchy startup. All I have is [personal projects like these](http://chip8.progr.am/) and that I've been volunteering on two large scale Unity3D games for a few years. So, maybe it would need to be somewhere with more startups or otherwise positions that pay below market rate, at least at first.

After owning laptops for so many years, I'm finally deciding to start my desktop since I am about to graduate. After my internship I saved around 1,100 for this build. This build is suppose to last me a bit before I have to upgrade, but by then I'll have a bigger budget. I have windows 10 64 bit already and a monitor which is why I did not include it. For my case situation, still looking for a mid tower. I'm just looking for any criticism for my build or if there can be any improvements. I am not very knowledgeable in this field as many others, so I am afraid I am over looking something that really should be taken accounted for. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

(IL)",Taylornicole26,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/51jqwj/i_had_a_retail_theft_felony_expunged_at_17_but/,"New to this.. apologize for any errors, I'm on my phone. 

In a major rut. 23 year old female (from and living in Illinois)..Graduated with a bachelors in psych and criminal justice last year (may 2015).. still looking for employment in law enforcement. Although I have great references and internship experience.. no one can seem to see past when I was arrested in 2010 at the age of 17. I was arrested for felony retail theft (felony only bc of the amount). My record was expunged and my case was dismissed.. but public service jobs can all still see it. Now wondering why I wasted money on all court fees to get it expunged, when everyone in my field can see it. (Other fields cannot see my arrest record.. Only police related jobs can... Unfortunately for me)

Incase anyone is wondering, I have been applying everywhere and am currently a server. Have been turned down by 4 dispatch jobs, one corrections and two police. It's just heart breaking at this point. So now I have started to apply for jobs outside of my field, but the pay is horrid. I am at a loss as to what to do anymore. 

My current issue... Got offered a job as a dispatcher. Contingent on my background investigation pass or fail. I disclosed and am honest about everything.. but am truly worried they won't give me a shot. Hoping for the best. Just been waiting forever for an opportunity like this and I truly fear im going to be let down again. I've had this issue with multiple other jobs. I interview spectacularly.. then my past mistake comes back to haunt me. That and I have a long work history. Not sure if that's negative or what. I've never been fired from anywhere, I just worked lots of odd jobs in college.. and am a waitress now. 

( Oh also.. it goes as far as a JUDGE has given me his recommendation, and a jail in the county he works in wouldn't even hire me. ) -_-

Basically. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm still living with my parents, making shit money, and clearly can't get a job in my field. It just truly breaks my heart. I don't know if there is anything I can do legally or what. It just all seems so ridiculous to me. I am NOT the idiot I was at 17. Ugh.  I've also been applying to administrative jobs, but it's not enough money to live comfortably off of. I'm at a loss. I'm considering just going back to school for psychology. It's not what I truly want.. But I don't think that matters anymore. 

Also incase anyone is wondering the details on my arrest.. I was at Von maur in Illinois, my friend walked out with a shit load of clothes. I dumped anything I was going to steal before I walked out, mall cop caught us and although I didn't physically take anything with me.. Her AND I were still pinned with everything SHE took. That's the shittiest part about ALL of this. He completely coerced me Into writing a statement and signing documents. I had never been in trouble like this before.. So I was completely terrified. Also..I had intent to steal... but I didn't even steal! My lawyer found it best to get me in a pre trial diversion program. I completed it and my record was and is completely expunged and the case was dismissed. So, no one but public service jobs (for some reason) can see my old record. 

I have NO record. No tickets. Nothing. But when it comes to the jobs I want, I apparently have a felony even if it was expunged. I'm honestly beginning to think what the fuck was the point of even ""expunging"" it if it's practically still there.  I'm just at a loss. I don't know what to do anymore. And I truly hope this dispatch position is gonna give me a shot or be a bit more lenient in regards to my past. 

As far as my legal question, are state/government etc jobs the only ones who will be able to see my expunged record? Is there anything I can do to get rid of it completely (since it is hindering my ability to get a job) or is expungement the last step? I have been asked in sales and administrative job applications if I have ever been arrested, an am unsure if I actually need to answer that honestly or not? And WHY are these jobs so hesitant to give me a chance?"

I've started my third year of community college with my major being computer science. The reason I haven't transferred yet is because I lack the Math requirements in order to be accepted into the CS major. I am **not** looking to do EECS. I plan to apply to Berkeley and Davis this season.

I have completed my community colleges Computing Fundamental, Data structure and Assembly language courses(all with very high grades). These are the extent of the CS courses my school has to offer. By the end of Spring 2017, I will have finished IGETC and have completed up to Calculus 2. My GPA will be &gt;= 3.69. 

I have interned at a prominent National Laboratory. I was the youngest in terms of my academic studies and the only one not from a technical or 4-year university. For example, 80% of the interns in my program were finishing their masters degrees from Universities such as NYU, GATech, CMU, etc. I am also one of the few interns that was hired on part time during the school year. I also hold an active security clearance for the work I do at the National Laboratory.

This is a question I got from a company interested in me as an intern. I was trying to think of an answer for *skills*, and realised that I wished I had one core skill that was impressive and useful to companies. 

I code a lot, but being a young developer a lot of it is exploratory. I do some database stuff, some scripting, then NLP, then machine learning, then web, etc. etc. Most of it tests my learning and problem solving ability, but I don't have a 'thing'.

In the longer term I would like to have Machine Learning, Agent-Oriented Programming and NLP as core skills. Unfortunately these skills take a long time to develop to the point where I could be of value to a company as an intern. 

So in the interim, which specific skills are best for interns to say they have? Ideally they would be skills that weren't as difficult to become good at as the aforementioned three, and they would be skills that are worthwhile implementing in python. "

Is there a problem with using the http preview, where it resets? I tried using the VLC Extension in Chrome but we couldn't access the camera via rtsp and if we put the http URL into VLC it still resets. Does anyone have any ideas around this?"

I’ve never seen so much blood and human tissue in my life. It was one of those things that scar you for life. I was just standing there, paralyzed. It all happened so fast. I was still trying to put all the pieces together of the last weeks, when it all happened. I remember running out of the house letting out a blood-cursing scream.

-HELP!!! HELP!!! SOMEBODY HELP HER PLEASE!!!! - I was crying, screaming, and about to faint. I had blood splatters all over my face, my clothes.

Liam came to me and held me as I was about to fall on my knees.

-What happened? -he asked alarmed -Charlie what happened?!

-It’s so much worse than we expected, call 911 now, please -I pleaded And then I fainted.

That’s the way everything ended to me, back then at least. Now let’s go back a few weeks before that, and put everything in order as I remember it. I heard the scratching in the attic window around 1am this time. Cookie, our neighbor’s cat, had the habit of getting into our house at night. As it was a hot and wet summer, we kept the windows open to enjoy the night breeze.

I went upstairs to check on him. He greeted me with a quick meow and rubbed himself against my legs. He followed me to bed, and I heard him leave later that night. That was his usual routine, and I enjoyed his company. Cookie belonged to the Elsons, a single mom with three children who lived across the street. Two girls and one boy: 14 year old Sophie, my best friend, 17 year old Tina and 18 year old, Liam. With this three we grew up as if we were joined to the hip. Inseparables. Both me and my sister had a big crush on Liam, but we never said anything to each other about it.

Next to us to the right, we had Ms. Turner (I changed all the names, just in case) who was a classic grumpy old lady, living in an abandoned house, without kids, nephews, nieces, or cats (I don't think cats would ever stand a woman like that). Always staring at the window, always yelling the kids of the block, always angry, with a long face and always there, as she seemed inmortal. Next to us to the left we had the Eldwoods, a family of 5. They seemed pretty normal, pretty goody-two-shoes. They had two little girls and one boy. They had moved less than a year ago, so we weren’t really close.

The strange happenings started before I was able to notice it. I remember falling asleep on a Sunday night while listening to my walkman. The music was still on at first, so I couldn't hear anything. When the noises became louder I took my earphones off to pay attention. It was Cookie, as every single night, walking in the attic right on top of me. Oh Cookie. I could hear him scratching like crazy, and I thought that my mum was going to be mad if he messed up with the furniture. I turned around and went back to sleep.

During the next day, my mother and Mrs. Elson had been drinking coffee together and gossiping about the neighbors, that Mrs. Turner was losing her mind, that she was too old and alone, that the wacky old lady had accused the Elsons of being stealing food from her kitchen, that she confronted the Eldwoods’ accusing their kids of writing their names in her home walls, among other things. The elder of them couldn't been more than 10 at the time and they were extremely shy. They were not the kind of kids that you could expect to break into people’s house to crash their walls. The truth is that we were all a bit scared of Mrs. Turner. Rumor was that she killed her husband and kept his corpse with her until today and that she made spirit sessions back when she was younger. I think it was all just a bunch of urban legends.

The rest of the week was pretty much the same. Every night, Cookie would come at night through the attic window, do some wild scratching, and then leave. Sunday night, in my sleep I felt his weight at the foot end of the bed, I remember talking to him, but he left. I loved having Cookie around, because it made me feel closer to Liam, my first crush. So the cat’s visits were a way to connect with my puppy love. Liam was working in the city council for the summer, as an internship, so I missed him even more. Summer was the best part of the year, we all used to spend so much time together, just wandering around. I fell asleep thinking about him.

Monday night after dinner things got much creepier. I walk passed my sister's room and noticed she was sobbing. I opened the door a little presenting my nosy head inside her room.

-Are you okay? -I asked

-Obviously not! I'm terribly sad -she said between tears

-What happened?

-I heard mom talking to Carol, Carol Elson, and she, she...-Poppy started crying again

-Poppy, What did you hear? -I claimed impatiently

-They were saying that Cookie has been missing for over a week, and he...he...appeared dead this morning, in their backyard, but he was like eaten. There were parts of him spread in the grass Charlie! -she yelled- Who could have done such a horrible thing to a cat? Carol doesn't want to tell the kids because the truth is awful. She tried to talk to the police, but no one really cared, they said it was a wild animal. Please keep your mouth shut, the children can’t find out about it.

-Are you sure? Are you sure that they were talking about Cookie? -All I could think about were the scratches on the walls and the crawling noises, and even worse, the weight I felt on my bed last night. I was 100% sure that it was the feline.

-Yes, Cookie, dead, torn apart -broke up in tears again

That night was probably one of the longest nights in my life. I got to bed frightened but I still held a tiny bit of hope that none of this was real. Maybe the cat they found wasn’t Cookie, maybe she misheard the conversation. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

Oh, I wished.

I left the light on my nightable on of course, and stayed up reading a book, there was no possible way I could go back to sleep. I was ready, I wanted to know what it was. I wanted to go upstairs and find cookie. Of course, all that bravery changed when the crawling started.

First, I heard a bump and then the slither. I was paralyzed. I could hear everything so clearly and I wasn't able to move. Oh my god, I could never forget the cold chills running crazy down my spine, the fear, the rush. Everything got worse when the scratching started. Slow, very very slow and then fast and loud against the wall. I couldn't take it anymore. I yelled with all the air in my lungs the magic word: MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

She jumped out the bed like crazy, came running to my room where she found me sitting on the bed terrified. Told her everything, desperate, and she went upstairs to check, that woman was so brave. Of course there was nothing. She turned the lights on, and did a quick search.

-All safe! -yelled from the attic almost laughing. She didn’t believe me. Classic. That night I ended up sleeping in my mother's room. I wasn't crazy, was I? Was I hearing things?

Next morning with everyone at home I decided to play brave and go to the attic by myself to make sure there was nothing out of the ordinary. At daytime nothing seemed creepy anymore and to be fair, our attic wasn't not one of those scary intimidating attics from movies, it was very illuminated during day because of the gorgeous window we had. At first I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. But then I caught a glimpse of it.

Fingernails. On the floor, few pieces . Long and hard few pieces of fingernails, with irregular shapes and a bit of dry blood. I was horrified. But it got worse.

Carved on the white wall there was a sketch of five people drawing. The drawing was horrible, like made by a child, but it was easy to understand that it was three boys and two girls. Who the hell. What the hell.

I didn’t know what to do. Something was getting into my house and carving scrawls on our walls while everyone was sleeping.

I showed my mum the drawing and the nails, as an irrefutable proof that there was something going on.

-Oh, my baby girl has always had a great imagination -she said and kissed me on the forehead -I’m sure it was here before we moved in, and that is just rubbish honey, I haven’t been able to clean up in here for a while. What a shame! -she said laughing.

I had asked my mum about the previous owners, all she could tell me was that there was a family of three. A couple with a kid, they had moved because the father had a new job in a different city, and it was 20 years ago. I needed to know what was happening in my house and I felt like doing some digging. That day I made up some excuse to take the bus to the town’s centre and pay Liam a little visit at the City Council. The main reason to make an excuse, was my sister. She would've gone mad if she knew I was going to meet with her crush, but it wasn’t for the reasons she would think of, well, maybe a little.

I got off the bus and walked to the building. I got to the reception, said hi to Elise (in a small town, we all know each other), the receptionist and asked for Liam, he showed up a minute later looking surprised. He made me follow him to the office where he was working as an assistant to Pam Middler, a stout middle age lady, with rosy cheeks and a sassy personality.

-So why are you here for Charls? -he asked me intrigued

-Well, I need to know about my house’s previous owners -I didn’t want to give much information, I just didn’t want them to think I was bonkers.

-Honey -Pam asked me- you live in the 239 of 2nd street right?

-Yes

-That is an old house, sugar, it might take you some time to find any information about it - she turned to Liam - Sweetie, bring your lady friend the files on the third file cabinet, those are for first and second street, they are ordered numerically, the 239 should be there.

Liam got the files within 5 minutes, and they offered me a desk to sit and read. I spent the whole afternoon with them, talking, laughing reading, and drinking coffee. Pam was hilarious, she knew a lot about the town and its inhabitants.

It was 5 o’clock and they had to leave in half an hour, I had finished with all the files, and I couldn’t find any family that would match the drawing, it was frustrating. Nothing strange, no mental institutions, no orphanages, no hospitals, no crimes, nothing. My house had been a family home for ever, with no strange background. I was disappointed and It showed.

-Honey, what is exactly that you expected to find? -Pam gave me commiseration look

-Oh God, I didn’t want to say anything -I said turning red as the converse I was wearing that day -Some strange things have been happening and as I’m a bit scared -big lie, I was terrified, but Liam was there, I needed to look brave- I wanted to know what could be happening.

I told them everything, except for the part of the gutted cat. Anyway Liam hadn’t seen Cookie for more than a week, so I just omitted the way it had been found and the story still made sense. They looked interested and Pam definitely believed me.

-You know, I don’t think the problem is in your house pumpkin -Pam said- You live next to Tanya Turner. The Turners were very famous back in the 70’s.

-How come? -This was new information for me

-Well, Tanya and her husband used to work as psychics, you know. Readings, connect to the other side, spirit sessions. They worked in famous cases, exorcisms, and they had even been contacted by the police sometimes to retrieve missing bodies. Good Jesus doesn’t let that old ghosts wander around your house honey. I always thought their lifestyle was a bit inappropriate, and taking their daughter with them...raise a child in that kind of darkness...is cruel -Pam said nodding her head with disapproval

-She had a kid? -I asked. I thought she was alone in the world, no family, no kids.

-Yes, a daughter, she grew into that, and after her father died in strange circumstances, she walked away, and no one saw her again since. Cute kid. She must be reaching her 40s now -Pam finished her story.

Liam and I were fascinated. We came back together in the bus thinking about all sort of theories about Mrs. Turner and the thing that was paying me visits. He told me to keep up with him with all the new events, he was now my partners in crime. That night I was in the clouds, the whole day with Liam was all I needed to spend a careless night of sleep. What happened in the next days still amuses me…

51luzf,6,2016-09-07,Is a Capitol Hill Internship in D.C. a once in a lifetime opportunity?,cbo92,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/51luzf/is_a_capitol_hill_internship_in_dc_a_once_in_a/,"I was recently fortunate enough to be offered an internship in D.C. working for a congressman in my home state. At first, I was ecstatic that I was offered a position on Capitol Hill, especially from a congressman in my home town. The more I think about it, however, a few concerns are raised. Namely:

1. I need to pay down my debt. I have been barley getting by for close to six months and have ran up credit card debt in addition to student loans I already had. I recently moved out of an apartment and back to my parents to try and pay down debt/save some money in the next six-12 months while I look into pursuing a masters degree at local schools. This internship, which is unpaid for three months, would require me to take out a loan with my family and pay them back, which I don't want to do for comfort reasons.

2. The congressman I would be working for is very conservative, and while I don't consider myself at all a dire hard liberal, but I don't agree with many of his policies which tend to be Republican standard. All that being said, he seems like a genuine man and I wouldn't mind working for him but I have seen other posts suggesting you work for the party you would want to be in business with long term only.

3. As mentioned before, I was planning on pursuing a Comp Sci Masters to complement my Finance bachelors degree. My real interest is in public policy research and I think I can leverage those two degrees into something in that area, particularly data analysis. However, the interviewer told me I would also have an opportunity to research legislation while there, and that they would try to hook me up with whatever kind of position I wanted post-internship.

**TL/DR** Is it worth me putting my plans on hold and straining myself financially for a three month DC internship? Is this really a once in a lifetime opportunity, or can I get myself in a better situation financially while building up some practical skills (i.e. formal training in programming) and expect to land a similar roll later on?"

I graduated this past spring with a BS in IT, which was a new degree at my school that mixed CS with MIS. It was not too heavy on coding, only having us take one or two coding heavy classes, but rounding it out with more database courses and project management courses. The only languages I was introduced to in class were C# and Python and I worked with VB in my internship.


Upon graduation, I got a position with a fortune 250 company as a java developer. I do not know Java, but they stated we would have a week long Java boot camp to get everyone up to speed. The boot camp was not what they made it out to be, quickly breezing over high level concepts and mainly showing us the environment we will be using.


To make matters worse, my first day in the office, after my on boarding was complete, my PM left for paternity leave without giving me any clear direction. After the first week that he was unavailable, he started working from home for another 2 weeks. 


Three weeks in and I had been given no clear direction and unsure of what I'm SUPPOSED to know or supposed to do. Since my PM coming back, I have had some good conversations with him, but my current goals are still very high level: learn java, learn the program, learn the the systems that are used by the main program. 


They have stated they expect it to take about 6 months to gain the knowledge I need, but I don't feel like I am getting the support I need to be successful. I don't want my hand held, but I just feel so lost. I have hundreds of pages of documentation for programs, which I have tried to read through, but the amount of effort involved seems so high for how little I gain from majority of what I read.


I have tried doing online java training like codeacademy(way too simplistic) and codingbat, as well as lynda.com and some others. I have found that I do not learn well from watching videos, I need something more interactive to get it to sink in.


I know this is long and rambling, but I just wanted to know what suggestions people have in terms of how to improve my java knowledge and possible things I can do to improve the support I receive?"
51lzo1,1,2016-09-07,"Accept return offer, or explore other options?",IamLytes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51lzo1/accept_return_offer_or_explore_other_options/,"This past summer, I had my first internship with one of the big banks in the United States. My team worked on the online banking platform. The tech used was mainly java/spring, javascript, html, and css. I worked on a simple web project using html, css, and javascript. I also learned about security regarding web applications and the bank as a whole. I'm currently most interested in full stack web development and security, but I find a lot of other areas really cool too.

I'm graduating in Dec 2017, so I received an offer from the bank to intern again next summer. I have to let them know by this Friday. However, my school has career fairs coming up in a couple weeks with lots of companies coming with some big names as well. I know many people get offers from these fairs.

I'm not sure if I want to stay with the bank. Overall, the internship was fine and I didn't have many complaints besides not doing as much as others. The pay was really good and the city was cool too. If I go back, I get the same pay and will probably work on the same team, and I'll probably get more development work. However, I'm not sure if I'd want to work there full time after the internship. I'd like to explore other options at the career fairs as this is the only experience I have, but I also like that I already have an offer. 

I'm thinking about accepting the offer, and still exploring other options. If I get interviews and offers from companies that appeal more, then I'd back out from the bank and most likely burn that bridge. I'd rather not burn any bridges, though a small part of me worries about getting a good internship if I decline the return offer, which would leave me with nothing.

Any and all advise is welcome. Thanks!

I must change careers , late in life (38) and have been told/read online that software developer will soon become obsolete.

My question is, given a lot of hard work, the willingness to always have a ""side project"" of some sort , spending the next few years learning a lot of theory (via a [B.S in IT Software Development](http://www.wgu.edu/wgu/prog_guide/BSITSW.pdf) from WGU , working internships or low level jobs that relate to my education and generally becoming a dedicated professional, can I expect a future within this industry? 

One where I may even make some small contributions? Considering that I'll be starting entry-level in 2020 and people tell me everything from ""software development jobs won't exist"" to ""you'll be competing with 20 year old geniuses, guess who will get hired?"" or ""Just take a four week course and start working"", ""with outsourcing people with far more experience, asking for far less money, will always be hired over you"" etc ad nauseum I feel very uncertain about my path and hope aomeone can illuminate some of the landscape ahead.

I'm currently a freshman at Appalachian State University, studying computer science. I would like to have my options open when graduating, ensuring I get a job that I will enjoy. This means I will need to build experience, potentially through an internship. My problem is my university may not be the best for landing an internship as it's in a small town. My main question is what will employers look for the most when hiring, and what can I do to make sure I am set up for a great career? Is an internship equally important as a portfolio of personal projects? Do employers care about which school I graduated from?



App State is located in a small mountain town. The school has about 18,000 students. My concern is that I won't be able to find a good internship to gain experience without traveling far. I was considering transferring to NC State, knowing that the Research Triangle Park would be a wonderful place to get an internship and maybe even land a job after I graduate. Also, I've heard it's more rigorous, meaning employers will lean towards the better school, when hiring.

My dream career would be to work for a bigger company as a software engineer. I want to walk into work everyday knowing that I made the right decisions along the way and I took the best possible path.

For the people who have already found a career or are just farther along than me, what advice or piece of information would you give yourself prior to starting your education path?

Sorry for the long post. Thanks to those that read it all, I really appreciate it.

TL;DR: My school isn't the best for getting an internship, I am thinking about transferring. Do employers care about which school I graduated from? What advice or knowledge would you wish to have known before you began your education path?"

Could use advice for transitioning into the CS field.,gw2380,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51naiw/graduating_with_bs_in_cs_in_the_spring_while/,"I feel like this is a situation that is becoming a little more common, but I still struggle a bit to find advice for the situation.  

I'm 31 years old. I've worked in marketing since I graduated college at 23, but felt like it was an unfulfilling career path for me. I'm very logical and analytical at heart, and thought I'd give a semester of CS a try, and then go from there if I liked it. I ended up loving it, and two years later, am slated to graduate with my BS in Computer Science in the spring (originally had earned a BS in Business Administration).  

I've done fairly well - my school's reputation is average, but I've earned a 3.70 GPA and two academic scholarships from my school's CS department that have nearly covered my entire second half of school.  

That said, as I approach the finish line, I'm left with a feeling that I don't know what to do. I haven't explored internships much, as my current marketing job has me making ~$55k and has let me get through school without having to take out any loans or change my lifestyle. It's been a huge help but also leaves me without a ton of CS experience to pitch to companies for a first job.  

I would like to get into mobile development, if possible - I'm comfortable with Objective C or Swift. Possibly web dev as a backup to that. I've taken courses in the subject, done well, and have some good programs to use as samples for applications/interviews.  

This is all a bit rambling, but I suppose my questions would be (especially for those who have been in a similar boat):
  
- With my (lack of) CS job experience, is pitching my course experience, program examples and 8+ years of working in business in a team environment with great references, etc. something that can get me in the door at a company, or is there something else I should be doing?  

- Is it uncommon for companies to hire people in my situation before they graduate? Should I be looking for something now, even though I don't graduate for another nine months?

- This is a bit radical, but if internships are a must to have a decent shot at a good entry level role, is it worth putting off my graduation for a semester, taking an internship over the summer and applying for jobs in the winter?  

- As someone with a pretty good background in marketing, is there a job that I *should* be looking at, as a way to pitch my marketing experience in a CS field or role? Mobile and/or web development always felt like one, just from knowing what kind of things are aesthetically pleasing to consumers being a bonus to design.  

I appreciate any advice, whether to these points or in general, anyone could give to someone in my position. Thank you!"

So, I finished my last class in early August. I'm officially done with my bachelors. Admittedly I procrastinated job searching because I was loving my summer internship and really wanted to work there. I was culturely a good fit and learned more than I've ever learned, but they decided against hiring me because of my lack of programming experience. They normally hire people from a school in my state that prides itself on being as rigorous as MIT, so my public school education and lack of prior internships or personal projects wasn't as desirable. I was told by many people there I ""have the mind for it"" but I just need to learn more and practice more.     

So, I applied to as many places as I possibly could. I got several rejection emails, tons of no-replys and finally one interview. The job listing was very vague and I assumed it was going to be a crappy job because I'd never heard of the contract company. Surprisingly, the job was at a very huge (well known in my state) pharmaceutical company and I got an onsite interview. I would be an entry level developer working on in-house tools for researchers to analyze data. Occasionally they also were put on other IT related tasks, they didn't use any kind of unit testing, they weren't Agile, and the guy in my interview mentioned they ""often just copy and paste the same code from old projects"". It wasn't exactly what I wanted, especially after being in the environment of my software engineering internship, but I was excited it was at a well known company and it would give me more experience coding.  

 Since then, the communication with the recruiter was very slow and I usually didn't get updates unless I emailed first. A week after my internship ended I was told I would get started in one to two weeks. Two weeks later I was told they were still unsure. Finally I was told there were unforeseeable circumstances and that there was no determined start date. I was even told I should continue my job search.  

I cannot afford to be jobless for an unknown period of time, so I am job searching again. I told the recruiter if there is a start date in the foreseeable future I would definitely still be interested and to keep me updated.  
  
Okay so, I've been putting in resumes and applications again. But, I have a problem. As my internship company stated, I am very inexperienced and need more practice with programming. I've been working on some side projects as best as I can but it is going to take a while to make anything that I am proud of. I need experience which requires either a job or time to work on something...   &lt;/ramble&gt; 

**tl;dr**  
I need to learn/ practice more before I can get a decent development job, 
but need a job asap for bills (I am not able to pay next month's rent as it stands right now),
I do have a lot of IT support experience and have considered broadening my search beyond development, but fear the low pay and lack of resume building 

IDK I'm mostly just venting. But if anyone has anything useful to say, pls do.

I've already been rejected from one internship for having a degree--they told me I should apply to their regular SE position instead. But I'm not qualified for that position.

My background: I've started my third year of community college with my major being computer science. The reason I haven't transferred yet is because I lack the Math requirements in order to be accepted into the CS major. I am not looking to do ECE. I plan to apply to Berkeley and Davis this season.

I have completed my community colleges Computing Fundamental, Data structure and Assembly language courses(all with very high grades). These are the extent of the CS courses my school has to offer. By the end of Spring 2017, I will have finished IGETC and have completed up to Calculus 2. My GPA will be &gt;= 3.69.

I have interned at a prominent National Laboratory. I was the youngest in terms of my academic studies and the only one not from a technical or 4-year university. For example, 80% of the interns in my program were finishing their masters degrees from Universities such as NYU, GATech, CMU, etc. I am also one of the few interns that was hired on part time during the school year. I also hold an active security clearance for the work I do at the National Laboratory.

My questions for you: /r/UCDavis 

1. What are my chances of getting in?
1. Will my internship experience make an impact? If so, how can I further elaborate on this during my application process?
1. Anything information you can pass my way to help ease my anxiety?"

Though, that is more of a separate issue I fee like.

Here are my results:

-Straight A's so far since the summer class I took as well.

-Involved in class and I stimulate group/class discussions very well.

-I am more fascinated and curious about the topics I learn.

-Even though things I don't want to do, it's much easier for me to do them and get them done well.

-3 internship offers from small to large companies

-Built a very strong network in the industry I am in that I will have a job in the field I want to work in after college

-Based on progress I can leverage my internships and the relationships I've built to get internship from a blue chip company

-Great odds in being able to transfer into a top tier university(based on class performance, resume, extra curricular, internship, A-grade recommendation letters)

-Great odds in landing a 6 figure starting position right after college based on feedback from the executives Ive built great relationships with (will be graduating in 4-5 years so I still have a lot of time to really ramp up my resume and experience)

Negatives: 

-Havent been in college for 2 years so have to take a placement exam for math and have forgotten almost everything with math

-Trying to learn 2 years worth of math (algebra-precal) in 2 months, but because of my schedule it is incredibly difficult to spare time to do so and I absolutely hate spending time on this

-If I dont place in a good math class then I will be delayed in transferring having to graduate in ~5years, if I get placed in a good math class then I can probably finish in 3-4 years. 

Just giving feedback and maybe if you guys have suggestion for my particular problem.

Just a little background. I have always liked programming. So when I had the opportunity, I went to a school that teaches computer science and I really liked learning C, Java and web development. I always came home and worked on some side projects just to learn more. I was really hungry to become the best developer I could be.

Last year, I had the chance to go to England (I am from Switzerland) to do an internship, but I ended up working in a really sh*tty company where I was the only developer and I had to work extra hours every day just to finish all the projects the previous developers who quit had left behind. I worked so much that I became sick. 

Eventually, the internship finished (even though my boss didn't want to pay me but whatever) and now I am working in an other company here in Switzerland. The problem is that I really have no motivation anymore. The things that I once enjoyed doing don't seem fun anymore and I stopped programming when I go home.

 I am afraid that I was so disgusted by my first internship that I don't want to program anything anymore. I really want to start programming again but I just have no motivation.

Has this problem ever happened to someone ? If yes, what did you do to get back on track ? 

Thank you for your help and sorry for my English. "

I successfully landed a job before graduation and have been working for 4-5 months now. However, I’ve come to realize that this life behind a desk, at least with what I am doing now has become monotonous and I don’t enjoy going to work like I thought I would. 

So I sit every day and try to think of my future and where ill be in 2, 5, 10 years from now and try to picture where I will be and what ill be doing. I try to think of things that make me happy or that I am interested in. I always come back to the idea that doing something in the video game industry would be down my alley. 

So I guess my question would or should be, what sort of jobs or companies could I make a living from in the gaming industry? Any redditors in the industry that would like to share some advice? I really want to find a job that I will love (I understand that takes time) but I think narrowing down the industry is a good start. 

Any comments/feedback/etc. are appreciated greatly. Again, I wasn’t really sure how to word this or form it to an exact question but would rather just like to brainstorm and hear what the internet has to say.

* ~1k left on student loans (was able to pay most of it from an internship I had + part time jobs)

I am currently still living with my parents and don't have plans to move out for another 1 or 2 years and don't have too many expenses.

* I spend about ~25% of my bi-weekly paychecks on gas, groceries, car payments, and bills and the rest I just put into my savings or spend some of it.
* I am thinking of just saving enough for a down payment on a house in several years instead of renting when I do move out.

Here are some of the things I'm looking to get advice on:

* Should I use my TFSA money (emergency funds) and just pay all my debts off?
* Should I start looking into investing? I get calls from BMO all the time asking if I want to invest in a mutual fund but idk if I want to do it with them so I just put it in my TFSA.
* I recently opened up a Tangerine account because their money-back credit card is awesome and have better rates than BMO. Should I just transfer my funds over to them and stop using BMO?

* Everything happened in Maryland, USA  

We just have a bunch of emails going back and forth where they started suggesting lots of ideas and things that we should add on the site.  I did engage in conversation with them about the ideas, and did not stop him from suggesting stuff, but I was under the impression they were going to be an intern/volunteer at this point and they had agreed to work for free as an intern.   

**My Problem is -** now they are asking about equity and being a partner eventually.

If I had known they would expect or ask about for something like this I would not have talked to them about the project in the first place. 

**What are my legal liabilities at this point?   Do i need to worry about them trying to sue me later saying I stole their ideas?**

I assume they would have no legal ground to stand on, they made the suggestions freely with no agreement for reimbursement.  But I want to make sure, I am ready to walk away from this project rather than risk being sued later by some guy who helped for a couple hours.

I should have gotten him to sign an NDA before we discussed anything, life lesson i guess.

I am located in the Bay area, graduated in June and started applying to jobs early-mid August. The reason being, I decided to take a trip to see my grandfather who was on his deathbed abroad (no need for sympathies, he left on good terms) after graduation. 

I've cold applied to about 30-35 positions so far, some of which were admittedly reach (only recruit from top schools) and have gotten about 10 ""thank you for applying but.. skills dont match"" so far. Some of these were at big companies and some well known start-ups. I think I am a descent programmer and a sensible guy so I'm trying to avoid mass-applying for entry level positions, but at the same time I don't want to start overlapping into the 2017 graduates territory for these positions which starts in October/Nov. I also don't want recruiters/HR to become dismissive of my application seeing that I've been out of school for 3 months, so I'm starting to cross into crunch time and get a little nervous. In the mean time, I've set up my own website and made sure I have all of my relevant school projects on github along with a couple side projects. Additionally, I'm learning more Java in the meantime (generics, AOP, etc). 

I have descent gpa (B+ avg. overall and 3.4ish CS), although I don't list it on my resume. I have prepared for technical interviews and believe I can answer many of the CTCI-like questions. 

I guess the weak points here are that I have a reserved personality and am mostly cold applying to all of these places. Although, now I am starting to reach out to friends and family a little bit more. I would attend networking events, but meeting and conversing with new people is not one of my strong suits (although can do if it comes to it). Additionally, the internship I had was at a relatively unknown start-up that no longer exists.

Another thing is: most of the bioinformatics job postings I've come across generally want a MS or PhD, so I'm not sure where I fall at the intersection of biology and CS. I'm posting my resume below in case that needs work, or if I should be working on more side projects.

I've never worked in any computer related field - the closest I've come is an unpaid internship building a website for a record label a number of years ago. 

I want to transition into the IT field and start building a career I can have some pride in. I've spoken with a careers councillor and they seem to believe that a Masters in IT would make me much more attractive to employers over an undergraduate degree in the same field.

Paying for this course isn't so much of an issue as I have savings that can *just* cover it, however I'd like some input as to whether this would be a wise use of my time and money and given my current (lack of) experience, will I be an attractive candidate to employers after completing the course?

Ok, some background info. I was a screw up in my early 20s and as a result I am now a 27 year old Junior studying to obtain a BBA in Information Systems.  I currently have both an Associates in Business Administration and one in Liberal Arts (obtained at the same time) but I have zero experience in anything IT related and wanted to know what is the best way to go about and get my feet wet in the field so I can get some experience before I get my degree.

I have some personal experience in building computers and really enjoyed taking Java I (currently taking Java II) so I know some of the fundamentals in both hardware, software programming, and other general undergrad tech subjects but that is pretty much it. 

All that being said I have no idea where to begin and when to begin. Should I try to obtain certifications like CompTIA A+ and MCP and use that to get into a help desk position? I feel like I'm too old to do internship and don't think a viable option anyway considering I work full time."

Somehow, I feel like I know what I need to do to be decent in my studies and don't mind learning skills on my own. But because the social aspects of clubs tend to congregate like minded like myself, it will expose me to be more social and do better in interviews than somehow who just knows technical stuff.

51vkbl,1,2016-09-09,Please help; trouble with mentor,corinarose1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/51vkbl/please_help_trouble_with_mentor/,"TL;DR I am having some real trouble with an ex-mentor of mine, who I was on good terms with, but later did some real stupid stuff and I had to back off.

When I started my first job almost four years ago, I was assigned a mentor. He was very helpful, taught me a lot, wrote my recommendation letters for grad school and helped with my paper. We were on good terms and would once in awhile have tea or lunch together. Later, he started behaving really weirdly, (from trying to hold my hand to trying to kiss me), and I decided I had to cut it off. Then I eventually resigned to pursue my Masters' degree.

He later came on a business trip and insisted on meeting me. Now I wasn't interested at all, but he pleaded and pleaded and showed how much he had helped me and finally I did meet him, but he ended up touching me inappropriately and tried to do other stuff, but I got out before anything could happen. I was scarred for a while, did really badly that semester and avoided him because I was too disgusted by him.

He would keep messaging or calling and saying how he is sorry and all that. A year later, I began to give in. I was desperately looking for internships, and ended up sending him my resume. ( I know, should not have). Then I faced some difficulty at work with my project so would consult him for guidance, believing that he wouldn't do anything bad. 

He somehow thought I owed him for all that and would insist that I take trips with him and go to places with him alone when I wasn't comfortable with it. I looked up to him as a professional mentor, so then I started questioning myself as to whether I was doing something wrong. Was I using him? So again, I stopped being in contact with him or responding to his (incredibly frequent) messages.

Recently he contacted me about a job opportunity that had opened up at my first company's headquarters, where he was still working. I was very reluctant but he insisted and eventually got me into a position I could not back out of despite me being very resistant. Now I'm in the company, partly out of desperation because I did not have a job either. Now the other day, he picked a fight with me over texts saying how I did not have gratitude and did not personally thank him for ""getting"" me the job, how I didn't go with him to coffee after I said I would (I had a meeting, and later forgot all about it) and how I've never been of any help to him.

I told him I really cannot be a friend any more after what he had done. He said he hasn't done anything to me of that sort recently and asked me why I was complaining. He even mentioned how he said he was hungry the other day, and although I asked him if he wanted me to cook something for him, I didn't insist. His exact words were, ""Am I supposed to request you to make something for me?"" 

He has been emotionally blackmailing me like this for the past 18 months, and crying and asking me to be his friend. He got married recently and I am not comfortable with being his ""friend"". What do I do? I own that it's my fault too for still being in contact with him, but I cannot tell you how hard I'm trying not to. He's contacting me through all avenues possible and not letting me go.

Early 20's; spent most my life working unrelated by day, programming by night.",hfhdrtrt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51w4ti/would_my_skillset_be_enough_to_get_an_internship/,"Wondering if this would be enough to have a shot at internships in spite of my current lack of credentials or if I would have to consider going to school to get a CS degree.

Background: Early 20's, worked in restaurants (mainly for family) for majority of my mid-late teens. Sadly, no secondary diploma but I'm working on it. Started programming as a kid after being interested in how it worked through Starcraft's map editor. From there, I learned Python, Lisp, and settled into C++ as I saw that's what the entire games industry was using.

I built very minor programs to start with after I was done messing around with Starcraft/Warcraft 3: one, a point-of-sale proof of concept system to convince people to purchase an actual one that looked nicer (in hindsight, I should've just ran with it and made something from it); another, a rudimentary game engine with SDL, later SFML, processing graphics and audio with input being hacked together through DirectInput; a myriad of other, smaller ones whenever I have to learn a concept (file editors, taking source files and turning them into something else, etc); all of them in C++. I've since worked with and familiarized myself with C# (first for Unity3D, then generally just messing around creating do-nothing desktop applications), Java for Android development, and Go recently for a concept I wanted to try. Barely touched upon Ruby, looking to do that after I mess with HTML5 more. I've also started to branch out my learning into more traditional computer science versus just programming through various online resources. Currently, I'm working on a server backend for a game I thought up both as a personal ""I've wanted to make this for awhile"" project and as a learning tool and portfolio padding.

I'd like to start working and applying right away since I've finally found the time to step away from the business and madness of the restaurant world, and I feel like I have a good grasp on the things that my peers in the industry know as well as a drive for it, but I'd like to get an unbiased opinion on my current state of affairs so I know what my next steps should be. Thoughts?

I am not a CS student, but I took a few electives on the major. I'd like to try to land an internship in the field to see if I'd like to do it professionally or if I should stick with doing it just for fun. I've started to build my resume and everyone mentions how important projects are to building a strong application.

In one of the electives I took we had to design a 2D platformer in Java and a Zork like game in C++. For various reasons I could not give proper attention to all of my classes that semester and, even though the games worked and I passed the class, the code is sloppy and confusing. Not well designed at all.

Looking back to what I've done, I don't have a lot of projects to display. Right now I am already building something else and I think the time it would take to fix the code will be just as long as making new games and I find my current project a bit more interesting so I don't feel like stopping that to re-do the other ones.

Considering I don't have a lot of projects would it be a good idea to upload them to github acknowledging that it has some design flaws that I plan to fix, even if not right now?

edit: I hope I was clear with the question. I tried to post this and Reddit crashed so I had to retype it and I am not sure that it seems as clear as I wanted it to be. Anyways, thanks :)"

This is my first post here, I'm looking for some kind of support or input:) i don't really know how to deal with my situation.

Few things about me: i'm a student and i'm about to start my master thesis next month. I dont have any courses anymore, but i still need to finish stuff my internship report. I have some mild form of social anxiety and feeling depressed for a while now. I don't have much social contact at the moment, mostly because i barely reach out to friends or initiate, but wait for friends to call me.

Well at the moment I really need to finish my internship report and start doing some research for my master thesis. Although i spend my days mostly at the home i can't seem to get any work done. I end up thinking about the problems in my life and trying to find fixes. I feel like I am totally unable to function at the moment, days go by me sitting at home dwelling on my thoughts all day long without writing a single sentence... I know that this won't help me at all and is total bullshit, yet i am somehow unable to change it. On the other hand if I go out and do something fun or social I feel bad for not have gotten any work done and can't enjoy it.
Sometimes I feel like losing my mind or the sense of reality... I think I know on a in intellectual level that my behaviour is self destructive and unhelpful as well as what i really need to do: Setting some time aside to do my work, and spend the other time going out and doing fun stuff. Yet my permanent thinking prevents me from doing this, i don't know how to change it 

Needed to get this off my chest, i'm open for any help or other response.

Take care"

I'm writing this post to hopefully receive some feedback about a plan of action. Initially, I tend to be more of a lurker, but I'm gradually realizing that not seeking help when I need it is making things unnecessarily hard on myself. I received some feedback from others (friends, a professor I emailed), and thought that it could not hurt to ask others who are actively working in the field. 

To give some context, so comply with the posting rules: I have a M.S. in speech-language pathology. I enjoy the degree and work that I do in social-communication, language, cognition, speech, and swallowing function and disorders. I have about 2 years of work experience (not including clinical practicum and internships in grad school). But I wish that it could be applied more technically, for lack of a better word, as I list programming, artificial intelligence, development of assistive &amp; augmentative communication (AAC) devices, robotics, interface between humans and technology, and computer science and engineering under my interests. I have some experience programming (predominantly Python) that I self-taught, because I found ways I could apply it to create a program to help coworkers. The crux is that my degree did not have the prerequisites and training that would typically fall under computer science and engineering degrees, and so I am researching the necessary path to take toward academia and continuing education.

I asked for others' feedback, including a professor who is doing research in artificial intelligence, social robotics, and applying technology to research and teach individuals with autism; it's work to which my current background could be applied provided I had the requisites taken care of.

Some of the feedback included suggestions to complete prerequisites for a CS or engineering program at a community college and later transition toward a B.S. degree. A friend mentioned that, given my existing M.S., I may not face the same hurdles as someone working toward a first degree. However, I don't know how true this is considering there is not significant overlap between my current degree and one I'd be working toward.

The professor's email is quoted below:

&gt; There are a few different routes into this kind of work, the most common of which is via a computer science degree. As it doesn't sound like you have enough CS background to be accepted into a PhD program, I'd suggest looking into one of the Masters programs. Many places have excellent MS programs that will let you get up-to-speed in a year or so and then be ready for more serious research.

This was very encouraging, but it left me with some follow-up questions, namely:

* Would a CS degree be the most advantageous route, even if it is the most common? One concern I came across is that CS may leave one less prepared in terms of hardware, embedded systems, and interface between humans and technology. A suggestion was to focus on CE instead, and tailor the program toward CS if that interests somebody.

* Would the Master's programs mentioned be a type of accelerated program? I wasn't aware of their existence for someone without a B.S. in a related field, but that may just be because I'm an outsider.

* Along the same vein, does such a Master's program exist for other fields (e.g., CE or EE), or is it exclusive to CS?

I've given this a lot of thought and would like to start taking the necessary steps. I hoped that I could pique the minds of people actively working/studying in the field, so I would appreciate any information. Thank you in advance!

(ugh stupid comma on the title, can't change that now)

I had an amazing internship this summer with a medium-sized company. They're the dominant company filling their niche currently, and they recently upgraded from startup status due to their success and just went international. My job was in ASP .NET with MVC, and I worked mostly backend with data and data services. Web dev is not something that I see myself in as an ultimate goal, but the culture was awesome, the team was amazing, and the company is really great.

Anyways at the end of the summer they gave me a full-time offer and if I accepted I would start once I'm done with school in April. It's 70,000 USD/yr (in Midwest dollars). I'm torn because while it's an awesome opportunity, I still feel like I want to shoot for the stars.
Favorite-big4-company visits my campus annually. I've met their recruiter for our area several times and he's pretty great. Anyway last time they visited he did an exclusive Q&amp;A with an org that I help run. Only the leaders showed up, so he told us that he had been personally instructed to reach out to us specifically and iirc he said they ""badly"" want the 4 of us work for them.

So, that's encouraging. Except for the fact that he hasn't even seen me code.

This summer has also been a study-up-for-interviews attempt because another recruiter contacted me, I sent transcript, they called me &amp; wanted to start interviewing, I didn't feel ready, I said call me back at the end of summer, and thus began the summer of studying (CTCI, MIT OCW, etc). Well, half-assed studying.

I don't feel ready at all, and also I won't have my algo class until spring. I know that information won't make them go ""easy"" on me. I'm the kind of person that wants to shoot for the stars but then either tends to disappoint themselves by not making it or back out because they feel inadequate. I want to shoot for favorite-big4-co but part of me says why even try if I don't think I'll make it?

Relevant subquestions: is it easier to get into competitive companies as a new grad or as an experienced dev? Should I not take the offer if it means I would get pigeonholed into web dev forever?

Relevant details: 3.76 gpa in major, multiple TA jobs, leader in multiple CS orgs, CS education volunteerism, 2 web dev internships so far"
51y15x,2,2016-09-09,Did I just shoot myself in the foot without realizing it? First offers out of school.,default_dev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51y15x/did_i_just_shoot_myself_in_the_foot_without/,"This is the story of my first offer, followed by a couple questions!

I graduated in the fall semester of 2015 from a Massachusetts state school with a BSCS, 3.0 GPA, no internships, some significant projects (mostly small). Since then I've been applying for between 30 and 40 hours a week to many companies, big and small. 

Since the start of 2016, I've had a total of 4 calls from HR departments doing the initial screening. From that, 3 on-site interviews. 2 of those interviews turned into offers (both within the last two weeks). Both offers seemed to be ecstatic to have found a candidate like me after the interviews. I received calls with offers literally within hours of both interviews, and it was obvious that they had other candidates they were interviewing. This was a HUGE confidence boost, but I could be reading it wrong.

The first offer was the higher salary (51k non-negotiable), but a total PITA of a commute to the south shore (~50min without any traffic, ~120+ with traffic), and also would be a dead end, using proprietary languages and gaining minimal skills that would apply elsewhere.

The second offer was 4k less than the first (non-negotiable), but a MUCH better commute on the north shore (~20 minute reverse commute, never any substantial traffic), with a broader net of skills that would be a real career builder.

The latter seems like the no-brainer to me. The office life seemed better, the team I'm going to be working on is developing a new technology for the company that basically all of their products will be based on in the future, the supervisor is MUCH more human (also a girl like me so we sort of ""clicked"" in the interview), etc. 

I am truly excited for this opportunity, and happy that I accepted, but there is this looming feeling that I can't shake that tells me that I just accepted a terrible offer, remuneration-wise. I know the whole selection-bias schpiel about the people here who post their newgrad 125k+ salary offers from ridiculous companies, having just graduated ridiculous schools with ridiculous GPAs (good for you, I'm happy for you, but I'm simply in no way comparable to you). But still, under 50k in MA? This is higher salary than anything I've ever received payment for, but this seems very low to me, though I don't have anything to compare it to besides the first offer I mentioned, which just barely broke the 50k line. The silver lining to me is that I'll be using over 5 languages that are mostly all very highly sought for in the software industry. They are mostly languages I've never used before and I made very sure to state that clearly, so I'm excited to be learning these new skills that can be put on a resume for the future. I understand that this company also promotes from within, so this seems like it could be a great investment in my future, just not the best compensation for the time being.

Am I crazy to be expecting higher pay? My dreams of getting a full inbox of offers right out of school was crushed when I realized that I wasn't exactly the ideal candidate, so that's not what I'm expecting here, but I certainly was hoping to have higher offers than this. Is there hope that my pay will increase in the future, whether by being promoted or by switching to new companies? Or did I shoot myself in the foot by basically advertising to future employers that I will accept low offers (I believe they ask for previous salaries when they do background checks, correct?)?"

I live in Canada and am a little flexible with cost. I would rather have something that lasts then buy something cheap and replace it in a year. max like $1,200?

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 I have zero need for a 2 in 1. I don’t really like the idea of a touch screen (I have an iPad). 
I am in gradschool, so a good battery life is very important to me. As is easy typing ( I write/excel a lot). I am looking for something pretty. As much as I hate to admit it, I am a big aesthetics gal. 

* **How important is weight to you?**
Very. I lug my laptop around school/work everyday. I will most likely be lugging it around in my internship and career (PR). So something small/thin is ideal. 

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 I am very much in a Windows/Mac debate. My old personal computer was a mac . It survived 6 years, 4 moves and a lot of carelessness.. but I am willing to convert. 

I used to have a work computer with windows 10 a while ago and found it frustrating but maybe the kinks are worked out?

I'd like to get an internship for summer 2017 but know my chances are slim to none without any personal projects and technically being a freshman. My goal is to complete some project come winter to give myself a shot when applying in spring. My university has a spring career fair and I'd like to have something to show then. Yes, I know applications for Summer 2017 start now, but I need something of substance on my resume to give myself a realistic shot at landing at internship.
I've been brainstorming and have come up with an idea for a project. I'd like to make a fitness app that calculates your daily macro-nutrient requirements (protein, fat, carbs), helps you log them, and has a library of workout routines.
This seems like a feasible project but I have a few questions before I begin.
1.) Which programming language can I accomplish this with?
2.) Which programming language is worth investing time to learn to make myself more marketable to employers?
3.) What are some of the best online resources to help me learn along the way?
Any advice is greatly appreciated.
Thanks!"
51yid2,11,2016-09-09,What are my options? I'm 22 and by the looks of it I will get my B.S. at 28 if I'm lucky.,Nuclearpolitics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51yid2/what_are_my_options_im_22_and_by_the_looks_of_it/,"I came to the U.S. when I was 16, had to wait a year, then took a placement exam that allowed me to go directly to a community college skipping high school. 

In college, I had to take a bunch of ridiculous general education classes to be eligible to transfer. I initially wanted to go into the medical field, but I realized I enjoy Math and CS way more. 
Then, a year ago, I got an internship at an industrial automation company in LA, as a ""software intern,"" and officially made the switch to Computer Science. I lost a good two years or so because of this switch. 

Currently I'm 22 and preparing to transfer next Fall to a UC campus. I have a near 4.0 GPA, the recommendation of most of my professors and supervisors at work but I'd never actually looked at the curriculum for B.S. in Computer Science. I never looked at it because it seemed like a distant dream, and after I looked at it today I have only confirmed by doubts. 

I still have to take about 34 courses, which add up to a minimum of 4.5 years. That means if I transfer next Fall at the age of 23, I will graduate when I'm almost 28 (assuming no delays).

When I initially came to the U.S. I had no idea how the educational system worked and thought community college was a mandatory in-between step. Did I have to take those general education classes only because I didn't go to high school in the US? I feel like a prisoner who's been locked up for most of his prime years. My college counselors keep reassuring me that I'm on the right track but I don't really trust their judgement.

But no crying over spilled milk. What are my options now to finish this up as quickly as I can? If I go to a less ambitious university, will the curriculum be shorter? I can always do my masters somewhere else (assuming by the time I'm 28 I don't get sick of living a student's life). Are there accelerated online pathways? I really don't want to spend all of my early twenties studying, and gearing up for some desk job maintaining someone else's code. 

I'm so lost.

School has started up again. Upside; my neighborhood delinquents have to spend their days locked inside a brick institution learning whatever it is kids learn these days. Downside; the museum is swarming with school trips at least three days a week. There’s upwards of five to six hundred public elementary schools in the city alone. Ages 6-9. Maybe. Then add onto that the middle schools and high schools and private schools. And all the of those from the counties just north of the city that send their kids down for a day too. That’s if each class that wants to come down gets the budget. 
All of that so that we can instill a sense of humanity pride into them. At least that’s what some of the teachers I’ve met have said. Most do it for the educational reasons. 

Kristoph kept the schedule tight and actually put effort into this aspect of his job. So, while classes of youngins tramped around in the upper floors, I stayed quite content in my little archive room. Unless a CUNY class or other University class was coming to look at something rarer, I had no intention of stepping foot out of the archive room between the hours of twelve and four. 

“Not going out for lunch today?” Today’s lunchtime intern asked me.

“School trips effectively ruin my appetite for most of the year,” I said, resting my forehead against the edge of my desk. “I hate seeing kids disrespecting history. As most of them do ‘cause they’re too young to really understand it, or they just don’t care. Besides that, I’ve got some more artifacts that the IFU wanted to take a look at.”

“That can wait,” Kristoph’s voice said from the entrance. For once there was no one hanging off of his arm and ogling at the massive size of the room. 

“Where’s your miner?” I sat up. 

“Out shopping,” he answered. “Get up,  you’re needed upstairs.”

“Last time you said that I ended up almost kicking an eight year old out of the museum for trying to take one of the display items home for show and tell.”

“I’m not about to ask the intern to give a tour of the museum.” Offhandedly he added a “no-offense” to that statement, not bothering to give them a glance. 

“I don’t do tours. Not unless they’re adults.”

“Lucky for you these are miniature adults.”

“High-schoolers are still technically children in the eyes of the law.”

“Think smaller.”

“I will kill a middle schooler. They’re all brats.”

“I’m paying you extra. Plus overtime for your troubles.”

*Damn him and my need for funds.* I stood and straightened out my dress. “Is there a reason you can’t have a tour guide give the tour? Don’t we have ten on hand, like, everyday?”

“Tourism, Calla, tourism. Additionally, three of them called in sick and the other three are currently out giving tours. As you can see, we’re short handed.”

“I already said I’d do it. Do you not see me standing?”

“Good.” His smile was blinding, with his freaking clinically treated white teeth. “You’ll be meeting them at one thirty.”

The door closed behind him at twelve-forty-five

I kicked my chair into place. “Guess I better go review. Don’t lend anything out while I’m gone unless they’ve already got the prep-approval.”

The intern gave me a pained smile. “Yes ma’am.”

---

There had to be at least fifty kids staring up at me. A group of about one-hundred had walked in at half past one on the dot, and got divided up between myself and another guide. One of the teachers dropped off a box full of cellphones at the front desk in order to make the children pay attention. I don’t blame them for not caring about the shitty, half-hearted introduction the main teacher was giving me right now. It’s not like they got an advanced notice that their tour guide had changed. The other tour guide told me to start on the bottom floor and work my way up. He’d be starting five minutes before us so that the rooms didn’t get too crowded. 

As I watched the last of the other group disappear down into the neolithic and Sumerian room, I clapped to gather the attention of the students in front of me. “Alright, hello everyone, I hope you’re having a good day.” No response. “Well, as your teacher said, my name’s Calla Burnhart, you can call me Calla. I’m the head archivist here in the Museum of Human History. Normally I’m down in the basement working with the artifacts that we don’t currently have on display,” some of the students and one of the teachers perked up at this, “but unfortunately we won’t be going down there today.”

My watch told me that only two minutes had passed. *Damn, how do they do this. Questions, ask them a question.*

“So, who can tell me what the oldest known civilization is?”

A two hands raised and I picked the one closest. “Mesopotamian?”

“Close, that’s actually a pretty good guess. The Sumerian civilization was based in the Mesopotamian region, but Mesopotamia itself is not a civilization. However, before all that, I’m certain you guys have heard of neanderthals.” Five minutes passed and I was good the lead them into the early history floor. The stairs leading down weren’t as crowded as they had been during the summer and I was thankful for that. The more studious children stayed up front and payed attention to every word that fell out of my mouth. The others who stayed towards the back took the time in each room that I allowed them to look around to prank each other and make ridiculous dares instead of reading and learning. I hoped I wasn’t making a fool of myself, but by the time we got to the fourth floor (American Civilizations and Modern history) I felt more annoyed than stressed. The younger history teacher had straightened himself out and was trying to keep the children in line the entire tour. The older teacher just laughed and told him to give up. 

---

Let me reiterate just how annoying I find unbehaved, loud mouthed, incessant, children. Particularly of the adult variety. 
The trip was ending in the gift shop, so that the kids could buy something either for themselves or someone else. I was going to leave them there, but the history teacher cornered me by the rack of mugs and keychains asking questions about getting in to see the archives. 

“You’d have to call in to schedule an appointment,” I answered, absentmindedly turning the mugs so that they all faced the same direction. “The front desk has all the information you’ll need in order to do that-”

“Calla, there you are!” Niex’s voice boomed through the gift shop. Heads turned at the disturbance, but quickly went back to their browsing of items.  The owner of the museum and a security guard were trailing after him, albeit casually. 

“So I’d stop by there before you leave. There’ll be a fee and some paperwork if you want to take an item out, but if it’s just to look there shouldn’t be a problem.” I pulled a business card out of my wallet and handed it to him. “Here, if you have any questions about anything and you’re not able to come in, I’d be happy to help.”

“Calla, do you know this man?” Kristoph demanded from halfway across the store. 

The teacher looked conflicted. I smiled, “Please don’t hesitate to contact me. It’s my job to help.”

“Calla, don’t ignore me,” Niex whined, hand on my shoulder. The teacher backed away.  

“Excuse me. Hope you have a good rest of the day.” I whipped around and slammed the side of my hand into Niex’s side. He, a grown ass man, pouted and rubbed the point of impact. 

“What was that for?” 

Kristoph gave him a glare, “Do you know this man? He’s been causing disruptions since the moment he stepped into the building. Tried to take one of the sarcophagi from the Egyptian exhibit.”

“You’re just upset because I stole that chick you were flirting with,” Niex grinned. I felt my shoulders tense up and my mouth drop at the words coming from both of them. 

*Deep. Breaths*

“Anywho, who’s that guy you were talking with? Seemed like a scrawny type,” Niex continued on. 

Kristop raised an eyebrow, “Calla? Having a social life? Unimaginable.”

“Office. Now.” I snapped, pushing the two of them towards the door. The guard followed us, resigned to his fate. Siet came around the corner just then, took one glance at the situation and fell in step next to the guard. I slammed the service elevator button about ten times before resorting to tapping against my thigh. 

“Care to tell me exactly why the two of you had to come find me for this situation?” I asked, stepping into the opening doors.

“I wanted to.” They answered.

“I want you to know that I hate the both of you.”

“How on earth will I survive,” Kristoph deadpanned. 

“Don’t say that,” Niex smirked. “You’ll-”

“You lack a heart,” I interrupted. “What do you two idiots want anyway?”

“I was bored.” “He said he knew you.”

They glared at each other. “You’re annoying.”

“You’re both a pain in my ass, congratulations.” 

Niex shrugged and leaned against the back of the elevator.

“If it’s any consolation, the crew ordered Chinese food and it’s in the conference room,” Kristoph said. 

The doors opened at B2 and instead of taking the stairs down to the archive room I led the way to the conference room. Some of the researchers working looked up from their work as we moved along. The electronic lock beeped at my ID and the door clicked open. 

Kristoph and Niex took opposing ends of the table, Siet took the corner next to Niex and pulled out a tablet to do work with, and the guard stayed outside. I opened up the bag of Chinese food and snagged a fortune cookie. Kristoph and Niex continued to glare at each other while I snapped open the cookie and let half of it dissolve in my mouth. 

“What’s your fortune?” Kristoph asked, breaking from the staring contest to watch me tap against the table. 

I picked up the blue and white slip. *Don’t take yourself seriously, no one else does. Learn Chinese: Cucumber = Huang Gua. Lucky #s: 32-29-50-44-18-10* “Stupid.”

“Anway, Calla, you still haven’t answered who this man is?” Kristoph pressed. 

“Better question, who’s the person that was in the shop with you?”  

*...Idiots, the both of them.* “You two have fun,” I smiled, standing up and taking the container of sweet and sour chicken. “I have an actual job I need to get back to.”

I slammed the door shut behind me and locked it from the outside. The security guard gave me a questioning glance. “If you hear any shouting, ignore it. It’s an important business meeting. They just don’t get along.”

He nodded as I walked away. *If they don’t kill each other in the next thirty minutes I’m sure they’ll be best friends…. Oh dear god don’t let them become friends.*

---

Never have I ever: wanted to kill someone as much as I do right now. The two morons who I left in the museum at five-thirty were now sitting in the far corner sharing a drink with a diligent guard dog on either side of them. A group of about five college girls walked in behind me screaming “FUCKED UP FRIDAAAAY!” They reeked.

I snuck over to the booth that contained George, my best friend (Ash: Short for Ashley), and a “stand up guy” the George knew from college. It was a botched attempt at a double date by four singles. 

“Calla, you’re late!” Ashley shouted, pulling me into our side of the booth. 

I slapped my hand over her mouth and hissed out, “Quiet.” A peek over at the table on the other side showed that neither man had figured out I was here.

“What’s got you all tensed up?” George asked. He passed a cider to me, “We saved you one.”

“Thanks,” I said. “And my boss and housemate are in the bar.”

Ashley’s face lit up, “Whaaat! No way! You mean that guy that took you home last time? Oh. My. Gawd. You should’ve seen her Tim, she was sooooo fucking drunk.”

“How many fucking drinks have you had already?” I asked, pinching her arm. 

“Like, only five.”

George and Tim laughed. 

“Anyway, my boss is Kirstoph Caper and my housemate is also a fucking prick, so I don’t really want to encounter either of them right now.”

Ashley laughed, “You never even say his name. Didn’t you lock the two of them in a room together today?”

I glared. “Yeah. That worked out sooo well, clearly.”

“What did you expect? Two guys like them are bound to get along,” George answered. 

“I was hoping they’d kill each other,” I stated.

Tim, who’d been looking over at their table, turned back around. “What’d you say your housemate’s name was? I feel like I’ve seen him before.”

*What? I’m pretty sure his human form hasn’t been put up on the search list.* “Jonathan Vicariot. Why?”

Tim’s eyebrows raised and he looked back over. Niex was laughing and shoving more alcohol towards Kristoph. There were about twelve shot glasses turned upside down on their table. 

“Real piece of work that guy,” George glared. “I can’t believe he showed up at your work. Didn’t you tell him not to?”

“I didn’t even tell him where I work. I honestly think he came in to buy something and just saw me. I had to do a tour today, I hate children.”

Ashley let out a little giggle and leaned against me. “Re-remember when you wanted a kid? What the hell happened to that?”

“I grew up,” I pushed her so that she was leaning against the wall. A waitress came up to us and I ordered nothing but appetizers. 

“I’m here to drink and be merry,” I said once the waitress was gone. “No one take advantage of me.”

Tim told us more about himself. He worked as an accountant for a shipping company that had started in on extraterrestrial mail once the borders opened ten years ago. He’d seen Niex in their building last week, but hadn’t actually talked to him. Ashley, who’d been invested in the whole traveling to space and the like, asked him all sorts of questions. George put in complaints with me about our jobs. The embassy was apparently getting nowhere, and the earth ambassador and George’s boss had been spending the past couple of days arguing with Drien Shon on getting the FBI or some other criminal investigative services involved with the search. I offered my agreement and apologies on just about everything. 

“From the man over there,” the waitress said, placing a shot of Demon’s Blood in front of me with a note. I looked over to where she had addressed, to see Niex raising his own shot to me. Kristoph was trying to keep his head straight. I glared and looked at the note. 

*Might as well take it, I’ll drive you home.*

“The hell you will!” I shouted, crumpling the note and throwing it away. Stupid pride. I down the shot against the protest of George who recognized it. 

It wasn’t as horrible as the first time I had it. Still fruity and delicious, but it didn’t hit me as hard. I didn’t pass out in five minutes, but god damn I couldn’t remember half of what happened after I took it. Kristoph’s guard led him out of the bar at some point, and Tim followed shortly after that. Ashley and George tried to feed me water, but Niex and Siet came up and sat with us, trying to coerce me into taking the ride home.

“You know you won’t be sober enough to drive home, despite the train ride,” Niex said and drunk-me didn’t want to acknowledge the logic in it. 

“I’m not letting you drive me home,” I said, trying to stand. 

Ashley, who had sobered up, caught me and sighed. “Jeeze, you’re stubborn.”

George offered up his couch for me. Niex shut him down. Ashley tried as well.

“Why don’t you just take the train with her?” Siet finally offered. “You’re also intoxicated beyond your normal means, so you shouldn’t even drive. I’ll park your car overnight and which ever one of you sobers up faster can drive her car back to the house.”

Niex thought about it, even though I was absolutely ready to deny it. George and Ashley agreed, seeing it as a decent enough plan, though saying that if I really didn’t want to, I should just go to George’s apartment. I was adamant about taking that plan. 

“You know,” Niex started, “Scotty’s been alone all day. He looked so sad when you left this morning.”

My teeth hurt. “Ugh, fine. I’ll bear with it.” 

“Good. Let’s go before it’s too late.”

Thankfully, there was subway entrance on the street corner and while I wasn’t all too keen to sit across from other drunks and some other sketchy looking figures, Niex almost bit some guys hand off when he tried to pick-pocket him. The metro-north train was quieter. Two other people got into the car with us, and both had a computer on in front of them. Niex wanted to switch cars. 

“They’re not going to kill us,” I snapped, resting my head against the window. The glass fogged up with my breath. 

“You don’t know that,” he replied, cracking his knuckles. 

“Just let it go.” I closed my eyes. “If you really want to move, then leave me here. I don’t know anyone who’d want me dead anyway.”

“Just go to sleep,” Niex said. I opened one eye and saw him on his phone, mouth turned down. 

“Mm. Don’t abandon me.” I said, turning in the seat so that I wouldn’t get a sore neck. “Or I’ll kick you out.”

He laughed softly and the train jerked forward.

- part time, only 5 hours per day, i can spend a lot of time on side projects like remote internship in a journal that i have right now, there are a lot of other good things that i can do with free time to develop my intellectual and social skills

- old boss promised me to help a build a portfolio for me that might help me to help for a better job in future, but i cant be sure that he is capable of that

- certainty that i wont be fired

- almost no stress

- 8-9 hours of sleep every night

- good location, i can get to the office in 50 minutes



Old job, cons:

- small salary, enough to sustain my lifestyle, going out with friends, buying little things for me, but not enough for travelling or buying expensive stuff or saving anything

- no people around, working either in an empty office or with the boss that i dont like much as person, feelings of occasional annoyance, boredom and loneliness are guaranteed

- the boss takes me back only with condition that i work with them at least for 6 months, until then i wont be able to leave

New job, pros:

- novelty of unknown, its a thrill and adventure

- people around, they might be good or bad, but there is a chance to make new friends

- better salary after few months of working...they take me as an intern and if i would prove myself as good worker, they would give me more than at old job, but only after a few months

- good working experience, they would really teach me some skills of copywriting and social media marketing that might help me looking for a job in future

- possibility of making a career in promising company


New job, cons:

- full-time 9 hours, i would forget about sleep and side projects

- bad location, more than an hour to get there

- office building is quite gloomy, huge and empty, renovation and darkness everywhere, i am afraid it might be depressing working there

- they might fire me if i wont prove useful...after being fired at last job i feel like its a decent chance of that happening, its basically the same field of profession and this guy who offered me the job said that they fired two people already, one was alcoholic and the other showed that he was unteachable

- the job might be too hard or dull for me, i cant be sure unless i try though

* Didn't do as well in my first year as my later years. GPA's been increasing year over year. Hoping to finish with a 3.65+ in December 2017. 
* In the process of writing a research paper that should go to publication in a major CS/IT research journal. Focus is fairly cutting edge tech with little similar research in the area.
* Quite confident I can get at least good, if not decent academic and professional references.

**Questions!**

* How do US schools look at Canadian undergrad schools? Do they see GPA differently? Canada has much less of the idea of ""top-tier schools"" and such. Still, Alberta is a fairly strong CS school, even for North America. I've also heard we do not inflate grades as much?
* I've heard internships do not count as work experience time, is that true?
* I am a Canadian, educated in Canada, but I'd like to attend a US MBA school. If I work in the US for a while, does that count as ""International Work Experience"" that so many candidates have?"

I am in my 4th year of college. I didn't switch to CS until halfway through my second year so I am equivalent to junior status right now in terms of finishing the program. I've just started to care about making personal projects (I'm working on a Pygame and building a portfolio website after i learn basic html and css plus maybe a little JS), but I feel like it's too late to land an internship for the summer. I don't feel like I have enough to offer on my resume to impress employers enough. I went to the career fair last spring and no one was interested in my resume enough to call me back for an interview. I'm just frightened and worry every day whether this degree will be a waste because I got started on enhancing my personal portfolio too late. I feel like I have nothing worthwhile to offer to employees... The career fair is coming up in about 2 weeks and I'm so nervous that I'll look like a fool because my resume's a little light... I wish I got serious about my major earlier. 

I am starting to get very passionate about CS (meaning I'm beginning to do side projects and think about it in my spare time), I'm just wondering... At 21 years old in my 4th year of college? Is it too late for me?"

But then I'd be missing out on the skills that I could be collecting in internships.

-Given my situation and desires, what do you guys think I should do? 

-Also, what kinds of internships should I look for that would improve some of the skills I would need to be a successful entrepreneur later? (I was thinking an internship in marketing could be useful.)

-What if I were to do both - do internships and build side businesses on the weekend or something similar? Any tips on juggling the two without burning myself out?"

I'm currently a junior studying CS in the States. A lot of people in my year (myself included) are ramping up to apply for internships for the summer, so I've had to sit down and think semi-critically about what I want to do beyond just graduating in the next couple years. 

I have basically no interest in trying to work in Silicon Valley right off the bat. I'd love to work somewhere in Europe (Copenhagen, Stockholm, Zurich, and Hamburg are the first few cities on my list), but I'm unsure of how to go about doing this or if it's really even a viable option. I know the pay will be less than what I could get in the US, but that isn't a big concern for me. I'm more interested in taking advantage of the time I have to be young and adventurous.

As far as language stuff goes, I speak a little German, which was the reasoning behind most of the cities I picked. I'm willing spend the time to really learn it if that would help me out at all, but most jobs I've seen only mention English proficiency.

Does anyone have any experience with this, or any advice to share? Am I more likely to get a job in one of the offices of a huge company like Google, or somewhere smaller? Is it even something I could do straight after graduating, or would I need more experience before I'm even considered? Any input would be very helpful. "

It took almost a month for them to schedule me an interview. I was told to show up at 8:30am but was not called in until 10. I completely BS'd my way through it. I didn't put much thought into any of my responses because I had a test at noon and wanted to get it over with quickly for some last minute studying. During the interview I was asked for my class schedule and availability. The interviewer asked if i would be available for graveyard/night/early morning shifts of 8 hours during the weekdays when I have class, without thinking my dumb ass said yes. I was surprised that I was hired immediately after the interview ended. 

I'm worried that they might schedule me to work those shifts. I looked over the syllabus for my classes and all of my exams  are on the same week. Plus my professors like to give pop quizzes almost every other class, so I really have to stay on top of the material. I'm taking 16 credit hours this semester. 3 classes being ""weed out"" classes and a class that requires a bit of work because of projects. I  have to maintain my GPA for the program im in and scholarships that will allow me to graduate debt free. Plus I want to join 2 clubs that would be extremely helpful in getting me an internship. 

I only want to work weekends 15-18 hours max. Im scheduled to attend an orientation for the job on Monday and plan on telling them there. The job isn't that important to me. I still live at home with the only bill I have to pay being my phone. I'll always have a job in my uncle's roofing company(The only job I've ever had). I only work Saturdays with him but its a very long and tiring day. I won't make a lot of money but enough to get me by. 

I wanted the job because I could make more money working the weekends than I would working 1 day with my uncle. Also for another name on my reference list. I fear that they won't give me my desired schedule and I'll have o quit. I'll make a lot more money once I have my career than I ever would working there. so, obviously school has to be the #1 priority in my life. 

Could there be any negative drawbacks if I quit or am I overthinking? I want some opinions/advice from other college students"

So far I've narrowed down about four reach schools, one of which I will apply to ED, but would like to hear anyone's opinions for ""safer"" schools because I know admissions is a crapshoot. I want a strong engineering education but am interested in taking classes in the liberal arts as well, so for this reason I'd like to avoid schools that are primarily tech-oriented. I have a few ideas but would like some outside input. Thank you for your help! 

Demographics: Male, white, public HS in New York

GPA: 96.5 UW, 99.0 W. My school doesn't rank but I would estimate that I am within the top 5-10% of my class based on GPA.

Courses: All honors/AP where applicable- probably the same as most people on this sub. The AP's I've taken are: AP World (5), AP Enviro. Sci (4), AP Chem (5), APUSH (5), AP Lang (5)

This year I am enrolled in AP Calculus BC, AP Physics C (Mech and E&amp;M), AP Lit, AP Macro, AP Comp Sci, College Italian &amp; Orchestra

SAT: 800 Math, 790 CR, 740 W
SAT II: 760 Molecular Bio, 790 World History, 760 Chem, 760 Math 2 (Retaking in October, trying to reach 800)

Extracurriculars:
-Boy Scouts (5th Grade-present): Just finished my Eagle Scout Project (~200 service hours) and about to finish my last merit badge, which will mean hopefully I'll have the award by mid November because the process of getting everything approved takes a while. On my ED application I plan on explaining in the additional info section that the award is expected by then. Also served as Assistant SPL (basically Vice President) of the troop, help run and plan trips and meetings.
-Varsity Swimming (9th-present)
-Italian Club &amp; Italian Honor Society (10th-present): This past year another student and I started a walkathon that 50+ students participated in. About $2000 was raised by club members to support Cooley's Anemia research, a lesser known blood disease common in Italians. 
-Math Team (10th-present), Co-Captain
-Viola (3rd Grade- Present) Member of school Chamber Orchestra, tutor two younger students once a week. All County Orchestra in 10th grade. 
-Internship in a Biomedical Optics Lab this past summer in the BME Dept. at an elite university (not giving name for privacy reasons, it would be easy to find the professor I worked with).  Research was in optical imaging for early detection of cancer/dysplastic tissue. Helped grad students set up/align laser systems, prepare biological samples. Learned lab basics. (100 Hours)
-NHS, Tri-M Music Honor Society
-NY American Legion Boys State, Elected as a State Assemblyman

Essays: Still drafting but I've been working closely with a counselor and teachers to get opinions and make changes- hopefully will be good and I know this part is very subjective. 

Recommendations: School doesn't let me look at them but I expect them to be decent. Chem teacher of two years, Italian teacher/club advisor of three years, and my internship mentor who is a professor at the university I'll be applying ED to. 

I appreciate anyone's feedback. Thank you!

I have learned a lot during the past 2 years and have completed multiple online courses including MOOCs from Coursera and also graduate level courses like cs188x of UCBerkeley. I am interested in pursuing higher education and do research in the same.

I can go ahead in the following ways:
1. Apply for Masters for fall 2017 intake. I feel that the coursework might get redundant and i would be forced to take up a job to repay loans
2. Apply for Phd directly for fall 2017 intake. However, this will be difficult as I have no prior research experience and average performance in Undergrad
3. Apply for yearlong unpaid internships under professors and get relevant research experience. And then apply for direct Phd

Can you please advice me on the best way to go forward. I am sure there are many like me that are facing a similar dilemma.

I've never felt like I've fitted in in this industry; all my peers seem to have been coding since they were 12, have done tons of side projects and have a github and all that, and know a bunch of languages we were never taught in class, and I've mostly just done what classes require; I've done one side project and I know how to make it sound impressive if needed, but I don't think it's actually very impressive and an experienced interviewer could probably figure that out. I also doubt my technical interview skills will be up to par.

Thing is, I'm not really sure I want to go into software development, and I'm leaning towards becoming an Actuary. But I haven't yet passed the actuarial exams (taking them soon, before graduation, but that doesn't leave me much time to find anything), so I can't really apply to actuarial companies at this time, and I need a job when I graduate. And studying for actuarial exams is taking up all my spare time - having to brush up on my CS interviewing skills in addition to that, and coursework, could get rather overwhelming.

So, does anyone have any recommendations for someone like me? Could I get a decent-paying ($65k or so a year) job in a company that's not a major tech company (like insurance or something) without having great technical interviewing skills? I'd always heard that a CS degree = a guaranteed job, but with everyone else having things getting lined up and not me, I'm starting to feel a little nervous."

525cvi,1,2016-09-10,HELP! Considering Architecture,coopzors,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/525cvi/help_considering_architecture/,"Hey everyone,

My name is Cooper. I'm a 19 year-old student in attendance at Kennesaw State University, and I need advice! I would like to ask you folks the following:

**1) How can I determine if architecture is the right career for me?**

**2) What advice would you offer to someone considering architecture as a pursuit?**

**3) Where can I learn more about the daily responsibilities of an architect?**

**Background:** I am thinking about changing my major to architecture, but not without doing my research. I am a sophomore in college, and I have been a music ed major, a music performance major, and a computer science major. I have had some difficulty finding my career, and now, I am simply undeclared in my studies. I've been taking ""general education"" courses, which apply towards just about any major I could choose, in order to buy me some time to make this ""major"" decision (pun intended). Anyways, while I have always considered architecture a fascinating and mysterious career, the idea of majoring in architecture really caught a hold of me a few days ago, and it has not escaped my focus. I've turned through a number of podcasts and youtube videos, and it seems like it may be a great fit for me as a career.

**About me:** I strongly identify with the Meyers-Briggs ENTP personality type, and it was through an MBTI website that Architecture was suggested to me as a career. I have always been very spatial, and had a knack for construction/creative toys like Legos, Lincoln Logs, K'nex, and video games like Minecraft. My best experience with any of these toys has been the times I made my own creations without the aid of instructions, and this is how I spent about 90% of my childhood playtime! I am a very creative and artistic person, and have taken music lessons across piano and percussion for 14 years. I love to draw. I am intellectual (Official IQ of 130, processing score of 132), in both a lingual and mathematical sense. I have a great appreciation for art and architecture, and like a true ENTP, I am obsessed with learning new things and finding new interests (hence my difficulty in finding a niche; I want to do EVERYTHING)! My mother was an architecture major in college, and worked in an architect's office before marrying my dad and becoming a full-time mom, so I may have a genetic disposition (if such a thing exists (it probably doesn't)).

With all of that said, I understand that an Architect's education involves a 5-year degree program, followed by a three-year internship, and I welcome the academic rigor with open arms. I would be very appreciative if you folks could offer me any sort of insight or share your experience, I'd really just love to hear what you have to say.

Thanks!"

Do I have to tell potential employers that this was an internship position? Can't I just say it is a contract position (as that what my boss calls it sometimes).

At this point, I'm seriously considering the program for the Winter quarter. Wanted to ask a few questions and see if this plan is feasible. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

- Can't help but see the same set of courses listed in the tracks and class descriptions. As Post-bacc online students, are we allowed to take CS electives? Or are these the only classes available for online? Ex: can I take another CS course instead of CS 372 - Intro to Computer Networks?

- My hope is to start the program with my full time job with 2 classes/quarter, then maybe after 2-3 quarters, transition to full time student until I finish. My thought process on that is with a full time job, I'd only have the energy for classes. But as a full time student, I would like to use spare juices to look for internships, participate in open source projects or networking events (I live in Bay area), learn and build things that can hopefully help with career search. Is this plan feasible? Would there be some logistical issue (aka can't get classes, etc.)? Has anyone had any experience with something similar?

- For any alums working in the Bay Area: after completing your degree, how competitive were you in the region, and how were your job prospects? I'm a little intimidated here with so many prestigious colleges in the area  and around producing solid engineers, and companies having such high standards.

Thanks for any feedback!"

I have been following this sub reddit since quite a while. All I have seen is people with top profiles, top colleges, top internship, top CGPA, etc. 

Heck, even on the internet all I land upon is people graduating from top schools with an internship at the Big 4, with already multiple jobs in hand.

Is there a place for a student with 3.5 GPA from an average school, very few side projects, and average coding? I can solve few hacker rank, leet code problems, never tried too hard. 

I am worried, thinking I am not good enough. I don't have major side projects, never worked in a collaborative manner with a team. I don't aim for Big 4, but a job with average or decent pay, good work culture at some small college town which is not expensive and crowded. 

Can I do it? How much efforts are required? 

TL;DR: Average student in all aspects, can I land a average job being an average student?
Using a throwaway. 

Thanks in Advance !"

1. What kind of clothes should I wear? I'm unsure how fancy I should dress. 

2. Since they are flying me to NYC, how likely am I to get the job, they should can't fly everybody in to interview right?

3. I'll probably be quizzed again in person and have to code on a whiteboard right?

Obviously nobody is going to advertise themselves as mid-tier, so I'm wondering if anybody has been in a similar place to where I am now, and has any suggestions for searching.

A little bit about my background: 

* I just graduated this June with a degree in Computer Science from a well-known tech school.
* I have a strong background in physics and mathematics -- I took graduate level physics courses up through Lagrangian mechanics, I also have experience in linear algebra, tensor analysis, etc.. 
* I've completed two CS-related internships focused in C++, one research-oriented, the other at a hedge fund in finance. Thus I have some experience in advanced level C++ concepts (template meta-programming etc.), but I believe I am more of an intermediate C++ programmer. 

Given my background, I don't think I would have too much trouble getting into a software company, but recently I've considered transitioning to a more computational role -- I want to do physics and programming since I love both. 

With that in mind, I've thought about working at scientific laboratories, but those are basically impossible to get into without a graduate degree. 

Assuming I don't want to get a graduate degree at this time, I figured that one of the best places to combine my love of physics and programming would be to make physics engines in the video game industry. However, I fear that my lack of experience in the industry bars me from entry, despite my education and internships in other sectors. Pretty sure experience in the game sector is king, and for that I'm out of luck. 

What steps should I take to transition to this sector? I was thinking about holding a software job in the meantime while building a portfolio, but that strikes me as something a game developer should focus on. Maybe there's something I'm missing. I'm also open to advice about computational roles in general.

Thanks a ton for any advice in advance. I really appreciate it.

Right now it looks like I could graduate in two or three semesters. Two would mean I would be applying to full-time positions. Three would mean I would be able to get another internship if I wanted to.

I've considered applying to both, but the one complication is that I think I should be able to take care of all of my cs requirements in two. Then I'd just have one or two gen ed classes. Now this does add more time, but because they are gen ed classes it'll probably be possible to test out or transfer those credits in. So I'm not sure if I'll even need to actually go back to school if I take three semesters. And if I did do an internship and got a full-time offer I might decide I want to talk with them about moving up my start date.

I started out with a different major, so I had a fair number of gen ed classes when I started. Because of that I haven't spent a full four years as a cs major. I feel like an inexperienced developer, so I'm ok picking up a little more experience as intern.

So I'm not at all opposed to taking three semesters. It's just that I'm a little unsure about how to talk to recruiters about it. I don't want to tell a recruiter that I'm graduating in two and then come back later and tell them that I'll be available then, but I still need one or two classes before I actually graduate. And I'm not quite sure how an internship will take being told that I'm actually immediately available right after the internship ends. Most internships expect students to go back to school. "

The second one is a job in mergers and acquisitions of a big company. It seems a more enjoyable job but they offer me a 1 year internship with no guarantee after that and it seems really hard to develop a career there without contacts. If after 1 year they kick me out it may be difficult to get the same job in other firm because they usually hire people from prestigious universities but maybe I can get a job in an investment firm.

52focc,2,2016-09-12,Searching for the best place to find scholarships/ student aid,basketball--jones,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/52focc/searching_for_the_best_place_to_find_scholarships/,"I am a 20 yo business student at a large, Big 10 university, and am just beginning my Junior year of undergrad. Right now, I am doing something I rarely ever do, which is ask for help. I am a first generation college student, and have no additional support for my education aside from my own and through aid from the government. My parents split up when I was 5 and both vowed to finance 1/3 of my college education each, though this never happened. I could have taken them to court, though I did was most sons would do and chose to go about it on my own. I made it quite further than most people told me I would, through a ever-increasing, massive pile of debt, working part-time, and few scholarships. I am sure that anyone reading this that went through college on their own dollar knows the position that I am in, and how frustrating financial obstacles are on the path to a degree. It is perhaps the most difficult thing I have ever experienced in my life, where I know I am intelligent and dedicated enough to get a degree, though I may not be able to simply because of financial issues. 

As hard as things have been up to this point, I've reached a tipping point where these resources will simply not be enough to support me. My tuition increased three separate times over this summer; once as a school wide increase, a business student increase, and a third-year student increase. As a result, my financial aid was no longer enough to cover my tuition expense, let alone expenses for books, rent, and food. I cannot even get any more relatively low-interest rate loans from the government, my parents get declined when they attempt to co-sign on loans, and the rest of my extended family is already supporting their own children and cannot afford to offer me a hand. Basically, I am desperate for another method of gaining funding for my education, aside from my last resort of private loans. I am a relatively intelligent student that works extremely hard in school and outside as well. I work 20+ hours per week during the school year and full-time any time I am not in school. I've sold all of my valuable possessions, sneakers, clothes, etc. I run errands for my friends, and basically take any odd job I can for some extra cash. I've become quite a ""hustler"" since coming to college, though I'm sure that my friends would just call me broke and cheap. Regardless, I have adapted to survive already and intend on continuing to do so.

I have had an internship in banking, a respectable GPA, am involved on campus, and have a decent resume. I feel that I am pretty marketable, though I do not know where the best places are to look for scholarships from private donors. If anyone knows of fruitful places to look, or any other creative ideas aside from this, I would be extremely appreciative. Any idea or information at this point would be helpful. I really just want to finish school, begin working, and be able to do good for the world while providing my family with opportunities I've never had. Also, just any general advice from someone who's graduated or been in a similar situation would be awesome. I would love to hear anything from anyone, and I genuinely thank you for taking the time to hear my story. I'd also be happy to share my experiences with anyone else and offer advice to those who may find themselves in my position when they go off to college.  

TL;DR   I am halfway through college and my university is sucking me dry. Broke and desperate for ideas/scholarships. Any ideas/suggestions/links help. Thank you.

52fyy3,2,2016-09-12,Worried about the future of the semiconductor industry. Should I jump ship?,m8te88,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/52fyy3/worried_about_the_future_of_the_semiconductor/,"I have always loved the process side of semiconductors specifically working with semiconductor tools and working on R&amp;D. However after working at a small semiconductor company for an internship, I am worried that the industry won't be around too much longer in the US. There is too much physical labor involved with the industry and with extremely expensive tools many companies are moving to Asia or using the services of large Asian fabrication facilities such as TSMC. 

 &amp;nbsp;

I was thinking about switching fields and going more into the design side of semiconductors such as VLSI and computer architecture. When looking for jobs, I see many more openings for the design side rather than the manufacturing side. However, having just graduated, I never took deeper courses into VLSI and computer architecture. I only took one digital design course, which I barely remember. 

&amp;nbsp;

It has always been my plan that I would go for a PhD in semiconductors and work as a process engineering but I really feel like the area is drying up. I feel like I have the ability to switch my focus now but I will need to do a lot of self studying to catch up."

What would you all say is the most important factor for an internship if you want to break into IB.

I previously completed an internship at a consulting firm (highly ranked on Infrastructure league tables). I now have two standing offers from two different PE firms (both are infrastructure and energy related groups). 

What should be the most important factor for me to consider?

52ginp,5,2016-09-12,From PHP 4 to PHP 7: modernizing a 13-year-old custom-built CMS. I need an adult. Help me.,rustbeltgelt,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/52ginp/from_php_4_to_php_7_modernizing_a_13yearold/,"Alright, so, context: I graduated from school this May and began working in June for a very small local factory. I stay in a small town in the Rust Belt; I'm very happy to be able to find work in my field, in a community where we are still trying to revive an obsolete manufacturing industry.

What I soon have to do at work is kind of a microcosm of that. Basically, in 2003, the company I work for hired a team of students &amp; recent grads as interns to build them a custom CMS for internal use in the factory. In 2003, I was 11. We are using a custom CMS that was written when I was still baby-deving on Neopets. *At the time*, they were students &amp; juniors my age now who did a fantastic job writing thousands of pages of PHP 4 to meet the company's needs. Again: *at the time*. This was 2003, remember. This team of former interns has since moved away &amp; found new work.

So now it's been 13 years and the company is *still* using this CMS, in its exact form. Our servers run 5.5.9. Obviously everyone is itching for updates to the CMS. There are 2 of us in IT and our first choice of course would be to simply start from scratch, because it's 2016 now and it wouldn't be hard at all for us to simply construct something for us out of any of the wonderful CMSs &amp; CMFs there are to choose from here in 2016.

However, our boss insists we must not start from scratch. We *must* not ""waste"" this particular CMS. The other IT guy (he does server admin &amp; LAMP stuff mostly) is in the process of upgrading our dev servers from 5.5.9 to PHP 7.

I am honestly fucked and have no idea how I'm going to efficiently modernize this old CMS. It would be so much easier, faster, and cost-effective to start from scratch--but, since our boss insists it will be wasteful, I can't do that. I also can't take forever on this. I don't know what to do. Does anyone know where I should begin?

(As an aside, I'm the only one here with hands-on PHP dev experience.)"

It looked like an awesome first ""real"" job after dinky jobs like being a TA and tutor. ...and it's boring. 

Completely, utterly boring. I'd be down if I had any busywork, but not even that. I'm doing nothing but maybe coding on Codepen every once in a while and a few things here and there like cleaning up the computer room.

The servers are all maintained by the parent division, and it's all really boring Microsoft stuff that cannot be changed or modified without their direct permission. There's people out there with shitty HP laptops with their keys falling apart complaining to **me** that they need them replaced. But I unfortunately have to point them the other direction because I'm just an intern. That's where the other problem lies: my boss.

The company is drastically downsizing IT departments worldwide, so it's just me and my boss. And well... He's a piece of shit. For starters he pretty much forgot to update Windows Server 2008 R2 to 2012, aaaand he ran out of those additional 120 day license extensions. So we had an expired Server OS turning off constantly in the middle of the day, with people asking us why they can't see their networked folders. So I had to find a crack because my dumbass boss can't get things right.

Yep.
A crack.
On day 1 of the job.

And yet, no matter how hard I try to talk to him to let me do more things, like Active Directory for when people have problems accessing their accounts, he insists I'm not ready yet because I do minor mistakes here or there. He says I should write things down (which I do) on my notebook like he does (uhuh, I've never seen him do that ever). He's constantly behind schedule, and no matter how hard I insist on us having weekly reunions to chat on what we should have planned for the week, he never does because he has more important things to do.

Oh, did I forget to mention he forgot to do maintenance on his console air conditioner? It started to drop shittons of water, so more and more water started to seep out of the computer room and into the carpet. In spite of telling him that this is a very concerning problem that needs fixing as soon as possible, he got to work almost an hour and thirty minutes late, got scolded by his boss, and started to rant to another one of the employees because he didn't do the proper maintenance he was HIRED TO DO.  Oh, he more or less called me a drama queen, too. 

On top of all that, I have no car and I often times end up waiting 2 and half hours (sometimes more) in order to go back home because public transportation here is the worst. 

What do I do? I'm getting seriously depressed here, I'm trying to juggle this crap and my classes which I take from 8 am to 4 pm every day. Both are taking a toll on my life right now; I barely have time to hang out or go on dates with my girlfriend (I haven't seen her for a month). 

I'm at odds here... Sorry for the rant, I'm just so frustrated.

52hb56,0,2016-09-12,"I am thinking about double majoring in Computer Science, but need a little bit advice?",haramwothebae,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/52hb56/i_am_thinking_about_double_majoring_in_computer/,"So I am currently a Biology (B.S.) major in the US who is also completing the pre-medical course of study. I just started my sophomore year of college, but with summer classes and AP credit, I am halfway done with my major. 

Because I am relatively ahead, I basically planned to get my undergraduate career done in 3 years as opposed to 4. However, I decided to take a Comp Sci class this year to fulfill a gen-ed requirement and I realized how much I miss studying computer science. So I am thinking about just graduating when I was originally supposed to (2019) in order to complete a CS BA major along with my Biology major. 

I was in a special program in high school where I had to take technology-heavy courses for all 4 years. I decided to take the programming track so I learned how to code in Visual Basic, C#, SAS, and Java. Plus, I did an internship in IT and learned a bit of Bash and Python. I really excelled in my programming courses, I would always score the highest on all my tests (meaning I really understood the logic/theory behind everything) and I had no problem with any of the projects. In fact, my teacher in high school used to make us write code by hand for her tests and I never had any issues with that. So I think I have a good baseline understanding of programming. 

Anyway, in high school I also pursued my interests in health/medicine and biology inside and outside of the classroom. When I went to college I was sure that I would rather pursue medicine as opposed to computer science (I liked my CS classes, but I did not like my CS internship at all). 

I still want to go to medical school. Since college has started I have done ample hours of hospital volunteering, research, a bit of shadowing, etc. so I know that my passion lies in medicine. However, being in my comp class, I really miss computer science as well. I would love to study the intersection of computer science and biology. 

I would have liked to do a computational biology major, but my school has nothing of that sort. I was thinking instead doing a B.A. in Computer Science (there are a few classes in this course of study that deal with computational biology). I do not want to do a B.S. because I do not want to take any math classes in college (I fulfilled my calculus and statistics requirements in high school).

Ultimately, I would like to use this knowledge and try to get a position in a computational biology lab (I know of two that I would like to get into). Also, I would hope that a BA in Computer Science would help me learn enough programming to program something really useful and creative related to Biology (even on a very small scale). Additionally, as a female, I think I would offer that diversity factor medical schools are looking for (since there's not a whole lot of females who major in CS). 

My ultimate question is: am I being to naive in thinking that I could complete a CS major at the university level? Is my background sufficient or do you think I will struggle through the coursework? Even though I took all these classes and really understood these programming languages when I took them, I haven't coded since, so I do not know how much I would remember."

thank you in advance fpr your advice and help!
Later this year I will be doing an internship in China for 6 month. I plan to travel after the internship, and thus I don't want to take my primary Laptop, which is a Thinkpad L450. It is just to large and to expensive to me. I don't want to bother much about material stuff while travelling and worry if someone will steal it or else. 
I do not need the notebook to be able to perform all the tasks during my scientific internship, there will be computers in the lab. What I need it to do is to be decent to write on, and be able to perform basic online tasks and office. Watch videos. Skype. 

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Maybe 250 €/ 300.$, less is of course appreciated, am considering buying used

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I am not sure about this 2 in 1 would be nice maybe.

* **How important is weight to you?**
as I will travel with it, it is a main factor

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
11''-13'', during 6 month in china I would rather buy a screen, than carry around a large computer afterwards

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Very light photo editing. 

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 


* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 a not completely horrible keybord would be great. Sd card reader. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I was considering buying the Lenovo Miix 300, I could get it for 150 €. "

52i3jq,1,2016-09-12,That Initial Hurdle...,Dark454,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52i3jq/that_initial_hurdle/,"Hi, I am a prospective 26 year old from Toronto, Canada looking to potentially start a career in IT, and a bit of an outlier, to say the least.


While I was in high school, I slowly started to experience chronic fatigue and I found that I would get tired very quickly when I did virtually anything that required mental effort. I barely finished high school and only decided to head off to University because I thought my problems were caused by smoking weed (albeit infrequently) the previous year, and assumed it would clear up since it had been a long while since I smoked.


Fast forward to halfway through my first semester of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and I am struggling. I had no idea what was wrong with me, but I dropped out before my first set of exams due to burnout.


My parents convinced me that my failure was due to being too young and immature to move out and live on my own (read: University residence). I reject this, of course, since I didn't really have any added responsibilities except an occasional laundry session. Anyway, they convinced me to try University again even though I felt the same in regards to my health. Long story short, I dropped out again, this time for good.


I finally found out a few years later that I had a disease causing me to have chronic fatigue and a low tolerance to stress. After getting treated, I suffered with depression for a few years, which I strongly suspect is due to me not being able to move forward in life. Before and during this time, (and presently), I have worked part-time at McDonald's. 


Fast forward again to the present...and I am 26 and working part-time in a dead end job for minimum wage. Dropping out twice has plagued me with debt that I have now finally managed to pay off with my job, thanks to living rent-free with my parents.


My question is...how can I once again attempt to break it into the IT world? My depression is mostly taken care of...however I cannot afford University. My math and programming skills have, for the most part, atrophied since I have been in school. I have always enjoyed programming, however finding the motivation to self-teach myself during this depressing and fatigued time has proven difficult. I also want to get a career started ASAP and would prefer not to spend another 4-5 years on University before I can even start gaining experience (excluding internships).


My goal right now is to get a decent paying job in the IT field with the potential to climb up the ladder, and experience working in different positions that I might be interested in specializing in later. I understand that having a CS degree will open many doors for me later on in my career, but right now I would be very happy with a job in which I can learn on the job.


What would be the fastest route to landing a job with potential career growth? My programming experience consists mostly of C and assembly from my childhood days...I have made a few offline hacks for the game Starcraft a long time ago. I also have experience in Java (mostly making swing applications) from my high school Computer Science class.


I would like some guidance on what I should teach myself in order to get a development job (or something similar in which I can prove myself for advancement) ASAP. People keep telling me that web development is the craze nowadays, however I am not too keen on spending $8000+ on a three-month boot camp, even if I could afford one. 


The Odin Project and freecodecamp seem like attractive alternatives, but I seem to really enjoy C and low-level stuff, and these courses don't really cover this. I also want to work through SCIP or HtDP as these books seem very efficient in teaching programmers not only how to code, but also how to really design and engineer large scale programs.


For some reason, I have always found that my motivation to do pretty much anything is an order of magnitude greater when I am surrounded by people also trying to learn (i.e. in a computer lab). Upon hearing my story, one guy I met on the bus who was apparently starting a start-up, told he would like to **give me a minimum-wage internship in which I would learn from practically zero, (googling everything on the job), and if/when I was a good programmer, he would hire me as a full-time junior dev.** He has since disappeared.


^THIS is exactly what would be ideal for me. However, if it is not a possibility, and I need to learn by myself and/or at meetups, I would be fine with that too.


So it all boils down to...What can I do to break into the IT field ASAP???? My end goal is to be a software engineer. Money doesn't matter too much, I just want to have the potential to turn programming into a career at some point, and need help getting started with networking and whatnot. If free internships/volunteer work are a thing, I would gladly accept an offer. 


What would be the best use of my time? Odin's Project? freecodecamp? Certs? Something not related to web development at all? Currently I am working through Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie's ""The C Programming Language"". Most of it is so far is review, however it has been years since I have coded seriously, so my problem solving skills are a little rusty. Is it possible to start out with no experience or education in a help desk position and learn from the software developers while on the job or something?


By the way, I would very much like to pursue a Computer Science degree part-time concurrently with a job, however that would be way down the line when I am at least a Junior developer or something with a similar salary. Also, some people think that if you aren't already passionately churning out code in your spare time, and that if you need some external motivation to get started, then you aren't meant to be a programmer. I mostly disagree with this: when I can find the courage and motivation to attempt to write software, nothing makes me happier than solving a difficult logical problem with my google-fu skills. However, I tend to overthink things and the anxiety that manifests itself as a result causes me to procrastinate. I know that for me, getting started is by far the hardest part.


Thanks for any help and guidance, and sorry if this post is a mess, my written/communication skills haven't been put to use in a long time!


I am posting this in both r/ITCareerQuestions and r/CSCareerQuestions.

Income level high enough that I don't get much need-based aid, but definitely can't afford the full COA. Suburban.


**Preferences:** Anywhere east of Chicago is fine. I don't have a problem with the west, but my parents are concerned with travel costs. I prefer urban to suburban, but definitely not rural. I definitely prefer non-religious schools, but don't care about public vs. private.


**Intended major:** Economics


**Academics:**

* ACT: 34 composite, 28 writing

* Best subject test scores: 780 US History and 740 Math II (retaking to try for 770+)

* I don't think AP exams count for admissions, but I've passed 10 of the 13 exams I've taken. 4's and 5's on the passes, 1's on the failures.

* UW &amp; W GPA: 4/4, 5.36/6 (4 for regular, 5 for honors, 6 for AP)

* Class Rank: 1/809

* Coursework: Honors for all core classes, except when AP available (13 AP classes, not including senior year). 3 years of Latin. Did a PLTW elective freshman year, Comp Sci electives (including AP Comp Sci) sophomore and junior year, then a student government period senior year (in previous years I'd only participated in student government outside of class).


**Extracurriculars:**

* Interact Club:  (Rotary service org along the lines of Key Club), president. Member all four years of high school. Plenty of volunteer hours and a wide variety of service projects.

* Student Government Association: class VP all four years of high school. Prom committee, Homecoming game half-time show and court banquet committee lead, constitutional revision committee lead. 

* [National Economics Challenge Team](http://councilforeconed.org/national-economics-challenge/): president and founder. Founded junior year.

* National History Club and Honor Society: vice-president (founding officer). Club just started senior year by teacher. National history day committee.


**Awards:**

* Boys Nation First Alternate for Florida

* Florida Boys State Best Forum Bill

* National Beta Convention 2nd Place Social Studies

* National Merit Semi-Finalist



**My List with reasoning:**

* UF &amp; FSU: Top 2 state schools, parental savings cover in-state COA, state government offers partial merit-scholarships (Bright Futures). Good econ programs.

* University of Maryland: COA isn't too bad for an out-of-state, and the school offers full merit scholarships to 250 individuals (Banneker/Kee scholarship). School is a quick Metro ride from D.C., meaning there are great internship opportunities in the realm of public policy. Some are even for credits. Very good econ program (better than UF or FSU). Scholars program gives additional opportunities in the area of public policy.

* Boston University: I like Boston. Excellent econ program. High COA, but full merit scholarship (Trustee) offered to about 20 freshmen. Fed branch nearby; internships (monetary policy is an interest of mine). I've checked out the campus online and like how it's very urban.

* UChicago: Fantastic econ program, quirky culture which I'm *pretty* sure I'll fit into. Prestige. Fed branch nearby; internships (monetary policy is an interest of mine). Liberal education.

* Yale: Fantastic econ program. Prestige. Yale. Liberal education.

* Duke: Full-merit Robertson Scholarship offered to 16 freshman, comes with international trips and other special opportunities, modeled after Rhodes. Econ and public policy studies are top 2 majors, so the campus culture definitely reflects my interests.


Any suggestions?"

Everytime I take my CS classes, I talk to some people after class or maybe discuss test to see how classmate do and sometimes we work on group project and I talk that way. After semester over, and new semester start or I get internship or they do, it is different people in my class next sem. so I don't make any friends.  Sometimes I get too busy with school work that I forget about making friend. I try to make effort to talk to people, but it only go so far. It been like this since freshman year What can I do to make close friend? My facebook friends have lots of friends when they post picture, but they in different school. Did i pick wrong school?"
52jahl,3,2016-09-13,How to categorize technical skills?,popanu,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52jahl/how_to_categorize_technical_skills/,"I'm in the process of revising the **technical skills** part of my resume. I was hoping to get a little feedback so I can find a job and start contributing to society. 

&amp;nbsp;

The technical skills summary on my resume looks like this: [http://imgur.com/a/eZTqb](http://imgur.com/a/eZTqb)

&amp;nbsp;

**What I've been working on:**
&amp;nbsp;

I've been using Digital Ocean VPS for over a year now. I'm confident with using Nginx as a web server and reverse proxy, creating SSH keys, SSL/TLS, user and group management, file permissions, symbolic links, setting up the firewall, private networking, etc. I've been successful with using Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana to create a basic SIEM for monitoring failed SSH logins and monitoring the Nginx access logs for HTTP requests. I typically use Qualys SSL labs to check my sites for proper SSL/TLS configuration, and I'm learning how to implement security headers for added protection.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm now working to improve my knowledge and proficiency with using Docker. I'm comfortable writing basic web applications and building containers using preexisting images (Redis, Python, etc) and deploying them. I'm also familiar with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). I'm building a static site, pushing it to Github and letting the service I use compile the repository during each new commit / push. I'm making a little headway with learning Go and Rust, since several positions I've been interested in require knowledge with Go. Rust is just a bonus since it's a fun language to work with. I'm not a *great* programmer by any means, I need a lot of practice.

&amp;nbsp;

Besides all of that, I'm comfortable using Compute Engine (Google Cloud Platform), and using EC2 (AWS). While I haven't done it many times, I know the importance and how to set up firewalls, create load balances, etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm an honest person, so I don't want to list anything on my resume that I'm not *extremely* competent with. I suppose I'm a bit afflicted by ""imposter syndrome"", even more so because I've never had an internship or worked in my field yet. However, the logical part of me is thinking that the only way to become confident with your skills is to work among others, learn from those with more experience, and gradually become more proficient.  

&amp;nbsp;

**My background:**
&amp;nbsp;

I'm a new graduate, about 3 months unemployed. I have a Masters and Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Computer Science. I've applied to 50+ positions, all met with rejection (about 5-10 so far) and the rest nothing. This tells me that my resume was either filtered or difficult to read. I've since revised my resume and I'm going for round two, but this time I want to actually get invited to a phone screen and make it to in-person interviews. "

The past week I joined the team working on a web-app and made some front-end features. Like getting the current date and time, format it a specific way and set that as in a input field. Not really difficult. But I just looked at the commit history from yesterday and saw that not only that code was commented out and completely rewritten, but almost all my code.  

It's pretty demotivating, really. I have more of a feeling that I hold the team back, than helping and improving the product. 
How do I tackle this feeling and how do I improve maybe my code, so I'll actually help?

52juca,48,2016-09-13,I started a consulting business (my first company) and turned over €84k in the first year. We’re now 3 in the team. Here’s a no-BS guide if you want to do the same (which requires REAL WORK).,gresquare,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/52juca/i_started_a_consulting_business_my_first_company/,"I haven’t written a blog post in more than a year. It’s been a busy year.

In one year, I went from a one-man show with €0 in revenue to a great team of 3 with €84k in revenue.

I have a newfound respect for you entrepreneurs. The people who have been doing this for years or decades.

A confession: Writing scares the shit out of me. I’m not afraid to speak in public (I love it). But writing does. It’s time to conquer this fear.

I wanted to write a letter to people who are in the same situation that I was in just before I left my job. I was miserable. I always wanted to do my own thing. Even my mom was saying that I should do something on my own. That I wasn’t made to receive orders.

[I’ve posted my progress here a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3dqfok/ive_started_my_own_business_as_a_marketing/). I used the questions you guys asked then to create this post.

This letter is for people who are struggling to get started. Who have this itch about doing their own thing. It’s also a letter for me. To realise how much I’ve done and what I’ve become.

It makes me sad to see all those startup events or free entrepreneur meetups. I don’t know about where you are, but in Dublin you’ll see always the same people. They never seem to make any progress.

It’s fake work.

This letter is for you. The wantrepreneur. The guy who always thinks and never does.

#First, here’s some context

Born in 1988. Great childhood.

**2003:**

I went to a good high school in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

**2006:**

I studied hard the last year to go to a school of engineering in France (so I could build wind turbines). But I didn’t get in.
I went to another school of engineering in 2006 to 2009.

**2008:**

Went to Kansas for a year as part of an exchange program. I saw another side of the World. I realised how lucky I was.

**2009:**

I was lost. I decided that marketing and business was much more interesting to me than mechanical engineering and found a business school that would take me.
I did a Bachelor Degree back in my hometown for a year.

**2010:**

I had to find an internship abroad. With the little bit of experience in mechanical engineering and my good english, I landed in Dublin.
As an intern, I was a prick. I was still very unsure about my future and myself.
I didn’t want to go back to France so I pushed hard to be hired. I found a weakness in the way the company was reporting data. I proposed to my boss to take care of it. He agreed.

**2011:**

I got a contract job in Dublin on something I barely understood. They gave me some budget and I managed to get a solution off the ground.
I thought hard about my future one weekend, and somehow I connected the dots. I always have been fascinated by the internet. I always had a computer in my room. The sound of my first 56k modem was a delight to my ears.

Marketing was also something I liked. But not the bullshit marketing. Not the shitty ads. What I really liked was trying to understand people. The psychology. How do people think? Why do they behave this way?
So I started a blog about entrepreneurship and marketing (in French). I spent my evenings (and days) on Twitter, connecting with people and I wrote a few blog posts. They were mostly research from reading books. They weren’t really me.

**2012:**

I managed to land a permanent full-time job with the same company. I replaced my boss who was leaving. For the first time in my life, I had a very decent salary (around €28,000 a year). I also had a company car.

It’s an important year. This is when I met Jen. She changed my life. She really did. She put me back in touch with my family. I got closer to my siblings and parents thanks to her. And it gave me confidence. Confidence that I could do whatever the fuck I wanted.
I earned a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing.

**2013:**

I found a job in the industry I wanted - a job with a mobile marketing company. I put everything I had in this business for almost 2 years. I learned so much about marketing and sales. I was involved in everything. The problem was: I learned by myself.
The product we were selling wasn’t good and customers didn’t want to pay for it. I was involved in business development at the end and I thought I was a bad salesperson. Turned out I wasn’t. The product just wasn’t good enough.

I also started to attend a few Startup Weekends. At the time I didn’t know much about the startup scene. Going to those events made me realise that it wasn’t that difficult to launch something. I just had to stop finding excuses.
I started a few side projects here and there but none of them were truly interesting to me. I just gave up very quickly.

**2014:**

I started to work on yet another project in December 2014, while I was still working full-time. I got the idea at a conference I was attending.
I started to blog about it. I was planning to help eCommerce retailers to retain their customers with smart emails.

**2015:**

The idea wasn’t better than the previous ones. But this time I decided to go for it and stop finding excuses. I had €20,000 in savings and just said “fuck it”. I left my job.

I felt it was the only way for me to actually do it. To be in front of a cliff and jump. I had to build a plane on the way down. Going back to work for something I didn’t believe in wasn’t an option.
The idea moved from a product to consulting. I didn’t want to raise money and I had to make money. I even got some financial help from the state for a few weeks to avoid making a big dent in my savings.

**Today:**

[We are a team of three, working remotely](slicesconsulting.com). Serina is based in Seattle. Marco is based in Barcelona. I’m based in Dublin.
We help companies make their website better so they can sell more.

##I’m lucky

I’m white, straight, living in Europe. I’ve never experienced discrimination. I’ve never experienced poverty. I’m well educated. I have a fiancée. Siblings I love more than anything. Parents who love me. Good friends.

I know that some of you have a way tougher life than me. Use it at your advantage. What you’re going through will probably help you to be tougher than most.

#Let's start

[Here's my desk \(in my living-room\) when I started.](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Desk.001-1024x576.jpeg)

This is what I would have liked to read before I got started. This is a letter to you if you always wanted to create a business but never did. Or if you feel like the business is going nowhere.

There are no hacks and no easy way to achieve this, so if you’re looking for a quick way to make money without working for it this guide is not for you.

##Your vision board

Before starting anything you need to know why you’re doing it. Why exactly do you want to have a business? To do it because it’s trendy? To follow your inspiration? To be able to be “your own boss”? Dig deeper.

“Why?” is the most important question. It took me a while to realise what was my “Why?”. I had to dig deeper than “having enough money to live”.

I’m lucky to have a lot of siblings that I love very much (my parents got remarried). I’m based in Ireland and they are in France. My first objective was to be able to visit them as many times as I wanted, without being wary of money or time off work.

My second objective was to live a happy life with my soon-to-be wife. To be able to take time off when I wanted to and travelling. To be able to afford a nice house, and a nice car.

In one word: Freedom. I wanted my freedom back.

##What are you fighting for or against?

Your vision for yourself is slightly different from the fight you should pick up.

Many people start with a business model or an idea. I believe that you should start with a fight.

Whatever your industry and what you want to do, what are you fighting against? What pisses you off the most? What do you want to change?

I’ve never liked bullshit. I’m a straight-forward person. I’ve been involved in marketing for while, and its bullshit always pissed me off.

A few examples:

* Internet is polluted with popups, clickbait articles (“You won’t believe what happened next!”), or spammy, irrelevant, content.
* Some companies lie and manipulate people to make money. Think about [Enron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016268/) or, at a smaller scale, all of those brands with lock-in contracts, fine print, etc…
* Most businesses focus on short-term gains rather than making an impact. Shareholder capitalism isn’t working, let’s face it. [“The harder a CEO is pushed to increase shareholder value, the more the CEO will be tempted to make moves that actually hurt the shareholders.”](https://hbr.org/2010/01/the-age-of-customer-capitalism)
* What’s your fight?

##How much do you have in the bank?

Do you have enough money to run for 6 months without any revenue? This is the question you need to ask yourself.

I burnt through €10,000 in 6 months without overspending at all. Just surviving with rent, food, and some entertainment. If you don’t have any savings, keep your job and put some money aside.

If you’re lucky enough to be able to come back to your parents’ house, do it.

Work during evenings and weekends but don’t quit your job.

##Where are you going to work from?

I worked from my living room for a few months. I was on my own for most of the day.

If you have the luxury to be able to work from home, do it. Do it until you get your first paying customers.

Working from home got to me sometimes. It is tough not to have many human interactions. Even being surrounded by people you don’t know feels better than being alone.

I was able to move to a co-working space after a few months. My productivity went up.

##Support system

Who can you talk to when you’ll feel down? Yes, you will like shit some days. You need to be able to talk to someone.

My dad, my siblings and my fiancée have always been very supportive. I know that I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them.

Mental health is really important if you want to make money. It won’t happen overnight. You need to rely on other people.

You might feel isolated even with a support system. It is difficult for people to know what you’re going through if they’re not going through it themselves.

##Customer development

You just can’t come with a good idea if you don’t talk to people. Talk to people.

People won’t steal your ideas. They don’t care. They have other stuff to do.

I’ve used the book [The Four Steps to the Epiphany](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426213&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=four+steps+to+the+epiphany) (by Steve Blank) a lot and you should, too.

Other good books I recommend :

* [The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development](https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Guide-Customer-Development-Epiphany/dp/0982743602) (by Brant Cooper).
* [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426190&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lean+startup) (by Eric Ries).
Problem(s) you’re solving

Don’t focus on what you do. Focus on the problems you’re solving. Look for the struggle. What prevent people from doing what they would like to do?

Let’s say your original idea is to launch a cake shop. What are the potential problems for your potential customers?

They need to get a cake for a special occasion, but:

* they don’t have time to make it,
* they don’t know how to bake.
Validate that with people. Ask them about their problems. Make them talk.

##Solution you’re providing

Once you’ve identified problems, you can look for a solution. Don’t think in term of services or features. You’ll start to copy what’s around instead of coming up with your own stuffs.

Isolate each problem and focus on its solution.

* Problem 1: They don’t have time to bake one.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes right now, without having to wait.

And:

* Problem 2: They don’t know how to bake.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes without having to bake.
* Another solution: A series of courses where people could learn how to bake themselves.

#Understand if your problem is painful enough

Your job is then to understand if the problem you’re solving is painful enough. If your problem is not painful, people won’t look for a solution. They won’t pay for it either.

If your problem is painful enough but your solution is bad, they won’t pay for it either.

Here’s how I went about it:

##List all the people you know

Create a new Google Spreadsheet and start typing the names of all the people you know:

[Your contact list could look like this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

Don’t list only the people that you know related to what you’re planning to do.

List everyone. Your uncle who lives on the other side of the World, your friends from high school, everybody.

Make sure to look at your email contacts, social network contacts, “real life” connections, so you don’t forget anyone.

Add a way to get in touch with each of them: their email, their phone number, their postal address, etc…

[Here’s an example on Google Sheets that you can view and copy.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

##Contact them one by one

Then contact them one by one.

In three sentences, tell them about:

* Who you are
* How you’ve met
* What you’re planning to do

Then ask them for one favour: an introduction.

You should ask them to introduce you to people you want to talk to: potential customers.

You want to learn from them. About their day-to-day, their problems, the current solutions they’re using, etc…

Make it clear that you’re not trying to sell anything. Think about yourself as a researcher, not a sales person. You want to learn.

##Follow-up like a mofo

People don’t care about you. Even your own uncle doesn’t care. They have other things to do. You can’t blame them for that.

That’s why you need to follow-up. If you don’t get an answer after the first contact, get in touch again.

Once every week should be enough.

You wouldn’t believe the number of times I had to contact people before I got an answer. Don’t give up.

Add a few columns on the right of your contacts. Every time you get in touch with someone, enter the date.

##People don’t care about you

Did I say you should follow-up?

If it was easy, everybody would do it. Most people give up after one try. Don’t be like this. Keep going until you hear something back.

Vary the ways you get in touch with them: two emails, one call, one tweet, one message on LinkedIn, two emails…

##Questions

Your objective is to learn. To validate what you thought was a good idea. Your initial idea will change, I can guarantee it. Don’t fall in love with it. Fall in love with the problem(s) you’re solving.

When talking to people, ask the right questions. [This post](http://mfishbein.com/the-ultimate-list-of-customer-development-questions/) from [Mick Fishbein](http://mfishbein.com/) is a goldmine.

If you’re on your own, record the conversation. Take notes. You will forget key insights after a few minutes if you don’t.

I used Google Docs to record my notes in the past. You can use Evernote, pen and paper, whatever you want.

Just make the calls. Send those emails.

Do it.

#Refine

After talking to a few people you WILL learn a lot. Chances are, the solution you were thinking about has already changed.

That’s good.

Don’t try to convince people that your idea is the best one. Just listen.

Refine your business model.

Update your problems and solutions.

##Niche

Ah, finding your niche. How many times have I read this about Internet marketing? Too many to count.

Don’t be stressed about it. You don’t have to find a niche right now. Just talk to people. Refine your idea.

It took me months to find “a niche”, and even know I feel that we’re still tackling too many problems at once.

I’ve started trying to sell a solution for eCommerce to retain their customers. By talking to my first people I ended up focusing on conversion (making website visitors do what I wanted them to do) rather than retention (making them come back). I switched from a product to consulting.

I can’t tell you what will happen to you. What I can tell you though is to look for patterns. Follow your guts and say no.

There are three good ways to start:

* Focus on one industry, solve many problems with many services. For example, marketing consulting for the pharmaceutical industry.
* Focus on many industries, solve one problem with one solution. For example, Trello. It’s a tool that help you get organised. Whatever you do, whoever you are.
* Focus one industry, solve one problem with one solution. For example, [Winterhalter](http://www.winterhalter.biz/), selling dishwashers for hotels and restaurants. Inspired by [this post](https://nothingventured.rocks/lessons-on-the-art-of-specialisation-from-the-dishwasher-market-67384f6693ba#.6hdpclp1p) from my friend [Connor Keppel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connorkeppel).

#First clients

Many people talk about starting a startup. They think that creating a startup means creating a product in 6 months with money that isn’t yours, sell that a year later for $100M, and get rich.

If it’s your first business, take it slow. Fall in love with the problems you’re solving. Start with a very simple solution.

A solution that doesn’t require €100,000 in investment to get off the ground. A solution that you can tweak and change as you please. A solution that you can start from your home, with a laptop and a lot of grit.

I believe that freelancing or consulting is the easiest way to go about making money.

You will be able to learn from your clients, change your offerings very fast, pay yourself, and build the foundation to create products in the future.

I started by trying to talk to eCommerce companies only. I then moved to any businesses selling products or services online.

My very first client was somebody I already knew (I was lecturing a bit at his college). He was paying me €500 a month.

The second client was a referral from somebody I knew. I worked as a consultant with them for 3 months to bridge the gap between their digital agency and their team. They were paying me around €2,000 a month.

The third client came from a referral from my accountant. They were paying me €1,200 a month.

Do you start to see a trend?

My first clients came from my network. From more than 300 people I contacted, people started to refer me.

We got 23 interesting leads in one year and closed more than half of them. Services varied from a 30-minute training session to large retainers.

Here’s the breakdown:

* 9 leads came from speaking at events.
* 8 came from referrals.
* 4 from cold emails.
* 2 from networking events.

As you can see, the vast majority of clients came from speaking (more on that later) and referrals.

##Bull’s eye

Many founders try to do everything at once. You HAVE to focus on one or two channels to get your first clients.

There are 19 in total. I refer to the book Traction for that (by Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, and Justin Mares)

As a solopreneur, you simply can’t focus on more than two. I would advise you to focus on contacting your network and get referred.

Don’t waste money and time on Facebook Ads or SEO when you’re starting. Sell directly. Talk to people.

Yes, it’s not easy. Some people will say no. Some people won’t have time to talk to you. But you have to do what others don’t want to do.

I also managed to get clients from speaking, at a later stage. I spoke at a few events in my last full-time job and I liked it. I actually paid to speak at a big marketing event in Dublin (that deserves its own article). [Here's me speaking at my first ""big"" event last year. Notice the beautiful pink shirt](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/8dd04a558c7d8b52a7328bd0466c734a-768x1024.jpg)...

##Routine

Set up a routine. This is so important.

I wake up every week day at 6.45am, go to work at 8am, and leave at around 5pm most days. I cycle to work. I eat a healthy breakfast (2 eggs, porridge, fruits).

This is a marathon, not a sprint. You will be full of energy at the start. Don’t burn it. Eat well, sleep well.

I remember reading this advice before I started. I found it to be over the top. It isn’t. Your brain is your most important asset. If you feel tired, you won’t be productive. If you’re not productive, your morale will be low. If your morale is low, you won’t achieve much.

Are you ready to keep up this routine for years? I’ve been doing this for more than a year. Every week day.

Some entrepreneurs have been doing this for decades. This is what it takes.

Reflect about your business every month. Think about its strategy. Read the book [Good Strategy / Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239) by Richard Rumelt. Here’s a free [video version of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrTl16hZdk). I also used the [SOSTAC Framework](http://prsmith.org/sostac/) for that.

Write a weekly todo list and a daily todo list.

##Say no

That’s also something I used to hear a lot. You have to say no more often than yes.

Focus on the problem you’re solving and the battle you’re fighting. Those two things shouldn’t change much.

However, be flexible when it comes to the solution you’re offering.

If you help companies to get more traffic to their site, don’t start offering web design services. Focus on one problem at a time.

Don’t be afraid to say no.

#Evolving

By then, you should have one or two paying clients. They will most likely friends of friends. This is great. They trust you because they know you.

Others won’t trust you just yet. Once you’re making a bit of money, you can start focusing on your business.

Those actions are from the book [Get Clients Now](http://getclientsnow.com/) that I found quite helpful at the start.

It makes you focus on what’s important.

##Description of services

This is what you do and how you do it. You should have a clearer idea of the services you offer once you’ve started working with a few clients.

##Website

Some of your clients might start referring you to others. This is when you can invest in a simple website. It won’t be perfect, don’t spend too much time on this.

Buy a domain name. Build the website using Wordpress.com, Squarespace, or Wordpress.org if you’re comfortable with it.

##Brand name

We haven’t talked about your brand name yet. It’s because it doesn’t matter.

If you’re planning to be a solopreneur, your own name would do just fine. If you’re planning to create a company and hire people, think about a name.

I came up with Slices in less than an hour. I took the idea of “slicing and dicing data”, looked at domains available, and picked one. It’s not perfect but nobody ever told me that they didn’t want to work with us because of our name.

You can always change name as you grow. Most of the time, spending weeks on picking the perfect name is just fake work.

It’s an excuse to avoid doing real work (making money).

[This article](http://joel.is/how-to-name-your-startup/) from [Joel Cascoigne](http://joel.is/), co-founder of Buffer, is great.

#Closing

Closing clients is tough. I always have this adrenaline rush just before I send a proposal.

Learn not to be afraid of it.

##Personalised proposal

We use a specific template for our proposals. They are not the prettiest but they are simple to understand. They are also focused on the client, not on us.

I recommend you to read [those posts](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/category/proposals/) from [Brennan Dunn](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/about/) about writing proposals.

We’ve tweaked it a bit, but the idea remains the same:

###Situation

In this part you should answer the following questions: Who’s the client? What problems and challenges are they facing?

###Tomorrow

What does your client want to achieve by using your services? Does she want to increase sales by 20%? Get more visitors on their site?

The more specific the better. Before sending a proposal, make sure that you know this information.

Make them talk.

###How to get there

This is where you present your solution as way to solve their challenges and reach their objectives.

You can get more specific about exactly what you’re offering.

###Investment

How much is it going to cost? Always a burning question. This is where you can answer it.

##Pricing

Compare your cost with the the benefits you’re providing: time savings, revenue growth, etc…

We price our services monthly or sometimes weekly. We never talk about the number of hours we’re planning to spend on a project. This shouldn’t be relevant to a client if you provide value.

Always quote more than what you’re comfortable with. €5,000 might seem like a lot to you. It might seem very little for your client.

Don’t be afraid to negotiate. This is the good part. It means that your prospect is interested.

Don’t bend under pressure. Keep focusing on value.

##Competition

If you’re able to extract the value you’re providing for clients, you’ve almost made it.

This is why competition becomes irrelevant at this point. It’s not about being the cheapest. It’s about delivering value.

Don’t be obsessed with your competition. It’s a good thing. Get interested only if you lose many proposals from the same competitor.

#Growing

At this stage you should have a few customers. You might barely break even. But who cares? You’re not under pressure to give money back to investors.

I’m planning to write more about the next part of our journey: how we grow, how we hire, how we organise ourselves, etc…

A few things to remember when you’re at this stage:

##Brain

Take care of your brain: exercise, eat well, talk to your friends, go see your family, spend time with your partner.

##Stay lean

Who cares if you don’t have an office or business cards? Be yourself, don’t follow conventions.

##Cashflow

Cashflow is king. At the start what matters is the amount of money you have available in your account. Don’t worry too much about making profits. You can tweak that later.

Track this daily.

##Fire yourself

Hire people smarter than you and fire yourself from each position. This is the key if you want to grow.

I recommend you to read [The E-Myth Revisited](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280) by [Michael Gerber](https://www.google.ie/search?q=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;oq=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).

*Damn. It feels good to finally finish and publish an article.*

#TL;DR

* I went from €0 to €84k by contacting my network and speaking at events. There was no silver bullet. It was painful (and it still is).
* I had €20k in savings and burnt half of it in a few months. I didn't take any loan and own 100% of the company.
* I believe that consulting is the best way to start as a first-time entrepreneur. Build products later.
* Work hard, don’t give up, focus on a few things.
* Pick a vision and a fight.
* Talk to people. Follow-up like a modafucka.
* Avoid fake work.
* Sell value.

#What to do next

* Ask me any questions here or via DM. I'll take the time to reply!
* Get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LouisSlices) or [Linkedin](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/louisgrenier), I don't bite!

My question is will it be a good idea to mention upcoming winter internship in the resume I'll be sending out for the Summers?"
52jx8t,18,2016-09-13,When are you no longer entry level?,rofl_falafel,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52jx8t/when_are_you_no_longer_entry_level/,"Obviously title, but I will be more specific in regard to my particular situation.

I didn't really follow the normal life script.  I dropped out of high school at 16 and did a crappy typesetting job for a print shop (think pagemaker and illustrator).  Then I started working for an ISP around 18.  The job was initially just basic internet phone support type stuff, connectivity, email, etc.  Over the course of the job I became a kind of RF guru for this particular brand of radio we used, wrote the training manuals for the in house people on this gear, etc.  That slowly morphed into a kind of junior admin position where I'd fix stuff on AP's (hardware, configuration, rat's nests of wiring jobs).  All of the responsibilities and none of the titles!  Getting tired of being a peon, maybe I should go to college?  Start taking dick around classes at local CC...

Get let go from ISP as part of buyout after 4.5 years there -&gt; maybe I'll take this college thing seriously.  I don't want to be asking people to reboot PoE's for the rest of my life.  Most of the jobs I envision myself doing all require a degree, so ok, college.  Everyone says CS has the most broad appeal, so lets give that a try...  -&gt;  WHY MATH, WHY!?

After a few semesters of not sucking at college + job at ISP ending, parents agree to pay for education if I do general IT for my dad's company (just him really, contractor).  He is in engineering, but TOTALLY unrelated to technology or anything that I do really, I just make shit work when he needs it to.  Don't do any internships (BIG MISTAKE) but couldn't really get any callbacks when I did desperately apply my last year either (software, not IT).

Now graduated BS CS, minor in stats; magna + AS from CC + some certificate that I got from CC for taking CCNA 1-4 but never took the Cisco cert test.  Oh and I did some windows admin stuff as an elective my last year.  70-410 of MCSA I think?  We did stuff like setting up server roles, domain controllers, active directory, intro to powershell, stuff like that.

Since I've graduated I've been working with a lab on campus to facilitate the way they analyze some data.  In a nutshell, I built the hardware and software for them to perform analyses on the web instead of from a command line.  And I mean built like, I built the machine it is running on, I set up the OS (Fedora), configuration, dydns for temp domain name, I installed all the associated tools and libraries, I did a significant portion of the software (writing code, html, etc.) as well as day-to-day admin of the box itself, user accounts, ftp access for faculty, etc.

So here is my problem: I think I hate software development.  At least, I hate the software interview.  Yes I have implemented BST's and red-black trees.  No, I don't remember how to implement them off the top of my head to solve some pointless exercise on a whiteboard so you can tell me how easy it is and how someone with my GPA shouldn't have this much trouble (thanks generic big software house).  If I needed a complex data structure or algo, I'd google that shit and call a library.  Don't reinvent the wheel, etc.

So needless to say, I have been failing miserably at software interviews despite my attempts to do better.  People seem flabbergasted this is an issue for me, as my GPA was north of 3.5.  I've done the CScareerquestions things, CTCI, leetcode, all that crap.  I just don't solve these DS/algo problems in 60 minutes, and it's not gonna happen, ever.  It takes me days of thinking, analyzing, reading, playing with code, etc.

So I've been thinking about not doing software and going back to my IT like beginnings.  I look at IT jobs and I wonder what the hell I am actually qualified to do.  I don't even know what I want to do either.  DevOps type stuff or networking are my strengths I'd guess, I don't even know where to start.  I just know that I don't want to be answering phones all day again or doing software interviews.  Please help.

Well that was long and rambling.  Please ask questions or yell at me or whatever it is you guys and gals do in these parts.  Thanks for reading.


**tl;dr**

A CS degree does not a software developer make.  Am I qualified to do something like Network Engineering or SysAdmin, DevOps, etc. with the experience I have?  Or is it back to square one and entry level if I go back to IT type roles?  "

I'm currently interning for a company in their cyber security division as a student employee with background in computer science and technical writing. My job tasks mostly consist of helping them create documentation for new software and policies they are implementing.

I've worked with their security scanner, their firewall(read only), created Infopath request forms that users will be submitting for policies and I've created documents that the sysadmins are using as a reference for certain softwares. I've also helped them compare their GPO settings to Microsoft's recommended settings.

 I'm currently working on documenting the process for managing Lieberman so that employees can escalate their privileges on their local machine for a short while (I'm not actually implementing it, but through documenting the process I'll get a general feel for it).

I feel like this is all great work, and it's not so much of sysadmin work (aside from the documentation process), but the realm of cyber security and infosec greatly interests me. Besides continuing to work the internship through graduation, what are some other things I can do to increase my chances of landing a great job right out of college? 

I have the feeling that the company I'm working for will opt to hire me if I continue to do quality work, but if that doesn't happen I want to be prepared to look elsewhere.

52lbgy,8,2016-09-13,Suggestions for my IT Career Path?,Fauxfroyo,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52lbgy/suggestions_for_my_it_career_path/,"

Hello everyone. I got a suggestion to post here asking for tips on my IT career path, and I'd love to hear anyone's advice or comments on my situation.

I am a 24 y/o woman working full time as a clerk typist for my county's DHS. I'm currently enrolled at my local community college's Computer Networking Technology 2 year associates degree program. Ideally, I'd complete this program, then get apply for a civil service position providing help desk support for state employees. I'd continue working full time and going to school full time, then to complete my bachelor's degree online through either Western Governor's University or Penn State World Campus. Then I could continue in civil service and work my way up there, or apply to other jobs elsewhere in private companies.

As for the rest of my work history, I've worked for the county as a clerk typist since April of this year, and before that I worked for the state as a temp clerk typist from Sept 2015 to April 2016. Before that, I worked part time then full time at a small business video game store from 2011-2015. I delayed going to school and stayed at that job for so long due to mental health reasons, which I have since made considerable progress on (especially in the past year). I currently have no certifications or experience in IT. Literally all I have at this point is an interest in computers and technology, and a genuine enjoyment of providing good customer service. Any suggestions on what I should study, where I should look for jobs or internships, and what fields to apply in are greatly appreciated. If it helps, I'm in the south central PA area, about an hour from both Harrisburg and Baltimore MD. Thanks so much!"
52ldbn,7,2016-09-13,I started a consulting business (my first company) and turned over €84k in the first year. We’re now 3 in the team. Here’s a no-BS guide if you want to do the same (which requires REAL WORK).,gresquare,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/52ldbn/i_started_a_consulting_business_my_first_company/,"I haven’t written a blog post in more than a year. It’s been a busy year.

In one year, I went from a one-man show with €0 in revenue to a great team of 3 with €84k in revenue.

I have a newfound respect for you entrepreneurs. The people who have been doing this for years or decades.

A confession: Writing scares the shit out of me. I’m not afraid to speak in public (I love it). But writing does. It’s time to conquer this fear.

I wanted to write a letter to people who are in the same situation that I was in just before I left my job. I was miserable. I always wanted to do my own thing. Even my mom was saying that I should do something on my own. That I wasn’t made to receive orders.

[I’ve posted my progress here a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3dqfok/ive_started_my_own_business_as_a_marketing/). I used the questions you guys asked then to create this post.

This letter is for people who are struggling to get started. Who have this itch about doing their own thing. It’s also a letter for me. To realise how much I’ve done and what I’ve become.

It makes me sad to see all those startup events or free entrepreneur meetups. I don’t know about where you are, but in Dublin you’ll see always the same people. They never seem to make any progress.

It’s fake work.

This letter is for you. The wantrepreneur. The guy who always thinks and never does.

#First, here’s some context

Born in 1988. Great childhood.

**2003:**

I went to a good high school in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

**2006:**

I studied hard the last year to go to a school of engineering in France (so I could build wind turbines). But I didn’t get in.
I went to another school of engineering in 2006 to 2009.

**2008:**

Went to Kansas for a year as part of an exchange program. I saw another side of the World. I realised how lucky I was.

**2009:**

I was lost. I decided that marketing and business was much more interesting to me than mechanical engineering and found a business school that would take me.
I did a Bachelor Degree back in my hometown for a year.

**2010:**

I had to find an internship abroad. With the little bit of experience in mechanical engineering and my good english, I landed in Dublin.
As an intern, I was a prick. I was still very unsure about my future and myself.
I didn’t want to go back to France so I pushed hard to be hired. I found a weakness in the way the company was reporting data. I proposed to my boss to take care of it. He agreed.

**2011:**

I got a contract job in Dublin on something I barely understood. They gave me some budget and I managed to get a solution off the ground.
I thought hard about my future one weekend, and somehow I connected the dots. I always have been fascinated by the internet. I always had a computer in my room. The sound of my first 56k modem was a delight to my ears.

Marketing was also something I liked. But not the bullshit marketing. Not the shitty ads. What I really liked was trying to understand people. The psychology. How do people think? Why do they behave this way?
So I started a blog about entrepreneurship and marketing (in French). I spent my evenings (and days) on Twitter, connecting with people and I wrote a few blog posts. They were mostly research from reading books. They weren’t really me.

**2012:**

I managed to land a permanent full-time job with the same company. I replaced my boss who was leaving. For the first time in my life, I had a very decent salary (around €28,000 a year). I also had a company car.

It’s an important year. This is when I met Jen. She changed my life. She really did. She put me back in touch with my family. I got closer to my siblings and parents thanks to her. And it gave me confidence. Confidence that I could do whatever the fuck I wanted.
I earned a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing.

**2013:**

I found a job in the industry I wanted - a job with a mobile marketing company. I put everything I had in this business for almost 2 years. I learned so much about marketing and sales. I was involved in everything. The problem was: I learned by myself.
The product we were selling wasn’t good and customers didn’t want to pay for it. I was involved in business development at the end and I thought I was a bad salesperson. Turned out I wasn’t. The product just wasn’t good enough.

I also started to attend a few Startup Weekends. At the time I didn’t know much about the startup scene. Going to those events made me realise that it wasn’t that difficult to launch something. I just had to stop finding excuses.
I started a few side projects here and there but none of them were truly interesting to me. I just gave up very quickly.

**2014:**

I started to work on yet another project in December 2014, while I was still working full-time. I got the idea at a conference I was attending.
I started to blog about it. I was planning to help eCommerce retailers to retain their customers with smart emails.

**2015:**

The idea wasn’t better than the previous ones. But this time I decided to go for it and stop finding excuses. I had €20,000 in savings and just said “fuck it”. I left my job.

I felt it was the only way for me to actually do it. To be in front of a cliff and jump. I had to build a plane on the way down. Going back to work for something I didn’t believe in wasn’t an option.
The idea moved from a product to consulting. I didn’t want to raise money and I had to make money. I even got some financial help from the state for a few weeks to avoid making a big dent in my savings.

**Today:**

[We are a team of three, working remotely](slicesconsulting.com). Serina is based in Seattle. Marco is based in Barcelona. I’m based in Dublin.
We help companies make their website better so they can sell more.

##I’m lucky

I’m white, straight, living in Europe. I’ve never experienced discrimination. I’ve never experienced poverty. I’m well educated. I have a fiancée. Siblings I love more than anything. Parents who love me. Good friends.

I know that some of you have a way tougher life than me. Use it at your advantage. What you’re going through will probably help you to be tougher than most.

#Let's start

[Here's my desk \(in my living-room\) when I started.](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Desk.001-1024x576.jpeg)

This is what I would have liked to read before I got started. This is a letter to you if you always wanted to create a business but never did. Or if you feel like the business is going nowhere.

There are no hacks and no easy way to achieve this, so if you’re looking for a quick way to make money without working for it this guide is not for you.

##Your vision board

Before starting anything you need to know why you’re doing it. Why exactly do you want to have a business? To do it because it’s trendy? To follow your inspiration? To be able to be “your own boss”? Dig deeper.

“Why?” is the most important question. It took me a while to realise what was my “Why?”. I had to dig deeper than “having enough money to live”.

I’m lucky to have a lot of siblings that I love very much (my parents got remarried). I’m based in Ireland and they are in France. My first objective was to be able to visit them as many times as I wanted, without being wary of money or time off work.

My second objective was to live a happy life with my soon-to-be wife. To be able to take time off when I wanted to and travelling. To be able to afford a nice house, and a nice car.

In one word: Freedom. I wanted my freedom back.

##What are you fighting for or against?

Your vision for yourself is slightly different from the fight you should pick up.

Many people start with a business model or an idea. I believe that you should start with a fight.

Whatever your industry and what you want to do, what are you fighting against? What pisses you off the most? What do you want to change?

I’ve never liked bullshit. I’m a straight-forward person. I’ve been involved in marketing for while, and its bullshit always pissed me off.

A few examples:

* Internet is polluted with popups, clickbait articles (“You won’t believe what happened next!”), or spammy, irrelevant, content.
* Some companies lie and manipulate people to make money. Think about [Enron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016268/) or, at a smaller scale, all of those brands with lock-in contracts, fine print, etc…
* Most businesses focus on short-term gains rather than making an impact. Shareholder capitalism isn’t working, let’s face it. [“The harder a CEO is pushed to increase shareholder value, the more the CEO will be tempted to make moves that actually hurt the shareholders.”](https://hbr.org/2010/01/the-age-of-customer-capitalism)
* What’s your fight?

##How much do you have in the bank?

Do you have enough money to run for 6 months without any revenue? This is the question you need to ask yourself.

I burnt through €10,000 in 6 months without overspending at all. Just surviving with rent, food, and some entertainment. If you don’t have any savings, keep your job and put some money aside.

If you’re lucky enough to be able to come back to your parents’ house, do it.

Work during evenings and weekends but don’t quit your job.

##Where are you going to work from?

I worked from my living room for a few months. I was on my own for most of the day.

If you have the luxury to be able to work from home, do it. Do it until you get your first paying customers.

Working from home got to me sometimes. It is tough not to have many human interactions. Even being surrounded by people you don’t know feels better than being alone.

I was able to move to a co-working space after a few months. My productivity went up.

##Support system

Who can you talk to when you’ll feel down? Yes, you will like shit some days. You need to be able to talk to someone.

My dad, my siblings and my fiancée have always been very supportive. I know that I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them.

Mental health is really important if you want to make money. It won’t happen overnight. You need to rely on other people.

You might feel isolated even with a support system. It is difficult for people to know what you’re going through if they’re not going through it themselves.

##Customer development

You just can’t come with a good idea if you don’t talk to people. Talk to people.

People won’t steal your ideas. They don’t care. They have other stuff to do.

I’ve used the book [The Four Steps to the Epiphany](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426213&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=four+steps+to+the+epiphany) (by Steve Blank) a lot and you should, too.

Other good books I recommend :

* [The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development](https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Guide-Customer-Development-Epiphany/dp/0982743602) (by Brant Cooper).
* [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426190&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lean+startup) (by Eric Ries).
Problem(s) you’re solving

Don’t focus on what you do. Focus on the problems you’re solving. Look for the struggle. What prevent people from doing what they would like to do?

Let’s say your original idea is to launch a cake shop. What are the potential problems for your potential customers?

They need to get a cake for a special occasion, but:

* they don’t have time to make it,
* they don’t know how to bake.
Validate that with people. Ask them about their problems. Make them talk.

##Solution you’re providing

Once you’ve identified problems, you can look for a solution. Don’t think in term of services or features. You’ll start to copy what’s around instead of coming up with your own stuffs.

Isolate each problem and focus on its solution.

* Problem 1: They don’t have time to bake one.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes right now, without having to wait.

And:

* Problem 2: They don’t know how to bake.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes without having to bake.
* Another solution: A series of courses where people could learn how to bake themselves.

#Understand if your problem is painful enough

Your job is then to understand if the problem you’re solving is painful enough. If your problem is not painful, people won’t look for a solution. They won’t pay for it either.

If your problem is painful enough but your solution is bad, they won’t pay for it either.

Here’s how I went about it:

##List all the people you know

Create a new Google Spreadsheet and start typing the names of all the people you know:

[Your contact list could look like this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

Don’t list only the people that you know related to what you’re planning to do.

List everyone. Your uncle who lives on the other side of the World, your friends from high school, everybody.

Make sure to look at your email contacts, social network contacts, “real life” connections, so you don’t forget anyone.

Add a way to get in touch with each of them: their email, their phone number, their postal address, etc…

[Here’s an example on Google Sheets that you can view and copy.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

##Contact them one by one

Then contact them one by one.

In three sentences, tell them about:

* Who you are
* How you’ve met
* What you’re planning to do

Then ask them for one favour: an introduction.

You should ask them to introduce you to people you want to talk to: potential customers.

You want to learn from them. About their day-to-day, their problems, the current solutions they’re using, etc…

Make it clear that you’re not trying to sell anything. Think about yourself as a researcher, not a sales person. You want to learn.

##Follow-up like a mofo

People don’t care about you. Even your own uncle doesn’t care. They have other things to do. You can’t blame them for that.

That’s why you need to follow-up. If you don’t get an answer after the first contact, get in touch again.

Once every week should be enough.

You wouldn’t believe the number of times I had to contact people before I got an answer. Don’t give up.

Add a few columns on the right of your contacts. Every time you get in touch with someone, enter the date.

##People don’t care about you

Did I say you should follow-up?

If it was easy, everybody would do it. Most people give up after one try. Don’t be like this. Keep going until you hear something back.

Vary the ways you get in touch with them: two emails, one call, one tweet, one message on LinkedIn, two emails…

##Questions

Your objective is to learn. To validate what you thought was a good idea. Your initial idea will change, I can guarantee it. Don’t fall in love with it. Fall in love with the problem(s) you’re solving.

When talking to people, ask the right questions. [This post](http://mfishbein.com/the-ultimate-list-of-customer-development-questions/) from [Mick Fishbein](http://mfishbein.com/) is a goldmine.

If you’re on your own, record the conversation. Take notes. You will forget key insights after a few minutes if you don’t.

I used Google Docs to record my notes in the past. You can use Evernote, pen and paper, whatever you want.

Just make the calls. Send those emails.

Do it.

#Refine

After talking to a few people you WILL learn a lot. Chances are, the solution you were thinking about has already changed.

That’s good.

Don’t try to convince people that your idea is the best one. Just listen.

Refine your business model.

Update your problems and solutions.

##Niche

Ah, finding your niche. How many times have I read this about Internet marketing? Too many to count.

Don’t be stressed about it. You don’t have to find a niche right now. Just talk to people. Refine your idea.

It took me months to find “a niche”, and even know I feel that we’re still tackling too many problems at once.

I’ve started trying to sell a solution for eCommerce to retain their customers. By talking to my first people I ended up focusing on conversion (making website visitors do what I wanted them to do) rather than retention (making them come back). I switched from a product to consulting.

I can’t tell you what will happen to you. What I can tell you though is to look for patterns. Follow your guts and say no.

There are three good ways to start:

* Focus on one industry, solve many problems with many services. For example, marketing consulting for the pharmaceutical industry.
* Focus on many industries, solve one problem with one solution. For example, Trello. It’s a tool that help you get organised. Whatever you do, whoever you are.
* Focus one industry, solve one problem with one solution. For example, [Winterhalter](http://www.winterhalter.biz/), selling dishwashers for hotels and restaurants. Inspired by [this post](https://nothingventured.rocks/lessons-on-the-art-of-specialisation-from-the-dishwasher-market-67384f6693ba#.6hdpclp1p) from my friend [Connor Keppel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connorkeppel).

#First clients

Many people talk about starting a startup. They think that creating a startup means creating a product in 6 months with money that isn’t yours, sell that a year later for $100M, and get rich.

If it’s your first business, take it slow. Fall in love with the problems you’re solving. Start with a very simple solution.

A solution that doesn’t require €100,000 in investment to get off the ground. A solution that you can tweak and change as you please. A solution that you can start from your home, with a laptop and a lot of grit.

I believe that freelancing or consulting is the easiest way to go about making money.

You will be able to learn from your clients, change your offerings very fast, pay yourself, and build the foundation to create products in the future.

I started by trying to talk to eCommerce companies only. I then moved to any businesses selling products or services online.

My very first client was somebody I already knew (I was lecturing a bit at his college). He was paying me €500 a month.

The second client was a referral from somebody I knew. I worked as a consultant with them for 3 months to bridge the gap between their digital agency and their team. They were paying me around €2,000 a month.

The third client came from a referral from my accountant. They were paying me €1,200 a month.

Do you start to see a trend?

My first clients came from my network. From more than 300 people I contacted, people started to refer me.

We got 23 interesting leads in one year and closed more than half of them. Services varied from a 30-minute training session to large retainers.

Here’s the breakdown:

* 9 leads came from speaking at events.
* 8 came from referrals.
* 4 from cold emails.
* 2 from networking events.

As you can see, the vast majority of clients came from speaking (more on that later) and referrals.

##Bull’s eye

Many founders try to do everything at once. You HAVE to focus on one or two channels to get your first clients.

There are 19 in total. I refer to the book Traction for that (by Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, and Justin Mares)

As a solopreneur, you simply can’t focus on more than two. I would advise you to focus on contacting your network and get referred.

Don’t waste money and time on Facebook Ads or SEO when you’re starting. Sell directly. Talk to people.

Yes, it’s not easy. Some people will say no. Some people won’t have time to talk to you. But you have to do what others don’t want to do.

I also managed to get clients from speaking, at a later stage. I spoke at a few events in my last full-time job and I liked it. I actually paid to speak at a big marketing event in Dublin (that deserves its own article). [Here's me speaking at my first ""big"" event last year. Notice the beautiful pink shirt](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/8dd04a558c7d8b52a7328bd0466c734a-768x1024.jpg)...

##Routine

Set up a routine. This is so important.

I wake up every week day at 6.45am, go to work at 8am, and leave at around 5pm most days. I cycle to work. I eat a healthy breakfast (2 eggs, porridge, fruits).

This is a marathon, not a sprint. You will be full of energy at the start. Don’t burn it. Eat well, sleep well.

I remember reading this advice before I started. I found it to be over the top. It isn’t. Your brain is your most important asset. If you feel tired, you won’t be productive. If you’re not productive, your morale will be low. If your morale is low, you won’t achieve much.

Are you ready to keep up this routine for years? I’ve been doing this for more than a year. Every week day.

Some entrepreneurs have been doing this for decades. This is what it takes.

Reflect about your business every month. Think about its strategy. Read the book [Good Strategy / Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239) by Richard Rumelt. Here’s a free [video version of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrTl16hZdk). I also used the [SOSTAC Framework](http://prsmith.org/sostac/) for that.

Write a weekly todo list and a daily todo list.

##Say no

That’s also something I used to hear a lot. You have to say no more often than yes.

Focus on the problem you’re solving and the battle you’re fighting. Those two things shouldn’t change much.

However, be flexible when it comes to the solution you’re offering.

If you help companies to get more traffic to their site, don’t start offering web design services. Focus on one problem at a time.

Don’t be afraid to say no.

#Evolving

By then, you should have one or two paying clients. They will most likely friends of friends. This is great. They trust you because they know you.

Others won’t trust you just yet. Once you’re making a bit of money, you can start focusing on your business.

Those actions are from the book [Get Clients Now](http://getclientsnow.com/) that I found quite helpful at the start.

It makes you focus on what’s important.

##Description of services

This is what you do and how you do it. You should have a clearer idea of the services you offer once you’ve started working with a few clients.

##Website

Some of your clients might start referring you to others. This is when you can invest in a simple website. It won’t be perfect, don’t spend too much time on this.

Buy a domain name. Build the website using Wordpress.com, Squarespace, or Wordpress.org if you’re comfortable with it.

##Brand name

We haven’t talked about your brand name yet. It’s because it doesn’t matter.

If you’re planning to be a solopreneur, your own name would do just fine. If you’re planning to create a company and hire people, think about a name.

I came up with Slices in less than an hour. I took the idea of “slicing and dicing data”, looked at domains available, and picked one. It’s not perfect but nobody ever told me that they didn’t want to work with us because of our name.

You can always change name as you grow. Most of the time, spending weeks on picking the perfect name is just fake work.

It’s an excuse to avoid doing real work (making money).

[This article](http://joel.is/how-to-name-your-startup/) from [Joel Cascoigne](http://joel.is/), co-founder of Buffer, is great.

#Closing

Closing clients is tough. I always have this adrenaline rush just before I send a proposal.

Learn not to be afraid of it.

##Personalised proposal

We use a specific template for our proposals. They are not the prettiest but they are simple to understand. They are also focused on the client, not on us.

I recommend you to read [those posts](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/category/proposals/) from [Brennan Dunn](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/about/) about writing proposals.

We’ve tweaked it a bit, but the idea remains the same:

###Situation

In this part you should answer the following questions: Who’s the client? What problems and challenges are they facing?

###Tomorrow

What does your client want to achieve by using your services? Does she want to increase sales by 20%? Get more visitors on their site?

The more specific the better. Before sending a proposal, make sure that you know this information.

Make them talk.

###How to get there

This is where you present your solution as way to solve their challenges and reach their objectives.

You can get more specific about exactly what you’re offering.

###Investment

How much is it going to cost? Always a burning question. This is where you can answer it.

##Pricing

Compare your cost with the the benefits you’re providing: time savings, revenue growth, etc…

We price our services monthly or sometimes weekly. We never talk about the number of hours we’re planning to spend on a project. This shouldn’t be relevant to a client if you provide value.

Always quote more than what you’re comfortable with. €5,000 might seem like a lot to you. It might seem very little for your client.

Don’t be afraid to negotiate. This is the good part. It means that your prospect is interested.

Don’t bend under pressure. Keep focusing on value.

##Competition

If you’re able to extract the value you’re providing for clients, you’ve almost made it.

This is why competition becomes irrelevant at this point. It’s not about being the cheapest. It’s about delivering value.

Don’t be obsessed with your competition. It’s a good thing. Get interested only if you lose many proposals from the same competitor.

#Growing

At this stage you should have a few customers. You might barely break even. But who cares? You’re not under pressure to give money back to investors.

I’m planning to write more about the next part of our journey: how we grow, how we hire, how we organise ourselves, etc…

A few things to remember when you’re at this stage:

##Brain

Take care of your brain: exercise, eat well, talk to your friends, go see your family, spend time with your partner.

##Stay lean

Who cares if you don’t have an office or business cards? Be yourself, don’t follow conventions.

##Cashflow

Cashflow is king. At the start what matters is the amount of money you have available in your account. Don’t worry too much about making profits. You can tweak that later.

Track this daily.

##Fire yourself

Hire people smarter than you and fire yourself from each position. This is the key if you want to grow.

I recommend you to read [The E-Myth Revisited](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280) by [Michael Gerber](https://www.google.ie/search?q=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;oq=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).

*Damn. It feels good to finally finish and publish an article.*

#TL;DR

* I went from €0 to €84k by contacting my network and speaking at events. There was no silver bullet. It was painful (and it still is).
* I had €20k in savings and burnt half of it in a few months. I didn't take any loan and own 100% of the company.
* I believe that consulting is the best way to start as a first-time entrepreneur. Build products later.
* Work hard, don’t give up, focus on a few things.
* Pick a vision and a fight.
* Talk to people. Follow-up like a modafucka.
* Avoid fake work.
* Sell value.

52ldnp,3,2016-09-13,Discouraged Easily,AlCapwn351,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/52ldnp/discouraged_easily/,"Hi there, I'm majoring in Software Engineering at my university and I want to make a personal project that I can use on my resume to get a summer internship. My problem is that every time I finally come up with an idea, I get easily discouraged from it after I sit down to get started. I have yet to complete a single project that is not homework.

For example; recently I decided that I want to make a battleship game in java. [Based of this board game](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/4/1333548711318/Battleship-board-game-001.jpg) But I get discouraged easily from completing it. I think the main problem is I don't know how to make the UI for it because I couldn't figure out how to make the grid and got frustrated.

So how do you deal with frustration and discouragement. I know it is super common to feel this way while programming, but I don't know how to deal with it.

Also, if you're feeling nice, how would you make the grid for battleship in java (Not in console but within a jFrame)?"

After trying to get interested in other career paths and majors, I've decided that I want to pursue a career in IT for real. I've decided on two options and I'm wondering which one would be best for me in terms making IT my long-term career.

Option 1: A friend of mine joined a program called YearUp!, which basically accepts 18-24 year olds, puts them through a six month learning period, then gives students a choice of companies they've partnered with to be an intern for another six months. He graduated recently and is currently on a contract doing security for the company he chose. I've been thinking about doing the same thing since it's basically a free program(from what I've read anyway, I still think there's a catch of some sort). But the thing is, by the end of this program I won't have any sort of degree. I guess I can get some certifications afterwards but not having a degree bothers me a bit. At least right after graduating this program I'll go straight into an internship.

Option 2: Get an AA in Computer Information Systems at my local community college, get an A+ certification, and get my foot through the door by getting a help desk job and working from there.


Thanks!"

My resume/background isn't stellar with all these random jumpy gigs I've been doing -- and it seems that interns/new grads with all their fancy internships and extracurriculars that I am no match for are mostly what they're looking for. Getting into tech as a contractor is easy, because there's no long term commitment for the companies. How can a washed up early professional like myself with 3 years of experience basically doing nothing worth of value get noticed by large tech companies for a full time non-technical role (i.e. growth marketing or project management)?

After a couple months of reading this sub, and doing my own research, I feel like it’s about time I put my plan up on here. Please give it a read, I know it’s long, somewhat scattered, and full of questions, but if you see any red flags or have better suggestions, please let me know. I’m really looking for a reality check here, because there’s a lot of excitement when contemplating something like this. I have a little under a year before I have to execute/commit to expatriating. Questions I am seeking answers to are in bold.




***BACKGROUND***:
I am a 28 year old male US citizen. I have been working for the past 6 years with cameras for the film/tv industry. I’ve spent most of my time at either rental houses or being on set, but everything I do involves a camera and light. I also have a 4 year BFA degree on the subject. So, that being said, I have a very specific set of skills, unfortunately, skills that really don’t work laterally for me. I can run your cameras on your film set, or I can shoot your wedding, I can even do some VFX and editing (but no professional experience in those), but if you want me to build budgets, write invoices, or code, I can’t bring much to the table. I can always learn those things, sure, but I don’t have a formal education in things like business or science. I also have no lineage to the UK that’s not 200 years old. My company is not an international company, so a transfer is not an option either. So, my only option is school.




***WHY I WANT OUT:***
Well, this past year and a half have been quite difficult for me. Long story short, I have lost my passion for my industry, and I want out of said industry. I moved coasts just to take a cushy job that gets me nowhere and doesn’t help me further myself (I actually spend most of my time getting paid while on reddit, this job is so stupid). Anyway, I feel stuck and stagnate. I feel like my only option is to go to grad school. This thought led me to do some research, and found out it would be cheaper for me to get a grad degree abroad vs. getting the same degree in my home state (we’re talking $17k vs $60k here). Plus, I never had the opportunity to study abroad when I was getting my undergrad (it was a super rigorous curriculum, there was no time for study abroad). I looked into some EU countries like Germany (I know, its practically free), but I honestly have no clue how I’d manage the culture and language. It would be a huge leap for me, and I’m not too sure I have the fortitude for a non English speaking country. So, this led me to look at schools in the UK. Programs I’m considering are *Journalism, PR, Marketing, and Advertising*. I’m looking to broaden my career options with my grad degree, hence why I’m looking at these subjects. I want a real marketable education that could work in both UK and the US if I can’t stay. **If you have any Uni recommendations, I’d love to hear them (currently speaking with Cardiff University and University of Salford)**. I’d really try to go for a degree that coincides with jobs that are on the UK shortage list, but to go from a BFA and an art profession to an Engineering MSc, might be quite the stretch. **What are your thoughts on this? Should I reconsider what I get my Master’s in if I want to get Tier 2 sponsorship?** So yeah, the main reason why I want out is to further my education, and change careers. But from a personal standpoint, I welcome the challenge of expatriating. The thought lights a fire under my ass, and its really the only thing I get excited about anymore. I have a newly found curiosity for the world, and I like the notion of becoming more of a global citizen. I want the adventure and the personal challenges that come with an endeavor like this. I just feel it’s the right direction for me and is needed to further myself.




***STRATEGY:***
As I said before, I’m going to do the Grad school route. I don’t really have marketable skills that can transfer to other industries. If there was a visa option for freelancers and film people, I guess I’d pursue that, but the only thing I’ve found is the Tier 5 visa which doesn’t set you up for a path of residency. **If you know something about visas and freelance work, please let me know**. So, here are my goals:



Get Accepted to uni **&gt;** Tier 4 Visa **&gt;** Relocate and get MA Degree **&gt;** Apply to jobs (internships?) **&gt;** Get Tier 2 sponsorship **&gt;** 5 years of work and residency **&gt;** UK citizenship **&gt;** Bask in my accomplishments!




Now, I don’t see getting into school and obtaining Tier 4 to be a difficult thing. Also, the thing I like about this strategy is that if I find the UK life doesn't work for me, I can always get my degree and bail. But if I fall in love with the culture and the UK life, well, I have three options. 1) get tier 2 sponsorship, 2) con someone into sponsoring me as their fiancé, or 3) actually fall in love with a Brit and do the whole marriage thing. Option 3 sounds grand, but lets be realistic, my only real option is tier 2 sponsorship. And this is the biggest question mark in my strategy. It seems like it’s almost an act of god to get tier 2 sponsorship. So, my strategy would be that I would have to start networking right away (if there’s one skill film/tv has taught me that transfers is my ability to network). I’m curious though, **how does networking in the UK compare to the US?** Culturally speaking, we’re pretty outgoing in the US, especially when we’re trying to sell something. We can be pretty aggressive. So, how would I approach network building in the UK? What are some good strategies for networking in the UK? I would try to get my face out there on days that I have off from school, and hit the pavement. I feel if people learn who I am, and what I can bring to the table, they would be more willing to go through the Tier 2 process for me.




Now I know my earning potential will be way less in the UK. This doesn’t really bother me because all US&gt;UK expats I’ve spoken to tell me their quality of life and work/life balance is way better than how it is in the US. Work/life balance is one of the main things I'm trying to find. It does kind of suck, though, willingly taking a huge pay cut, but that’s the price I have to pay, right? With that being said, **does having a graduate degree boost my earning potential?** Does it make me more valuable in the UK job market, or would I be fighting undergrads for the same entry level wages/jobs? Also, is it safe to assume that no UK work experience will ultimately hurt me in my hypothetical job hunt?




My last concern is the 2 months that the visa allows me after graduating (its 2 months for 10 month degrees, 4 months for 12 month degrees). I feel it puts a damper on most internship opportunities (internships in the US are usually 3 months). **Am I correct in thinking that with 2 months between graduating and visa expiration, internships are not an option?**




***BUDGET:***
I’m currently building a pre employment budget, so these things have also been considered, if you were wondering about that. I’m pretty confident I’ll be able to make this work from a financial perspective, but if you are curious, this is what I’m budgeting:

-Tuition

-Visa Fees

-Housing Fees (rent/utilities)

-Living Expenses

-Cell phone

-NHS Fees

**Am I leaving anything out for budgeting?** Are there transportation fees? Is this a significant cost of UK life?




**So, there you have it. That’s pretty much where I’m at right now. What do you see working for me? What do see not working for me? I know it’s still too early to say, but what are people theorizing about how Brexit will influence something like what I’m trying to achieve? Any and all feedback/advice is greatly appreciated.**




Thank you for reading, I know I’ve covered a lot, and asked a lot of questions, and I apologize if I come off as scattered. I just want to make sure I have all of my bases covered and have a good head on my shoulders before continuing pursuing this.

Does anyone know if I could still apply to these underclassmen internship opportunities, or am I just stuck in my situation. It doesn't really seem fair to compare me to CS majors who have been in this major for all 3 years, but maybe that's how it goes.

I'm earning a second bachelor's degree in CS/SE, and I'm wrapping up my program at the end of the calendar year. Because it's my second bachelor's, I only had to take major courses, so I completed the program in just under two years (and only one summer). I chose to do a research project this summer instead of an internship in case I want to return to school for a Master's/PhD sometime down the line. Fortunately, the paper was accepted to a conference in the fall, and I'm in the process of finishing up an application that utilizes techniques introduced in the research to speed up a computationally intensive process used by researchers in a different field.

My goal now is to find a software engineering or programmer analyst job. I'd prefer to work for a larger firm to begin so I can learn best practices. I live in Seattle, so there are plenty of opportunities. My previous degree was in econ and I've worked in a variety of roles: journalism, marketing, IT, sales. I'm in my mid-30s now but look a bit younger.

How badly will I be dinged for not having an internship under my belt? Will employers care at all about the research? How should I include it in my resume? Do employers offer post-graduate internship programs for people in my situation, or will I be able to land with a major employer in spite of not having an internship? Anything else I should be doing to help improve my chances of landing a job when I graduate in three months?

Cheers, and thanks again for any insights you can provide."

I'm applying for a data science internship with a well known company in the SF area (think Uber/Airbnb/Pinterest etc.). One of their points under 'Qualifications' is 'Must be currently pursuing a Master's or Doctoral degree. Preferred fields of study are statistics, math, economics, or related discipline.'

This presents a few problems. Namely, that I'm a junior undergraduate studying CS.

That said, I have more experience than the typical undergrad (and, from what I've seen, the typical masters student with respect to data science). Here's what I've got going for me:

* Very proficient using Python, R, and SQL (among many other data analysis/science tools).

* Just finished a summer internship at a well-known tech company as a data science intern. Built the company's new anomaly detection system in R from the ground up and deployed it.

* Just started a fall data science internship in NYC with an e-commerce company. Will be working on customer segmentation with some SQL reports and machine learning.

* Taking two data science masters courses.

* Tutoring for a masters-level algorithms course.

I know I don't fit their exact description, but do you think I should apply anyways? I'd love to intern here and would appreciate any tips/experiences any of you have had on applying where you don't necessarily meet every single criteria.

Thanks!

So this year I was rejected from UC Berkeley, along with a number of other UCs, after applying to the college of engineering. As Berkeley was, and remains to be, my number one choice of school to pursue my career path (Electrical Engineer and Computer Science) I decided to go to community college down in SoCal at Moorpark. I have looked at the class requirements and as I understand there are certain courses I need to complete and a number that would significantly strengthen my application. My question for any transfer students currently attending Berkeley, or any students who may have any information or tips in general, is if there is anything I should be doing outside of the classes I am taking at Moorpark and hoping to get a perfect GPA in the classes I'm enrolled in. I'm currently taking some introductory C++ courses and I plan on doing some introductory Electrical Engineering and Java courses. Do you guys think getting a high GPA in these courses would give me a significant chance of transferring into Berkeley's engineering department? Would anything else be necessary? Maybe an internship or some form of involvement in an engineering would be helpful but I do not see how I could get involved in the field with such little knowledge. Any tips, recommendations, or advice is greatly appreciated. Also any advice on preparing myself for the rigorousness of the Berkeley engineering program is welcome as I am hoping to succeed during my time at Berkeley and the time thereafter. I hope to join you soon! Go Bears! (I'm putting most of my eggs into this Berkeley basket)"

I love math and science and the prospect of using both at work is exciting to me. I could spend this last year getting mechanical engineering prerequisites done and then transfer to CS Mines and do ME there. It would take me 3 extra years and cost me at most 100k in student loans. There are perks to both paths except that one is SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive and rigorous and the other would most likely be underwhelming and unfulfilling. If I did ME I would graduate at 25/26 and be suffocated with debt and possibly not even get into the industry I want to be in for another few years. If I stick with CM I can have a decent salary at 24 but I'd be pigeon holed into the construction industry and I'd have to cross my fingers that 10 years down the road I don't get hit with a wave of regret....

I spent some time talking through my approach, and some optimizations I'd have liked to make, but I didn't realize how limited my time was, and I ended up not being able to actually fully implement it in code (there was a text editor I was supposed to type in). 

He said something along the lines of ""Oh, looks like we're running out of time - that's basically what I was looking for..."" but I remember him seeming a little less enthused after the question than he was before.

He briefly mentioned some stuff about next steps, but I was too shocked and caught off-guard to pay attention. 

I feel pretty terrible about not being able to implement the solution fast enough and think that'll reflect badly. Should I be worried about this?

Fall quarter last year I was septic, on and off antibiotics and pretty much sick the entire time.

I ended up being hospitalized again and was just so distracted that once again I got terrible grades. Spring quarter was a new turn, but I had no study skills yet and it was pretty much my learning how to deal with college stress quarter so my grades were solid b's, but obviously not what is needed for med school.

I start my first programming job next week. It's a junior position with a Healthcare IT firm (not Epic). As the start date gets closer I'm starting to lose it a little bit, racking my brain just thinking of all the ""what if"" horror scenarios.

What if they're expecting more than I can deliver? What if I'm nervous and awkward around people? What if I get fired in a week or a month or two or three months? I just signed a one year lease, I'd be completely SOL if that happened.

They have research projects and internships from school that I don't have. I'm a Java programmer up until now, the job is in C#.

A little about myself: I graduated about 9 months ago with a degree in Finance. Initially I struggled to find work, and I came into a wonderful internship opportunity that really opened some doors for me as far as furthering my career. As the internship was finishing up, I found myself speaking with a contracting firm that wanted me to place me in Data Analysis role within the healthcare field.

So, I became interested and intrigued by the opportunity, and decided to take it. It is a six month contract, and after asking around the office on the day of my interview, a lot of people get hired full time afterwards. Of course, a little part of my brain is already thinking about what I will do afterwards should it not work out/not the type of work that I want to get into. It all seems like somewhat of an opportunity to get a taste of the business.

My thinking is basically this: experience in anything is good for me where I am currently. That is the bottom line, and I will take all the chances to gather more knowledge at the cost of my time as I can. However, if I am not careful, this role could easily shift my relevant experience to something outside of Finance could it not? It is all about how I can form the work I will be doing to be relevant to any job in the future, but at the very base of it all, this job seems to have an IT flavor.

At this point, I do not know what it is that I want to do more. There is part of me that says ""You have spent the last half decade of your life doing what you can to get your life on the path that you are on. Why would you walk away from that?"" But at the same time, I am interested in IT and the lifestyle that it supposedly has. I am not opposed to working 60 hour work weeks, but the 40-45 hour weeks in IT surely isn't a negative. The negative of the IT option is that I will have to start over from nearly scratch. I will do what it takes to be successful in the industry if that's what it comes to and it's what I want to do, whether that be make new friends inside the field, teach myself programming languages, whatever. It really does not matter, but as I said before, I will have pretty much ""wasted"" my entire collegiate career before I even really got started. That seems kind of silly to me.

I have had big plans for myself and my future -- it's always been work for a couple of years and get a good base of knowledge, go back to school, get sought after certs (CPA most likely) become a manager, controller, exec, etc. Now how I get there is suddenly unclear to me. Before, it was always going from Point A to Point B to Point C to Point D and THEN, I will have made it. I should have known that wasn't realistic.

Life is exciting. I am finding comfort in the uncertainty. I will accomplish what I want to either way, so a big part of what I need to do is to do the best that I can in any circumstance, and set myself up for the next step, skip, or hop that comes my way."

So I'm teaching myself programming through Odin Project (focuses on Ruby on Rails). I just got through the HTML/CSS section and the JavaScript/JQuery section and started the Ruby section. 

I think it's still waaay to early to even think about applying anywhere with my current knowledge/experience but I do have a goal of getting and internship sometime in the Spring next year, so that gives me another 5-6 months of learning. 

Even though I think it's too early to apply, I'm assuming it takes time to land anything. Specially for a 26 year old with a B.A. on Psychology, so maybe I should consider applying now and seeing what happens.

I already have a Github account with 2 mini projects in there and it will be filling up with more projects as I progress through Odin. So that'll help with my resume but still, is it too early to apply to internships?

At what point do you think I should even consider sending applications? Is it risky to apply to a company and try re-applying later if I get rejected?

I just feel like I'm learning how to program too late and therefore will only be internship ready in my senior year. 

Do I start applying for internships while I'm still at CC and have very limited knowledge on programming or do I only apply once I have a good foundation on it (i.e. Senior year)?"

I'm 23. I had an internship 2 weeks after I graduated May '15 from college. I made that a full time job 1 month later. I was laid off in a round of company-wide layoffs at the beginning of August. Got 2 weeks severance + vacation pay, so about a month of salary.

I spend 5 days a week, a few hours a day applying to jobs I can see myself at - so about 2-4 jobs a day. I'm not going to be one of those guys applying to every job I see, because I can't be unhappy at work hating my job or I won't be a good employee. I like to spend my time crafting my resume/cover letter to fit the company and role, too. I've reached out to recruiters I know. I've reached out to people in the field or that may know people in the field. 

I've had a couple of interviews, one of which has rejected me after the 2nd round of interviews, the other of which I had round 2 today, but I really think I'm under-qualified and probably won't get the job.

I spend the rest of my days apartment hunting. I still live at home, so I've saved a shit ton of money, but I don't want to live in LA anymore and am working on a move to SF or Seattle ASAP. But that has proven difficult to find a place, as CL people want to meet you tomorrow, and apartments want proof of income to lease.

I work part time - a couple weekends a month plus a weekday or two here and there - at an overnight camp that I grew up at and worked at for 5 summers to keep my working and on my feet and to get some income along with unemployment. I love it there. I work my ass off for less than minimum, because I know I'm GREAT at that job (it involves logistics and coordinating, and manual labor - whatever), and I get more thank you's and gratitude and support in 48 hours than I did in 14 months at my ""real"" job. If my ""real"" job taught me how NOT to be a manager, this camp has taught me how to be the best manager you can be.

My parents are driving me into a deeper depression/lack of motivation. They keep telling me I'm not trying hard enough. I'm not doing enough. I get no support from them. They accuse me of ""running away"" to work at the camp over weekends, or that I'm ""running away"" to my friends cabin with him and his family on other weekends. It's killing me. Making me feel like a failure. and I'm only 23. I'm young. I have time, right? 

Sorry I just needed to vent for a minute. I know this kind of shit gets posted all the time, but I needed to let it out. 

Anyone who has been through this before - Am I wrong? Am I going about this all wrong? Or - how the fuck do I get my mojo, my motivation, my positively back about this whole thing?"
52tpj2,1,2016-09-14,New job jitters or do I need a career change?,TreadLightlyBitch,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/52tpj2/new_job_jitters_or_do_i_need_a_career_change/,"Good evening (Central US time), 

Currently freaking out about the work world. I went to school for 4 years of Civil Engineering where I specialized in structures. I actually focused on Construction Management, but after a CM internship I wanted to make sure I had my bases covered and switched my specialization to structures. My logic - that I could use my internship experience to get me a CM job and if I needed to do structures I'd have the degree to go back to school.

I took my fourth year of structures, and it was difficult, but I loved it. It was lots of math and satisfying to design something; I enjoyed it. But early in my year I got a good offer from my internship for a CM job. Fast forward a year, and I end up taking the CM job (I had no experience interning for structures so I couldn't get a structure job or internship, and I didn't get far with other CM jobs). To be a real structural engineer, I need 5 years to get a masters.

To highlight the difference between these fields, its night and day. I did four years of engineering in school. Structural engineering is designing buildings to last and whatnot; an office job working with software and specs. CM is in the field managing of procurement and schedule of construction. Really nothing I learned in school. I took the job because I thought it'd be fine and I liked my internship.

Now that I really work there full-time, I don't know anymore. Its been two months, and I got to work on the project I was at with my internship. Those were great; I had a really solid team of people I could rely on. My peers could help me learn what I didn't know; I felt like I had a good relationship with the clients and fellow coworkers.

Now I got put on a new project where it's just me and my project manager. He is no where near as helpful for when I have questions. Remember, we're tasked with actually fully building things and I have no knowledge or experience with any of this so I feel like I'm drowning. Not to mention I don't feel like I have a good relationship with the architect on this project and I feel like I can't ask them questions when we need to. 

Above all else, the hours are not ideal. I'm constantly working minimum 50 hours, which I feel like I am a 40-50 hour guy. I've got nights coming up so now I will end up doing late night work so its impossible to schedule a social life outside of weekeneds (I also know there will come a time when I need to work Saturdays I'm sure). And because we work on projects I feel like I will always have to drive to different locations.

I feel like I fucked up hard. I see myself as an engineer; a ""smart"" math guy who can help design buildings and shit. Work in an office and do some site visits once a week. I could go back but I'm terrified of quitting and I also don't know if I would hate structural engineering and I'm just scared of the pressures of working.

To be honest, I just feel like working these late shifts may be getting to me at this new job. I feel unsafe without a net of coworkers to help teach me the ropes; it's me and another employee who doesn't help me a lot and we're surrounded by demanding employees from other places who need things from me that I can't provide. I jsut want to cry a little.

What should I do? I dunno, maybe I jsut need someone to talk to but I am a grown man and I wanna cry.

tl;dr Instead of finishing my structural degree and maybe getting a structural job (only requiring another year) I took a job as a construction manager when I am a fish out of water. Should I keep on keeping on or should I consider going back to school? Remember, this conversation may be biased cause I feel overwhelmed this week."
52txbt,34,2016-09-14,"Internship @ Cisco wasn't what I expected, looking for advice",YRN-YSL,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/52txbt/internship_cisco_wasnt_what_i_expected_looking/,"Background: I went to a small liberal arts school with a CS program that was pretty easy to me, which now seems like a bad thing in hindsight. Few of our CS grads go on to become SWE's without a masters. I didn't intend on being an engineer (and was complacent) until Nov of my senior year when I started to code more intensively, take online courses, and attended 3 MLH hackathons.

After graduation, I decided to take a risk by forgoing two full-time offers (tech consulting + IT @ a non tech company) for a front-end dev internship at Cisco in the bay area. I figured the tech community and environment here would be more conducive to learning, and that I would be able to find a full-time job even if things didn't work out at Cisco. I suffered a lot to make this happen- took a very low wage and lived in a bad housing situation to make things work.

Fast forward 3 months, and the job hasn't been what I expected. The people I work directly with are all remote, so all of my work is done remotely. My mentor was great at first, traveling to meet me weekly etc, but he weaned off his communication and support to me, citing 'crunch time' reasons. Things have gotten busier, so I have had to really push to get any mentorship back. There was a long period of time where they would tell me to train / learn myself for a small project, and then as soon as I would need anything more than passing support, it seemed they would put me on something different. 
Now, the lead engineer is taking a more active role in mentoring me (I think because I sort of went over his head to ask for more work). Because of all this, 3 months in I am still not consistently contributing to the code base. When I do, it is with a ton of help/skyping with a team member (I went in with minimal web dev experience, but understand MVC etc).

The code base is a frankenstein of frameworks and systems, and our development process is virtually nonexistent. There are more people writing specs (project managers and BAs) than people writing code. I feel as if exec level management in charge of our product all specialize in hardware, so there is a disconnect between top leadership and engineering efforts. There is huge disconnect between our U.S. (mine) team and the India team, and they rarely get along.

Now, I am wondering when if ever I will be able to contribute on the level that I was hoping/expecting. They've given me a more serious responsibility (Program Management between India/US) which I am grateful for, but it is not development. I'm not sure if I will ever contribute like I want to, and I don't really want to sacrifice pay and experience by coming onto Cisco as a non-engineer. I feel as if it will stunt my career in many ways (though I'm willing to move to product management in the future).

I just enrolled in a class at Berkeley and begin tomorrow (EECS 169). I am desperately trying to bridge the gap in all ways and become a real dev. I've tried the DS/Algos stanford coursera course, but have difficulty implementing everything! I feel as if I'm trying everything and excelling at nothing. Hopefully this course at Berkeley gives me the structure I'm hoping for.

Any advice? What do I do? Stay? Leave? Study? If so, any guidance on what? DS/Algos or more web dev? (I know they're not mutually exclusive, but I feel as if I always spread myself too thin!) I'm also a little disappointed that Cisco isn't as respected in the Bay Area as I originally thought.

Thanks so much for any advice."

Completed an internship at a local, but very large Unified Communications company. I worked in support, taking calls, creating tickets and troubleshooting the issue until it was resolved. I'm also in the Army National Guard where I do IT work. Helpdesk/NetOps type things. Configuring routers/switches, setting up VPN tunnels, hooking up telephony services etc. nothing too in depth but decent amount of experience. No real IT job other than what I've listed above. 

Certs: CCENT, CCNA R&amp;S, ICCE (in house cert for UC company I interned for) 

So I've been applying for a crap ton of jobs. Helpdesk, junior net engineer type gigs. No real luck until today.

Job #1
I had an interview with a very large, global, and well respected company. They are huge in the world of HealthTech. The position I applied for was a Field Service Engineer. This position would be traveling around to different hospitals around the state (maybe further) to install and service these healthtech systems. Great pay (for a brand new college grad), company car + gas. However seems to be a large amount of travel, with a not so appealing on-call system (basically on call 24/7/365). Be pretty much on my own all the time doing what needs to be done. Advancement seems possible but seems like it would take a very long time and things don't seem too structured.

Job #2
I had an interview for this job the same day as job #1. This job is working as a VoIP associate engineer at a very large hospital corporation who has hospitals all across the state. Work will be focused in the city I live in, no real travel, office type job. Implementing phones and troubleshooting as well as some backend stuff. Advancement seems more likely here and they seem to be more engaged when it comes to getting you exposure to what you want (i.e. If you eventually want to be a network guy, they push you in that direction). 

Job #1 has offered me a position the very same day as the interview. During the interview for job #2 (I already knew I was offered job #1) I used this to leverage a quicker interview process (since job #1 would need to know if i accept the offer ASAP). Job #2 told me I was the leading candidate for the position and I'm feeling very confident that they will offer me the position. 

Where I'm stuck: do I take job #1 or job #2(assuming they actually offer it to me)???? Both jobs offer pretty much the same amount of money. Job #1 is hourly with good chance of OT. Job #2 is salary with no OT. Job #1 offers company car + gas but you must travel often. Job #2 doesn't offer these things but is local and short drive from my house. Other than that the benefits are good and very similar between both jobs. Traveling around interests me but I don't want to me on call all the time.

Does anyone here work as a field service engineer or a VoIP engineer tell me a little about what they like/dislike? I'm mainly curious about the field service engineer because I don't really know what to expect other than long days and working alone. 

Any advice or input is welcome. TIA"

He mentions that before an interview even begins, say something to the effect of
&gt;I'm very happy to be here, and I want to answer all the questions you have for me, but before we begin do you mind if I ask you a question? Why did you ask me here today? What was it about my resume that caused you to invite me in?

His reasoning is that it encourages the interviewer to see you in a positive light from the get-go, and therefore everything else you say after that is helping reinforce their already positive thoughts about you.

I have an interview for an IB fall internship tomorrow, and am interested in trying this out. Before I do though, I want to hear some opinions on whether this would work the way it is intended – or would it be a *negative* question to ask, as I found online.
&gt; You risk seeming unaware of the value you bring or what the company’s needs are—it’s a rookie move.

Thoughts?

tl;dr lol no"

In the first interview, I was able to solve the first question I was asked on my own. It certainly wasn't easy, but I remained calm and figured it out. Then, after the interviewer added a follow-up which made it go from medium to hard, I had no clue how to approach it. I talked out loud about a few ideas I had, but in the end, the interviewer had to provide some hints to help me formulate an answer. I didn't finish, and he even said he didn't expect me to finish and its good that I got the first correct.

Second interview, I got the second best solution to the question by myself, but not the best (which I found out after the interview). He asked if I could improve it, but I honestly didn't know how I could, so I tried brainstorming a few ideas, but in the end I said that I couldn't :(

After that, there was time remaining so I got another question which I was able to work through. I had to backtrack once and fix my approach, and then finally got the solution with a very small bit of guidance (mostly on my own).

Throughout this, I surely explained myself pretty well, drew out examples, and thought out loud.

I found out later that they would keep my salary unchanged (and since then I think I've improved so I would like to make the same as what other companies offer)

So my question is essentially: How negative would it be career-wise to break the promise of me working there. I blame myself partly because I did not ask about the salary and assumed they would adjust it themselves, so I feel guilty about telling them I won't go without a raise. I fear that it would hurt my reputation in the long run. How could I back up professionally?"

It would be for a minimum commitment of one year. The problem is that I didn't know what I wanted to do in life until recently, so when I applied to internships last year I just applied randomly and happened to get this one over the summer. My heart is really on AM and I'm studying for the CFA to try and eventually do that.

I have a 3.85 GPA from a semi-target school in NYC with a decent undergraduate business network. I have a major in Finance and really don't want to be constrained to the BO for the rest of my life. My question is: Which path should I choose?

1) Take the offer, work for 1-2 years while networking and studying for CFA, try to transfer into AM at JP or some other bank.

2) Reject the offer, go to all career fairs and resources available to me to get something more relevant to what I want to do.

3) Take the offer and renege if something better comes up in the 1 year interim until I start next August.

4) Take the offer and try to get into some equity research position after the minimum tenure before transitioning back into AM 

With all of these plans, I plan on going to B-School after working for 2-3 years (hopefully a good one given my GPA). What are your thoughts?"

I'm sure there are posts like mine on here often so I'm sorry if this is repetitive for you. I have about a year and a half before I graduate with my cs degree (my last semester will be like two classes) and I just have no desire to program anymore. 

When I first started cs I loved to program because it was challenging and I felt like I could do anything. I ended up landing an internship doing web development this past spring which is great for the resume, but I hated it a lot. While I learned a lot of new technologies I just didn't feel challenged at all and I decided that I never want to do web development again. The problem is that the boringness of the internship seems to have completely killed programming for me, I haven't coded at all since may (classes haven't required it yet this semester, cs=math now). 

I'm in this weird place where my first internship bored me to death and my long term plan doesn't include programming (want to move into management or politics or something eventually) so I just have no desire to keep learning and improving. My GPA isn't great (lack of doing homework and attending class, not programming ability/ability to learn) so I feel like I won't be getting a job at a good company when I first start out anyways, and in my mind that means I won't have any really difficult interview questions (within reason obviously). Even if I'm wrong on this point I don't think that preparing for interview questions alone will be enough to bring me out of my funk. 

 I think that the possibility of getting a job at an awesome company (nasa, google, SpaceX, etc) when i graduate would help reignite my passion for programming, but my GPA (about a 2.8 now, can probably get to 2.9 when I graduate) makes me think that I won't be able to land anything great. This combined with the fact that I plan on going into management  anyways (I like money and making big decisions) leave me with little desire to be an outstanding programmer. Right now I'm just doing enough to get by, but I want more than that. 

So tell me where my thinking is wrong and convince me to refine my programming skills, I could use a kick in the ass."

I (F/23) have been in the process of applying to studying abroad in the UK. (I'm American) At first I was really excited at the opportunity, I've always wanted to truly be immersed in the culture of the UK, and I've heard from so many people what an incredible life-changing experience it can be! Plus, I really want to experience more of the world before I start my career. But now that it's seeming more ""real"" I'm having second thoughts...
First off, it would most certainly put me into debt. My semester abroad would be my last before I graduate. Right now I have zero student loans, and I don't know if it's the best idea to take out loans right before I set out into the ""real world"" (I definitely want to move away from my the town I've been living in once I'm done with school.)
Also, I've experienced pretty bad anxiety before. The one and only time I went overseas before, I had panic attacks and anxiety throughout the whole trip. That was a couple of years ago, and I have since lived away from home for 6 months (I did the Disney College Program and loved it!) and I was fine, but I am still nervous that being in such a new and different environment will seriously trigger my anxiety again. The past couple days I have felt so much anxiety just at the thought of it actually happening. Plus, if I decided to go home early, I wouldn't be able to graduate. So even if I ended up hating it, I would be absolutely stuck there.
And the last thing. There is a guy who is from and lives close to London. We met while we were both living in the US. We have had sort of a long distance relationship thing over the past 6 months or so. This guy really isn't good for me though, I've been trying to keep my distance from him in an effort to kind of get over it... I really love him still though. I guess it could be both a good and a bad thing, him being there: at least I have one person I know; but on the other hand, this guy has hurt me in the past, and I wouldn't want it ruining my time there. (I know, it's stupid.)
I am applying to the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield.
If I choose not to study abroad next semester, I was thinking about trying for a summer internship in London through BUNAC's program. Does anyone have any experience doing something similar?
I just feel so conflicted, it's driving me crazy! If anyone could offer me any advice or input at all, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!"

I've gotten a few internships, some with established companies and some with start ups, so I have insight from my perspective, but I'd love to have a few points of view on this.  If you are hiring an intern, what are you looking for?  What resources do you use (LinkedIn, indeed, looksharp, etc)?

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

My buddy wants to get a new PC for AutoCAD work. He's an intern at a architectural firm. He was about to buy a pre-built but I convinced him that a build your own is a better choice. I'm a little out of my element here though (I know gaming PCs, but not AutoCAD PCs). I was hoping there were some folks here on /r/buildapc that know more about the best kind of rig for AutoCAD.

A quote from him about what he will use it for:

&gt;It's all just 2D site planning linework; however, we oftentimes have xrefs brought in, as well as PDF underlays and raster images, so that can cause CAD files to be pretty sluggish.

&gt;Also, some of the illustratives we work on in Photoshop can have a ton of layers and be huge, so it tends to run slowly sometimes.

There's room in my build higher cost / higher performance parts. If he can spend more money and get real performance out of it (aka value) then please let me know.

How do you choose your first (or next) role? I'm a senior interviewing for full-time positions. I've been struggling with the following questions, and was hoping someone could provide some insight.


* How do you know what part of full-stack (or subfield of CS) interests you? 
* Should I be worried about getting pigeonholed into a role? For example, will joining an iOS team limit my future opportunities in non-iOS work?
* In college &amp; job interviews, we constantly practice algorithmic problems like tree-traversals, DP, etc - I've rarely used these skills in internships, and have trouble seeing this ""algorithmic"" process in some job descriptions. This makes me worry about working on non-challenging / boilerplate code. Is this irrational? I would love to hear some diverse examples of your work that are fulfilling / challenging.

Any other tips for deciding on a first team would be awesome - thank you!"

I'm a CS undergrad in a top-20 to top-10 depending on where you look CS program. I started out studying Neuroscience, but after deciding before my senior year in Fall 2014 that I didn't want to do grad school or medical school, I decided to pick up a second major in CS to help my job prospects.

So, in the last two years I've flown through the CS program here to the point where I'm graduating in December. It's been a rough road, and throughout most of it I've been struggling with depression and anxiety due to a number of external factors that I won't delve into. I've also felt WAY behind my peers since I started so late. But I have managed to get through the program.

The problem is I haven't had an internship, and don't really have any projects that I've done outside of class. It's been a struggle just finding the mental fortitude to power through class. 

Things are definitely a lot better now, but I'm finding myself looking ahead to our career fair next week, and I feel like I don't really know what to put on my resume/am doubting my prospects of finding stuff since I haven't had an internship/a big external portfolio. 

Any of the resume building stuff I did during my 4 years of studying Neuroscience doesn't really apply directly to a job in CS. I've been working an IT job for the last year and a half, but obviously that doesn't really encompass CS. My best bet is putting CS class projects I've done I guess, but most of them were generalized things that everyone who took the class had to do. I've only had really one big group project that was completely our own idea/thing.

I guess I'm just wondering what I should be looking for. Should I be going after an internship first before something full time? Can I expect to be able to get one? I'm confident in my own abilities for the most part, as I've gotten through a lot of difficult CS classes and ultimately will have a degree come December, I just don't really know how to express it in resume form, and I still do feel behind a lot of my peers. I'm a first gen college student which is something a lot of people have said I should play up, but the side I'm worried about is actually displaying the CS skills I've gained. 

Appreciate any advice!

I'm also interested in potentially going back for a second bachelor's in computer science, but I can't really say that one outweighs the other. 

I thought maybe working some entry-level positions would help pass the time and maybe put me on a path to something else I enjoy. But I've had trouble getting any positions(other than some unpaid internships) because I'm not really sure what to look for with a Polisci degree.

I want to prepare myself for the job market through side projects until I land an internship. You're probably going to ask, ""well, what are you interested in?""... Well, i've found that I enjoy systems development definitely, but as far as I understand for most developer roles these days, webdev/appdev is becoming more and more the norm.

What do you guys suggest I start working on? 

Edit: I'm thinking setting up a Linux server for my network, maybe? Would that require a dedicated server(like a physical machine)?"

ZERO.

I was promised to be given an internship certificate of completion and also internship evaluation form.

Fast forward 2 months, completed internship but didn't get those 2 papers. I was assigned to do unrelated stuffs. I felt cheated.

Then a week ago, I decided to extend my internship to develop an mobile app for my final year project and also the same internship company. Not a good decision at all.

Things didn't go down the way I wanted as the company's vision and expectation of the app are different from mine. 

So now, what is the best way to quit? On the contract it says that I have to give 2 weeks notice. Do I still have to serve the 2 weeks? Should my approach to quitting be a peaceful one or a somewhat aggressive one? Should I still ask for the 1 week's pay that I have served?

Please advice."

I've been studying up a lot, but mostly conceptual stuff.

On my resume, I have my skills listed like so:

&gt; Highly skilled: Java

&gt; Experienced: Python, C, .....

&gt; Familiar: .....

The idea was that Java is the only language that I'd be comfortable using in any situation, but I've written somewhat complex code in both Python (chat bot for Discord and a Django website) and C (heap manager and kernel for school assignments) so I listed those as ""experienced"". I know lines of code isn't always a great indicator, but with my relatively concise coding style I've written &gt;300k LOC in Java and ~10k LOC in Python and C each, so there's a pretty big disparity there in terms of experience.

As a college undergrad, will I be asked specific questions about languages I list other than my main language? For example, specific questions on the language (like ""what is the string pool"" in Java, except questions for Python/C). Or questions that require using something besides Java (""do ___ and return the pointer""). 

I'm comfortable coding in Python/C with the internet as a quick reference so I don't feel at all that I was dishonest on my resume, but at the same time I don't think I'd be comfortable handling interview-level questions outside of Java. Certainly even my ability to just structure projects is far superior in Java than in any other language."

I have interviewed (and failed) for internships at Microsoft (1 time), Google (3) and at a US unicorn that's in my city (1). Neither Facebook, Twitter or Amazon got back to me after I send them my Resume.

I made it to host matching at Google once, but no manager ended up selecting me for an interview. At the Unicorn I was the only one from my school to made it to the last rounds of interviews.

The thing is I know I am close to actually getting an offer because my background usually brings attention (Full Stack Dev who got press coverage for a prize and some notable things not related to coding) and I was really really close at Google and at the Unicorn. I can probably do the work these companies ask interns to do just fine (from what I've been told).

The thing is, I always fuck up in the detailed implementation of algorithms. I always have problems figuring out if an index start from 0 or 1 and usually that blocks me. Simple questions like, compress a string or add two arrays representing numbers always cause me too much problems. Discussing tradeoffs or implementations are not an issue for me.

I have spend a significant time preparing interview questions and at this point I'm starting two think (1) I'm doing something wrong and (2) it will just take me too much time to successfully prepare for interviews and I have to look for other companies.

In the long term I see my self starting a company and I thought spending some time at big company could be good for experience and networking. But if I have to spend too much time mastering algorithm questions instead of doing real-life problems I'm questioning if it's worth it. 

Yes, I did use the ""Cracking the coding interview"" and after some progress I got stuck with the same problems. (My interview at Microsoft was a disaster and I realized a year later)

What are your thought?"

Thanks for reading this post - I'll try to keep it short and simple.

I am currently a Field Service Engineer Intern in a large medical devices multinational (50,000 employees worldwide). So far I've got nothing but praise on my work but I've been told there will not be a permanent position opening up soon due to headcount issues so I am on the hunt for my next challenge. 

Now, I've told my previous employer (smaller multinational in medical IT, ~500 employees) that I'm looking for new challenges and have been offered an Account Manager position in one of their UK office. 

I've also reached out to the UK division of my current company and I'm in the midst of interviewing for a permanent Field Service job and, according to the Hiring Manager, I should have no issues getting the job. 

Now, my question is, given the two options and that the salaries are equivalent, which one would you pick? Account Manager is a nice step up in the direction I was hoping to go but the big multinational company is very well known and seems to offer more career choices - although I wouldn't be moving to an Account Mgr position any time soon.

Whatever advice you have would be absolutely fantastic! Thanks for reading this far!

tl;dr - Would you rather bid your time in a big multinational and climb that ladder or move to a smaller company and skip a few steps in said ladder?

Thanks again!

1. Which is worse in terms of future employment? (a) a longterm gap in employment, or (b) downgrading to a much lower paying job below my skill set
1. What kinds of careers value programming knowledge mixed with science/health? What programming languages in the health field (or in general) do you think are most worth learning?

**What's going on now**

Seven months ago I finished my fellowship job and moved to a small town with my husband. There, he's working on a postdoc, which seems to be going great, but I'm struggling with what is best for me to spend my time pursuing. Two years from now, my husband will finish his posdoc and we plan to move someplace else. 

I sort of fell into the field of public health as a way to not have to do biology anymore. I also am pretty ""over"" working for a huge government institution. I've also tried tutoring in the past, which taught me I do ***not*** want to go into teaching/tutoring. Where we live now doesn't seem to have any great job options for me. I'm basically twiddling my thumbs, and feel like I would like to work on my career, but am not sure where I should focus and which direction I should head. 

**Previous trials and tribulations**

I am have BS in biology and masters in public health. I have worked for large government institutions as a fellow (which, though competitive, honestly felt like one step above intern in this case), doing things like project management, qualitative research, hand holding, running meetings, team building, and strategic planning. All in all, it was OK.


Before that, I've been a research assistant, either in biology labs, or for a consulting company writing scientific reviews/summary reports. Doing huge systematic reviews of scientific literature and drug trials was OK, though the process is pretty tedious. Everyone tells me coming from a scientific background is valuable, but I don't want to work in a lab again.


**What I've been doing since moving:**

* Applying to local public health department is proving slow and unfruitful. The only interview I've gotten was for ""data manager"" which I was not qualified for since my last job was more writing and managing. (not to mention hour + commute, which I'm not sure is worth it for a job I'm not too interested in)

* **In July I began training in HTML, CSS, and currently Javascript through free online programs.** I have my good days and bad days, but overall I love it and hope to continue getting better. Javascript is a bitch, though. :) I've been looking into maybe getting into public health informatics, or just change careers completely and become a developer of some kind. (if I can build the right skillset) I guess it's discouraging because on the one hand, I feel like there are 15-year-old programming wizards or at least the countless CS-undergrads who have a massive advantage over me. Then again, it's not like I need to work for google or build the next IBM Watson. I just want to find a job that pays me for doing something I kind of enjoy sometimes. lol I also get mixed reviews of how valuable learning programming is these days. But I mean...it's such a huge field, so even within that it's a little overwhelming to figure out where to set my goals.

* I've been playing piano a lot more. Growing up, I took lessons for ~13 years and played gigs through high school playing background music at art galleries openings and events like that. During my days sitting at home, I start to wonder if I want to try advertising for gigs if I can build up a repertoire again. Then again, I also like this fine as a hobby/stress releiver, and it may take time away from finding a more lucrative and stable career.

* Hesitating to apply for jobs in town, because the only things I see available are secretary/staff assstants, or PhD-required nuclear physicists. But then I also worry about having a &gt; 2 year gap in my resume. 

P.S. I'm also reluctant to go to school again, mainly because I accrued some massive debt that we're aggressively paying off, and at this rate will be debt-free (given we don't buy a house or have a kid) in two years. "

So, I have a bit of an issue that has gotten out of hand. I am an international student enrolled at an university and i moved recently to a city in Bavaria for my internship. Everyone knows the housing situation and so I found one pretty far away from work. Landlord is a 62 something year old who seemed nice, friendly until I signed the contract. Following things happened.

1. He said to me, I am not allowed to bring any friends or visitors for an evening or a night's stay. ""Fremde Menschen sind nicht erlaubt"" are his words in the email.

2. He makes explicit sexual comments, gets drunk everyday, told me to marry him and asked if I have ever slept with a German before. He is always in the kitchen when I am cooking in the evening after work. He also caused issues with my Stadtanmeldung.

3. He imposed rules like cooking time, making me pay rent for another room which was eventually given to a 32 year old Hungarian he is enamoured with. He also kept showing me pictures of her in a bikini during lunch and asking my opinion. 

4. He said, my boyfriend when visiting from Scotland, must pay 10 euros per night. 

5. He stole and ate a huge pot of food that I had cooked for work. I leave for work at 6 and come home at 8. He never apologised, instead insulted me for even being mad at him. This is where it all went downhill. Because I refused to put up with his stupidity.

6. He has sent me openly racist texts, being extremely rude and well, has said no one can come in the house to help me move tomorrow. Also, he plans to sleep at 11 am; that is when I am moving out and I must be quiet. It's the second floor and i have backache issues.

None of these stupid rules are mentioned in the contract. Also the cancellation period is 1 month but he insists that it is 3. 1 is written instead. He also harasses me by switching off the stove when I am cooking or moving my things or worse, sending away a DHL packet.


Lastly, I have been to the police for advice with help from the company but he will create issues tomorrow and refuses to return my kaution. I know I need a lawyer for that but I really could some help dealing with him and what to do next. The police said they can only intervene if something serious happens, but they warned me he would cause trouble. It's been barely 20 days since I moved in and I am tired of this guy's openly racist comments, sexual comments and rudeness. 

He has also asked me what I think of him and if I am interested in him. Also, he is renting the house from someone, and is now starting his own prison with all germans and 1-2 foreigners.

Any advice for me, Reddit? I'm stressed out about tomorrow and haven't slept in fear of him since over a week. He is also aggressive and gets in my face to shout if I am walking barefoot around the house or cooking for more than 30 mins etc..."

AMA!",dreamsaremade,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/534nrl/im_kat_clowes_independent_educational_consultant/,"Hello Reddit!  My name is Kat Clowes and I’m an independent educational consultant for March Consulting, meaning that I help students with college admissions and career planning.  I’ve been doing this for six years now (going on my 4th full time, as the first two were during graduate school) and hold a BA in Communications from Santa Clara U, an MBA from Mt. St. Mary’s University in LA, and my consulting certificate from UC Irvine.  

I’ve worked with a variety of different schools and students across the board. Mostly, I focus on helping a student develop who they are, communicate that clearly, and plan for the future.  Students of mine have gone on to graduate early from high school and start college, have been admitted to various prestigious colleges, but most importantly have made themselves stand out in the world by developing their own projects and expertise.  I’ve had students intern at NASA, start successful businesses, create their own non-profits, and tinker with cool robotics projects.  

My mission is to bust through the same misconceptions that I had when I was applying to college back in 2001.  Mostly, I want you to learn from all the mistakes that I made when I was applying to college and while I was in college.  Below are a few tips that I tell most of my clients and, although I know it's a bit of a novel, I think will help you in your journey.  

***TL;DR: I gave you a bunch of tips for admissions and life.  AMA!***

Here are a few tips for college admissions:

**A college/university is more than architecture, town, and prestige.**  Yes, you want to be happy in the area, inspired by campus, and (maybe) be the student who can say they got into a prestigious school but you are also buying a product.  Almost every school has study abroad, claims small class sizes, and looks great in the brochure.  Look instead at the classes you’ll be taking, the professors who will be teaching you, and how the university will help you develop as a person.  Read their mission statement and values.  Investigate their traditions and the extra academic and career options they will offer you.  Ask how often it is that students do research or internships, get help from the tutoring center, or what kind of projects current students are doing to make them stand out in their majors.  Don’t get sucked in by rankings and pretty buildings.  Do your research.  Ask questions.  

**Create a list of things that you want admissions officers to know about you.**  Your application is not a collection of documents, it’s an entire picture of you as a person.  You’re going to be evaluated like all of the other students applying to that school, so make sure you cover everything about yourself that you want them to know.  Your essays and your letters of recommendation are sometimes the only aspects of your application where the admissions office will be able to see who you truly are apart from your grades and your test scores.  Make it count.  Think of your application as a whole.

**Please, PLEASE spend time on your essays.**  I highly recommend that you get help from Ethan Sawyer, the College Essay Guy.  He has amazing resources for students. 

**Start now.**  There is nothing stopping you from starting a business, becoming an expert in a particular area, shadowing current professionals, or simply starting a project that is your own.  While I say that, don’t start a project just because it “looks good on college applications.”  Everyone will be able to tell that your heart isn’t in it (including admissions officers).  If you’re interested in business, start something small and learn from it (selling on ebay, start a lemonade stand, sell t-shirts online, start an etsy shop, become an amazon affiliate, etc).  My most successful students started something small and built it up over time, providing themselves with opportunities they never would have had in college and high school otherwise.

**Finally, talk to admissions officers.**  Talk to faculty members and current students.  Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the environment and tell them about yourselves so they might recommend other programs and opportunities their school has for you.

Here are a few tips for **life** after college admissions:

**You can’t find yourself in college.** I’m sorry to burst a lot of bubbles, but nothing is going to magically happen.  If you’re not LOOKING for yourself, you’re not going to FIND yourself.  Sitting in your dorm and taking classes tells you nothing.  You need to have goals (SMART goals), expose yourself to different experiences, and start building your network.  Read extra books, try new things, and step outside of that proverbial comfort-zone.  No one goes to college and has it all figured out by the time that they leave.  What they do is work on it one bit at a time.

**Don’t let fear rule you.**  Yes, this is a terrifying process.  You’re submitting a part of yourself for someone else to judge and it is the next four years of your life.  However, success comes from experimenting and failure.  If you don’t make any move, you’re only going to stress yourself out more.  Make a move and go with it.  If it’s not the right one, change course.

**College is a conduit for your future.** It is what you make of it.  You’re paying a lot of money for resources and opportunities, so use them.  Also, I’ve found that saying you’re a college student can sometimes get you through doors that are closed to you as an adult.  I created my own path by using the resources at my school to get me there.  My most successful students are able to do this too.  Here are a few to consider:

**Join professional organizations.** Every industry has some sort of professional organizations (heck, reddit has subreddits dedicated to different professions) where people who are interested or in your industry meet and talk about...you guessed it...that industry.  These are the people who will be hiring you.  Also, you can grab a nifty student discount from that organization, get scholarships to their conferences, and network/get to know the people who will soon be hiring you.  Why wouldn’t you join in college?  Gain mentors from those who will be hiring you?  Get great advice and know what’s going on in the industry to rock your interview?  Join.

**Life doesn’t work by major.**  You’re not going to be in one field for the rest of your life.  In fact, most of us will have anywhere from four to seven careers in our lifetime.  

While majoring in communications in college, I thought I had it all figured out in a cookie-cutter type way.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), the benefits of my liberal arts requirements came into play later, and I was glad that I was exposed to a variety of different subjects and topics, because I could always relate with someone.  If you’re looking into medicine, don’t be afraid to minor (or major, as medical schools increasingly are looking for variety in their applicant pools) in business.  The likelihood of you running your practice is high and without business experience, you’re not going to get very far.  The same goes for engineering and computer science.  You can have the best app or software in the world but unless you know a bit about marketing (or enough to hire someone awesome at it), you’re not going far.  

You get what you put into it.  Just like an entrepreneur, you have to create what you want.  NO one is going to hand you anything.

**The system isn’t as rigid as they make you believe.**  I graduated high school a year early and started community college with two signatures from administration.  The same goes for college; do you want to create your own research?  Start a business?  Do something cool?  Someone on your campus will give you approval and money, if you start fishing around and asking.  

**Use your alumni.**  I can’t stress this enough, thinking that the alumni house was merely for after I graduated college.  The main reason people go to prestigious schools is for the alumni connections.  At your school (no matter where it is), you have access to thousands of other people that you already have a common connection to--some of which were in your major.  Have the alumni office connect you to them.  Take them to coffee, ask them questions, ask to shadow them at work--they’re one of the richest sources of information you’ll have.  Thinking about your future engineering career?  Why not ask an engineer?  One of the best questions you can ask:  “What would you  have done differently when you were my age?”

**Begin building your brand.**  You’ll need to know who you are, what you want out of life, and what signals you’re broadcasting to the world.  What type of friend are you or will you be? Employee?  Boss?  Significant other?  Start working on developing your brand now for the professional world.  Get business cards, start your LinkedIn profile, and start dressing the part.  You can completely reinvent yourself in college, so go for it.

If you’re looking for more tips, I wrote a book called *[Put College to Work: How to use college to the fullest to discover your strengths and find a job you love before you graduate](https://www.amazon.com/Put-College-Work-Discover-Strengths/dp/161035253X)* that’s available on Amazon and other major booksellers.  Pick up a copy.  I created a step-by-step timeline for each quarter of college through senior year for you to follow.  

Also, my other consultant and I are launching a podcast called [The Almost Everything College Podcast](http://www.mymarchconsulting.com/almosteverythingcollegepodcast) where we talk about everything we wished we would have known about college, college admissions, and life in general.  We’ll be answering questions like:  what do you do with a degree in English?  and other quandaries.  We'll be live September 23rd on iTunes and Stitcher.

With that said, AMA!"

5352n2,23,2016-09-16,Journey from Depression to Landing Job,willthrowaway029,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5352n2/journey_from_depression_to_landing_job/,"I had always believed I was a smart student but after the first year of college the way I perceived myself had changed. At the end of the first year, I had 2.3 GPA overall after never getting a grade lower than a B in high school. I always worried that I wound’t get the job I wanted, as it was already hard to get any internships. 

That summer I felt very depressed and had always lied about my academics when friends or family asked. I felt I was lacking many skills and self-confidence.   I decided to do something about it instead of worrying about it all the time. I started reading more, changed my habits, and zoned in. Another year went by, got better grades but still no internship so again I was worried. I didn’t know what I was doing wrong. 

My biggest problem was I didn’t know the key to getting an internship or job were side projects. That year, I decided to take on a few side projects. I was starting to feel more confident in my programming abilities so I created a mobile app and got a few more projects on my github and I was able to land my first internship at a small startup as an Android Developer. That was one of the most exciting moments in life. 

The next year, I decided I wanted to get into web development so learned MEAN stack and built a high-quality web app. After having a hard time getting interviews in the previous years, I had no problem this time. My self-confidence had grown tremendously and I learned how to pitch myself to people better. I went to the job fair the final year of college and I was able to land more than a handful of interviews. I went through interviews and I was able to get the best job I could’ve imagined mid-way through the school year. 

Although I didn’t end up with the best GPA, a 3.3, I couldn’t have cared less because it didn’t define who I was and what I could do. As I’ve started working now, I reflect on those down days and realize what a long way I have come. So the lesson to be learned is that SIDE PROJECTS are essential in getting a job so keep learning, stay engaged in the work you do,  and don’t lose hope."
535opc,1,2016-09-16,"Can I keep this ""break"" from turning into a breakup?",Insertcleverpun_here,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/535opc/can_i_keep_this_break_from_turning_into_a_breakup/,"So about two weeks ago my boyfriend of nearly one year (by nearly I mean we were less than a month away) broke up with me. I freaked out (as women tend to do) and we ended up agreeing on a break instead. Basically, giving each other space because he definitely doesnt know what he needs and I did a lot to turn him off. I'll give you a run down of what I realized I was doing wrong and what Im doing to fix it: 1. I was really clingy and dependent on him, always wanted to be around him, couldnt be by myself, in other words, the world's biggest turn off. I've been talking about this with my therapist and part of it stems from OCD and part from childhood abandonment issues. To combat this I a) told him (and am actually keeping up with) no contact for a full week (no texting, calls, seeing each other, nothing. Only thing I messaged him about was an important email of his that got sent to my account because I was still logged into my email on his phone) and b) Ive been focusing on being more comfortable depending on myself. Ive been getting through panic attacks on my, keeping up with my health the best I ever have, being independent monetarily and transportation wise (he would help me out by giving me a ride if I needed it), and just overall finding ways to be self reliant, not something Ive ever done before. 2. I talked to much about whatever future we had together (stemming from number 1). He felt pressured and I can see why, we're too young to be thinking that far down the road, we both have no clue where we're ending up in life, but I didn't realize that since I was so dependent on others for security. We had been discussing an apartment for the summer next year because I'm currently homeless (my parents and I dont speak and the woman I was sharing a house with moved out of state and I cant afford the rent alone. I'm looking for an internship and it was my backup plan (obviously thats no more). Now Im making plans that dont revolve around a partner (starting with volunteering at my old scout camp this summer and dropping off the map for a few months to reconnect with myself and get in better shape). I've also been working out, started figure modeling for some colleges in the area, focusing on school work, etc. to put it in my mind that I'm responsible for my own life and no one else. 3. I was really critical of things and asked more of him than I had any right of say over. For example, I had asked him to quit smoking weed because it was an expensive and frankly unhealthy habit. He agreed but didn't like it. I also really didn't like it when his facial hair got too long, etc, etc. it was a lot of little things that got continually more smothering the more time went on for him. I've gotten the thought out of my head that its my place to change him, especially when hes not doing something seriously detrimental to himself (its not like hes not going to class or skydiving without a parachute) the things I was bothered by just dont matter in the grand scheme of things. Hes happier if he can smoke now and again, he likes his beard, and honestly Ive come to appreciate him for the man he is, not my ideal of him. Those are the primary things I did to negatively influence his opinion of me, but another factor in this breakup is his need to work out things in his own life. He's a senior in college and now is stuck between grad school or getting a job right away. Personally I think grad school is a good idea for him for two reason, one being that it gives him a chance to not be entirely responsible right away and take this next summer as a break to spend some much needed time with friends and family before adulthood really starts, and two being that he can go for free at his college since he has a research assistant job, and opportunity that he may never get again. He's overwhelmed by adulthood because he has just kept going and going and going with no time to just be young and carefree, and I think having a little downtime would be great for him. Either way he does genuinely need space to himself, and Im giving him that. I realize I did a lot of things wrong but I'm really doing my best to improve my life and my attitude. I guess what Im asking here is, would any of you men here, after seeing my readiness to realize what Ive been doing wrong, how to fix it and do better overall as a person, would you think I still have a chance to try again in this relationship. He's a very nice guy and while he made mistakes in our relationship a lot of them were a result of me acting desperate when I didnt know any better. He's funny, we got along great when I wasnt acting all nervesy, and we found each other quite physically attractive (we had a passionate sex life right up until the day we broke it off, so at least that wasnt one of the problems). I dont need him in my life, I could definitely survive without him, Im not trying to be one of those desperate ""Ill never live without him"" sort of girls, I just genuinely respect him as a strong human being and enjoy his company a lot, and I want him in my life if I can have him, and if he's willing to have me. So from the mouth of a woman to the ears of the dudes on reddit, please tell me how Im doing."
53666y,5,2016-09-17,Flicker,numbr1beanbag,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/53666y/flicker/,"I don't like hospitals, and I don't like snowstorms.

And I don't like it when the two mix.

As a kid, I was always the one who would either break his arm or his leg, or I would sprain something, etc. You know how it is. Stupid kids doing stupid things that get stupid consequences.

But it was one particular day that made my childhood something that I don't wanna look back on.

It was February 10th, 1997. My fourteenth birthday. I had always loved going outside and playing in the snow, and then coming in for my traditional birthday hot chocolate. My mom would always make it special. Put one of those big jet-puffed marshmallows in it with a candle on top.

But that year, my driveway had been covered inch to inch in a thick layer of ice. After I was done sledding, I had been walking up the slanted walkway on my driveway, when I tripped over my own feet and fell flat on my face. I immediately lifted my face onto my gloves, and when I pulled my hands away, there was a stream of blood coming from my face. Copious amounts.

I yelled loud enough through the red river covering my face so that my mom could hear me. She ran outside, took one look at me, and I saw all the color drain from her face. She's never been to good at looking at blood.

But she shoved the feeling aside just for me, to help me into the house, get me a towel to put on my face, and immediately drove me to the ER. 

When we got there, the line for people waiting to get help was amazing. Some of those people didn't even look like they needed help, and most of them were women or children. My mom grabbed my arm and pushed me through the crowd of people to get to the desk where the interns were trying desperately to get everything situated. My mom took the bloody towel off of my face, put it on the counter, and ordered me to be taken to a room immediately. The intern who was looking at my mother like she was insane just kind of gave me back the towel and lead us to a room.

I held the towel against my face for a good two hours while we waited for a doctor to come in. During that time, my mother had started switching channels on the TV and stopped at the weather channel. A loud clap of thunder went on overhead as the screen displayed a terrible snowstorm heading our way. Then, when the doctor came in with his clipboard, the lights flickered. 

That was not a good sign.

The doctor removed my towel, cringed, and took me into the x-ray room. After they had been taken, my mom got a phone call from my brother and had to step out for a few minutes while we got the x-rays back. The doctor came back in and showed me them, and said that I was really lucky. The break was so bad that one of the larger fragments was just a millimeter away from piercing my brain, which means I was just a millimeter away from instant death. He then asked where my mother was, and I told him that she had just stepped outside the room to make a call. He said he hadn't seen her, so we both came to the conclusion that she had gone to get something to eat or drink. He left the room without another word.

About five minutes later, the lights flickered. 

And then all of the power in the hospital itself went out.

I kind of panicked, but my lack of blood and high dosage of various medications kept me from freaking out too much. I decided to get up and make my way somewhere to grab a flashlight and ask what was going on. I guess the snowstorm had gotten really bad and caused everything to lose power.

I got up, pressed a clean wash rag up against my nose, and walked into the hallway. The entire place smelled like shit, literally. It smelled like decaying carcasses, of what, I really didn't know. When I walked out into the hall, however, everyone was gone. Everything that made the ER resemble an ER was gone. There was nothing except me and the disgusting smell.

By now, I just wanted to get out of here. A roar of thunder rolled over the unfamiliar building, and I was starting to fear my surroundings.

I walked down the hall and tried to see if any of the doors would open, but they wouldn't. They had the paint scratched off of the outsides of them, and every time I went near another one, it smelled even more of shit and dead things. 

And then, at last, one of the doors opened.

But it's contents were disturbing.

There was a dim light coming from a small window next to the ceiling in the very corner of the room, so I could barely see. The smell of rotting things was the strongest it had been the entire time I was there, and there was a pile of something. I went over and kind of nudged it, and it made a sloshing noise. A wet slap sounded throughout the room as I kicked the pile. A disfigured spherical object rolled towards me, where I was standing. 

Then I realized what it was, and ran out of the room to go puke in the hallway.

Who would put a pile of dead, mutilated children inside an emergency room? What kind of sick fuck would do that? It still makes me sick. I have to move on from here, no more details about that. 

Anyway, I finally found a flight of stairs. I tried to make my way down it as fast as I could possibly go. I just wanted to go home. I've now seen things that shouldn't be seen by a fourteen year old.

When I reached the bottom, I found the exit doors. I ran over and tried to open them, but they were locked. Looking around for something to smash the doors with, I heard a groan from one of the closets.

It was a demented sound, something that sounded like it should belong in a horror movie. Then it walked out of the shadows and into the dim light.

The thing had a slender figure, and was crooked. You could hear every bone in it's body grind up against one another as it slowly shambled into view. It was pitch black, and looked like it was covered in oil, the black liquid dripping out of it's gaping maw as it's white eyes glared into my soul. My heart stopped. 

Then I saw it.

A chair, five feet away from the creature. I ran over and grabbed the chair, and ran back over to the door, throwing the chair through the glass. The creature shrieked, and started moving more quickly towards me. I jumped out of the door and looked around for a vehicle or something, something to get out of the place.

A pickup truck out of the corner of my eye caught my attention. I ran over and busted the window with my bare hand just to unlock it. With my bloody knuckles and dried bloody nose, I climbed into the truck and fortunately, found the key. The creature was crawling on all fours towards the vehicle, and I was shaking as I put the key into the ignition. When it started, I floored the gas pedal and drove away.

When I finally made my way home, I got out of the truck and went inside my house to see my mother crying at the table. When she noticed that I had entered the house, a large smile grew on her face.

A few months after my traumatizing experience, I decided to look up what the building was that I had been in. I gave details about the place, and what came up shocked me.

It was an abandoned insane asylum, that held everyone. And one type of person it held was liable for raping and murdering children. And the strangest part? It was at least forty miles away from where the ER was, and I had been missing for approximately six weeks after that. 

Now I don't know what happened during that snowstorm, or what it meant when the lights flickered. But all I know is that I have a true hate for that hospital and snowstorm mix. It truly was my living nightmare."

This FU did not happen recently, but I am writing it now because I finally found it in myself to uncurl from the corner and not force my sadness down with ice cream. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________

Going back to about 8 months, it was my junior year of high school and summer was coming up. Most kids are excited about this time of the year, as they can Neflix, game, or screw around for 2 months. However, seeing as how it was my last summer before I applied for college, I really wanted to do something meaningful. I know it's probably not a surprise to many to hear that I aspire to pursue medicine as an Asian, but it is just what I'm genuinely passionate about. I spend a few weeks researching online for medical programs and finally decided on a few to apply for. Within the pile of rejection letters, I was accepted into a summer volunteer program by a well-known hospital. Needless to say, I was pumped and felt as if I had already become a doctor. 

Fast forward a few months, I finished the orientation and training and had been placed into the Pediatrics department. The placements were random, but to be honest I was really hoping to land in a surgical department. Weeks pass and I get pretty comfortable with the floor staff and begin to really enjoy my time there. I take this chance to talk to the department manager about my interest in surgery. To my surprise, she was really supportive and hooked me up with a Pediatric Neurosurgery PA. 

On the first day, I wake up at the asscrack of dawn and got there an hour early to make a good impression. For clarity sake, let's call him Stavis. Stavis asked me a few questions I had expected beforehand, such  as: ""why do you want to be a doctor?"". I guess he liked my answers because his stern countenance gradually became friendlier. After that, he introduced me to the team and I followed them on their rounds. On the way, the physician seemed really curious about me and kept engaging me in conversations. Usually, I'm pretty natural at these things, but I was extremely intimidated by this guy. Mind you, Stavis showed me the neurosurgery book that the physician wrote and told me about how he invented his own surgical procedure, so it's hard not to respect this man for his mad intelligence and feel like a puny tick in his presence. I overhear the nurses joking around, calling him ""Mr. Sunshine"" on the way to the patient rooms. I only wish I found out the reason sooner.

The whole experience felt so surreal, going room to room and seeing real life situations of people. It's one thing to see it in movies and shows, but to be there in actual person and witness the pain that these families had to go through brought out a whole new level of compassion. The team went into a break room after the rounds and they started joking around and gossiping. The physician turned his attention to me and asked me questions about school and my interests. It was at this point I discovered the meaning behind his name. I told him about my robotics team and he shot everything down in the most negative way possible. Every year the competition that our team competes in releases new game rules which teams have to design and build a robot to compete in. Halfway through my explanation, he cuts me off and tells me he's only interested in our robot. So I describe our robot and the capabilities we incorporated into its design. He responds be saying, ""So you don't build actual human-like robotics? They're just little cars that go around shooting balls? That's disappointing."" I understand that he's smart and all, but does he really expect high school kids to be building androids? After this I was pretty much speechless and gave short one word answers, wishing I never said anything in the first place. 

The team had to go into surgery and I guess that's where my day was gonna end because I didn't think I would be allowed in the operating room. I waited for them to let me know it was time to part, but I didn't believe my ears when the RN told me Mr. Sunshine asked if I wanted to join them. I was at a loss for words and all I wanted to do was give her a hug and thank god bestowing me this opportunity. She told me I needed to complete an MRI training and she'll schedule me to come whenever there are good surgeries to watch. Fast forward a few weeks, my volunteer program had already ended and I confirmed with the program director that it's okay for me to shadow the surgeon. It was also complicated to work out my school schedule with my counselor, but that also worked out in the end. Everything was going so smoothly, it felt like all the stars perfectly aligned for me to be able to do this.

Finally, the scheduled date comes and I'm rolling around in my bed all night waiting for the asscrack of dawn once again. I debate for a while what I should wear and ended up choosing a pair of Khakis and a Black and white plaid shirt on top of a t-shirt. Little did I know, this 10 minutes of time would fuck up everything. 

Once again I arrive about an hour early and look for the RN. I've mainly been communicating with her about scheduling and training so I thought it would only be appropriate to meet up with her first. She sent me the code for the lobby door and told me to meet up with her in the x-ray room. I start punching in the numbers to the lobby door but I guess I entered something wrong so I pull out my phone to check the code again, but right at that moment Mr. Sunshine appears from the corner and gives me this suspicious look. I greet him and he opens the door for me, giving me a gesture to welcome me in but at the same time sending a suspicious look. 

I walk down the hall trying to locate an ""x-ray room"", but no luck. I walk back to try to find Mr. Sunshine and when I approached him, he stopped me before I can say anything and asked, ""Why are you here? Who are you?"" I felt my heart skip a beat and I wish time froze because I did not see this coming and didn't know how to respond. I guess it's no surprise he forgot about me after a few weeks, so I tried to calm myself down and explain the situation to him. I begin by going back to how I was a part of the volunteer program and shadowed this department. Then about how the RN had told me he offered to let me in the operating room. Before I could finish, he cuts me off again saying, ""Nono I don't care, why are you dress like that? You can't be here dressed like that, you should be arrested."" I was so confused at this point because the RN had told me I could wear anything since I'll be wearing scrubs anyways. I continued to attempt at maintaining my composure, but at this point, the ruckus had brought the department manager out of his office and he too started to question me.

 I felt my knees starting to feel weak at this point and started panic inside. I tell them to let me call the RN so she could help me clear things up. Turns out, the RN is relatively new and I found out she might lose her job over this. The department manager calls the RN and tells her to come over immediately and he scolds at both of us. While he is scolding, Stavis and Mr. Sunshine walks by with the team and I heard Stavis saying, ""It's not that bad, he's just wearing a torn up shirt."" I've been through a lot of bullying before, but that single sentence literally crushed me. At that point, I just kept my head down and waited for everything to be over. The RN apologized to me after all that and I let her know that it's okay and I should be sorry for risking her job. I told her I'll never show my face there again and left. When I arrived home, my parents had just woke up to go to work and asked me why I had come home so soon. I couldn't find face them and went straight to my room wishing I could just fall asleep and wake up to a bad dream. But in the end, reality is reality and I had to face the fact that I just did the biggest FU of my life.

TL;DR: Got offered a chance to intern with a genius surgeon as a high school student, didn't find out about the dress code, told to never show my face there again.

53875g,3,2016-09-17,Advice on dealing with an (increasingly) worse job,enginthroawa,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/53875g/advice_on_dealing_with_an_increasingly_worse_job/,"I took an internship over the summer across the country from where I lived with the federal government.  The department which I am in does engineering but they also do several other things very different from engineering.

During the time I was there several people left and the management structure changed.  So totally different management than the few months before.  But the old management seemed pretty good so when the new management offered me a position I said I would take it.  (I transition from intern to regular hire quite soon.)

Increasingly, under this new management, this job has gotten steadily more awful.  When I interviewed I was very explicit that I had a date for my FE exam set and that I expected to receive the sort of training which would lead to my PE, eventually.  I handed my boss the requirements of the kind of work that is expected and as far as I could tell, there was a pretty explicit understanding that this is the sort of work I would be doing.  My bosses boss even had a discussion with me about exactly how they planned on doing it.

Until about two weeks ago when someone else in the department decided to take another job elsewhere and I was told I would fill in for her duties indefinitely.  This wasn't even told to me directly.  My boss said I was doing it ""For now."" and then when he was talking to someone else in the field about my duties he said I would be doing it ""indefinitely.""

When I complained to him about the difference between expectation when I accepted the job and the expectations now and how they had changed so drastically he pretty much said ""Tough shit.  You can transfer out after your probation period.""  My probation is 2 years.  he also said I could get work in engineering eventually and pretty much I had to be patient about it but I was doing this other thing indefinitely.  So I'm not sure how that translates into fulfilling anything I asked for.  It seems more like ""We didn't lie to you, because you'll get one of the few things you asked for in your interview, eventually, at a time of our choosing.""

In addition, he hasn't told the person who is training me work completely unrelated to engineering that this is neither my field nor my interest so I had to explain this all to her, because she couldn't figure out why I wasn't showing that much interest in what she is training me in.

In addition to this, my boss often makes inappropriate jokes about women in the workplace, often to my face.  And maybe this would be less of a problem for me if the office I am in made it clear in any other way that they cared about my career goals.

I plan on quitting in 3 months if I don't have any other job offers, move back home, and do nothing but job search and study for my FE (if I don't pass it the first time).  Also, I was taken on as a regular hire, not in the recent graduates program.  Any other advice on how to deal with this situation?  Also, advice on applying to other federal jobs now?  (I have a couple of interviews coming up so I'm hopeful I won't have to do this.)"

538osc,0,2016-09-17,[California] I believe I was fired from my internship unjustly,firedthrowawayunjust,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/538osc/california_i_believe_i_was_fired_from_my/,"I am looking for assistance as to the next steps that I can take as I was fired from my internship for what I believe were unjust reasons.

I was interning at a newspaper. It was made clear to me that we were to get the story at all costs and to put our body on the line if needed and even under threat of arrest to do whatever we need. I was not working at the time, but I came upon a car accident that was obviously a hit and run.

I was in the process of taking photos and making notes for about 15 or 20 minutes when a woman driving by also stopped. She told me she was a cop but wasn't in uniform and threatened to ""smash my phone"" because I was taking pictures. She called other cops and ambulances.

The cop asked me where I worked and called my boss and I got fired. Among the reasons were disobeying a police officers order to stop and step back and not calling 9-1-1 and instead taking photos of the people inside the car and the damage instead of helping. Apparently one them died. They were both still breathing the entire time I was on the scene and I had nothing to do with causing the accident or the death. The other person is still in the hospital. The hit and run driver was arrested not far away and he was impaired.

I'm currently a high school senior that has UCLA as my top choice of college. I've decided that I want to major in Computer Science, but I've heard that getting into UCLA CS is difficult, and I'm afraid of getting rejected. I have a 4.36 weighted total GPA, and a 3.98 unweighted total GPA (not including senior year). I got a 35 on the ACT, and got seven 5's on AP Exams, and one 4. I got an 800 on SAT 2 math, but only 700's on US history and Biology. My extracurriculars are also strong, with over 1000 hours in volunteering, and two internships this past summer. My questions are:

1. Will the two 700's on the SAT 2 subject tests significantly hurt my chances at getting in, and should I retake them to try to get higher?

2. If I applied to UCLA for computer science, what are my chances at getting in?

3. Is applying for computer science and engineering easier to get in than just computer science?

4. My brother who goes to UCLA suggested to me to apply for bio as a major so I have a higher chance of getting in. He told me that if I got all A's the first year, then I would be able to transfer majors into CS. Is this a viable plan?

Thanks for any advice/suggestions, and let me know if there are any questions."

538x0v,3,2016-09-17,"1st year 7th Grade teacher, Struggling with confidence",teacherburneraccount,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/538x0v/1st_year_7th_grade_teacher_struggling_with/,"This will be a little ranty and unorganized so forgive me. I'm unloading a lot from my brain. 

I'm fresh from receiving my MAT, where I did a field experience and full time internship at an inner-city high school and another field experience at a middle school. Loved both experiences, loved both age groups. I'm entering my 8th week at my dream job, teaching 7th grade ELA at a quality middle school, but I'm having serious confidence issues that I need some clarity and feedback on.

I've read the research. I've studied Wong, Jones, Marzano, Tovani, Gallagher, Schlechty, Payne, Wormeli, and others tirelessly. I've done my absolute best to implement these practices as effectively as possible, but I'm still struggling, particularly with classroom management, which was NEVER an issue during student teaching. I spent my high school placements working with very difficult kids with very tough backgrounds, and my calm and persistent demeanor combined with a caring attitude kept everything running smoothly, but almost none of my tricks are working on my behavior problem kids. I would say that out of my 85 students, about a dozen are serious problems, but man that small bunch is rocking my world. At the start of the year, the school counselor informed me that since my team had 2 male teachers, we were the official ""dumping ground, where all the turds go."" 

The same calmness, politeness, and persistence that worked at my previous schools draws ridicule and defiance from these particular kids, who can be very abrasive and loud, completely distracting the rest of the class from getting things done. Instead, I tried mimicking what I saw other teachers doing around the school, barking orders. Not yelling, not screaming, but certainly raising my voice and dropping the friendly attitude. I not only hate what this does to the tone of my classroom, but I hate what it does to my nerves. I also started resorting to written referrals and removal of privileges at the behest of my team leader (something I never touched as a student teacher). These actions would draw total indignant reactions, creating shouting matches in the middle of my classroom. If I try to remain calm, they angrily rant, if I try to respond, they argue louder. This would also draw in friends who would either join in to rise to their defense or create even further disruptions. They feel completely persecuted by me, as if I'm this unfair, tyrannical monster. The thing is, I bring these concerns to my team teacher, and she feels I'm not being strict enough. 

I need to say that I love my job. I think about it 24/7. I love my kids and I love what I do, but I cannot help but feel inadequate at it. When these problems occur, they completely throw me off of my rhythm, causing me to bog down into low self-esteem and make me disappointed in my performance by the time I leave. I've also had to experiment, find a classroom structure that works for both me and my students (going from 95 minute classes to 50 has been quite difficult), and get an understanding of my curriculum and how best to teach it. I admit this has created some inconsistency in structure and that's sure to frustrate the kids, but I can't know what works until I've tried it. My issue is that I'm feeling bad that the students have to receive a mediocre education for a year while this new guy is up here trying to figure his job out. I can't help but feel this is unfair to them. My team leader is a 20 year vet, very successful and well-liked at the school, but when I come to her for feedback and support, I get the impression that I'm just lowering her opinion of me. Three weeks into school she told me that she was ""officially worried about me"" after going to her to vent about areas that I was struggling with and wanted to improve on. I thought this was a key aspect to having a mentor, at least it was at my previous schools. 

Then there's the curriculum. My school requires a LOT of pre-assessment the first quarter for ELA, because they scored the poorest in these areas. It is full of (dull) writing prompts and lengthy assignments that are way outside of the context of what I'm otherwise teaching. This causes animosity from the kids who are starting to vocalize their boredom and comparing me to their other teachers on the team who teach tons of fun stuff, but I can't help that their upcoming benchmark will cover mostly grammar, which is difficult to make exciting every day. 

I guess what I'm struggling with is the fact that I'm not amazing out of the gate, my students have to receive a substandard education while I figure things out, and I'm working alongside veterans and feel expected to deliver the same quality of instruction as them. I'm not typically a person without confidence, but this has been a real struggle. I will say that my inclusion teacher, who works with me during my first (and best) class, thinks I'm doing fantastic for a first year, but none of the students I have difficulty with are in that class. 

Thank you for those willing to listen to me vent. Any feedback, encouragement, and smacks upside the head are more than welcome. "

I'm currently studying for my Masters in Information Systems. My undergrad was in Health Administration. I have no IT experience, but a willingness to learn and the belief that I should have the aptitude to learn this field. I'm taking some prep courses as part of my degree to make up for what I missed in the bachelor (it's required to take these classes). I'm taking a class in C#, and will be taking classes dealing with database design, systems analysis, etc.

Anyways, I'm a realist (and also a worry-wort!) and know that I can't exactly trust the department head when he says I'll be making $80k after graduation. However, he says that internships are usually the way to go when it comes to getting jobs. I will probably get one next summer after finishing my prep courses.

Okay, to the point. What can I feasibly accomplish (as in, certs and  other opportunities) having no IT experience in these next two years while I finish my degree? In what order? Will my degree hold some weight on it's own? 

As for what I want, at some point I would like to get into security, but I'm at the point in my life (age 23) where I have to start getting my career together. My naive mind thinks that a possible path would be starting as maybe a network/sys admin then database admin, and so on. But really, I just want that first big boy job I can make a solid living off of. I'd like to be making at least 45-50k before I turn 30!:(

Company A was aware company B was trying to recruit me, so they unexpectedly sent me a full time job offer a month before anyone in their intern pool in an attempt to prevent company B from having time to send me an offer. I immediately informed company B of the timeline, and they were not able to give me raw numbers until a week after I signed with company A (they were 100% aware I had signed with A but were hoping that I would renege the job offer). Company B's offer was roughly $25k more a year, with better benefits, in a role I was far more interested in. 
Through my internships and scholarships, Company A has roughly dropped $80k on me throughout college, but has made me extremely angry in the past because they paid me $3k/month less than all of the interns because I do not have a petroleum engineering background. Additionally, my full time offer at company A is less than those with petroleum engineering degrees simply because of my degree, not because of my contributions (I build oil software that has saved the company several million).

53ezs1,1,2016-09-18,Moving to a new city as a teacher Help??,Quicksilver9014,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/53ezs1/moving_to_a_new_city_as_a_teacher_help/,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm super worried about the next step of my life so I made a reddit account to get some help (this is my first post). I plan to move to Oregon next year but I don't have any connections. How would an individual go about booking a job in a city they've never been to, especially in the field of education where schools are only hiring at a certain time of year for the next year? 



Specifically- How should I go about researching which schools to apply to work at? I don't just want a job, I want the RIGHT job (see the bottom of this post).  I need a way of researching schools! I feel like most school websites are not effective indicators  as to what the school is actually like and I only have a few days max to explore/interview so I can't just go visit each and every school at my own pace. Further, I feel like most schools that have their acts together wouldn't feel the need to resort to online job adds, so I do not think that to be the most prudent course of action either. 



Further- Even if I find the ideal fit, how can I convince them to hire someone who is flying out for an interview and who has to transfer his credential (from California to Oregon) when they could just as easily choose someone who is already local? While it is effectively a sure-thing that a California teaching credential will translate to an Oregon one, the process can take between 3-5 months to go through. 



______________________________________________________________________________

About me:
 I am 25 and I am in my 2nd year of teaching. I possess  California Single Subject teaching credentials in both Social Science, as well as Science, with a specialization in Physics and a supplementary authorization in Spanish Language.  (Effectively I am legally credentialed to teach non-AP Spanish classes, History classes, general science classes, and Physics classes). I was doing an Intern Credential program this past year, wherein I was getting a teaching credential while working full-time as a World History teacher. I decided to quit the program (I didn't have enough in me to do night classes while trying to handle myself in my 1st year of teaching w/o any prep) in order to pursue adding the ability to teach Science, Physics, and Spanish to my teaching credential. I will be finishing up my program this year but I don't want to stay in Los Angeles where I currently reside and will be completing my student-teaching. I've always wanted to move to Oregon (beautiful weather, culture, and amazing quality of life there), and when I found out that a woman that I am in love with will might be moving there I figured that it was a sign that now was the time to make the move! I have enough savings to last me no problem, but I worry about being seriously considered for a job when I am not even currently residing in the state the job is in!

_______________________________________________________________________________


What I am looking for in a school:

-Not overly conservative politics present in the community in question (relevant to my curriculum as a History teacher as well as a Science teacher)

- The school where classrooms are funded sufficiently .I'm ok with falling apart buildings and no textbooks etc... I just need to make sure that the materials I need for physics will be compensated effectively by the school. I additionally would strongly prefer to be working at a school where I have the option to check out a laptop cart for my classroom

- A school where I wont have more than 30 students in each class,

- Where the educational philosophy of the school really emphasizes creating a love of learning (not opposed to any specific type of highschool. Does not matter if it is a private, charter, religious, Summerhill, Montessori, hippie, public or whatever kind of school). 

__________________________________________________________________________________

I feel that I am a desirable enough candidate, with my various teaching credentials and my not being a first year teacher, to be a tad picky (specifically since I am ok with mediocre pay at this time in my life) but I have never researched outside of schools in Los Angeles and truly have no idea what I am talking about. 

Am I being unrealistic? Is it even possible to get hired as a teacher in a new city without any contacts? Any advice comments or suggestions? I feel very alone in this decision and need consult. "

So I think an execution role in HFT would be good for me. But then I've started taking a few outside courses in machine learning and it's pretty interesting to me. I'm thinking of taking some more stats classes and the idea of working with statistical models is interesting as well. I don't know about a PhD in mathematics, its a pretty big commitment and if I can make good money as a quant developer or HFT then so be it. Im in second year and I'm thinking about some internships in SV in ML and development before moving onto some internships at Citadel or something. Would my background in ML do anything for me at Citadel? What are my exit options as a quant developer?"

I'm currently a senior at a fairly decent college and will be graduating next May. I'm sitting at a 3.9 GPA and have 2 internships under my belt, 1 of which I'm still working at. Additionally, I'm in a year-long senior project course that is being sponsored by a moderately large company (hoping to learn machine learning out of this). I will say that I have very minimal side-project experience aside from a small dinosaur plotting web app I made and code I've written from ProjectEuler. Lastly, I have very little experience with technical interviews, I'm really scared for these.

I'm in a long-distance relationship with someone that is in New York (Manhattan). I've been stressing out a bit because that relationship essentially rides on whether or not I can find a job in New York. I feel pretty good about my resume (is it against the rules to post this?) and have spent the last week applying for different jobs in that area but have yet to receive anything back.

Without rambling too much further, my question is: Does it seem like I'd be able to work in a place such as New York City?  Is it difficult to find a job in Manhattan or nearby? I'm not really looking to work for a top 4 company and would be alright working at a mid-tier company (I have pretty high anxiety so less stressful the better). Additionally, my internships have been very research/data driven; writing Python scripts and packages for data analysis, visualization, etc. - I have very little software development experience (the senior project I'm in will help with this). Is this a skillset that is sought after and if so, where? I really don't know where to start looking.

Any help would be really, really appreciated. Thanks!"

___________________________(Part 1)_____________________________


***I awake, my palms suddenly cold, clammy***

The days have started to move more quickly now. Flickering, obsolete conversations that I can't recall a single word from. Food I remember eating but not tasting. I had to check the date three times before I really believed it. Four months. It had been almost seventeen weeks since that night. The night the five of us went into the black cave, near the lake and dead center in Rudy's Forest. Rudy was an original founder of our small town, died over two hundred years ago, and helped plant part of what is now his forest. My younger brother by a year, Cody and I had built a treehouse in the forest as kids.

***Stinging goosebumps crawl over my whole body***

We found a small clearing one night, with only two trees right in the middle of it about three feet apart. Perfect for a big tree house. It wasn't very sophisticated, and it creaked loudly when it was windy; but it had two rooms, a bed, hammock, all of our comics and books, and an amazing view of the forest canopy. We spent most of our teenage years there, until that night.

***Small specs of sweat slowly streak down my face***

Dave originally brought up the idea of a group camping trip, which was typical for him. He loved the outdoors more than we did, so much so that he volunteered as a Jr. Park Ranger in Rudy's Forest. I grew up with Dave and as kids he was always with us exploring the forest. 

I was up for a camping trip, needing an escape after the hell of a finals week we had all been through.

""I am so down. I haven't been to the lake in forever, and it would be really cool to visit the old clubhouse. How about it guys?"" I asked the rest of the group.

""I'm free. Would love to spend some time outdoors! You're gonna go right Cody?"" said Sky, giving Cody a longing look that everyone noticed except him. Sky professed her love for Cody over six months ago, but his life was so crowded with summer school and his law internship that he barely even realized she was serious.

***My pulse races with the sound of slowly approaching footsteps***
 

""Yeah yeah I'll be there guys. Probably have some work stuff to do though while we're out there though."" my brother said ignoring Sky, as he furiously texted what I assumed to be one of his many bosses.


""Jax how about you, you ready to finally see the place Dave and I have told stories about since you've known us?"" I asked, lightly shoving him in attempt to exhume his nose buried in one of the many Time Wheel novels. His love for reading fantasy was only surpassed by his love for writing it. I always told him the forest would give him great material for a story.

***My vision blurs as a shadow flickers on the edge of the firelight***

""Hmm? Sorry, what did you ask me? Why are you pushing me Luke? I'm just finding out about the One Power! I wish stuff like this was real so much!"" he exclaimed, oblivious to our proposal.

""The One Power? Huh?"" Dave said with mock interest.

""Nevermind that. Jax! Camping, Rudy's Forest, all of us, beer, bonfire, good times. Yay or nay?"" I said, trying to make it easy for him to pick out the basics as he continued reading.

""Sounds good, I'm up for whatever just let me know what you guys want to do."" he replied without looking up. I slapped my forehead, rolling my eyes at the rest of the group.

""Okay he's in. Cool looks like were all going. Lets say meet back here tomorrow morning and we'll take Dave's truck if that's cool with everyone?"" I asked looking around at everyone.

""Fine by me, just had her scrubbed up."" Dave agreed. We all went home to pack and get ready for what we hoped would be an amazing time.

***All around me lit up for a brief second as if lightning had struck outside. I saw the creature looming in the entrance to the cave. It was back from hunting, empty handed again. How long could it go without eating before I became its next meal. It made its way towards me, slowly dragging its deformed body across the damp cave floor. The fire seemed to be playing tricks on my eyes because the creatures shape kept changing. One second massive and lumpy with growths protruding out of it; the next skinny and hollow like a skeleton. The smell got worse as it crept nearer, until the air was thick with the bitterness. Soon darkness black as death engulfed me.***

53gota,0,2016-09-19,Keep making mistakes in new job and terrified,arghsoscared,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/53gota/keep_making_mistakes_in_new_job_and_terrified/,"Hiya, so after a 4 month job search, I managed to find a full time job in customer service, for a company that delivers food around the city. 

Before this position I was doing internships, and before that I was let go from an estate agent job after 5 months for making mistakes. I over-ordered stationery, and didn't call a customer by their name in an email.

Needless to say I'm terrified of being fired again, as the experience was so traumatic.

Well, you've guessed it - 2 weeks in and I keep making silly mistakes. I sometimes filled out spreadsheets incorrectly, and I did not stay on top of drivers' schedules, so when they fell behind, I didn't notify the customer in time. Some customers came back furious. On top of this, I get through the work slower than the rest of my team.

I also had to work alone the other day, and I felt like I was finally doing better. I was getting through the issues, logging them properly, and watching the drivers' schedules like a hawk. However, right near the end of the day, I received an email from a very irate customer from 2 days before that I had scheduled her delivery for the wrong day, and that as a result her dying friend would have to go without the goods. 

I had a panic attack and started hyperventilating and crying. Just as I had thought everything had gone well, this happened. I immediately let my manager know about my mistake, who handled it. I was so mortified, and told her as much. She responded that mistakes happen, and that from now on she'd monitor my emails until I get used to it.

I really don't want to be a liability to my team, and I'm so horrified that I caused that much damage two weeks in. I was so happy to get the job after so long, and thought that this time, everything would be different. 

I trained people during my internship after just two weeks, and I was the go to person for procedures and customer issues. I also was an extremely competent teacher abroad who trained others for years. I really don't know how I could be such a fuck up, and seen as a liability so quickly.

The one thing I think I did differently was going to my manager first as soon as I found that email. In my estate job I tended to shy away from the managers, as the workplace was a very hostile environment.

Now the manager wants to catch up when I'm next in. I'm so terrified of being fired that my whole weekend was spoiled. I've become so depressed and fearful that it's affected my sleep, and I feel like crying all the time. I think I have some sort of PTSD from the estate job that's finding its way into my new one. I really wanted to excel in this company. 

The one thing I can think of is that these events have been so traumatic that I'd never want to experience them again, so I've become much more vigilant. I am worried about the speed at which I'm currently working. 

Any advice? I'm so afraid right now."

I finished taking all the required classes - I forgot to apply for graduation to receive the actual degree. So I didn't get it until this past May). 

Had no idea what I wanted to do with my life at this point. Took about 8 months off from October. working at a middle school and a grocery store. I still work at the middle school. 

Missed studying and going to school, decided to major in Finance - not knowing too much about the field, just knew you can make a lot of money. I've mapped it so that I know I'll graduate by the end of the summer 2017. Kind of feel like I'm falling behind the 'race', so I want to finish it as fast as I can. 

After reading a number of the top posts on this sub, it seems that I should have a few things defined before looking for internships/jobs. I know I want a solid steady income, to live in a big city, more or less a demanding/stressful job- something that no more than 60+- hrs/week. 

Also, as I'm taking finance/economics classes I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to understand: 1. the whole system of finance/banking/economics , 2. what exactly Finance entails , 2a. what part I see myself working in/what interests me the most. (My idealized interest would be in trading like how its depicted in movies/TV, where you're at a stock exchange and yelling over one another,everything looks chaotic, etc... but as far as I know this isn't anymore - it's all electronic now). 

Another thing I've read is to be good at programming. Can you explain why programming would be important? And which programming language (is this the correct term?) is most popular/useful- I'm thinking of Java, Linux, etc? 
In terms of excel, I'm decent in it - know I can be better. I do plan on spending a lot of time learning more, come October. 

I think I should've applied to internships over 2 summers ago to build experience. If I apply now to some internships, it'll be in my last 5 classes of my degree (not giving me too much experience as others will have), depending on if I were to get accepted. Would I just continue to intern after I graduate to build experience? 

My school has a minor/program that prepares students to take the CFP exam (it's approved by the actual CFP Board), would this benefit me even if I know financial planning isn't necessarily something that interests me? 

Thanks in advance!"

I was twice in the USA for holiday and i really liked it there. So I decided that I want to live there atleast for some time.
I'm currently study computer science (bachelor) in germany and will graduate in about 1 year.
As a working student (20hr/week) I already gathered about a year experience in software development and also I need to do an internship.
Basically I just have some question:

* I heard that the job market is good for computer science graduates. But how are the chances for foreigners?
* Is it possible, in term of visa, to do my internship in the usa and do companys even take foreigners as interns?
* Should I rather stay in germany and get some more experience and try to move after some years?
* I kinda like colder weather more then super hot summer. Are there any big tech cities like San Francisco in areas where it is a little bit colder? (spring and autumn are my favorite seasons due the whether :D) 
* For which visas would I be qualified for?

That were my first questions :D
I would be really happy if someone could give me some informations about them.

What should I do?,caloriemonster,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/53iobd/chemical_engineering_graduate_of_2013_no_real/,"Here is my resume for some background: http://imgur.com/a/vpq2I

This might seem like a stream of consciousness post so I apologise:

I graduated from chemical engineering in 2013 with a good GPA and took a job in regulatory affairs which is what I had done a co-op in. It was not really relevant to my field but I took what I got. After this 14 month contract ended I went to Calgary since at the time the job market there was good but then crashed shortly after. I kept applying to jobs, maybe more than a 1000, got maybe 8 interviews, two of them going to the second stage. Both were in pulp and paper I guess because of my short internship in quality at a tissue plant, but I didnt end up getting the job. Also, looking at new/recent grad job postings, the vast majority require someone who has graduated in the past two years.
I had to work, so did security. I then decided, after being 3 years out of university to go for a course based masters thinking it could help me get internships or maybe full time work. I am completely lost in class as the stuff done in my bachelors is just being skimmed in a couple of classes and then we will be going to more advanced stuff. I ended up dropping those classes and have taken two that I feel I will be able to cope with, however, eventually I will need to take the core courses and get at least a 70% in, otherwise I will be expelled.
Now I am applying for internships so that at least I can get relevant work experience even if i couldnt finish this MEng, and even applying to full time work mentioning the end date of the MEng as ""Tentative"" and saying in the cover letter that I am willing to put it on an indefinite hold for employment.

I dont know what to do, all the time I spent on my bachelors and hard work to get good grades seem like its all been a waste. Any input would be great since I have basically hit rock bottom."

My lenovo ideapad has served me pretty well for three years, but last winter a crack appeared in the plastic body right by the charging report. I got it repaired for ~200 dollars, but now the crack is back, and I think it's time to retire this one. The crack in the plastic is getting bigger every time I open or close the laptop, so while I try to open/close it as little as possible, I can tell that its days are numbered (possibly only a week left). 

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Less than $700, purchasing in the US (in person or online). 

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
My sister got a Dell Inspiron 2-1 this year, and I used it over the summer since my laptop was starting to break. I really liked it! Two-in-one would be great, but not mandatory. I'm not too picky about battery; as long as it lasts about an hour and a half on dim, I'm okay.

* **How important is weight to you?**
Somewhat; I would be carrying it around to class and stuff in addition to textbooks and notebooks, so I would prefer not to be lugging around a monstrous laptop.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 14-15 inches. My sister's inspiron is the 13.3 one and that's one of the few things I didn't like about it.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
N/A
None at all! Don't do any gaming ever haha.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Touch screen would be nice but not compulsory. I would also prefer for the keyboard to not be too noisy, but again it's not a deal-breaker. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I've looked up the 15.6"" version of Dell Inspiron and it seems pretty good. I also have looked up the Dell XPS 13 which looks awesome but totally out of my budget. I don't do anything extraordinary on my computer (I literally just use it for schoolwork (and work for my internship), browsing the internet, and streaming netflix. Should I just stick to what I've used and liked (inspiron 2-in-1)? Or are there others that I should be looking at?

Side note about brand: I've generally had really good customer service experiences with Dell and not very good with Lenovo.

Side note for the budget: My mom is considering paying for a laptop as a birthday present and I think she's more likely to agree if it's within the 400-600 range, so that'd be great! Otherwise, I may be able to get her to pay for ~500 and I would pay the rest."

I'm going to be on a call with the hiring manager soon. Quick background: I went to a target school, got decent grades, and did a few internships. I started the job search arguably late. I spent a month studying and tidying up my resume. I've been on the job hunt for a month now. The company: A mid-sized start-up in SF.

My thoughts: I was surprised at how well I jived with all the engineers during the onsite. I only had 1 technical interview. The other 4 were more behavioral/long term goals/ testing/ect. type interviews. I got a really good vibe from everyone in the company and am interested in the product they are working on. That being said, I'm in the process of potentially interviewing with bigger, more well known companies (still in the early stages of those interviews though). How do I time this?

I didn't really consider working at a start-up right out of college. I thought working at a more established company was more ideal. I don't know how true that is. Thoughts?

How important is the work you'll be working on (in terms of future employment)? This is a front end role, so I'll be working with JavaScript. Would that put me at a disadvantage for future, general software engineering roles? 

Finally: What should I ask the hiring manager? What is the target salary I should be looking for (in SF)? General things to keep in mind when deciding on a new job? 

Thoughts, comments, and advice is appreciated. Don't have too many people to talk to about these things.

Just to be clear, I am a grad student looking for a job in the STEM fields (mostly CFD, Aerodynamics and stuff).

I get a rejection mail form some jobs within a day or so of applying, some jobs don't ever bother to change the status of my application and a couple of them have called me for an interview. From these I have drawn the following conclusions. Could you guys let me know if I am correct or not?

The jobs where I get an almost immediate rejection are those where my CV is rejected by a automatic filter (say scenario A). The jobs where I don't hear back for months are those where I might have passed the filter but have been rejected by a hiring manager and they don't update the status till either they find the person for the job or have identified potential candidates (scenario B). The ones where I had a phone interview also rejected me. One, outright on the phone because I did not have 1 year experience in an industry (intern exp does not count apparently) and another because I did not have the required coursuework/intern experience in one of the subfields of the job ( that is what I thought, or maybe I just didn't do well in the interview). 

So am I correct in my conclusions? I ask this because, I will try and find a pattern in jobs where I get rejected immediately and maybe try and tailor my resume better for those type of jobs. For scenario B, I guess there is not much I can do apart from maybe highlighting my skills and competencies better. Any advice is appreciated.

Roughly about 40 - 50 % of my applications are in scenario A, while the rest are in scenario B. I have had 3 interviews so far and I missed one interview because their mail went into my spam folder and by the time I realised, they had already selected someone. 

Thank you people."

I've been working for a school district doing helpdesk/desktop support kind of stuff with a little bit of sysadmin stuff for a little over two years. The pay is average, the job is low stress, and I get a full pension. But I'm not happy here due to the location (small town Alberta). It's also so easy that I feel like I'm barely learning anything. It's really boring and I feel like I'm wasting my youth.

Just got back from a vacation to Europe and I decided I'm going to move there, particularly Scandinavia. I've learned that English-speaking IT jobs are pretty much non-existent in these countries. English-speaking programming jobs, however, seem to be in abundance. My programming knowledge is pretty basic. At sait I took a couple weeks each of: java, perl, html, css. I went into it with zero programming knowledge and didn't struggle at all, but I never got into object-oriented programming. 

Some questions:

There is a transfer option to a really nice University in Aarhus, Denmark, where I can transfer all my IT courses and have a degree in 1.5 years. There are two options that interest me: [Software Development](http://www.baaa.dk/programmes/it-and-technology/software-development/) and [Web Development](http://www.baaa.dk/programmes/web-media-and-communication/web-development/). I pretty much know for a fact that web development would suit me better, but is it worth taking that in university? From what I understand, web development falls under the software development umbrella anyway, so wouldn't I just want to take that regardless? Or would both degrees be a waste of money? One of my friends said that these both look like ""meme courses"", and he's been a software engineer for a few years now. 

What really catches my eye about these programs is that you get a guaranteed real-world internship. Unpaid, but I think it means you get a work visa in Denmark, something which is near-impossible for a non-EU citizen otherwise. This makes me want to take the program regardless of its content. Perhaps I'm overvaluing this. 

Say I got either of these degrees, are there any career paths where my IT skills could also be a huge asset? Such as server administration, network stuff, customer service skills, etc? 

I think I'm more interested in the web design aspect more than the technical aspect. I have a creative mind and a strong attention to detail. Those are probably my best skills. I'm imagining that the more artistic web jobs are much harder to come by and likely pay less. Is this assumption somewhat accurate?

I'm not too sure what sort of info I'm looking for. Would just like some opinions other than those I got from my friends. I have until March to apply for this school, so if I'm going for it I should probably start self teaching myself some stuff. 

Thoughts? Thanks in advance. "

Note: I change my objective per each position I apply for. It would help if I got some critique on how to make a better general objective statement (if I should included it at all.)

I recently graduated this past May and have been applying to jobs (mainly ""entry level"" IT positions) every week since and so far not a single company has contacted me.  It could be the high saturation of people with higher level education in my area and the fact that many huge IT companies and their headquarters are located where I live. 

I didn't do any internships and wasn't really involved in school organizations, so my working experience in IT is nothing and all I really have to show is my course projects.  I want to pursue a career in database or software engineering, but at this point I realize that with my lack of professional IT experience, I may have to start with help desk positions.

Anyway, I have shown my resume to multiple people in my related field and they have said that it looks fine.  I would appreciate additional criticism.

However, my boss told me I was still not allowed to work overtime because they couldn't afford me in their budget, but that if I needed to keep working (we are severely understaffed and my job expectations are through the roof, also because of other laws my boss breaks that makes me work even more), I would have to clock out and finish the job.

There are some things I know for certain- I am ambitious, I am a romantic type, I care about my family, I like sports (both being active and watching them), so on and so forth. 

That being said, there are some large parts of my identity I am unsure of. I really like the idea of world travelling, but when I have done it twice I didn't even really have that much fun. I studied abroad in a summer program once in Hong Kong (about 1 month long), and pretty much was counting down the days until I could come home for a few reasons (home sickness, lack of comfort in new place, etc). I went to Asia this summer with my dad for a week, and also didn't even really like it (because he was annoying me and I also just kind of like home better to be honest). Now, due to FOMO (fear of missing out), I do want to study abroad for a full semester in Europe, but I'm not even sure if I would like it.

Secondly, I can't really decide which people I want in my life (or even the outlook in life I want). When I see some of my friends from way back, I literally have nothing in common with them because they have zero ambition, and have basically done absolutely nothing with their lives after high school ended. However, when I see people from university clubs and so on, I find that people can be pretty pretentious for their age and are taking life waaaaay too seriously. I can't decide whether to be the 'chill' guy who works at the gym during the summer, or going for banking internships where I will be pumping 80 hours a week out of myself.

Even my political beliefs are somewhat like this. I consider myself to be a very liberal person, and I get offended when many of my male friends have that 'good old boy' type of attitude that is somewhat sexist and racist. But when I have been in groups where everyone is very left wing I basically felt like a cowboy haha.

Most importantly, I have a devil's advocate type view of myself. I tend to view myself as opposite of my surroundings always. 

I am partially asking this question because I have some important decisions to make: the type of full time jobs I look for, whether to study abroad for a semester or do a demanding but rewarding university club, etc "

For example docker is a portable container, you can have a bash script that downloads all code and run your web server with some command, to deploy you basically have to push the image to the server and run the command, but ansible and chef seems to do the same thing too just configuring the server and running it.

Skip to the end if you don't care about the story/intro.

I went off to university in 2009 and fumbled around for several years as a CS major. I considered switching majors but decided that Comp Sci was the only thing that really interested me so I figured I would take time off and get a job while I figure it out. I felt like I was just wasting time/money and was stressing out for no reason. 

Truth be told, I was struggling in my courses but really didn't apply myself. I made it through gradeschool/highschool without ever really doing any work/study and didn't have the discipline to correct my habits in college. 

I managed to take quite a few classes like discrete math, DS/algs, basic programming (oop/java) but really started to fall apart in the higher-level theory classes. One class in particular led me to drop out, it was a programming languages / paradigms courses where we learned common lisp and explored functional concepts. I absolutely loved the class and topics but couldn't finish the first project because I wasn't far enough ahead in my math courses (we had to write a program to differentiate polynomials but I had barely passed pre-calc a semester before). At that point I was panicking and felt like a failure and couldn't imagine ever being able to program professionally without being stressed/anxious all the time.

Ultimately I dropped out and got an internship doing IT support which quickly turned into a fulltime job. It's a stagnant help desk position with pretty much no hopes of moving up internally.

In my free time I've been getting back into programming with the hopes of landing a simple mobile app dev job somewhere. I hate IT more than I ever could have imagined (most of it can probably be chalked up to the environment and work culture here but it's really turned me sour).
I figured I could create a few apps and publish to the playstore as a portfolio but as I dig deeper into the work I'm starting to second guess myself.

Basically, my issue is that I already know enough to be a competent programmer thanks to the courses I managed to pass and I want to be a true software engineer someday, not just the mobile app guy that throws a UI together and does some data binding to tie things up to a DB and call it a day.

**TL;DR** Do I have any hopes of landing an actual software engineering gig some day? Or can I expect to be relegated to web/app dev forever?

Going back to finish my degree is an option but I'm already 25 and would probably have to re-do most, if not all, of the courses. The Gen Eds would probably transfer but I'd essentially have to start from square one in CS courses."

While my ideal choice is working both jobs, my current boss doesn't want me to. 

So assuming I get the other job, I have two options: 

A. Stick with my current tech support position, a much easier job that would pay more for now and possibly show dedication and/or work ethic at a decently early age,  but not learn much in the way of programming

Or 

B.  Take the software development job that would teach me a lot for my (hopefully) future career, a much harder/stressful job that would pay less at first, but would give me a more programming oriented job/ skill set for my resume, as well as fill an internship requirement

*Both jobs have ~ the same pay cap,  it would just be a matter of if/when I hit it. 

Any advice? "

I graduated with a BS in information technology a few months ago. I completed an internship as the last requirement for my degree. At my internship I was told that I would be hired on full time but the last day on my internship I was told that ""they aren't sure if they have the room/budget to keep me"". This put me in a bad situation because I had stopped looking for jobs because I thought I already had one. This was also a day before I left for annual training for 3 weeks for the Army National guard, where I would not be able to apply/interview for jobs. Upon returning from AT, I started applying for as many jobs as I could most via Indeed or similar sites. Since I was not working, I had a lot of downtime and was able to live off money in my savings. With this downtime i studied for my CCNA (I got my CCENT a year earlier while still in college). I started getting calls back regarding positions I had applied for, mostly for helpdesk positions. I also got a few call backs and scheduled interviews for positions that required a CCNA. I sat for my CCNA a few days before most of the interviews and I passed so this made my so much for valuable to them and I was going into the interviews with a lot more confidence because I was more qualified than what they previously thought. 

I had about 15 in person interviews in a span of 2 weeks. It was crazy but I knew I needed to do it. Since I had a lot of interviews, I then got more calls and requests for second interviews. 

Last week, I stared getting calls from company's I had interviewed with and starting getting job offers (a few offered me the position the same day I interviewed). 

I am now sitting in a position where I have about 7 or 8 job offers on the table where I get to pick and choose which ones I like/dislike. All of the positions are offering good money. Anywhere between 45K to 60K. Some are helpdesk positions and a few others are actually entry/associate level network positions. I am currently still deciding which job to take but it's nice having many different options and companies to choose from. 

I can't stress it enough, if you have downtime, STUDY!! Self learning can go along way and show a company that you are committed to your field. Also don't be afraid to apply for jobs you feel you are unqualified for. I have applied for numerous jobs I feel I am unqualified for and a few of those jobs have offered me positions. When you interview, sell yourself to them and tell them what you bring to the table without lying!

There is hope and you will find a job. Stick to it and continue to learn on your own. Hopefully this help if not motivates some of you looking for jobs. It's been a tough long run for me but it's finally over and i can finally pick a job that I actually want to do. GOOD LUCK!

tl:dr - if you are looking for a job and have downtime, study for certs and get them. Also don't be afraid to apply for jobs you feel you are unqualified for. "
53nss6,1,2016-09-20,Feeling discouraged. How hard is it to find a job after graduating?,serinxandar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53nss6/feeling_discouraged_how_hard_is_it_to_find_a_job/,"So this may seem like a very dumb question to many of you but I am feeling very discouraged lately at the jobs prospects after graduation. I am graduating spring of this next year. 

I got my first programming job for the school of education at my university. Many of my co-workers there were information systems majors this seemed odd that there weren't many other CS majors there. After working there and getting a handle on some basic web technologies I got an internship working at a startup where I have worked for 8 months doing work on their front and back end. They recently hired another intern that is an IS major. 

Now to the point of the post. This new intern has way more experience than me. Even though he is a junior he had an internship at a large company, has several impressive personal projects, and just seems like he is ahead of me in knowledge of technology. I felt similarly inadequate at my first job and now I feel even more so. 

I don't feel like I can compete with people like this for jobs because I have no time to work on any personal projects because I work over 20 hours a week and have 4 CS classes. My new coworker (and I feel like most IS majors) has 1 CS class and is otherwise is just taking business classes. This offers him way more time to go to events on campus, and work on personal projects. Basically what I am asking is, how much is experience weighed over technical knowledge ( algorithms, data structures, design patterns)?  Would it be better to try and find time to work on personal projects or use that time to study principles?"

When I go into bios/uefi settings for my thinkpad and select to boot from usb, the screen goes blank and returns right back to the menu of the bios.

53oe24,3,2016-09-20,Conflicted with new internship teaching children how to code,cheeekyslug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53oe24/conflicted_with_new_internship_teaching_children/,"So I'm about a month into this new internship teaching 7-10 year olds how to code in Javascript in an afterschool program. This is with a 1-year old start up.

I am not getting paid for this, I do it because I thought it would be fun and it takes up my free time that I don't need. But I love the class I'm working with and I look forward to every time I come in.  The CEO dabbled with a paid internship, but he has never brought it up again. 

I work directly with the CEO in the afterschool program. He never gave me the company's shirt which makes the kids a bit intimidated to ask me questions. I never got to introduce myself, and just have me interacting with the kids. I don't like him very much, I feel like he's ingenuine to the kids and has big ego for starting a startup at 21.  

There's a lot of issues that make this very stressful and I am not quite sure how much I really enjoy the company itself:

1. I didn't realize this, but each kid in the program pays nearly $1000 for 15 weeks of coding. I thought the school was providing this service and all the funding had been done by the school. Remember, I don't get paid for this and there's 20 kids in the program. The school provides the computers so it was no expense on the company's part. The CEO is an unfinished business-management major too, so I'm just questioning if CS is really his passion. 

2. For one, the app that they're using times out, so if you're writing code, it will randomly restart. I remember this kid was so frustrated because he wrote 30 lines of code and it all disappeared. There is no Save button on this app, you can only save your work once. He keeps blaming the ""internet quality"" but I know it could be a potentially a bug in the app. 

3. Unprofessionalism by the CEO. We contact through text, he's always late, he makes me take the kids out to pass out snacks and for recess. Later down the road if I need a reference, I could already tell that he would definitely not be the most dependable person.

4. I always ask ""Is there anything you would like for me to work on next week?"" and he gives me the most blunt answer. I would enjoy try teaching the class on my own, since I have 4 years of science education experience and there's a lot of flaws in his lessons. None of the kids ever work on the coding assignments that he does and he expects kids to finish up 2 full pages of class notes in 10 mins. 

The company itself just seems disorganized. However, since I switched into CE recently, this is what I have to work with. I am currently applying for summer internships at the moment so I was hoping that this will give me something to talk about in interviews. 

How can I make this less miserable due to the CEO?  "

I'm a bit of a lurker on this sub, but decided to post because I need your advice ! 

I'm currently enrolled in a masters program in France (grande école). I have the opportunity to do a 6 month co op/internship next semester and I'd really like to do it in the US (I am a US citizen so I don't need a visa or anything) because I'd like to go back to the US when I finish my studies.

When I browsed this sub, it seems like talking to recruiters really helps when looking for an internship. Unfortunately I can't do any of that because I'm on the other side of the Atlantic. On top of that, I don't have a network in the US because I've been living in France for years now.

Also last time I was looking for an internship, I applied for a quite a few offers in the US that I had found on indeed.com. It didn't work (I ended up finding something in Europe though). I don't know if it was because my application was poor, or if the recruiter/algorithm didn't understand my CV (because the engineering system is different here) etc.
What is your experience with indeed ?

I am planning on starting my co op in January. Is it too late/early to start looking for opportunities ?

What do you think my strategy to find something should be ?


If it is relevant I'm looking for a 6 month co op in a tech company (small or big).

I am an international student who graduated about 2 months ago with a masters degree in Engineering Management and Leadership from Santa Clara University and have a bachelors degree in Computer Science from India. I loved my masters degree because it let me pick a mix of courses from the Management school and the School of Engineering. According to US visa rules I have until June 25th 2017 to find a full-time job in-order to stay in the country. I only have internship and project experience that mainly deals with Android development and associated work. My skill set for data analytics includes Python, R, Java and related computational and visualization packages like Numpy, Matplotlib, Ggvis, Ggplot2...etc. I haven't done any major projects in data analytics, it's been mostly studying so far and that is how my interest in the field grew. The reason I moved away from android app development is because I applied to a ton of companies and had a fair number of interviews, and the general consensus was that I didn't have enough experience or that my projects were not impressive enough or that I didn't have many published apps in the app store. To be completely honest, I never really liked android development, I was only doing it because I took a course on it in college and won the best-app award, but the more I did it, the more weary i grew and was simply not passionate about it and I am not willing to spend any more time on a sinking ship. I understand that to break into the Data Science field I need to start much lower and I'm okay with that. I'm willing to take less pay in the beginning and live like a broke college student if it means that I get to eventually work my way up and stay in the country. Please give me some advice on how I go about doing this, I want to be able to utilize my time in the best way I can.

If I delay my graduation to December of next year, I could do another internship this summer and spend my free time doing interview prep and exposing myself to Big Data. It seems like a gamble but with potential for a huge payoff.

Thoughts?

**TL;DR** - Would like to delay graduation and spend another summer doing interview prep and learning Big Data to increase my chances of landing a better entry level position."

I have a question for all of you, like many of you i learned to code on my own, i had programming classes but they honestly all sucked i was never able to learn anything until i started doing internships and building funny stuff like surprises for my GF in my website.

I already do a good amount of money and every month i can really see how much i learn and improve just by looking at my old commits but here is the problem: I've been ""studying"" for almost 7 years now a major in information technology and communications engineering at Mexico ITESM university which is ""one of the best"" but extremely expensive.

I hate it, i have to pay around 5000 usd per month just for the semester and i have failed classes like english, software development fundamentals, databases fundamentals, etc... i re-took most of them and passed but the problem is still there, i have to take classes like entrepreneurship 101, finance, accounting, ethics(which i actually like), an ITIL, project management fundamentals, etc... and i cant but feel frustrated because in two months i have to deliver a new feature on my job and pass an exam online about ""advanced ethics"", i still need to pass 11 courses and do social service which is about 300 hours, also i have to do again an internship because i haven't graduated and the other four i did the past years are no longer valid because i haven't graduated yet.

My mother calls me a ""disappointment"" because i haven't finished and she doesn't trust me on anything i want to do with my life, I'm already 23 years old and i pay my stuff at least for the past year. she doesn't want me to drop out because she says that without a degree I'm nothing and i wont have security in the future but the companies that i had applied in the past wont even ask me if i have a degree i just pass their exams and show them my silly weird projects and they want to have a chat with me.

What should i do? is it true that without a degree i'm a worthless piece of human garbage and i wont be able to carry out anything in the future? what can i tell to my mother about this? she wont listen to me and the problem with this AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT is that even though i want to drop out i cant because she works at the university i study and because i'm no longer living in that city she just pays the inscription and then charges that money to me...

i'm very frustrated because i cant just drop-out without starting a family fight...

the director of my major and my mother are insisting on me to quit my job and go back to study but it was hell i was not happy, i was not learning anything, i was not earning anything!!!!

I currently have a job offer as an Application Security Engineer at a top company in the Bay Area as well as generalist new grad Software Engineer offers at a few other companies in the same location with similar compensation and prestige.

At face value, I think the decision is obvious: take the security role! But I have a few concerns that I want to address before I feel comfortable signing any offer:

1. My prior industry experience has been in generalist software engineering roles. My strengths lie in crypto (mostly through graduate level classes), pentesting (through war games), and malware analysis/reversing/exploit development (through personal projects). The AppSec role is mostly doing web app security, which is an area within security where I'm weakest but certainly not incompetent. I'm terrified that I'll show up to work and be way out of my depth, although I don't doubt my ability to learn quickly on the job. 

2. The company is big but the application security engineering team is quite small, &lt;5 people. Unfortunately I get the impression that this company does not place a big emphasis on security of their product as they are heavily focused on growth right now, and so security engineers are perceived as barriers which can slow down their development cycle.

3. What happens if I want to pivot out of the security engineering role and move towards more general backend SWE roles? At this point, my only experience with non-security SWE work will have been my 3 internships. I fear that after 2-3 years in a security role , my internships will become much less relevant to getting a SWE interview. Furthermore, I fear that as a security engineer in a specialized role I'll lose out on knowledge of industry best-practices that SWEs typically pick up in their positions.

4. There seems to be a lot of variation between security roles at tech companies. I've seen ""Information Security Analyst"" roles which seem to be ""checkbox compliance"" roles which require little technical legwork, and I've also seen ""IT Security"" type jobs. I am trying to avoid like the plague. I'm mostly interested in ""Application Security Engineer"" and ""Software Engineer in Security"" roles; but at this point, it's unclear to me that there is a difference between the two.

Anyway, I'll give you a little background. I always struggled with some depression and issues of self-image. And when I got to college, it became much worse. It got so bad at one point that I started walking around downtown looking for the best building I could jump off of. I just barely kept up with my classes while struggling with a sadness that I could not determine the source of. If you talk to me on the street, you would have no idea that I was struggling with this. When I'm with people, I'm usually energetic and I make people laugh.

Anyway, I'm three years deep into college with a major that I am figuring out I am not smart enough for. As I see these professors writing abstract formulas on the board that I can not comprehend no matter how hard I try, and I see everyone around me surpass me in intellect, it's becoming too much. Every time they hand me the test, I completely blank out. It's a major for programming, and I like to code in my free time, but as we get into the more complex stuff I quickly realize I am a one-trick pony. I can only do the basic shit, nothing the employers want.

And it's all catching up to me. I am on academic probation. I have not told anyone about this. If I do bad this semester, I'm done. And unfortunately, my classes have gotten even more difficult and I am having even more trouble keeping up. I lose my full ride scholarship, lose all my college opportunities, I have to move back with my parents, and I lose something else...

I have an extremely good paid internship that I would get kicked out of. I would be kicked out and put right back at a shitty retail job I despise. I have bad anxiety everyday thinking about the future. I know I would be absolutely devastated if I lost all of that. My future would be gone. Everyone in my family would be disappointed in me. All my friends would surpass me.

But that's not the sole reason why I'm thinking about it. There's more.

I am just disappointed in everything. Life is not what it is shaping up to me. I had this great fantasy in my head and it's just all turned out to be shit. I lost my virginity recently, and it actually made me more depressed. I was completely disconnected from the entire act, feeling like shit, having that ""Is this it?"" feeling like I have with everything. I have no motivation to do anything, even play video games, because I know it's just going to disappoint me. It's hard to go on like this.

In a way, it feels like my life has led up to this. Things are in order in some fucked up way. I've been seeing a girl and she brings a small glimmer of joy to me, enough to keep me going a little bit. We both agreed that we shouldn't be a couple, but we still do ""couple"" things like go out to eat together and cuddle. She may be the only thing I'm not completely disappointed by. But I'm sure that's all going to be over soon.

After I (probably) fail out of school at the end of the semester, go through Christmas, and have one last hurrah at New Year's, that's when I want to do it. I'm really looking for any other way out than what I want to do. I know there would be people who would be hurt. I'm just saying I want to do it, I don't know if I would actually go through with it. But I'm scared to death that after it all comes crashing down, my future self is going to make the decision easily.

I need help."

I currently work as a Sr. Desktop Administrator.  Been doing it for 4 years at my current company and getting bored of it.  My manager has been pushing (or so he says) to get me promoted to Lead for over a year now.  Still waiting on that....

Overall, I have been doing Help Desk / Desktop Support for 16 years now.  Because of that, I've started to think about my future....don't want to be stuck doing this forever.  

I've always been interested in system/server administration, but in each company I've worked in, I've never had the opportunity to click with the admin group or get trained on how it works in the company environment.

I've known the Windows admin in our office for a while now and he's a cool dude.  I talked to him a few months ago about my thoughts of moving away from desktop into system admin work.  But at the time, I told him I'm not interested in leaving my current role.  So today, I asked to him if I could shadow him for 1-2 hours a day on what he does and his role in our company's environment.  He told me he was cool with that. 

But during our conversation, he mentions something that caught me by surprise.  He told me that his manager and him have been looking for someone to fill body count (I'm guessing work overload or not enough staff) and he could talk to his manager about bringing me on as a Jr. Admin.  I never expected him to say that.  I was only looking to shadow since I don't have any experience in the field.  He said that's no problem because they currently have an intern that's been working with them who was just offered a FT role.

The dilemma I have is my manager.  My team is currently training for the CCNA.  Each one of the team members gets 2 hours out of the day to train for it.  But for me, I'm starting to get bored of it (I don't think it's the CCNA, more the instructor in the videos we're watching).  I told him before in our 1-on-1s that I'm interested in system / server administration, but it's been a while since I've told him.  So for this, I didn't mentioned anything to him about shadowing one of the admins.  

I want to shadow the Windows admin during my training time.  My manager might get some vibe with me shadowing that I might be moving on from his team.  Without giving him that hint, how can I get away with shadowing the Windows admin?  What do I tell him?"

I don't expect to really get hired based on the fact that I went here, so I'm trying to focus on doing things in my free time as much as possible. I've started my own personal projects on various things. Basically dabbling with all sorts of things to see what I like and eventually making some small things I could post in a portfolio. I am also considering internships. 

My big question is; are personal projects looked at as being better or internships in terms of being hired? Currently I'm thinking of going into software engineering, but I don't really know much about what all there is in terms of job opportunities and what they're like for other fields. My school has thus far only taught us about software development in terms of a professional career and my school doesn't have CS classifications, it's more focused on broad skills.

My main concern with internships is that as it stands I will be having to graduate school a semester late, and if I take a summer internship I'll have to graduate a year late. I'm not sure how much an employer would weigh that in considering whether or not to hire me. I feel like if an employer saw that someone took five years to graduate without knowing the context they wouldn't consider them very highly compared to someone who did so in four years; however maybe I'm just being paranoid.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!

Edit: I'm also curious, when giving out my GPA for internships, are they looking for my overall GPA, or my specific CS GPA? If it's unclear what I'm talking about I'll try to clarify: When I view my current academic standing I have two different GPAs visible. One is my overall GPA that accounts for my CS courses as well as my general education courses plus any other classes I have taken in the past. While my CS GPA is specifically my GPA when accounting for the CS courses I have taken. I would very much prefer to give my CS GPA as it is substantially higher, however I don't want to give them the wrong information and end up being in a bad position when they say that I've unwittingly lied to them."

I'd eventually like to work in one of the Big 4 but I don't know which is my best pathway there.

The best uni's of my state (Monash and Melbourne) do not offer any internships or work experience as part of the course. In fact, t Melbourne, probably the most prestigious uni in Australia, only 250 internships are given to the 1000+ commerce students.

At the next ""tier"" of universities are 2 universities I'm considering. They both offer guaranteed 12 month work placement (paid at one, not sure about the other). From what I've heard and the information I've read, work experience is invaluable to prospective students and I feel like it would be silly of me to let this go.


The counter side of this argument in my head is that I don't need a 12 month work placement to be in my course for me to do it. If I go to the more prestigious uni's I could still organise the work placement myself and do it on my own. I imagine this would not be easy (and very time consuming!) though.

My ideal situation is to obviously go to the best university AND have work experience but I don't know how likely this will be.

What do you guys think? Do you possibly have any advice for me?"

Most of my experience is full-stack .NET, specifically with vanilla JavaScript or ReactJS and some AngularJS. But I've done Java stuff on my own - recently played with Java to make a restful API for reading and writing tweets to my Twitter account. So I'm familiar with Maven, Jetty, and more.
And I've also done enough with Django to understand that the frameworks are conceptually similar....and where they're not, it's easy to pick up differences and syntax if you already know one stack.
The manager I chatted with in writing initially told me he thinks my background is a solid foundation. But then on the phone call, he told me he doesn't think I'm a good fit because of the lack of open-stack experience.
So...am I right to be worried with the stack I've been working with? This is the first time I've actually felt threatened by being pinholed into a single stack. He mentioned that all the real top companies use open-stack technology (and only some closed-stack tech) and that I'd do well to transition into that direction.
So I'm requesting some advice here. Did I make the wrong move in sticking with another full-stack .NET role after graduating and leaving my last internship? I had an opportunity to work at a company that has a typical Java stack going but I liked the current company more. In any case, I was under the impression that serious software companies don't care too much what stack you're experienced in as long as you're a strong engineer who learns quickly and efficiently. :/"

I think I've got a pretty strong resume (See below), so I'm looking for more mid-tier schools.

To give you you an idea of where I'm at, for judging what qualifies as a ""Safe"" choice:

 - Just above a 3.0 GPA, but 3.7 if you only look at the last three years (my second run at college), and above a 4.0 if you only look at my CS grades during that time.

 - Good/difficult course selection for electives
 - Math double major
 - Two very solid letters of recommendation, several pretty-good options for a third
 - Won site and placed second regional in Tier 2 ACM programming contest
 - Succesful internship (for whatever that's worth), was in charge of a lot of non-trivial features (including the entire security system, from design up)
 - Attached to several research projects (Missed results, did write a spam filter for SoundCloud that the professor had been wanting for a while)

53wipp,10,2016-09-21,Low salary offers in HTX,Blitz-Lexikon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53wipp/low_salary_offers_in_htx/,"tl;dr: Bachelor's in CS, good grades, no experience in tech field, what should I expect salary wise?

Hey all. I graduated with a bachelor's in CS in August from Lamar University in Southeast Texas (Magna Cum Laude, 3.78 GPA) and my job search which is centered toward Houston, TX has turned up a few companies who are interested. I have gone to one interview and have another scheduled for tomorrow, but there has been a common theme with the jobs that have shown interest - low pay. 

The work experience portion of my résumé is quite weak perhaps compared to some others who were able to find an internship etc. during school. I am very much aiming at an entry level position having worked at a restaurant for 5 years to support myself through school (I am the manager and do IT support and manage their menu database however).

My question is essentially, is it ridiculous to expect a starting salary on par with the ""average"" entry level positions from sites such as GlassDoor and PayScale with no experience in the field? Is it common for fresh college graduates to accept jobs at ~40k while the supposed average for entry level CS jobs is around 50-60k? I do want to start gaining experience in software dev or web security ASAP but I want to make sure I don't sell myself short! 

Thanks in advance for any help/advice.

Also I am on mobile at the moment but I can post an anonymous résumé later if anyone would like to critique or advise me in that regard.

The only problems that ever comes up is minor syntax problems (missing a semicolon, forgetting a bracket etc)

I am a Junior at a University in Houston (transferred from a Community College), studying Computer Science. I also work 25 hours a week during the school year doing basic inventory for $11.33 an hour to get by, and split rent with my SO.

I really want to get an internship or some type of part time coding job, preferably in web development. I've been applying through my University career services page, and have heard back from two companies: 1 an unpaid internship, and the other a 3 month contract job at a small company that I interviewed at, and offered $5000 stipend to basically train me, with potential hire at the end of the 3 months. I didn't take that because it would have been too much of a risk for the low pay.
I've applied to a lot of jobs on indeed, all entry level and internships, and haven't been called for an interview.

I joined the CS club at my school, and have been talking to other students who have held jobs/internships. Some had no personal projects and interned at big companies like JP Morgan, and some had luck with smaller companies.

I have been working on web development in my free time, learning to code front end to back. So, html, css, javascript for the front, and python/flask, sqlite in the back. I have a website that features my projects, a contact form that goes directly to my email, nice bootstrap layout, form validations etc… I have two front end projects, a Weather App, and a Random Quote Machine that show I know how to use APIs, and small Python game I made in 24 hours for a competition between friends.

I showed one of my successful peers my website and he said “woah, this is a lot more than most of the people in the club have, you should put those on your resume rather that unrelated work experience”. So I did.

We had a CS career fair recently, and I talked with a few companies and they really seemed unimpressed. I tried talking about my projects, but they were all mostly interested in hiring Java and C# developers. One guy from a company I spoke to basically told me “its cool you've been working on web development projects, but you should focus on core languages like Java. I could make a website too, it wouldn't be the prettiest, but I could”. Is web development a lesser skill or something?

My older brother has been a developer for 8 years now, and I've been asking him for advice. He told me to keep working on projects like my website, build a couple more small web apps, and maybe pick up C# and .Net (he's a C# dev).

I would really accept any position that would pay me at least $15 just to get my foot in the door and get some experience. Anyone have any advice? Should I be shifting to different languages to fit in the job market better, or is it just Houston?

Much preciated."

This week has been busy with all sorts of companies coming to recruit interns for their companies and I feel a bit left out. I have some experience in computer science outside of school and I'm currently in CMSC132. I love programming and have a great passion for computer related stuff. Even though CMSC132 is a bit of a tough course, I enjoy every bit of it and I'm looking forward to learn more programming skills outside of school. During high school I was modding games and doing basic scripting and during my freshman year in a community college I developed my own android game and published it on Google Play. Even though its not a sophisticated game, I feel proud of creating it. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faho.juggletballs) 

I know I have a lot more to learn and develop more skills to be in par with many computer scientists here. My game plan is to learn more about computer science and all the related stuff during my junior year and then start focusing on internships and such during my senior year. Is this proper? Will companies look down on me for beginning my internship during senior year, or even after graduating? 

I'm sorry for sounding so simpleminded but I'm just clueless and the transfer experience for me has been a bit daunting. Also, any tips on what companies look for on the resumes? Can I put basic skills that I have. Over the summer I learned basic HTML, CSS, and also SQL programming, not anything extensive though. Is it worth putting things like this?

540y6h,32,2016-09-22,"Just got a job as a new grad (Engineer) with no networking, here is how it went.",GT540MGamer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/540y6h/just_got_a_job_as_a_new_grad_engineer_with_no/,"**Background:** I graduated with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering Technology in late July from a state school with a 3.2 GPA. Prior to my degree I was enlisted in the Marines for 4 years in a combat role (i.e. not something with a direct civilian equivalent, but I did have some technical experience with radio systems and obviously there's a big leadership aspect). I also have been a paid blog writer for 2 years (concurrent with school). So basically I had some good experience, but not in the engineering field.


**Job Hunt:** 40 applications, 30 of which had unique cover letters, using one of 3 main resumes that I slightly tweaked; Design Engineer, Manager, and Marketing. I applied to entry-level jobs for which I was pretty clearly qualified (Meaning I met 75-100% of qualifications listed in job posting) My only callback led to an interview, and my single interview got me an offer. 


**What Worked:** 

* My callback was from a staffing firm, not a big company with their own hiring people. I think that's what helped get my resume in front of a human being, which is the primary hurdle. Big companies have so many applications to sort through and do a lot of that sorting with software.

* The job I got was posted on Indeed which was where I found the majority of jobs to apply to.

* Dressed to impress for my interview. Full suit (bought the day prior) even though the typical dress code is a tucked in polo shirt. There was specific mention of my attire pleasing them, so even though it's a well-known rule it does still get people's attention in a good way.

* I had things on my resume besides my education. My GPA wasn't stellar but my interviewer said he really just liked to see someone that ""had done *something*"" He liked my involvement in a school organization (it was on my resume) so don't discount things like that if you were in some sort of active role.


**the interview:** Like they say, if you get the interview then they already think you're qualified, what they really want to know is if they'll enjoy working with you. I've waited tables over the past year which has helped tremendously with general interaction skills (Those of you still in school, the money can be pretty good too). I would say half of my interview (2 hours total) was really just chit-chatting. A good portion of my interview was discussing the duties of the position and the business of the company, with a pretty equal split between the interviewer just filling me in, and me asking specific questions. Overall I think what worked was my candor, and my genuine interest in the position. Salary was the very last thing we discussed and it was pretty straightforward, ""What would be a comfortable salary for you?"" There are a lot of people that are big into negotiation here but I had a figure walking in based on the job description and the national and state averages for that and I gave it to them. They offered me the job at that rate after they interviewed their final candidate. 


**Advice**

* One thing I would have changed is my transparency in dealing with both the staffing firm and the interviewer. I'm great at having fluid engaging conversations and getting along, but I'm also sometimes overly honest and informative. I tipped my hand in the interview that I had a specific position I was looking into at another company (out of state) with personal contacts in the company and which would pay substantially more. What I should have done was remain vague. ""I'm very interested in this position, and if offered I expect to be able to make a decision by X date"" would have been a better way to explain my situation. The other job didn't pan out just because too much was up in the air and wouldn't be resolved until this opportunity had come and gone. 


* Take what you can get. The salary offered is comfortable, but it's entry level for sure. This led to some really silly feelings of wanting to wait for a better gig to come along even though I'm scraping by as-is. Getting called back and having a good interview boosted my ego and made me forget the frustrations of job hunting. Try and remember that if you applied for it, it is a job you wanted! 

* Remember that sometimes a posted job is already filled. I had a few jobs that I applied to where I was a PERFECT fit. One in particular looked to make use of every professional skill I had through experience and not one thing I wasn't clearly qualified to handle. I pursued it as hard as I could, even contacting a recruiter through the company on Linkedin and having her forward an email to the hiring manager. Not even a callback or phone screen. This was really demoralizing so it's important to remember that it is really just a numbers game. That sucks for sure, but now that you know the rules you can better play the game. 

* Create a few resumes tailored to positions you're interested in and attach cover letters with blank fields that you can easily fill in to quickly customize it for a specific company. You can't pour your heart and soul into every application and still generate the numbers needed to get seen. I had actually sent the wrong resume in response to the job posting, but since the key information was the same throughout all of them, it didn't seem to matter.

* do an internship! I thought I didn't need one because of my work history, but the real value in an internship is the company contacts. Those are huge! 


It feels great to get hired and I'm excited about beginning my professional career. I turned to this board a lot during my job hunt for advice and inspiration so I'll happily answer any questions in order to help those who are still in those shoes. "
5419jx,5,2016-09-22,Just got fired from my job at a student media position. Quit my retail position to work for them. Currently unemployed and waiting for a response from my old retail job. How to stop ruining my career?,photodummy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5419jx/just_got_fired_from_my_job_at_a_student_media/,"I guess fired isn't necessairly the right phrasing.  It's more like unamicable un-pairing.  

Basically what happened is I wasn't pushing out work as fast or as frequently as they wanted me to.  I was hired based on some work I did prior to working there and the work I did (not to toot my own horn) was demonstrably better than the work their current team was putting out.  So they hired me on as an employee, and things seemed to be going fine until about last week.  I was called in and they let me know that I need to speed things up and make more of an effort to get content out faster and I needed to communicate more with the other members of my staff. I responded frequently in our group chats but apparently that wasn't enough and none of my peers made that apparent.  

So I show up for work on Weds of this week to try to get some projects done and I'm pulled into the office with one of my peers and the ""production manager(?)"" and I'm basically made to come up with a reason for them to keep me on at my position.  They decided they could find someone else to do the work I was doing because they believed that they would push that work out faster.  They said they didn't want me to grovel, but that's essentially what they wanted me to do.  

Apparently the staff was contacting the supervisor rather than contacting me personally.  Rather than try to work things out with me personally they just went around my back and complained to her instead, and rather than really give me an opportunity to explain myself or even start a dialogue with other members of the team.  I'm simply told that my options were to either accept an unpaid internship position or leave.  So I leave.  

Due to some prior poor financial decisions I racked up a little over 10,000 dollars in CC debt and over 27,000 dollars in student loan debt.  I made mistakes.  


Forgive my ranting, I'm as upset with myself as I am them.  I keep seeming to burn bridges and draw rifts in my professional relationships.  I've been incredibly lazy most of my life, and I'm just now starting to get out of it, I'm trying to make some significant changes in my life but it seems like I keep finding myself falling into similar ruts.  I was so excited to even get the job because it was something that wasn't retail which I had been working uninterrupted for over three years and it seems like I'm going to be falling back into that.  How do I stop this cycle of failure?  I really would like to be a successful human being but I keep finding myself back at square one.  "

* Talk to my manager and lobby him for some machine learning related work. Not sure if this will work given that he believes he can't ""commit to anything as far away as next summer."" Worth a try, I guess?

* Try my luck at other companies. And possibly *renege* if I do get something I like at another company. Sounds really *risky*, but would you recommend it in my case?

* Work on iOS dev at the said company this summer, and actively look for full-time opportunities at other companies during my internship.

My first assignment was working on a bug fix. I didn't really understand the code I was changing, and the senior pretty much held my hand through it. I wanted to try and understand it a little more, so I asked him if he could explain what the module we were working on did. He may as well have been speaking Chinese. 

I looked at pieces of the code on my own and tried Googling to get a better understanding of it, but for the life of me I'm just totally lost. Everyone says to ""ask a lot of questions"", but using the Chinese example again, if you showed up to school one day and your teacher and the other students only spoke Chinese, would asking questions help anything?

My family/friends keep trying to assure me that this is normal for starting a new job, but I can't help but feel like this is beyond normal levels of confusion. I didn't do an internship, I didn't have any major projects before this. I actually raised this concern with my manager in my orientation meeting and he sort of waved it off with a ""don't worry, we'll be starting you on something simple"" comment. But I just worry that he doesn't realize the level of incompetence he's dealing with here, and my definition of ""simple"" is much different than his. I never excelled in my algorithms or discrete courses, I was just kind of ""let off"" with a B or a B-.

I'm a sophomore year college student who is going for an MIS major this year. I'm trying my best to be competitive and get into the major. I've don't a bit of research as to what the major entails and the experiences from MIS grad students have, I have a few questions. If this isn't the correct place, do direct me in the right path please.

 I guess one factor as to why I'm posting is I'm slightly concern about my college's ""55%"" acceptance rate. They say I need a 3.6 GPA (which I can get no problem, sitting at 3.4 atm) along with an essay and a resume but I'm fearful that I might not get the major since only half of the applicants get in and my backups are a heavy downgrade. I'll start with this as my first quesiton.

* Since I have a passion for Computers, I've been self teaching myself coding in my little spare time (HTML5/CSS/C#). If I don't get in, what's a similar major to MIS that I can take?

* What exactly are the requirements for an MIS job? If I can learn C# along with HTML 5/CSS, will it help me? I have messed around with coding from video game mods to bots for programs like Discord (Voice program) but I wouldn't say that I created anything significant, just more or less play around with stuff to get a feeling for it. So far it's interesting to me.

* What should I do to better my chances at getting the major and getting a job with the major after graduation? I am looking at internships and so far I have a family friend who works at a Water company that would be glad to have me.

* From what I gathered, MIS jobs prefer people with an understanding of coding and good social skills. Is this accurate? If so, I am in the process of learning coding and I have great social skills. I'm a part of 3 campus clubs and am a PR Member for an online organization with around 10k~ members.

Forgive me for the long post, I just want to make sure that Management Information Systems is not only the major I'm looking for, but the major I like and will succeed with, along with backup plans if I don't get into the School of Business.

**Target schools**: H/S...if there's an ROI case to be made for anything other than H/S I'd like to hear it, because right now my third option is to try for product management positions at a place like Uber, Netflix, etc. and just skip the MBA.

I've already completed an internship at a big tech company and will be looking for full-time jobs next summer/fall. This semester, I have to choose between doing machine-learning research and a deep-learning grad course (I can't squeeze in both). Which one should I do?

* Research: It focuses on analyzing the video and audio content of videos to understand what's in them, employing a variety of machine-learning approaches from deep learning to supervised feature-based methods. I might get a publication from this, should I choose to do this for a year. The coding work will be in Python (Theano maybe).  **Stuff that goes on my resume: the research experience itself + potential publication.**

* Grad course: It's about deep neural nets with assignments where we develop stuff like ConvNets and RNNs from scratch. There's also one final team project where we take a state-of-the-art paper in the literature of deep learning (stuff like ResNets, WaveNets etc.) and implement it in code by ourselves, reproducing or bettering the results of the paper. It's pretty similar in content to [Stanford's CS 231N](https://cs231n.github.io), except it covers stuff beyond ConvNets and focuses on other applications like speech recognition.  **Stuff that goes on my resume: the grad course itself + iPython course assignments on GitHub + TensorFlow final project on GitHub.**

Which one of these two would be more useful to have on my resume for a full-time machine learning engineer job? Thanks!"

We spend massive amounts of time and money on our education. We dedicate ourselves to lives of working most Friday nights and weekends instead of going out and enjoying life. We cut hours of sleep off our schedules every week so we can finish all the work we need to finish. We push ourselves to the mental limit so when we succeed, we are stronger and we can keep pushing further. 

So, in the eyes of a company, why is all of that pointless if we don't have a 3-month internship on our resume? I understand having experience is good, but why is the internship a firm make or break aspect for so many companies? Internships aren't the only method of gaining experience.

I don't want any tips or advice on what I should have done, I just want to discuss the current situation of engineering education and industry."

-I will be graduating 2 quarters from now with a 3.2 GPA in Mechanical Engineering
-About 3 years into completing my degree, I felt that ME just wasn't the right program for me, so I picked up my minor in Math and planned on going for my MS in Applied Mathematics (I've always been passionate about Math, but Engineering was the ""logical"" choice when applying for college, and I thought I might like it)
-I've taken several intermediate analysis math courses and a few upper division stats courses to prepare myself and meet pre-requisites for grad programs
-GPA in these courses is a 3.3 (A's in my first few courses, and 2 B-'s in my last courses)
-had an internship for ~6 months doing some programming

So, I didn't know this at the time of taking my classes, but apparently, the B- I got in my last 2 classes was a huge deal. Since I'm an engineering major, they put some serious emphasis on looking at the few higher Math courses I've taken, which of course makes perfect sense. I initially thought that my grades would be the equivalent of all B+'s for the same GPA, but I was mistaken.

Here's another issue: Our class terms are relatively short. I am also the type of student who shows up to class and quietly does well in the back without saying much. This has led to me having almost no relationship to any professors at my school. I'll chat with professors every now and then, but rarely make the effort I should have for them to know me. So letters of rec are an issue.

So with all that said, any advice on how I can improve my applications? Take additional courses? Exams? Pick up some skills? Am I SOL because of the choices I've already made? Thanks!"

54407h,160,2016-09-23,TIFU when I tried to get my car back.,BigDubo,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/54407h/tifu_when_i_tried_to_get_my_car_back/,"Happened a couple years ago in University.

My car needed an oil change, but at the time I was interning at a small, engineering firm and my hours wouldn't allow me time to take care of it. Fortunately, the factory my dad worked at was a quick walk from his house, and he just happened to be on afternoon shift that week. So he offered to switch cars, and take mine in for me. Then I could just pick it up at the end of the week.

End of the week arrives, and I decide to go pick up my car. Now, my shift ends at just after 4, and his starts at 3. The only times we'd be able to exchange keys would be either right as he enters work, leaves, or during his lunch break at 7. I didn't really have the patience to wait until 7, so I decided to leave work early and meet him before he goes in.

My work was expectantly strict with interns leaving early or showing up late, so my dumb ass decided to make up a harmless lie instead of just waiting until the weekend. Something about family emergency. I got to leave, but traffic was pretty bad and I ended up showing up just after 4 anyways.

My place was a pretty far commute from my dad's work, and I didn't have a key to his place yet, so I wasn't entirely keen on waiting or driving back home. I texted him, but I knew he wasn't allowed to text on the line.

While I was deciding what to do, a couple of workers walked up and asked if I was waiting for anyone. I told them about my dilemma and they offered to help by letting me into the factory so I could find my dad, saying my dad was a good friend of theirs. They used their swipe cards to get me in, and gestured towards where my dad should be, before leaving to get back to their own work.

I walked around a bit, and asked if anyone knew or had seen my dad. I noticed their reactions were almost subdued, calling me ""Sir"" and given me terse replies. It was then I figured it was because I had just come from my office in business casual wear, so  they assumed I was one of the engineers working there. I figured this was better then being treated like some random kid. So I started to play the part, acting like I was the shit (to anyone who's worked in a factory, they know the engineer's attitudes). I'd point at people and ask where this and that was, tell them they were doing a good job, etc.

I was getting so into it that I didn't notice a man in suit walking up to me. That's when I froze. I couldn't bullshit this guy. He immediately asked what I was doing in his factory, and questioned why I wasn't wearing safety glasses or work boots (office job). All the bravado left me and I just ended up explaining the predicament with my dad, and how some workers let me in. After ripping me apart for pretending to be an engineer, he told me to wait outside and that he'd send my dad after me. I quickly left with my tail between my legs.

After a bit my dad showed up at the parking lot looking pale. He told me the man I had talked to was his superintendent, and that he was fired for ""allowing a minor to trespass onto company property, and without the proper safety equipment"". At this point, we were both pretty rattled, and he sent me home, reassuring me that it wasn't my fault.

When I finally got home, I just felt like the biggest piece of shit ever. As I was lying in my bed a couple hours after, I got a call from the firm I worked for. If I didn't feel like a big enough idiot, I forgot that my company was hired by my dad's company to work out some bugs on the line. One of our employees saw me, and casually brought it up to my boss thinking it was harmless. My boss decided to call me that night to fire me for lying to skip work. Talk about a shitty day.

TL;DR I went to switch cars with my dad, and got us both fired from our jobs."

I know what I need to do, study and study some more. CTCI, leetcode, etc. But my questions is this: Can I reasonably expect to be able to find an internship with very little knowledge of these Data Structures? I'm losing faith. 

Follow up: If I do not find an internship, would it be worth it to stay in college an extra semester so that I will have one more summer to intern? Will internship have such an effect on my employ-ability that it would warrant this?

I'm currently eying a few programs at my local community college. One of them is a certificate in Computer Information Systems. It says that it provides basic courses needed for careers as an entry level programmer or help desk person. They also say they provide internships.


I am wondering if this is a viable stepping stone to a better career or if it would be a waste of time and money? Is there a good job field for this area of study and is there good potential for higher earnings? What are some other steps I might take to maximize my success in this endeavor?


If anyone has any information please let me know, I would be happy to hear it."

It's a crippling anxiety and it surfaces with any person who may have influence on my future. I hate it because it has already cost me some serious opportunities (jobs, internships, etc.).

For example, I have recently spent quite a lot of time looking for a Bachelor thesis supervisor. Every time I wanted email someone, my anxiety rose up and I would scrutinize every single word. And when I finally got a response from someone who had a spot for me, I was nervous all the way up to and during the first meeting. Afterwards I just collapsed and beat my self up over how bad an impression I left (they could tell I was nervous). He said he would send me an email with more details on the project and an estimated starting date, but I haven't heard back yet (3.5 weeks ago).

I talk just fine with any other stranger, though. It's just with people who have some form of 'authority'.

I don't really know where I am going with this post, other than that I really *really* want to get rid of it, if I want to have any chance for a successful career. Does anybody else experience anything like this? Do you have any advice?"

They are c#, python, and javascript. 

I am currently doing an internship using c# and following the MVVM pattern and even though I like c#, boy have I struggled. Moving forward, I dont know what I can do since I just graduated from school and I want to land a good job. 

I honestly dont think I did enough to land a full time position and alot of it had to do with the steep learning curve of MVVM and c#. 

Moving forward, I realized that I am weak at SQL, Database systems, and that I need to learn data structures and algorithms. 

In essence, I dont know how to proceed. Logic would say that I should just continue learning c# but if there arent as many jobs as I would like, then I would definitely be open to learning another language.

I started a new job about a month and a half ago. I work as a technology risk consultant for a medium size accounting firm. When I was hired I was told I would do things such as penetration testing, IT risk assessments, and cyber security assessments. These are all things that really interest me. I was also told there would be plenty of training since this is all new to me. Well, when I started the first thing I noticed is that there was no specific training for what I would be doing. There was only general HR training. I thought this was weird but i chugged forward. Then, I noticed they were not putting me on any projects even after asking for work multiple times. Another werid thing. Then, our director of cyber security ""resigned"". This is the main person in charge of bringing in clients for risk assessments and such. Another werid thing. Then, this past week they laid off 6 of my co-workers. I have no clue how I was not laid off. Its important to note here that our office is fairly small and fairly new. The longest person here has only been here for a year and a half and that person was one of the ones laid off. Now, I'm finally being put on projects but they are nothing like what I was told I would be doing or what I'm interested in. I'm looking at financial statements and other accounting audit things. This is down right boring to me and worst, I have no clue what I'm doing since I have only taken one accounting class (IT major).

So with all of this, I'm looking for advice. Should I quit this job and try to find anothrr one? My fear is I won't be able to find a job soon or that it looks bad that I was only at this job for a month and a half. Should I take a contractor position. How hard is it to find a contractor employee as an entry level person? I noticed the previous company I worked for as a a help desk intern is hiring for a full time help desk employee. My fear there is that its a pretty large pay cut (60k currently to around 45k) and the stigma associated with being a help desk person. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!"

I graduated May 2016 from a top 50 university. Never had an internship during university but I did work on a some personal projects and done some IT volunteering. My courses also had projects but don't think those are too relevant to employers. I had around a 3.0 GPA and my programming skills would also be around average (for reference I can solve easy and a few medium LeetCode problems. Also did pretty well on some technical interviews but didn't get an offer).

I'm applying for literally every junior / entry-level position around my area as I can't afford to move. I am getting a low amount of callback from my applications. In total, I only received 7 in-person interviews (also had 6 phone interviews that led to nothing). Zero callbacks from any new grad positions.

I have already had my resume critiqued over at /r/cscareerquestions (using my main reddit account) and mostly received positive feedback. Overall my resume seems decent. I have sent out ~100 applications. At this point I am not sure if programming is the right thing for me as I still haven't landed a job yet.

So far I applied for the following positions (most are listed as junior / entry level):

* Software developer
* System analyst
* Business analyst
* Web developer
* UI / UX designer
* Development support
* QA

My questions are:

* Should I give up looking for jobs in the software development industry?
* If I do give up, what jobs should I search for where I can apply my CS degree to?

Edit: Another question: If I cannot enter the IT / software industry, how would I even write a non-software dev resume? I don't have any customer service or any other experience besides my programming projects.

Over the summer I had an internship in linguistics where I basically realized my original plan of going to graduate school and becoming a professor was maybe too far fetched and not the best idea unless I was really good at research and ready to do research my whole life (which isn't the case). I had always been good at math and was looking for a related area that I could focus on, and while I had never had any experience with computer science, I thought I'd look into it. 

I ended up being really interested in it and I've added a computer science minor now, and even though my classes are difficult I'm really loving it so far. I definitely missed all the math and problem solving, and I actually somewhat enjoy doing homework for the first time. 

Obviously, though, my major is still linguistics. But I think I have a better selection going for a more CS based job vs a linguistics based job after college. I'm not planning on going to graduate school right now, but that could change if I think I need to to get hired. I was planning on taking a little time after I graduate to improve my programming skills since a CS minor doesn't really give me enough credentials to apply for programming jobs, and I assume I'll need a lot more practice than my minor will provide me with.

So I guess my question is, what kind of job would want someone like me? Can my linguistics background help me at all in any CS positions? I've kept a 4.0 GPA so far in college which I feel is helpful, but will employers even care about that since my major was linguistics and not computer science?"

Using a throwaway as the necessary information is pretty personal. Also, sorry for the wall of text, but this is a huge crossroads that I'm at. 

Backstory about myself: I'm originally from Illinois, but currently live in Florida where I have for the last ~18 months. I previously attended a University in Central Illinois from 2013 to 2015. Not UIUC. Since I've been living in Florida, I took time off classes to work full-time at a theme park. I've been reenrolled in a community college in Orlando since January of 2016. I work full-time and take classes part-time. I'll be graduating with an Associate's Degree in May, where I'll then be transferring to a 4-year school. I'm also lucky enough to say that my current position at work has me set up for a pretty decent career, if I want it. 

This is where I need some help.

I'm considering leaving my job and going back to school Full-Time to finish my Bachelor's Degree ASAP. I'd most likely attend a large public university in Florida, since I'll be able to qualify for in-state tuition. In high-school, I had a 2.7 GPA. At my university in Illinois, I left with a 2.3 GPA. Since I've been in Florida, I'm looking at a 3.5 GPA, and I've been invited to be a member of Phi Theta Kappa. (Not a huge deal really, but it's something I'm proud of)

With my grades being the best they've ever been, and me feeling like I finally have my head on straight, I don't want to waste this opportunity.

At the same time, I also have a pretty decent job that pays well, and if all goes well, I'll be promoted to management within the year. I don't want to waste that either. My current plan is to take classes part-time/online instead of going back to school full-time. 

I've talked to some of my friends about this, and they're about as split as I am. 

Really, there's two schools of thought. 

1) My best friend, who is my age, says that I should go back to school Full-time. She knows that I'll be successful in the world, and doesn't want me to squander my opportunities by playing it safe and staying with my current company. She herself has had regrets about not taking certain internships, and instead choosing to stay with a company she already knew. Going to a better school (not an online college) is going to be a better investment for my future, especially if I ever decide to leave my current company. Plus the universities I'm looking at attending are infinitely better than my school in Illinois. I'm not trying to go to Harvard, but being able to have a large alumni base all over the country is important.

2) My one friend from work, who is about twice as old as I am, says that finding a company who wants to make you management without a Bachelor's Degree is really tough to find, so the fact that my current job already sees the potential in me is huge. Plus I get really good benefits. Insurance. 401k. Educational Reimbursement. Having a long history at a well-established company, plus making them foot the bill for my education, isn't something I should think lightly of. 

Obviously, this is gonna come down to my decision and my decision alone, but I'm really just trying to weigh all the options out and think long and hard about this. Whatever choice I make is going to have a profound impact on my life, and I'm going to need to be ready for it. 

TL;DR: 1) Either I stay with my current job, continue to take classes part-time, finish my Bachelor's degree in a few years, and hope my career pans out

or 2) I quit my current job at the end of next summer, move across the state, go back to college Full-Time at 23, and hope THAT pans out."

54dgo6,3,2016-09-24,Torn between writing a Honors Thesis and spending time trying to find a good job in the US tech industry.,ckmA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54dgo6/torn_between_writing_a_honors_thesis_and_spending/,"I'm a Math and Computer Science Honors Major from Canada and I have the option to complete a thesis.

I have completed internships at Amazon and Microsoft (but I don't have a return offer for Microsoft because it wasn't a good fit and my Amazon offer expired). I plan to go into the tech industry (Seattle or Bay area) but I'm worried that I won't get a job.
The problem that I'm facing right now is split between interest and job opportunities. I want to write a thesis and at the same time, I want to be able to land a job for when I graduate in June 2017.

My problem for finding jobs right now is that I'm not familiar enough with my preferred language (C++ / Java) and I feel like this is really affecting my chances of getting hired. On top of this, my final year consists of graduate math courses so I don't have much time to practice, as these courses are not easy for me.

Would anyone still write the thesis in my position? Or should I just focus on job hunting? I only have one chance for my thesis and also one chance to start off my career with a good job (I don't want to be jobless for a year as I fear it may make it harder for me to apply to these big tech companies).

Note: I'm currently in the process of some interviews already.

**TL;DR**: I'm currently not up to pace with coding skills and I don't have much time. Should I still continue with an Honors Thesis (which is actually not required for the Honors program) or should I focus on job hunting?

My resume pretty much looks like this:

* Amazon, Microsoft
* High Major GPA + Honors Math and CS
* Research experience with professors (who can vouch for me)
* Not so impressive projects (at least this shows that I code on the side?)

What I probably am:

* Marginal coding skills (because I'm rather slow due to unfamiliarity at the moment)
* Good problem solving ability (not great, but I think it's passable)

Thanks for those who took the time to read and answer. I would really appreciate any advice."
54dxcs,10,2016-09-25,When do I turn in my resignation letter/quit during my (retail) shift?,notsomagical,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/54dxcs/when_do_i_turn_in_my_resignation_letterquit/,"Hello all,

I have previously asked for advice on leaving my job at the Disney Store [here, on this subreddit,](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4vfs4r/i_hate_my_retail_job_so_much_its_making_me/) as well as [in the AskRetail subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRetail/comments/4vg0m4/i_hate_my_job_so_much_its_making_me_miserable_how/) (both are the same post basically, just different replies and such). Quick TL;DR for those who didn't read it, I worked for Disney before and loved it, but I hate working at TDS and wasn't sure the best way to quit without causing issues if I ever wanted to work for the Disney Company (in any field) again.

Well the time has finally come for me to quit, but I'm a little confused, as I've never had to quit a job before. I was hoping to tell the Store Manager and give her the letter, but I'm not working with her at all the next week, and I don't want to wait and work there an extra week just to give it to her. I'm not really sure how the hierarchy works at the Disney Store. I know we have the Store Manager, and then we have two other full time leads and one part time lead. But they all have pretty much the same responsibilities during the day and whenever we work with them, so I don't know if they would be considered Assistant Managers or not.

Anyway, so my next shift I'm working with (what I think) is like the ""2nd in command"" at the store, she's actually the main reason I'm quitting, (not saying that in my reason of course lol), and I'm not sure how to approach her about quitting.

First, is it okay to give her the letter and tell her I'm quitting instead of the Store Manager? I would prefer to give it to the SM but since I haven't worked with her (besides when she's in the office on conference calls all day or for like 30 mins) in weeks, I don't feel like I have any other choice.

Second, how and when do I tell her/give her the letter? I'm closing (which sucks because she gives me a hard time when I close with her) and only working like 4 hours, so should I tell her at the beginning, at the end, or sometime in the middle? It's only going to be the two of us working for my entire shift (unless they change things) so I can't pull her to the back and ask to talk in private. Should I just say something like ""Hey _____, can I talk to you before we leave tonight?"" or should I just have the letter and bring it up at the same time?

Also how do I even tell her I'm quitting? After I tell her I need to talk or something. Just a little general advice on how I should tell her that I'm quitting, should I tell her my reason (internship in my field) or just tell her I'm leaving and that's that?

It would be so much easier if I wasn't closing, as I could just do it at the end of my shift and not worry about how she's going to react, but I've been putting this off for months and it's time to pull the trigger.

TL;DR: I want to quit during my next shift, when I'm closing with one of the leaders (who is not the Store Manager). How should I bring up that I'm quitting (like how do I tell her I need to talk to her and how do I tell her I'm quitting) and when should I tell her/give her my resignation letter?

Thank you so much!

EDIT: To clarify, when I say give my letter of resignation I mean two weeks notice, I wrote this when I was exhausted so I wasn't clear enough."

However, I am not the genius-type these companies are looking for -- I have to work really hard to be good at things.

Will I face significant career disadvantages if I just forgo the whole internship process for now, and focus more on it next year?

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The lizard carefully crept over the granite spikes. While the spikes made for an excellent protection from larger predators, that didn’t mean they were completely safe for the lizard. The spikes were indiscriminate about who they sliced into ribbons, intruders or those that had spent their lives in their jagged masses. As the lizard carefully placed its toes around the edges of the peak it was crossing, a shadow crossed its peripherals. The lizard quickly dragged itself over the edge, just as talons closed over the space it had just occupied. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The lizard blinked in a slow lazy satisfaction, knowing that the hawk that had attacked it would pay dearly for its efforts. The spike pit was easy enough to enter from the air, but getting back out was the tricky part. Even now the hawk was having difficulty spreading its wings for flight. The lizard turned to continue on its way, when the granite sliced one of its feet, the ensuing bleeding dropped the lizard to the ground.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The lizard closed its eyes. Any minute now it would start bouncing of the unforgiving spikes, and by the time it hit the ground it would be a minced bag of flesh. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Suddenly, the lizard felt the air change, but there was no pain. The lizard reopened its eyes to see that it was now falling down a hole. The hole did not seem to have a bottom and the walls were getting closer. The lizard reached out its bleeding foot to see if it could find some purchase on the wall. It was relieved when it could feel its claws making slight indents into the wall, slowing its descent. The lizard immediately moved all of its feet to the walls to decrease its velocity. Luckily this worked. Unluckily, the lizard was still falling fast enough that it couldn’t stop itself from hitting the bottom.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The blow stunned the lizard for a bit. And when it came to, it licked its eyes in wonder. Everything around it show a beautiful sparkling pink. It was in a large chamber in the earth, the only sources of light came from holes in the ceiling, like the one it had just fallen down. But the walls and the floor of the chamber took these few beams of light and refracted them all over, so the whole room shone this beautiful solid salmon glow. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As the lizard looked on at this wondrous sight, a feeling of unease crawled down its spine. The same instinct that had saved it from the hawk was telling it something was wrong. But what? And then the lizard noticed. The shadows were wrong. The lizard noticed that glow was not as solid as it first believed. There were this impressions against the wall that were lighter than the rest. As if the light was trying to penetrate its depth, but there was something in there that was absorbing the light. And once the lizard noticed it in one area, it couldn’t stop the seeing it wherever it turned. The lizard quickly scurried up a wall and into one of the holes in the ceilings and began to climb far, far away from the beautiful chamber. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; And once again the chamber was completely still.

**Chapter 1**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai fidgeted in her chair. That was what really drove home the seriousness of their situation. Not the harsh white light. Not the noise of the air filter leaking through the “soundproof” walls. Not the slight tang of ozone that any new air filter from the last decade had gotten rid of. It was the fact that their chair made them want to fidget. How broken can a chair be that it stops perfectly curving to your body they wondered. That’s the entire point of a chair!


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai couldn’t help but wallow in self-pity. They weren’t supposed to be here. This was a job interview for the truly desperate. Not for the first time, they cursed their father’s name. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Ahem.”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai jerked, bringing their attention back to the interviewer. The interviewer was tall and willowy, obviously a spacer and still getting used to the natural gravity of larger planetoids. 
It still made scientists scratch their heads. Nobody had ever found anything empirically different about the gravity on space stations and the gravity on planetoids or planets. Darkness, all of the planetoids and planets had some supplemental gravity to equal Terra’s. But somehow human bodies always seemed to know the difference. Spacers just seemed more spread out than those who grew up on ground, inner or outer rim. Of course nobody had any health issues living anywhere, gene therapy made sure of that.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Ahem.”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Darkness, Sai had drifted off again. They refocused their attention on the willowy interviewer. “Sorry, what was that?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The harsh light reflected of the clear plastic lenses set in a wireframe sitting in front of the interviewer’s face. The lenses were the most striking thing about the interviewer. Sai could not determine their function. They wondered if the lenses hurt. Sai couldn’t imagine holding something on their face using their nose. By this point, the interviewer had steepled their hands together and was looking at Sai. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “You’re over qualified for this position. You’ve got two Ph.Ds. in astrophysics and engineering from MIT. And yet you are applying to be an intern at a shipwright start-up. A start-up with almost no capital. Thanks to some fancy tax maneuvering this internship will be paying less than minimum wage, much less. But you already knew that. We didn’t hide the fact when we sent out the job notice. So the question is, why are you here?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai opened their mouth to answer, but by way the interviewer ignored them, it was a rhetorical question.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “There were no flags in your job application, but obviously there is something about you that has forced you into this position. And that makes me even more leery. Whatever it is that has made you this desperate doesn’t raise any flags for the United Nations, and we don’t have the spare money to run a deeper background check on you. Do you know what that makes you?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai sat fidgeting in silence this time, thinking it was another rhetorical question. After a long pause they answered, “What?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “That makes you a desperate mystery.” 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The interviewer suddenly pushed themselves forward and slammed their hands on their desk and leaned forward, those strange lenses flashing. Sia flinched back at the sudden movement, the solid air comprising their chair couldn’t quite keep up with their movement. Suddenly there was nothing supporting their back and their back hit the floor with their legs weirdly floating as the chair tried to figure out what happened to the body it was previously holding. The interviewer’s shadow loomed over Sai’s sprawled body. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “We’re trying to change the world here. We’ve got a staff of five, no capital, and a crazy idea. We don’t have time for a desperate mystery. Get out of my office.”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai tapped the pressure plate on the floor turning off the chair, allowing their legs to touch the ground. They sighed as they collected themselves off the floor and made for the door. Another job down the waste dispenser. At least this time she actually had an interview. Everyone else did have the resources to run a more in depth background check, and Sia didn’t even hear back from them. But their exit was barred by a person.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This person had most definitely been born and raised in the inner rim. There was just something about natural or close to natural gravity that made for that delightfully defined musculature nothing else could seem to replicate. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Their origin just became more obvious as they moved towards Sai. Inner rim folk moved like the gravity wasn’t the same out in the outer rim. They went from being still to an explosive movement to being still again. They almost seemed like a stop-motion hologram. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; They smiled as they approached Sai. “Oh don’t listen to that stick in the terra Minerva, I love desperate mysteries.” They stuck their hand out for Sai to shake. “Welcome to the team, I’m the CEO of Modern Combustion. Please call me Mister Vladimir.”
Sai dumbly stuck out their hand to shake Mister’s hand. “What an odd name,” they thought.

The business was not going to last much longer. In the end, we were in our twenties, chasing musicians around San Francisco who didn’t have enough money to buy lunch, let alone video and lighting production. After some tough discussions, my partner bought my share of the equipment and moved back to New York.

Upon hearing the news, another friend offered me an internship opportunity, so long as I could sit at a desk and wear button-down shirts. I was skeptical on all accounts. At the time, I didn’t know the conversation would launch me headlong into the world of Salesforce.com. So began a wonderful journey: riding the wave of one of the hottest business platforms of this decade, working at three enterprise level companies in completely different industries, and relentlessly obsessing over the inner-workings of each business model.

Four years later, I spend most of my time working with internal customers at Angie’s List. I wear many hats in an effort to bring new functionality to life. I am a business analyst, teasing out the pain points and inefficiencies within the company; a solution designer – the whiteboard is my canvas; a mentor to an ever-growing team of Salesforce administrators, project managers, and developers; a consultant to my Director, as I have lived and breathed the enterprise level best practices. Most of all, I am a team player, a chameleon. I do what the job requires in that moment and strive to bring out the best in the people around me.

I am happy with my achievements thus far, while knowing there is more to accomplish. My favorite part of my life is analysis, strategy, and innovation; not just at work but everywhere. I am a natural problem solver, relishing the high pressure of a looming deadline, and overcoming the doubt that my team will reach a viable solution to a seemingly impossible problem. I want to do that on a much broader scale, beyond the lens of a single tool.

Salesforce has been amazing, but I know every wave must crest. I want to get in front of that, hone the skills that mean the most to me, and know how to apply them anywhere. I believe an MBA will help me achieve that goal. More so, I want to learn how to harness the raw vision, the energy of new ideas; and get them out of my basement, my garage, and my head – into the marketplace and the world. I believe the program at Kelley, specifically with a focus in Entrepreneurship, will help me realize that dream.

As a philosophy major, small business owner, and enterprise level IT specialist, I have a unique perspective that I love to share. I have honed my critical thinking skills, learned my share of business lessons the hard way, and played the corporate game with continually growing degrees of success. Most of all, I am enthusiastic about achieving greatness, with great people who want to shape the future and change the world.

Here is my journey and lessons for you friends.",zacharoo12,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/54ixqk/10_months_job_hunting_finally_landed_dream_job/,"I am here to share my story in hopes that it might rub off or inspire those that are struggling to find work. 
I worked for 5 years as an outdoor instructor in NZ before eventually wanting to make something different of my life and I chose to study at the University of Auckland. I chose to study the two fields I was interested in which was philosophy and economics. To do so meant that I would have to do it through the arts faculty and only come out with an arts degree; no commerce degree for me. I did consider my studies as an investment however. I put the time into doing the readings, preparing for exams and took summer school each year in order to shave time off of my degree. I ended up completing it in 2.5 years instead of 3 but sacrificed a number of summers in order to do so. My GPA was only B+ average. Sometimes I got an A, other times I got a C+. I wasn’t a top student of any sort but I was a committed one. 

Come November 2015, I had completed my last set of exams, was feeling good about the results I would get soon and put my eyes forward to finding a job. What job did I end up wanted after my degree? Something in economics, business, accounting etc. What really tripped me up in the arts faculty was that they do not prepare you for a business template of job hunting at all, and I suppose rightly so for they are an arts faculty, not a business faculty. This meant that I was not told at the beginning that it was invaluable to be doing summer internships, work placements, volunteer work and preparing for a graduate programme at a large firm after I had finished. Instead I left in November and expected that I would probably have some sort of “office” job by December sometime and I could work my way into something I enjoyed from there. Naïve I know! But I actually had not been given any guidance or clues as to what I was to become. Maybe the business faculty of the university was supposed to do this at some point. I was interested in getting anything “economicsy” or “businessy” for the mean time. 
My first reality check involved my CV. My sister who works at a large firm saw it once in passing and immediately scalded me for bad spelling, grammar, sentence structure, syntax, font type, spacing, professional wording, you name it. I am extremely grateful for the work she and some other professionals put into making it look nice and presentable and my first piece of advice would be that; get your CV looking professional and do not underrate the value of a second opinion. A well paid for professional CV is actually worth the money hands down. These companies actually have electronic filters for CV’s. They will trawl the list of thousands of CV’s sent and delete 99% of them using keyword culling. The same goes with cover letters to a more important extent. 
So how long was it going to take me to get a job? 10 months. 10 long months of continuous searching NZ job sites, phoning people for opportunities, writing and tailoring CV’s and cover letters for each one in order for it to at least not be deleted without even being read. Here’s another opinion but I would not discard this method all together; job listing websites such as Seek NZ are almost exclusively after people with experience, or they immediately cull the ones without experience. For what it was worth to me, I never, not once, got an interview from sending my CV and Cover Letter to a company through Seek. Seek seems to work much better for people with experience and certainly not for someone trying to break into a field they don’t have a degree in. So don’t throw it just yet if this doesn’t apply to you. 
Here is where I can teach you the most on how to break into an industry. We have all heard it before, “it’s not what you know but who you know”. In my time phoning around people for jobs I had in mind my conversation would normally go something like this. “Hi X, my name is Y how are you doing today? (reply), hey look I am calling because I am a graduate from UoA in Economics and I am interested in working in (field) and I have heard you might be a valuable person to talk to and seek some advice. I am wondering if I would be able to get you a coffee and pick your brain about the profession sometime”. So this either got 1 of 2 replies. 1 being, “why should I waste my time with you, you don’t even have a commerce degree, no one is going to hire you, you made the wrong choice and need to go back to university and make better decisions” Basically they laugh you off the phone. (Click). The second reply was “I sure would love to get a coffee with you, I really appreciate the effort you have taken to get in contact with me, not many people do this, you stand out as someone with passion for field x, when do you have in mind?”. The people are few and far between but totally work the effort. Every time I sat down with one, they would buy me the coffee, I would have a large list of questions about the industry having done my homework on the field and we could talk sometimes for up to 2 hours about the field, history of it, where it is leading, job opportunities, sage advice from the person at the top. (these guys were often directors or even CEO’s, they actually are jumping in their boots to impart their knowledge, success lessons onto you). Now here’s what is interesting! I didn’t actually get a job from these guys however I can very very close. I would attribute it to just bad luck in the long run that this never worked and would actually advice this as the best way to get a job. These guys will shoot for the moon to get you a job if they like you. Sometimes the industry/company just doesn’t have a job going at the time or the decision just doesn’t stop with that specific person and you don’t get picked. The thing is that in knowing these guys, they will send your CV around to the golden destinations, put in their word for you, vouch for your passion and I even had 2 of them improve my CV once again to make it even more impressive. Once again! Call around and meet people face to face, this is the most valuable and opportune way to get a job in my opinion. 
I applied for 2 recruitment agencies. After talking with both and after a few weeks. 1 called me up asking if I wanted to be a milk man delivery driver, the other sent me to an interview that ended up being my foot in the door for office experience. These guys get you the small experiences that tally up on your CV. I ended up getting a second temporary placement through this agency to work at the might PwC big 4 firm. This was my massive break! 6 weeks working in the nicest offices you could work in. Free coffee quality machines, latest equipment, technology, software and the people are actually really nice! PwC would be one of the places I would love to work and hey I kinda did! For 6 weeks. The greatest part about this was that I now could stamp the brand of PwC on my CV. The funny thing is that no one actually cared how long I had worked there. My CV just showed I did and it was reputable. 
So after working for 6 weeks in the nicest office imaginable and now having a few office work style experiences on my CV, I continued my search in July. Once again my big break came through the people I knew. You see I had gone to an interview early in the year after applying for a job on a company’s actual website. These jobs are not listed publicly on large job listing websites but are for the opportunist that aggressively looks for them on the individual company website’s career page. The bad news? I didn’t get the job, at that point someone who had worked for a few weeks at a big 4 firm made the marginal cut and was selected over me. The good news? The liked me. They said I had passion, a good nature, the interviewer said I was a neat guy and the HR employee who dealt with me knew my name. Over the year I would ring her for jobs I saw on the website, she would remember me from when I interviewed at the start of the year and would advise me on if it would be a good suited role for me or not. Many times what I was inquiring about was not for me. Finally at the beginning of August I saw something that looked like my field, economics, attention to detail, business minded, degree in quantitative discipline etc. So I called my HR contact up (let’s call her Sally). She immediately remembered me, probably a compliment on her side for good memory and amazing skill to have for her line of work. But since we had talked together about what I was after and I was a likeably quality on their records, she “green flagged” me in an application. This means that I am a priority candidate immediately and within 2 days had an interview.
So did I get this job? No! funnily enough, for a second time, it came down to it being between me and another candidate. I had aced the first interview, I had to do a presentation for the second one and apparently aced that and now I had met some of the high up managers of the sector, the really like me and wanted me to have the job. But my competition made the marginal cut once again. I got a few interesting calls basically saying that I was great and it was close but someone else had got it. But they best news was that this commercial manager dealing with me like me so much he was going to personally fit me somewhere, rain, hail or shine! You cannot believe what that kind of call goes down like. You have a manager offering to find you a position in their company due to your skills, experience, passion etc. So a few more weeks went on by and I eventually did land myself a contract. 
Now here is the funny part! All year I had searched for something between 43k – 50k as a good starting point, I was turned down after interviews for these jobs and I turned down a few myself for it not looking like what I wanted to do. I even had one place turn me down, tell me I was arrogant and wouldn’t fit their environment due to such. This was for a 43k job remember. Sometimes me confidence which is incredibly attractive to the industry is just perceived at arrogance and it can be a fine balance when played in an interview. This place asked me for a good example of my impeccable attention to detail and I very respectfully pointed out how their website’s blog page I had read was missing a few words at the start of a paragraph; a copy and paste error it would seem. Where some companies would find this a great example, thank you for helping them improve their website and eliminate an embarrassing mistake, these guys saw it as arrogant! We all know NZ is a really PC place, and that it is smack with tall poppy syndrome and had clearly walked on these guys “eggshell” egos and they weren’t going to have anything to do with me because of such. They are a small govt enterprise by the way and govt enterprises don’t breed the kind of people/managers that will take constructive criticism for its value. Their website still has the spelling mistake/omitted words too which shows the incompetency of these kind of peoples. I have strayed, 43k is what I wanted and this company that I go the job at finally told me early in the interview stage that I had completely undersold my value by saying I expected such a short fall in pay. They said I would probably be looking at the 55-65k range if everything went through. Well! I get a coffee a few days later with the commercial manager to do a “little dance” of negotiations pre-contract so we can smooth the process. He asks if I am happy with the 70-75k offer that he can present me in a few days. I play it cool and say yes. But holy shit! That is more than I was dreaming of for a starter package jesus! Then a few days later, HR calls me, they say my reference checks with my past employers have checked out and they would like to send me the contract. Get this! My starting salary will be 89k. Once again, I play it cool. But I have already gone full super saiyan with celebration when I am off the phone. That is more than twice as much as I was hoping on a starting job and I had been turned down for less than half that much this year!

So I the contract signed, I have been looking for 10 months and I have had to go through hell to get here no knowing when it will end but it finally has and with the most amazing results. The biggest lessons I can tell you guys are all my mistakes though! These are what teach us! My CV was horrible at the start and I am sure it was binned instantly for being so. Get you CV professionally done, it’s a massive investment. Tailor your cover letters for each and every position so that it has the key phrases they had in the job description. Follow up with calls as soon as possible. HR is either your worst enemy or your best friend. If you annoy them at all, you can guarantee they will bin your CV, block your progress and feed you to the dogs. If you get on their good side, they will fight for you, vouch for you and even call you personally when they hear the good news at the end. The more eager you sound the better! The more people you talk to the better! The more contacts you network the stronger and quicker you will get the job! Know the people you are interviewing with. If you wanted to play it safe perhaps I should not have called out spelling mistakes on a website of the company interviewing me, but that is just me! I still maintain it is a good example but it won’t get swallowed as one every time. Another lesson! A company sees value in you valuing yourself well. If you say you expect 43k, they are likely to think you are only work the minimum amount, if you say you are worth 50k instead, they will see that as you being valuable to them, taking yourself and your expertise seriously and being willing to work harder. Most companies are not actually going to choose the person they can pay the least to because the person who is more valuable is probably going to make that money for the company back more than twice over with their skills. Remember the choices we make will not always bring about the result we wanted but they were still the right decisions. This is what risk and probability tell us. Sometimes the right decision will be a bad result. A last insight is that I am an Arts graduate! I don’t have a commerce degree that everyone seems to want, I don’t have a post-grad degree either! I have just networked a bunch of select people who have all helped me in some way, shape or form and have held out for what I wanted. 
I know I haven’t structured this extremely well but I wanted to write you all anyway because I know how hard it is and have been reading all your posts all year for inspiration. And now I have come out in the clear with a good future and only wish I can help you guys a little with your journey. Hang in their guys! Hold out for what you want. My way of tying my expenses over all year except for the few weeks of office work was to wash windows for a living. I have gone from making about 25k to just get by to 89k in one final signing of a contract. It gets better and the light finally shines, the hardest part is now knowing when it will but it will. Once again, thank you all for helping me all year with your advice and inspiration. I hope I can at least help one other person out today.

I'll be graduating May 2017 with a BS in Finance, BS in Economics, BA in German, and an MBA with a concentration in Finance.  I'd like to move there around June 2017.  I'm only 21, so I don't have a whole lot of work experience.  The past two years, I've held an internship at a company in the travel industry where I've been able to work in or at least shadow many different departments, including finance, pricing, analysis, contract negotiation, and customer service.

I study German and spent a few months studying in Berlin.  My language skills are probably around a B2 level.  I'm working on it though (as I mention later, I'm dating a native speaker).

I'm coming out of college with some debt, all government loans (no private).  When I graduate, I'll probably have about ~$7000 saved up.

I am in a serious relationship with a German guy.  We probably don't want to get married immediately, though.  We've talked about it as a ""someday"" thing, though, and he's mentioned it in regard to being willing to marry sooner rather than later to help me be there with him.  I don't want to rush him though, or make it seem like we're just getting married so I can live there.

I really want to get out - to get to him, and to get out of here.  My family situation has always been a bit strained, and my father recently passed.  I figure there really isn't any time that's better, or that I'd rather, pick up and leave than right now.

Where do I begin?  Especially in terms of finding a job.  I know some of my classmates (mostly in more technical fields) are beginning to interview/get offers in jobs that won't start til next year.  I think I saw once that there were websites some universities subscribed to that provided help to students who wanted to work abroad.  Do these exist?  Otherwise, what job boards can I look at?  I don't want to be teaching English or nannying; I want to make use of my degrees and be over there for the long term.  Is there anything else I should be considering or looking into?

Thank you!"

54lw4i,1493,2016-09-26,The Perils of Live TV,iia,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/54lw4i/the_perils_of_live_tv/,"One of the biggest misconceptions about live television is that it’s actually live. Let me tell you a secret: nothing is live. Everything has a built-in delay, just in case something unexpected happens. It’s not so much out of concern for the viewers, but for the advertisers. The last thing Pampers wants to deal with is some British actor saying “cunt” on a talk show or an NFL quarterback getting paralyzed after a big hit. It’s bad for the brand.

I work for the Food Network. Over the last ten years, we’ve moved from basic cooking instruction to a more “reality TV” style; lots of competitions, celebrity cameos, that whole thing. Lots of people didn’t like the change, but we got a big uptick in the younger demographics as a result. 

One of the problems with capturing a younger demographic is holding onto them as they transition into an older one. Let’s say, for example, when we started with the reality TV shows, we got a viewer named Jenny. Jenny was 22 when she first saw Ace of Cakes and became a regular viewer of the network since then. She was fresh out of college, had few responsibilities, and was enjoying being a kid. 

Fast-forward nine years. Jenny’s 31 and a stay-at-home mom. Her priorities are far different than they were when she was 22. She has two children, and, on weekdays, she babysits her brother’s twins as well. Instead of eating out all the time like she did at 22, Jenny’s responsible for feeding a household. She doesn’t have time for reality shows anymore and she wishes her cable company offered the Cooking Channel - the sister station to the Food Network that offers more how-to programming. 

There are hundreds of thousands of Jennys across the country - first generation captures from the reality-TV era who yearn for more instructional programming. But it’s a balancing act. If the Food Network goes back to their original format, they lose the potential for new, younger viewers. If they stay with primarily reality-based programming, they lose all the Jennys out there. 

Our goal, and by “our,” I mean: me and my team at the network, was to create a show to bridge that gap. After the success of The Kitchen, a Saturday morning program featuring four of the network’s biggest stars as they cook exciting recipes and give tips and techniques, we were tasked to make something for the weekday morning viewers.

We ended up creating a show that featured two of the network’s top chefs, a live studio audience, and Q&amp;A from online viewers. It was going to be as interactive a show as we’d ever made, and the twist was, it would be “live.” Now, remember what I said about “live” TV. Sure, the audience would be there watching the chefs cook and asking them questions while they did, but the online questions would be from emails. The delay would be 30 minutes.

It was a huge success in the various test markets. We had one show to go with the stand-in chefs before the show went national, this time in Oklahoma, but there was a problem. There had been a tornado warning in the county. It had since expired, but the audience was about half of what it should’ve been. We decided to go with it anyway, since we figured a lot of the at-home audience would still be inside after the storms. They’d be watching.

Right away, there were technical issues. Even though the tornado warning had passed, there were still frequent lightning strikes and other atmospheric disturbances all around the station. Things still went on, however, and the chefs started cooking. 

The first problem came when the cream wouldn’t whip. The chef made a show out of it, poking fun at the behind-the-scenes staff and trying it again with a new container of cream. Again, nothing. In my ear, one of the producers said it might have been because of the storm. He didn’t sound like he knew what he was talking about.

The chefs gave up on the whipped cream and decided to make a creme anglaise. Those require eggs. Two eggs were cracked into the mixing bowl without incident. The third, though, was bad. It was blood-red, clumpy, and smelled terrible. The odor permeated the studio quickly and I saw the audience members holding their noses. When I held my own, my fingers came back bloody. I hadn’t had a nosebleed since I was a kid. We cut to a commercial.

Neither chef was happy. They agreed to scrap the whole “dessert first” idea and just go directly to the entree. No one would complain about the basic steak-and-potatoes main course, especially in cow country. The kitchen was reset and the show resumed.

The downward spiral continued. As thunder boomed outside, loud enough to be picked up by studio microphones, the mixer for the potatoes started to smoke and emit sparks before the chef yanked the plug out of the wall and threw the whole thing in the sink. “Just goes to show you guys, disasters can happen in any kitchen,” he joked to the audience, still obviously irritated but trying to play it cool.

Potatoes got mixed and mashed by hand and the chefs fielded questions about whether or not milk or cream should be used. There was another thunderclap and the studio lights flickered. I’ve always hated working in these satellite studios - compared to the main studios in New York, these were like living in the dark ages.

The lights stayed on, thankfully, and the half-hour delay caught up to the beginning of the show. All over Oklahoma, people watching the Food Network were about to see the show for the first time. 

Problems aside, the potatoes came out great. During a commercial, I had an intern get me a spoonful. I should’ve had him get me a bowl. Didn’t matter - after the broadcast, I’d be able to eat all I wanted. 

The studio audience, to their credit, had taken all the technical problems in stride. I hoped the TV audience would do the same, and figured they would, as long as they didn’t turn the TV off in disgust at the sight of that egg.

The chefs moved on to the steak. Each discussed their favorite techniques; one preferring a sous-vide style followed by a blast in a hot pan, while the other advocated grilling it over hardwood charcoal. Both methods would be used and the lucky studio audience would get samples to taste and choose their favorite cooking method.

The cast-iron pan was hot and the grill, despite the powerful fans sucking away the smoke, filled the studio with the savory aroma of burning hardwood. I was starving. 

Chef Bob cooked his steak first, then showed the audience the perfect edge-to-edge pinkness that only a sous-vide cooked steak can achieve. The crust on the outside was magnificent. Maillard would have been proud. Wind battered the studio walls and more thunder rolled by. The power went out.

Everyone in the studio groaned, but not as loud as the executive producer. We were in a time slot. Even with the delay, which we could shorten if we had to, there was a hard out a the top of the hour when Chopped! was scheduled to air. The last thing we wanted was to have the show just cut off entirely. If the power didn’t come back on before the delay was used up, it’d look awful. Plus, we’d have to issue refunds to the local advertisers who’d purchased that time.

We waited. And waited. And waited. We had less than a minute of delay left before the power went back on. The whole team was galvanized into action and, with only one second of delay left, we resumed filming. 

For the first time in about 20 years, the broadcast was fully live. I thanked God we weren’t in front of a national audience, because if someone screwed up and said a bad word, the FCC fines we’d have to deal with would be crippling.

More thunder rumbled outside as the chef talked about how sous-vide was a nice novelty, but almost everyone, in reality, preferred a grilled steak. He seasoned as he talked, obviously comfortable with the cameras and the audience who hung on every word. The grill, which had to be refilled with more charcoal to bring it back up to temperature after the delay, was screaming hot again. The chef used his laser thermometer to take the temperature of the coals. 733 degrees. Perfect for the initial sear.

Another clap of thunder and the lights flickered again. I felt my stomach leap with panic, but the lights stayed on. We only had 11 minutes left before Chopped! came on.

With the seasoning complete and the audience dying to see the steak get cooked, the chef picked up the rib eye with his tongs and carefully placed it on the searing grill.

The other chef began to scream. Everyone, including the production crew, jumped. With expertise honed by years in television, the camera operators instinctively turned the cameras toward the screaming man. 31 studio audience members and 14,000 households across Oklahoma watched as the chef’s skin blistered and charred. 

“What the fuck is going on?,” the executive producer shouted, his voice clearly audible over the screams of pain and panic. Before the cameras could pan away, the chef’s eyes burst in an explosion of boiling lachrymal fluid and blood. The skin on his nose, forehead, and cheeks bubbled and blackened.

As EMTs rushed toward the man, one of them knocked over a carton of eggs and sent the contents splattering across the floor. Behind me, with a sound I will never forget for as long as I live, Dave, the sound engineer, crumpled to the floor with his body in knots of hideously broken bones; his skull caved in and leaking brain matter onto my shoes.

The loudest thunderclap yet drowned out even the panicked shouting and screams of pain. And that was it. When all was said and done - whatever it was that had been said and done - Dave was dead. The chef was dead. The cameras had never stopped rolling. Not until Chopped! came on.

The Food Network settled lawsuits for the better part of a year. Needless to say, our show wasn’t picked up. No one could ever figure out what had happened, but the funerals I attended and the trauma endured by the audiences, both studio and remote, are proof enough that I didn’t imagine it. If you know anyone in Oklahoma who was watching the Food Network on April 11th, 2015 between 10 and 11am, ask them what they saw. They’ll tell you. I’ll bet they haven’t watched a single live broadcast of anything ever since.

And yes, the network got an FCC fine from the producer saying “fuck” on air. They were okay with the burning skin, for some reason.

I could use a bit of advice. I spent ~7 years at my University working towards two degrees; Electrical Engineering and Physics. During which I had multiple internships within the space/defense industry. Worked at two great companies after University before landing my dream job at a top Space &amp; Defense company.

This is what I've always wanted. I've worked my ass off to get to this place in life and now that I'm working at what is supposed to be my ""dream career"", I want out.
Everything is so shiny and interesting when you're in college but once you get into the workforce, it dulls.....real quick. 

I love creating. Anything from clothing and bags, to amphibious robots and quad copters. That's what inspired me to become an Engineer; the idea that I could spend the rest of my life creating. Now I'm in the field I love, creating and implementing the ideas someone else loves.

Maybe it's my fault. I chose a career where there really isn't as much innovation as you would imagine. Most of what we work on has been around for decades. We're just innovative in the way we apply it.

I'm ready to leave my dream career.
I have a few ideas I want to work on, and a group of friends that are in a similar situation.

I want to know if anyone else (i'm sure there are many) has been in this situation and made the leap.
What struggles did you go through? Did you miss that job security? At any point did you try and run back? Did you succeed and find what you loved?"

A bit about myself, which may or may not be relevant to critiquing:  I'm 32.  Just finished my second BA degree this past spring, in Computer Science.  I finished it in 3 years with a 3.3+ GPA.  

After my first degree in Psychology, I had an internship assisting a Human Resources department with administration, and continued my part-time job at Starbucks as a Supervisor.  Then I decided to spend two years teaching English in South Korea.  Upon returning I finished my other degree in CS, as mentioned above.

I'm a bit self-conscious about what I've included as work history since it's not very relevant to computer science, aside for the internship done last summer.  On the other hand, I can't just have a blank resume.

To explain why I put ""ASAP"" in the title: on a whim my parents, whom I live with currently, have suddenly decided to move to Ecuador within the next 2-3 months, which is much sooner than I was expecting.  I can't exactly afford to stay in NJ without a job.  

Needless to say, I'm having a minor panic attack at this prospect as I feel like moving to South America directly after graduating (and not getting a first job in the field) is a bad move.  I don't want to get pigeon-holed into teaching English again; I want to get established in a CS position in the States.  Even the most basic Comp Sci job, say, Help Desk would be acceptable.  

Thanks in advance for critiquing my resume and any other advice you might have."

I graduated this past may with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I'm not very passionate about programming or engineering and do not have any impressive projects under my belt besides the standard school homework assignments. I do not have any internship or other computer science/engineering/networking work experience, just what is shown. 

I've had a few resume critiques in the past and have had people say I should and should not include my GPA. I graduated with an overall 2.58 on a 4.0 scale. My major/class specific GPA is not much better.

I did find studying for the CCNA to be a lot more interesting than anything I did in college and after browsing the various Networking/IT communities on reddit for a few months, have decided that I would be much happier pursuing this career path. I am okay with starting off in a entry level help desk position for a few months before moving up. If I were to go back to school, I would have definitely changed my major but hind sight is 20 20. At least I have my degree.

I'm currently living with my parents and have a lot of time to learn new material. Whats an absolute must for me to learn next? I want to be a more competitive and useful applicant.

I'm a 24 yo Master's Degree student in Electrical Engineering. Did a lot of signals and machine learning applications (MATLAB dominated, so yeah... no bueno)

Thinking ahead about jobs, I realized that for the jobs I wanted, I really needed more legit software experience. I've done lots of Python and MATLAB stuff for my own ends both in and out of my degree, but didn't seriously use anything else or do anything in any real workflow. I realize I should probably have addressed this earlier, but better late than never.

I figured that my next move is to take an internship to gain experience. The only thing I'm worried about is the fact that I might be perceived as too deep in EE with a Master's to be considered for internships where I'm going to be competing with sophomore-senior undergrads, even though I'm not that far removed from them in terms of age. I also feel insecure because I simply don't have the background CS students have and may not be able to answer questions as well (data structures, algorithms... didn't get any of that since the EE curriculum). However, I do have over a year's worth of internship experience (EE related) plus my research experience for my degree, so at least I have that. I'm also running through lots of coding exercises.

In short, is the fact that I'm competing with a bunch of students in a different phase of life going to hurt in my search for an internship? Are companies gonna say ""wtf is a guy with a Master's doing looking for an internship""?

What should I start doing now?,valuemachine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/54nvcq/looking_to_secure_a_business_analyst_position/,"Hey everyone, I'm looking to work as a business analyst (I know, broad term) when I get out of school because it encompasses what I want out of a job and my interests. I like the balance of working with people while being able to find technology solutions to business problems.

My situation: I'm a MGMT Information Systems (MIS) major at a top 25 business school in my Senior year. I just switched to this major and started taking the classes last semester after completing pretty much all of my required core classes in business and liberal arts. I ended up taking 3 finance classes and realized I didn't want to work in that field so I switched to MIS and I'm enjoying the classes a lot more.

Problem is, I never took the initiative to get an internship or any real world experience partly due to being unsure of what I even wanted to do at the time. I have gathered some skills along the way, but nothing amazing. I have basic proficiency in Java, HTML/CSS, Javascript and C++ so I know how coding works. I actually wanted to be a web developer at one point but realized I would hate punching in code all day without any human interaction. I'm also working on my SQL skills (I find SQL extremely fun to use so far, don't ask me why) and taking a databases class at the moment. I could also see myself working with databases as a DB admin so that's a possibility as well. I just don't have amazing skills yet. I'm also taking a business analysis class and learning about different data visualization tools and how to use them. I like the idea of working with data as well.

My question for you guys is, should I try to get an internship 20hrs/week if I'm taking 5 major classes at once or would that be too much do you think? I'm afraid of graduating with no experience and frankly I have a lot of free time right now despite taking all these classes.

What types of internships should I be looking for and where can I find them? I'm kind of a newbie when it comes to finding jobs and networking. All I have on my resume are part time jobs. What else should I put on there? I can do basic stuff like host Wordpress websites and can figure out most things involving computers. I put up a basic Wordpress site with a theme for a family friend. Should I mention something like this? What should I be doing in the meantime to sharpen my marketability in the eyes of employers? I just feel very behind and don't know where to start, as the career services at my school has a heavy focus on finance/accounting people but leaves MIS majors in the dust IMO.

Would love to hear from current/former business analysts or anyone with MIS degrees. Thanks a bunch!"

Today, I brought up the fact that the app they're using to code has bugs in it, and despite the fact I probably wouldn't be able to fix it, I know there is a bug in it since the app restarts on it's own.

This is a $1k, 3-month coding camp for children ages 7 - 11, with about 20 kids registered in the class. I am not paid for any work. The CEO profits from everything because the computers are all funded by the school. 

Basically the CEO snapped at me, told me that there's nothing wrong with the app. Later tonight he told me he needs to ""talk"" to me. Mind you he's a *incomplete* business major, not a CS major with little CS experience besides college. He treats me disrespectfully and never formally trained me to be an intern and is quite unprofessional. 

I've been a month into this start-up and I don't think I can take it any longer. But it is also my first CS/CE related internship so I'm a bit conflicted if I should walk or not. I do kinda feel shitty that I wasted a month with this, so I'm thinking about staying at least to say I was there for 3 months. 

What would be the smartest move?  

UPDATE: Called the labor office, highly advised that I should file a claim. Will be talking to the CEO later today, will tell him that this was not the right fit and that I am not learning anything from this company. Will make updates if anything changes! 

UPDATE 2: CEO canceled are morning ""talk"" in which we planned out yesterday. I emailed him a resignation stating that this position wasn't for me and that I did not feel like I was learning anything / utilizing past experience or knowledge to benefit from the company. Told him, thank you for your time. "

I've been working part time at various places that are not related to software development at all, as a result of this I've saved up a good chunk of money. Originally my plan was to take half a year to a year traveling with my girlfriend of 6 years with my savings. Unfortunately those plans fell through due to family problems that I don't want to go into full detail, but basically after I graduate I have to take care of my mom and sister financially. My mom currently does not work due to medical issues and my sister is currently a sophmore in high school.

I know that people have already been applying for post grad jobs, and I am worried I won't secure one since I have not done anything yet, even more so since I am graduating in March. Is it already too late to start applying for jobs? I also have a really bad GPA (2.4 - 2.5) and no relevant internships. I have a few projects from my CS classes to put on my resume, but that's really it when it comes to showing off coding skills. What can I do from now to March that can help me secure a good job after graduation? My family is from the bay area, so the job would preferably be there, but I am afraid that it is very competitive in Silicon Valley. I have just purchased Cracking the Coding Interview after searching around here, and I'll be going through it during my free time. Should I also try to come up with any personal projects? My course load is not that bad since I am taking a networks class, combinatorics, and two GE's that shouldn't take up that much time.

Is there much hope in securing a cs-related job in March with my bad resume and lack of experience? I really don't want to continue working at these part-time jobs if I have to take care of 2 more people."

After spending six weeks job searching, I found a new job at a startup with a 15k pay cut (102k to 87k)... and got fired again last Friday after two months for different reasons.


It has been less than a year since I graduated and now I have to look for my third job. I don't even know if I want to put this startup on my resume since two short stints make me look super bad to potential employers, but the 3-month employment gap might be worse. I honestly don't know why I keep getting fired. The first company said my code wasn't good enough and this startup said I'm doing an amazing job (ironic because they fired me for being constantly &lt;1 min late). 


Some advice for my situation would be great appreciated. I want to grow my career and be able to stay at a company long term. Constantly bouncing between multiple short stints isn't good, and as time passes since graduation I'm already starting to have an increasingly hard time securing new employment. Please help!"

54pebk,1,2016-09-27,I have a newly acquired chronic health condition: what are some options to consider now that my life has been altered due to a disability?,Shakkabuku,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/54pebk/i_have_a_newly_acquired_chronic_health_condition/,"Tl;dr I have many degrees, but they only qualify me for low-paying jobs, and now a chronic health condition is further limiting some of my career options.

I'm in the US, and I have an assortment of degrees and nearly finished degrees. My bachelor's is in speech-language pathology (cannot practice at the bachelor's level), my Master's in applied linguistics, and I also have a graduate certificate in educational technology/instructional design. I'm also done with everything but my final internship in another masters in counseling psychology, and I'm ABD (just that pesky dissertation left) to finish a PhD in psycholinguistics. Halfway through my PhD I realized my department wasn't giving me the training I'd need to be competitive, so I used my PhD funding (teaching jobs) to concurrently do a practical program (counseling) while I finished my PhD courses and dissertation.

I was actually doing quite well with keeping up with both of these, and I was on time to graduate from both at the same time, along with selling and publishing a science fiction novel. Then I had an acquired spine condition from being a passenger in a really bad spine accident, and ended up needing neurosurgery. Since the surgery (7 months ago), nothing has gone well. I have constant migraines from the tension in my neck, and continuing myelopathy/neuropathy/radiculopathy from the surgery. I've had almost every spine injection and outpatient surgical procedure, including radiofrequency ablation done through most of my c-spine. Still, nothing works, and I'm just in constant pain. Several specialists have told me this might just be how I'm stuck permanently, which is extremely sad.

Along with that, I'm now way behind on finishing both of my degrees. It's just not going to happen this semester, and I'm out of my funding period. I just have to beg for jobs and hope my PhD department takes sympathy on me.
So I'm not sure what to do. I don't know if I can or should finish either of my current degrees, and I don't know how functional I'd be trying to get a regular job--and all the job options are low-paying, since I'm drawn to helping or artsy careers. Another factor is that even when I'm not sick, I have a delayed sleep phase, and morning work is difficult for me. I do it, but it just slowly makes me sick because I don't get enough sleep, and none of my previous jobs/degrees are really suitable for night shift work. I was a veterinary technician for many years prior to this, and worked a night shift easily, but techs make almost no money, and it's a very physically demanding job.

Any advice about what to do? I wish I'd been able to do a clinical psychology program because they make so much more money, but I don't know if I have another five years of grad school in me.

Another *probably* bad idea I've been noodling with is getting an MFA in Creative Writing. I'm already published, but you make basically nothing in that industry as well. Since I already have a TESOL credential/years of experience teaching ESL, if I had an MFA I'd hopefully be attractive to English departments or programs. I know it's very hard to find a job teaching creative writing job full-time, but sometimes it's easier if you can teach one or two creative writing classes and fill in the rest with the always-needed ESL and basic writing courses. Writing is my true passion (and if you asked if I could do anything for a living, I'd say writing, if money weren't a factor).

Big rambling post, but if anyone has any thoughts or ideas I haven't considered yet, I would really appreciate it. I'm open to pretty much anything. Thank you.

Edit: the fixation with salary isn't because I'm money-hungry so much as I'm now drowning in medical bills, and that's probably something that won't ever stop. Unless I want to live under a bridge somewhere, a low-paying not for profit job or something of that nature isn't going to work anymore :/ "

I've revamped my resume and while I do get calls, every interview I've had comes back with ""we went with someone who better suites our needs and has more experience."" my problem is I don't have a lot of experience in my field. My previous jobs are kind of all scattered.  

In college I wanted to move towards editing film- I took a lot of classes for it in college but it has been so long and I can't afford my own camera or equipment to do it freelance. I only have 2 videos I have done on my own and old college film that hasnt been moved to a USB. Also I feel like at my age the younger generation are a lot more technically inclined, I haven't kept up with it.

I did volunteer for non profits and I really enjoy helping other people. I thought maybe I could even shoot some film for an organization after landing a job with them. I haven't landed a non profit job either.

I did get various temp jobs, that lead to very high stress for me with the ""not knowing when i'll get another call or my next gig."" I was only doing it really to get me started here but it never led to any full-time positions. especially since I learned the company has to pay out to the agency if they want to hire you... or so I was told.

So im stuck. Applying for jobs constantly and getting turned down. Entry level positions I apply for want more experience but I can't afford to do an internship at my age and try to make ends meet with another job. 

I'm just ready to throw in the towel and give up. I did get accepted on shiftgig so I'll be able to bring in some income but I wan't someone to give me a chance in my field of interest. It's just not happening for me.

Any advice on interviews, standing out more, or how to land an entry level position I want would be greatly appreciated.

Alot of my peers also have internships, and most are graduating into a job (our school isn't top, but it still has a 95% job placement rate, and our alums usually don't know anyone that also graduated without a job offer).  Is it mainly oversaturated at large tech companies, which I see happening, or are smaller companies, contracting firms, and non-tech companies' ITs also tightening up?

I decided late last 2015/early 2016 that while it really would be a nice career, and I think grad school could be a fun way to spend my twenties, I do not want to pursue it due to job prospects and other reasons. This meant I had to accent my B.A. in Philosophy some to be a competitive applicant. For a college grad my resume isn't terrible, I have worked at a law firm doing case research (legal assistant), been a marketing intern for a campus outreach program, wrote for the school's economics magazine, completed research in an organic chemistry lab which resulted in my name on a paper(I went through a pre-med phase) and worked as a line cook all throughout college to pay the bills. I also began to teach myself Python last December, making slow progress.

I applied to about 50 jobs in the spring in a panicky, ""I'm going to graduate with 35k debt in 8 weeks and I have no definitive plans!"" frenzy. I was trying to use the qualitative and quantitative research experience I have from the law firm and lab coupled with my writing skills to get a job as a research associate as a D.C. think tank, or non-profit. I heard back from a company in Boston offering me a part-time job, and got 2 rejections letters. I understand that I was inexperienced at writing cover letters and tailoring my resume, so I wasn't too let down.

I decided to teach English in South Korea for year (I arrived in Seoul in August) to save some money, pay down my student loans, travel a bit, and use the free time to work on skills for jobs. My one year goal is to become proficient (read: not an expert, but ahead of the curve) in Python and Google Analytics, familiar with another language (C++, Javascript, Ruby, or R) and try to build a small portfolio of projects I've completed. After my year in South Korea is up (Aug 2017), I want to move to a bigger city like Denver, D.C., Boston, or Seattle with the money I've saved.

I mentioned knowing what I want to do.. The truth is I know what I like doing and I need help figuring out the career for me. I still like the idea of working for a political think tank, and I think with more ""hard skills"" to pair with my liberal arts degree I would have a better chance. I'm thinking of journalism as well, maybe even ""data journalism."" I have also thought about trying to get an internship or even a position as a junior data analyst for some company as well. I really like thinking hard about problems, imagining solutions, and writing about them- it's why I studied philosophy. What are other fields that would use the mixture of hard and soft skills I'll have in a 8 months when I'm applying for jobs in the U.S. again? I kind of want to work in something at least tangentially related to public or foreign policy, because I find it interesting.

If I felt like I could handle teaching for two years, I might consider staying in Korea, because at the end of 24 months here I will have just turned 24, I can have paid off over 18k in student loans, saved up 5k+ in cash, and done a lot of traveling (I've made an excel sheet to make a budget, and predict all of this based on my spendings and monthly salary). I would be scared of becoming a less desirable applicant though, as well as suffering from burnout here.

Sorry for writing so much, I think I just wanted to write my story down to get it off my chest.

**TL;DR:** Liberal arts grad is learning some programming to broaden his skill set. He likes writing, problem solving, researching, and learning new things. Give him some advice or insult his B.A."

I go to a large public university. I’m a Senior, and I’m majoring in a field that is basically IT and minoring in IT (literally IT). I’ve worked two on campus jobs in IT. One was a walk in helpdesk for the general public, the other was a department specific help desk. Right now I’m doing an internship with an actual company, so when I graduate I should have 3 years of level 1/level 1.5 experience. Right now I’m studying for the A+ which I should’ve done over the summer, but I’m not sure if I should try and finish, go for a different cert, or learn something like PowerShell/SQL/some programming language. So the question is, what do I do from here? I'm pretty much banking on my degree and experience. Do you its are enough to get a decent job (L2, SysAdmin, Support Analyst) in Washington/Oregon? 

So there are a lot of things I should've done over the summer which I have not done, so I will try and get things done now before graduation. "
54rp33,193,2016-09-27,Graduating from college and transitioning to work life is the best thing that ever happened to me,doorway84760138,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54rp33/graduating_from_college_and_transitioning_to_work/,"So I graduated from a public school near the SF Bay Area with a degree in CS in June and after 6 weeks of vacation I started working at a local software company. I’ve now been working for a while and have a decent sense of what is going on. Most importantly, I enjoy my job and the people that I work with. My job is fun and my company culture is very exciting. Even though it is a private company (and we get no stock) we are accommodated well for our efforts and we have competitive salaries.

When I was in college, I was incredibly depressed most of the time. I had very little free time to go to the gym, play sports, and do other things. I had severe anxiety almost all the time and I developed an alcohol addiction. I hated the stress of having so many programming assignments and having to spend so much of my damn time getting work done. My professors were mostly terrible, my assignments were boring and uninteresting, and I was surrounded by a good amount of assholes that only cared about getting jobs at the Big 4 and bragging about their internships. It was a very toxic environment. I was about ready to drop out my senior year. I absolutely hated everything about going to school.

Now that I am working, I am in the best shape of my life. Everyone would always tell me that college is supposed to be the best 4 years of your life, but those 4 years were hell for me. I’ve now lost a good amount of weight by lifting and playing sports almost every day, I have disposable income and can do lots of fun things in the Bay Area, and I have made a lot of good friends at work. I have never been this healthy or felt this good about myself in my entire life. I love my job and I look forward to going to work every day.

Anyway I just typed this (on a throwaway account) for… actually I am not sure. I just want to give people some hope I guess. If you don’t like college, it will get better. It feels great to have some disposable income and finally have some free time. Life is great. 

Did anyone else have similar findings? I am interested to hear your stories.

I've been reading up on what kinds of parts to pick out for a ~1k€ gaming pc. but it is my first time and i don't know much about computers so i'd appreciate some advice. Here is the list of parts:

Processor: Intel Core i5 6600 4x 3.20GHz

CPU Cooler: Hyper 212 Evo

GPU: MSI GeForce GTX 1070 Gaming X 8G

PSU: EVGA 600B Non-Modular 80+ Bronze

RAM: 8GB Crucial Ballistix Sport LT DDR4-2400 DIMM CL16 Dual Kit

DVD Drive: LG Electronics GH24NSC0 DVD-RW SATA intern 

SSD: 250GB Samsung 750 Evo 2.5"" (6.4cm) SATA 6Gb/s TLC Toggle (MZ-750250BW)

HDD: 1000GB WD Blue WD10EZEX 64MB 3.5"" 

Tower: Corsair Carbide Series 200R Mid Tower

Monitor: 24"" BenQ GL2460HM 2ms response time

This all rounds up to about 1250€ which is stretching the budget a bit but it's fine, but it shouldn't go higher than this. I plan to play all kinds of games such as World of Warcraft, CS:GO and League of Legends on this computer, as for the graphics i'd love to play on highest graphics available on said games, but really what im looking for is as smooth a gameplay as i can get, i'm more into the competetive side of gaming as opposed to looking at shiny trees. I don't plan on overclocking considering i have no knowledge of such. I'd also like to be able to livestream but that's not the main focus.

I'd be forever thankful if you could check it out and maybe give me some advice on better choices, for example i wasn't sure if the MSI or Asus GPU was better. Also i'd like to know if everything is compatible with everything.

I live in Finland and I'm ordering from the German site Mindfactory.de

Thanks in advance :)

I'd really appreciate any advice you have and would love to hear about similar experiences. 


I recently earned my Associates at a CC and planned to finish up a BS degree in computer science at a university. However, I took on an internship this semester that is making me second guess whether I am cut out for this line of work, including the corporate world. I really do not enjoy my current job (IT analyst) or the people I work with. Every day is extremely dull and slow and I feel like any soul I use to have has slowly shriveled and disappeared. I have been here for just about 4 months now. During this time I have definitely become depressed, but I reassured myself that it was just because of the change (moving away from home, sitting all day, little to no work to keep busy, and super boring coworkers). 


This probably has a lot to do with the fact that I'm accustomed to a much faster paced workplace. Before I took on this internship, I was a meat cutter. I absolutely loved my work and felt very confident in it. My coworkers were amazing and I loved meeting new customers who I'd exchange recipes and cooking tips with. I really loved working hard and pushing my body to its limits (I'm a female, so it was quite strenuous for me at times). However, I never viewed the job as a career choice due to the lack of decent salary and 50+ hour work weeks with no weekend or weekdays off. 


I never realized how much I would miss the job until I left. I assumed I could make the most out of any work experience and while IT isn't considered to be the most fun, I figured the salary, weekends and holidays off, benefits, and regular hours/routine would make up for any lack of excitement. 


A major concern of mine is that I am giving up the chance to challenge my mind, if I decide to rejoin the food world. I really enjoy learning new things and I was looking forward to continuing school, but I also don't want to waste two years and $30,000 to find out I'd be happier where I started. 


So where would you go from here?


Sorry for the lengthy narrative. I realize this has become the money vs happiness quandary, but I would love to hear any productive thoughts. Thanks!

This isn't an interview, so I won't spend most of my time patting myself on my back for my life's accomplishments-some readers will appreciate that.
I just wanted to introduce myself to the community, and maybe inspire someone my age to think  "" I can try too!"". I currently work 6-6, Monday-Saturday as a middle manager for a large pest control company. I'll be 30 in December and I had to ask myself ""what do I want to be when I grow up?"" If you're like me, perhaps you hoped lighting would strike- Eureka!  Lighting doesn't strike for many of us. 

My degree is in Business Administration/Marketing, but I didn't aggressively pursue the field upon graduation. Maybe it was self-esteem, but I seemed to aim low in my job prospects only to end up with a  promotion I didn't ask for.  My advice to the college kids, do the internships, network and have a basic plan for when you graduate. Seems simple enough, but we don't all take good advice.

 Although some of my family members code for careers, it was an Uber driver that watered the seed of my pursuit. I saved his information... I have this fantasy that I will get the entry-level coding job one day and show him how much I appreciated our conversation. 

I have taken teamtreehouse and codeacademy lessons for a few months now, but I'm also not getting any younger. I'm going to take the plunge and do a coding bootcamp. I will have to move to a part time job waiting tables to pay the bills, but it will allow me a lot more time to study and focus. Even though the bootcamp is 6 months (3 days a week with 20-40 hours of homework a week). I'm not fooled by the claims of the camp.  I wouldn't be surprised if I had to work an additional 6 months to a year to be job ready.  I'm terrified, but excited and driven.

Part of my bootcamp pre-work is to create a game in ""Scratch"", a kid's programming website. I wanted to encourage all of the ""wannabe"" programmers like me to take a stab at designing something on this site. It was a lot of fun! You'll impress yourself with the problems you solve as you create your own projects. If you're too advanced, share it with a friend that could take an interest in coding-  who knows, you could be THEIR ""uber driver"".

Last semester I dealt with the stress with smoking a ton of weed and putting off sleep with a TON of adderall I could cop off of friends. Over the summer I decided to give up both of those with internships coming up and I decided I need to grow up at some point and quit treating my body like shit. I have tried so hard to keep up with my class work but as soon as I'm done with a heap of work, I get stacked with more horseshit work. I'm 5 weeks in and I am drowning in stress and school work. I average less then 6 hours of sleep per night, I am popping caffeine pills like no other, and week by week I am hating my life more and more. I am currently taking 15 hours as 3rd year MEEN student but probably go to class between 16-19 hours a week w/ labs, and am taking all core classes(thermo, diff equations, mechanical analysis, etc). I go to a very good engineering school notorious for weeding the fuck out of their engineers. I work about 10 hours a week. Pretty much Sunday - Thursday I am busting my ass 24/7. Fridays I have off. Both Fridays and Saturdays I am normally lying around with a migraine from lack of sleep during the week and caffeine withdrawal and sometimes being sick.

What is some advice you fellow engineering students can give me to prevent this horrible burnout I experience and general hatred of my life by the mid semester every fucking semester. Also when does it get better? I am still not enjoying most of my classes (with the exception of the design classes I have taken, those are really cool). Most of it is really tedious and time consuming that really feels like something put in the coursework to weed me out (especially those god damn 3 hour labs with lab reports that take a minimum of 5 hours to do).

the fact is, that I'm four years into my physics PhD and I don't have much to write about yet. My contract at uni ends in 12 months and there is no hope for renewal. I feel like I am too far behind in my research to catch up and somehow make it work in the remaining months. I am almost sure that there is no way I can succeed in getting that PhD even if I give it my all. There is also the problem that going to uni and to my lab makes me profoundly unhappy. I avoid going there and break down crying on a weekly basis.  I don't like my topic and don't care that much anymore about the title.  But most importantly I don't really live anymore and I have been feeling like this for over two years. I don't want to go on like this for another year. So I need a plan B.

I am really interested in data science and think that I could be good at it. Unfortunately, at the moment, I do not yet possess the necessary skills to get hired as a data scientist, such as Python, SQL, statistics and math, Hadoop and its ecosystem,...
I have the following idea:
to quit my Phd and move to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam for a year. I could use this time to learn the skills and build a portfolio I need to get hired. The cost of living would be less then in my current country. Obviously I wouldn't use this year primarily as vacation time but really focus on progressing as a data scientist to be and also start the application process before returning home.

I currently have around 14000€. A year in asia would cost me about 8000-9000€. This is my calculation for one year: 2555€ hostel costs + 800€ flights + 4400€ food + 350€ health insurance.
This would leave me with 3000-4000€ for unexpected costs, emergencies and resettling home afterwards.
Am I totally mad? Or could this actually work?
I would move around by bike (have done this before) and stay predominantly in hostels with wifi so I can access MOOCs and other online resources.

I have parents who I think would take me in for a few months if it takes too long to get a job after return. I am aware that I probably won't get hired as a data scientist without experience and that the skills acquired during that year might only land me an internship. I'm ok with that. I just really like the topic and want to work my way up.

Plan C could be to stay here and find a ""stupid"" part-time job outside of physics and use the remaining time for data science education. But then I might not make enough to pay for health insurance and a flat and food in Europe,...
Please tell me if I'm totally crazy and delusional. Also any other advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Naturally, an internship is what I'm focusing on getting. I went to my school's career fair last week, saw this cyber security company that was offering internships. Within 5 min of talking to the guy, he basically offered me an internship (unpaid, would've been paid if I had prior security experience). I met up with him the next day to talk it over, and that's when I was officially offered it. My first ""task"" is to web crawl on Linkedin and pretty much grab whatever IT-related people in my area and toss 'em into an Excel doc (over 2,000 people).

What should I do at this point? I realize it's not even a week in, but this is my first internship so I really don't have an idea of if I'm getting exploited or not.

Currently have 26.5 credits and only need 3 more credits from required courses in order to graduate with an advanced studies. School didn't offer any IT classes, regrettably did not find out about my local community college's classes until after the classes were already a month and a half in, technically they are still open to enrollment but they are almost halfway through for this semester so I do not believe that will be best. My GPA is above average for my school though not the best (3.5).

Highest math right now is Calculus and only technical class is AP CSA (Java).

I am currently planning to start studying for the A+ Certification in the next few days even though some people claim that it is useless. I personally feel that it isn't entirely useless, no matter how much I think I know about computers, there will always be things I do not know. And I plan to study for the Net+ Certification. These are just to have some entry level certs for an entry level job.

My plan is to get an entry level IT job and study for other certifications as I gain experience and then use the experience and certifications to apply to WGU for the IT Bachelors Network Administration program and complete the courses while I work to move up in the field and gain experience. I do not want to rack up an absurd amount of debt at a typical 4 year school though community college is always an option along with Federal Aid.

From what I gathered from this sub:

- http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/ is a great resource, although it doesn't seem to be entirely related to Network Administration but seems to have some good information to know, should I read the entirety of it?

- I should setup a homelab. I haven't used Linux very much other than basic Ubuntu for a short period of time and know next to nothing about servers, most I've done is setup NoMachine for remote PC access. Someone had suggested to get familiar with Linux and I think that is a great idea.

- attend conferences and whatnot to meet people who work in the field and to have contacts (I believe the saying is ""its not about what you know, its about who you know"" though I doubt that is always the case)

- internship. I actually have a possible internship lined up, I really hope it works out.

- volunteering. I've done some volunteer work though nothing IT related. I think I have the possibility to volunteer at my school's IT.

- programming. I've taken AP CSA and got a 4 on the AP Test. I also had worked a fair amount with it outside of the class prior. I looked at Python some, feel that I need to work with it more.

- keep up to date with current technologies and trends, read stuff such as the State of IT on this subreddit. I think that is something I will start doing as I only recently discovered this sub but wish I had discovered it months ago.

If anyone can critique my ""plan"" or offer any words of advice, please feel free to.

Thank you for your time.

I've read the FAQ and done some research for the past week and I have an idea of how to get into the field. I would like some feedback and advice on my plan.

I am 25 Y/O and reside in Orange County and Los Angeles. I graduated with a BS in Biological Sciences in 2015 (GPA wasn't too good at all, around 3.0-3.2) and was going to pursue healthcare. During my year off, I decided that I want to work in the tech field instead, and leaning towards system administrator field.

I have no tech work experience (although I do build computers occasionally and do some admin work at physical therapy workplace), and the only experience I have is as a physical therapy aide, physical therapy volunteer, and many years of working in a restaurant as a server.

What I'm thinking is:

1) Go back to school for a BS in Computer Science.

2) Pursue certifications while continuing to work part time and look for internships (working on A+, planning on studying for MCSE and Server+).
I would also actively look for a fulltime entry level job ie helpdesk or junior system admin job; but looking around on craigslist and indeed, it seems like many job postings require 1-2+ years of experience (so much for entry level postings).

I'm leaning towards option 2 because I don't want to be in debt and read many success stories about the individuals getting into the IT field without the relevant degree. I would appreciate any advice on what entry level IT positions are the best to shoot for, and what general path would be best for me to take in my current situation. Thanks all!"

All of this is on my resume (for now). I was pretty much brushed off at the fall career fair and had a couple questions.

One, are there any companies out there that you think would give me a chance, especially in the Chicago area? I'd have to apply online but I really would like this opportunity. A couple of companies at the career fair pretty much told me they'd love to give me an interview, took down my availability, etc. but they also mentioned that preference has to be given to upperclassmen. Needless to say, no one called me.

Two, how are things at the spring career fairs? Will I still have a shot at internships during that time or is everything pretty much filled up? By then, I will have solidified GPA (working hard to keep 4.0 through the semester) and a couple of applicable skills (Creo and Python). Also, my next set of coursework will be Design for Manufacturability (more 3D modeling and design processes/methods/tolerances/etc.), diff. equations, electricity and magnetism, and statics.

Tl;dr: I am a freshman taking somewhat advanced coursework for my age and was wondering what kind of internship opportunities are out there, especially with respect to spring career fairs.

Thanks!"

54uy7j,0,2016-09-28,Software to Embedded?,throwaway-CSCQ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54uy7j/software_to_embedded/,"Background: I graduated with a B.S. in computer engineering and a background mix of hardware and software (C/C++, parallel/GPU programming, microcontrollers, robotics). No internships, but some good class projects, a very good senior design project and some personal projects mixed in (Arduino/electronics related).

I've been trying to find a job for the last four months, but it seems like most companies want people who do web development and full stack stuff, and those that *are* looking for firmware/embedded engineers are trying to fill mid/senior-level roles that require years of experience I don't have. I've tried applying to both software and hardware jobs, but the furthest I've gotten are coding samples (not even a phone screen). I'm not worried about trying to get a back-end software engineering or web development job, but I'm worried if I accept an offer I won't be able to eventually move to firmware or embedded engineering. Is it realistically possible to start in software/front-end and move to hardware/embedded, or would I just pigeon-hole myself? I would love to do firmware/embedded engineering, but as this job search gets longer I'm starting to consider accepting nearly anything."

I still think that this is a miracle... I never thought I'd get a job, let alone at a good company. My grades were average, I was okay in classes, but only were really good a in a few classes. My transcript is a spectrum of a small amount of As and a lot of Bs and Cs and a small amount of Ds.. I also never had any internships in my 4 years of college. Regardless, I got an interview with this company.

When I interviewed, I thought I screwed it up. They asked questions that I didn't know how to answer, there were things that I didn't remember because I only studied the night before.. I did well in the Java part of the interview, but that was about it. I feel like any first year CS can do the things that I was asked to do.

After just one interview, I got an offer.. It felt too good to be true. I accepted, thinking that I got lucky and vowed to learn more so that I can live up to the position I was given. I attended orientation... and everyone was friendly and the company sounds great... but in the back of my mind I have this feeling that as soon as I start working I'll probably get fired because they're gonna find out I'm not really good at programming, especially for the project I'm going to be working on...

Tomorrow I'm going to finally meet my manager and I'm super super scared... Like I'm frantically trying to study up so that I won't sound like an idiot in front of him... And I'm afraid I won't be able to cover everything before I meet him...

Has anyone here felt like this before? What was your experience at a first job like? Are there any ways to get over this feeling besides just absorbing as much information as possible?"

I'm a senior CS student outside of the US. I'm planning to apply PhDs in the US. I've done a 4 months research internship at UMD, CP (at UMIACS MC2) this summer, and I've liked it there, I like the professor, and the topics we worked on. He personally invited me to do a PhD there with him. (I think I'll be a RA with him.)  But he also said that I have a good shot at first tier schools as well, and I may apply for them. But the problem with that is if I get admitted to another school, I need to do TA and find a good supervisor for the first years of my PhD.

So the question is:

1) School vs supervisor, which one is more important for a PhD in CS? 

2) Where does UMD, CP stand in terms of CS Grad schools? (Reputation, opportunities, quality of education etc.)

3) How does the school affect my future, if I don't consider joining the academia. (I want to work in private sector.)

4) What other schools should I consider, if I want to work on ML/Cyber security?

Thanks for helping, I would appreciate any advice and recommendations.

You have probably seen my posts here, and it's because they are working. We have hired 8 redditors this year and are hoping to spread the word about more opportunities to the community this way.

I work for an awesome recruiting agency called HireNetworks. We have clients ranging from giant, global banking firms to a variety of well-backed startups, mostly in the Triangle. We’re a small team that is made up of dedicated recruiters who work to know their stuff- who won’t contact you for jobs that don’t fit your skills, or ask you to help us ""do cutting-edge Swing work”. We want to help talented people get into companies where they can be recognized, challenged, and compensated at a level they feel is suited to them. PM me if this job might fit that bill for you, and we can get you talking to the hiring manager ASAP. (We hired him last November for the role, so there's a great relationship there.)

This is a Junior .NET role with a local Raleigh start-up. They are looking for someone who has at least 2+ years of commercial .NET experience (people with 1 year, internships only, or freelance only were not advanced enough unfortunately) to take over the maintenance and ownership of an enterprise SaaS app. You will be responsible for bug fixing, enhancements, customer implementation, and have the opportunity to grow into a Senior dev doing new product development over time. Ideally, you are the kind of engineer who can hit the ground running, and figure out how to do it better than its been done. 

It's a direct hire opportunity and candidates MUST be local to NC or already building/renting a home here (unfortunate misfires with a couple nonlocal candidates has made this client gunshy). Salary range is $65,000 - $80,000 with benefits, and great mentorship. OPT candidates will be considered, but not H1B or C2C candidates. If this sounds like you, PM me today and let's chat!

(NOTE: They are also looking for local Senior devs for the new product team. C#.NET, Entity framework, SQL Server, and bonus points for Angular or JavaScript front end experience. $85-110k salary, direct hire, local only)"

so as title says, I'm completely lost and I'm getting desperate.

So, first of all I love IT related to systems; I enjoy reparing PCs, doing some help desk tech support, administrating domain servers, taking care of server racks... can't say the same thing for programming tho, I made some shellscript,coded a nice PHP page for my personal use, selflearned advanced javascript... but It doesn't fulfill me at all.


I'm 20 years old, and I studied an official 2 year course (Grado Superior) of ""Computer Systems Administration in Network"", we call it ""ASIR"" here in **Spain**. I don't know what's the equivalence in american or other european education systems, but basically I learnt a lot of SQL, Windows Server, Linux and I'm somehow prepared for a CCNA R&amp;S exam. I did some internship work (mandatory for completing the course, for free sadly) in a computer consulting company... I enjoyed it a lot despite being exploited 11hours a day w/o payment (they can't pay me by law, but they didn't ""thank me"" too haha).

Now here's the problem. I don't know how to continue. 

I started Computer Engineering this september, but I realized I don't want to do it: it's 60% programming and 20% non related to what I want to do. Also, the big amount of math is making me suffer from anxiety again after a lot of time trying to beat it. I feel no motivation at all and I'm 95% going to abandon it.

So... I don't know what to do now:

- Certifications? There are too many and I'd love to study every one of them, but my money is limited. Like 1000€ and a RHSA exam costs 450€

- The 2 remaining official computer courses are only for web developing (programming) and the other is basically java (android), I know they won't fullfill me.

- Internship working for getting experience? (companies, at least here, love IT) I know some friends who do nothing related to it too, and that scares me.

- Do a 1 year course of something (called master here)? I've found advanced courses for Linux, Windows server, networking...

- English certification, not really a doubt.

So so few options, so many doubts... I know my grammar/vocabulary isn't the best nor my formal english. Sorry.

I hope you can illuminate me a little bit"

I am planning on majoring in CS(engineering school) from UVa, and wanted to know how I could get an internship over the summer. I don't have a GPA yet, but I plan on it being at least a 3.5(calc 3 may say otherwise, but we will see). I am taking an intro to programming class this semester, and some other stuff like chem, calc, and a required class interdisciplinary engineering class.

An undergrad adviser suggested I should try for Fannie Mae and work in their IT division. 

I honestly wouldn't care that much if the IT internship(doesn't necessarily have to be IT, I just thought that field was in high demand)had nothing to do with finance, but it would be a plus considering it is harder for a person in e school to learn more about business, economics, and finance.

Does anyone have thoughts on this?"

One of my clearest memories of my childhood was playing games with the local kids in my neighborhood in Mumbai, India, and always pausing to admire the planes that flew overhead. My interests in aerospace grew further when my father would regularly take me to local air and space museums throughout my childhood. I knew I wanted to spend my life studying aerospace or space-related technology after seeing space shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Space Center. I graduated from ___________ with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in June 2015, and currently work as a New Product Introduction (NPI) Manufacturing Engineer at __________, which manufactures parts for the semiconductor industry. I am excited to pursue a degree in control systems and dynamics so I can achieve a lifelong goal to work in the space industry, specifically autonomous systems in spacecraft.

My interests in engineering began in high school after discovering my strength in mathematics and interests in space. Through my core mechanical engineering classes in college, I became more curious about dynamics, vibrations, and control systems. Although each course presented extremely daunting and difficult coursework, they were also extremely rewarding. I was eager to apply this knowledge when I revitalized the __________ CubeSat project which aimed to design and build a functional satellite. I was the project manager for the majority of my senior year while working with Professor _____________. One of the specific challenges I took on was determining the structure of the CubeSat. The CubeSat’s structure was required to have 2 liters in volume, which poses interesting structural challenges when considering the heavy vibrations associated with take-off of up to 3000 Hz. I conducted a modal analysis of the CubeSat structure in SolidWorks Finite Element Analysis and was able to determine the most ideal locations to place bolts to protect the satellite from its resonant frequencies. This project helped me take a deeper look into vibrations and has since inspired me to pursue a degree in this field.     
During my senior year, I held an engineering internship at ____________, a startup biomedical engineering company. During this internship I learned how to scientifically set up and, conduct experiments, and make data driven decisions.  My main project was to determine the highest performing degassing unit which the company would ultimately rely on to remove dissolved gasses from the working fluids. To do so I designed the experiment while working under a senior mechanical engineer, then I personally designed and fabricated the fixtures, then used the design in an accelerated time study. I collected the data using a dissolved oxygen meter and the system’s dissolved oxygen meter and compared the results between different units to determine the best performing units as well as the best configuration of units. This experience has greatly helped me become a better engineer and I hope to apply this skillset in graduate level research in control systems.  

As a NPI Manufacturing Engineer at _______________, I have taken on monumental responsibilities and learned many new skills not attainable at the university level. I have successfully led the company’s first conversion of a part from new process introduction to mass production in the last five years, and lead another project which is responsible for 10% of the company’s revenue. My main responsibility is to design the manufacturing process to machine parts from raw material to match the customer’s design. This task requires expertise in multiple fields of manufacturing including solid modeling, Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), machining, inspection methods, cleaning processes, packaging solutions, customer relations, and teamwork. In this position I am regularly required to diagnose manufacturing failures at any stage of the process, determine the root cause of these failures, and develop temporary and permanent corrective actions through a structured problem solving analysis. Although not directly related to my interests in aerospace and space, I have gained a strong sense of design for manufacturability through this work, and this skill will be critical when designing any device or instruments when developing research and professional work as a controls engineer.

I want to study the control of autonomous systems at the University Of Boulder, Colorado because it is a leader in the field of space craft controls, with groundbreaking research conducted in Colorado Center for Astrodynamics. Furthermore, Boulder also offers one of the only programs directly in my field of interest: Astrodynamics &amp; Satellite Navigation Systems.  The idea of reaching further into space demands for better technology in this field. One of many hurdles is time delays between communication systems. For example, there is a twenty six minute delay when communicating to spacecrafts on Mars. This calls for the technology to rely on real time autonomous systems which can operate in extreme situations and provide accurate and optimized solutions. I am interested in working with _________ to further efforts of low energy autonomous orbit transfers. I am also interested in working with ________________ to further innovate the field of real time satellite orbit and attitude determination. Additionally, I am interested in developing my own research and becoming a subject-matter expert so I can apply this knowledge and hopefully lead the effort to developing complex autonomous systems for the future of navigation systems and the space industry as a whole.

Pursuing a graduate degree in this field has been a lifelong dream, which I am ready to make a reality. Though working as a practicing manufacturing engineer has been enlightening and invaluable, I am excited to begin my graduate studies and work towards achieving my dream of becoming a Guidance Navigation and Control Systems Engineer in the space industry.

I am seriously expecting that my current resume looks to be something that is good and can land me interviews at top companies... however, that doesn't look to be the case.

The reason I am aiming at top companies is that I consider my previous internship to be a top one, and I fear if I were to take one that is well obviously lower, it would be considered as regression of sorts in my career which will be set backs.

My current approach is really apply to companies through online only (I am currently in an unique situation where I do not have access to my school's job board). I do have leveraged referrals to some companies.

The reasons on why as to I believe I should at least get interviews from top companies are:

* I have a 3.51 gpa
* I go to a what I presume at least a tier 2 target school (Waterloo)
* My previous internship is at what I considered to be a top location (Nvidia)
* My previous internship has involved me in top quality work (Application architecture and design)
* I have personal projects that does show some type of brilliance or achievements

Reflecting back on it though, there are might possibly be reasons as to why I am not getting such interviews even

* Maybe my resume isn't as good as I think (achievement wise and/or design wise)
* Companies maybe want US citizens (I require work authorization)
* I actually do not fit the roles?
* Maybe I am using the wrong channels... applying online has way too high rejection or ignore rates

By also analyzing some of the rejection letters I did get, a few do say they explicitly want 2018 graduates. Many says there is not a good fit or openings that match my skill set (assumed to be standard rejection).

My resume is available to be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/GOb0U).

Are there maybe any suggestions or insights? I am truly at my wits end because I feel like I have played my trump card but I guess it's not as powerful."

While she was speaking to our club, she told us that it's possible for ALL of us to get in. And the fact we were all unrepresented - all girls, basically - that we all deserve a spot at Google. It seemed a bit odd, mostly because I know a lot of people who get rejected from this internship. 

I personally told the recruiter afterwards that I've been studying for interviews since mid July. I also told her that my first CS class was taken at a community college during the summer. She told me it was fine, that I just need to send in my transcripts. However last quarter someone was stalking me and I have a whole set of withdraws on my transcript which also concerned me. I know I really should have no excuses for that, but I do have official documentation from a Title IX office. I know GPA doesn't really matter but I'm a bit worried. I'm guessing Microsoft will be expecting the same.

I've been more or less doing it informally in my company as I am the liason for Business to IT and do IT support and strategy myself. I started off as an IT intern because I had some experience and after my supervisor left, I just kinda took over. Now I'm the sole IT person here. I've been doing business revenue gain based projects from start to finish here and am comfortable, but like I said, it's pretty informal from an actual BA point. For instance, I don't use any sort of analysis program besides a database I designed in Access to keep track of technology and am now working on moving it to a cloud based issue tracking system that we can extend to our actual business clients for increased value to them and an advantage in the market.  

I guess my question/concern is that I may be pigeonholing myself into a very specific type of position. I'm afraid if I don't move while I'm still just starting my career then I'll either not be employable elsewhere or continue doing this and never really meet any potential as I'm already as high position wise as I can get in this company. I've looked at BA positions in a few companies, they all require familiarity with business intelligence software and work with SQL and other related softwares. I've taken SQL/database classes and understand relational algebra to some degree but I haven't had any hands on work with either BI or SQL systems directly. I've led several projects that I designed and implemented but didn't use any project management software besides basically setting up my own environment specific to that project. I based a few of the projects on a cut down AGILE model but I'm not sure how to present that as a possible portfolio besides just describing the project. And to be honest, I mostly just designed it to be iterative so I didn't have to deal with all the parts at the same time. I also have very little experience or desire to deal with programming hands on. I can somewhat understand it if someone puts it in front of me, but I don't code. Is there any advice on how to mitigate some of these issues? Or how to get familiarity with some BI and or SQL systems? Keep in mind I'm low on income and time for extra schooling. "

For the past year I've been networking well and taking any bootcamp classes I could to get back into the software and programming world in preparation for finding a job this Fall. I've had multiple contacts in this field comment that I shouldn't have much issue finding a job due to my abilities and degree, even so far as to refer me to their companies, but I've yet to get a positive response.  I have applied to countless companies with only one response - being a no.

A little background to help: I started in Computer Engineering and programming in C, I programmed microprocessors but ultimately decided to switch to Computer Information Systems.  In that major I programmed mostly in Java with some experience with the LAMP stack and command-line Linux, learned algorithms, design patterns, and all that good stuff. I haven't worked in those languages recently, but feel I could pick them back up fairly quickly.  Since graduation I've worked in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript &amp; jQuery, and have just cracked open the door to Python. I have Java and HTML/CSS/JS listed on my resume and always include a cover letter showing I've researched the company, how I believe I can contribute value, and offer some guidance translating my banking skills and previous programming (albeit not professionally) to the company I'm applying. I'm mostly interested in software development or cyber security, but at this point I really just want to get my foot in the door to switch careers - even its a Jr. position or paid internship. I try to program every day, use github, have a portfolio website in Bootstrap but it's lacking any major projects yet which I know can really set me back, and use websites like freecodeacademy.com and cybrary.it to supplement what I know and expand my knowledge.

TLDR: Former banker trying to get into Software Development with his Computer Info Sys degree. Used to program in Java &amp; C, currently programming front-end and considering Python. Interested in Software Development or Cyber Security.

Could y'all give insight into anything I might be missing or languages I should abandon in support of others? Am I not portraying my skills well enough or think I don't have enough practice under my belt?  Any input helps.  Thanks everyone!"

I'm coming from a mechanical/aerospace background, so I was hoping current students or other applicants could give me an idea of whether I'll have a reasonable chance of admittance.

**Background:**

Education: 

* 2015 graduate, B.S. Mechanical Engineering (concentration in aerospace) at a mid-tier engineering program (top 50-100). GPA 3.07, strong upward trend last 4 semesters. Took standard Mech E classes in intro programming (C/C++), and plenty of Matlab programming throughout my degree.
* Hopefully mitigating my GPA somewhat, I was on an athletic scholarship and was in season for sports year round. Also involved with engineering extracurriculars.
* Took a 2 year college level CS course in high school and scored well on exam (International Baccalaureate CS, higher-level, scored 6/7 -- approx equivalent to 5/5 on AP CS plus additional topics). It included a pretty substantial project developing and documenting a Java application.

Work:

* I work for a well-regarded federal gov consulting firm that has great name recognition.
* My project for the past 1.5 years since college has been a role as a systems engineer on a DoD engineering software product. I work on data analysis, migration, software implementation, and systems engineering for the core software (requirements management, case tracking).
* As part of my job I develop analytic scripts with Java/Python for bulk data processing and manage a Git repo for myself and a couple teammates.
* Certified Agile Scrum Master (kind of a bs certification, I know)
* I'm the primary system admin for the developmental version of my clients' software and work backend on data loading.
* Working on a secondary project developing a data warehousing solution proposal for a DoD logistics office responsible for $10B in annual budget.
* Intern experience in college as a Python back-end developer for a small startup.
* FWIW, work will pay everything if I'm admitted.

I realize the work experience doesn't replace the educational experience, but wondering if it's enough to supplement the Mechanical Engineering background. I wouldn't venture as far as saying I am equivalent to a BS CS, but I'm definitely several steps above the level of CS taught in other engineering disciplines.

I appreciate any and all feedback!"

That means only two summers are ""available"" for me to do internships, and for summer 2017, I'm only going to have the 2 intro CS courses under my belt and no previous experience in this field, so I doubt I'll really be competitive for many internships. I'm also planning to take classes this summer. However, I'm worried that I'm going to be at a huge disadvantage compared to other students, considering that I'll only be able to do one internship--and since I'm only doing one, I can't imagine it'll be at a top company without any other experience. On top of that, some internships aren't even open to me because I'm not a full-time student. What can I do to make sure I have the best chance in the job market after graduation?

Some alternatives I've considered are:

1. Picking up a second major (probably math) so that I can be a full-time student; however, taking 5 CS/math classes at once would likely mean not being able to work during school and, therefore, a lot more in loans.

2. Stretching out my program an extra semester to get a third summer/second internship in there--maybe taking a couple electives/adding another minor/taking lighter course loads in a couple other semesters. Not ideal, as I'm already going to be 27 when I graduate and I fear the older I get, the more of a disadvantage I'll have in the entry-level job market. Also, more loans.

3. Trying for a co-op (after a couple more semesters). Financially, if I could get one, this is probably the best option for me. The disadvantage to this is that I'll end up being even older when I graduate...

4. Trying to intern during the semester. Not sure how this would work or what the availability would be.

5. Just doing a lot of personal side projects. I'm not sure yet how to even go about this with my very limited knowledge, but I definitely plan on doing some of my own stuff at some point; probably need to learn a bit more first, though--I don't feel like I even really have any ideas at this point."

Does anyone have any insight on how these compare with just getting a regular Coop job in terms of building valuable skills?

Microsoft's internship for example says that you will be working on a new project with a group of interns. This does not sound like a real world Coop experience to me. Will having the name on the resume be worth forgoing potentially more intensive dev worth from a Coop experience? 

Also how do the actual Coop positions that these companies post compare to respective intern positions?

I got a few questions - I'll be entering an internship soon, arranged by my university. I've got my eye on a few, but this one stands out.

There's an internship that is focused on IT through cloud computing and virtualization. Now, from my limited understanding, it should deal with distributed systems, computer networks and such, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

 What I'd like to know, is how would those areas be applied to IT?

558ayl,144,2016-09-30,Meatwagon,IamHowardMoxley,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/558ayl/meatwagon/,"The last job applicant looked like he pushed open his coffin and walked in fresh from the grave. 

&amp;nbsp;
His gray shirt was as filthy and wrinkled as his disheveled black slacks. His greasy hair hung in a tangled mess around eyes dark and sunken, set deep in a pudgy and sallow face that looked genuinely sick. That was strike one. 

&amp;nbsp;
To say his resume was skimpy was an understatement. RANDAL GANES took up a quarter of the page, his contact information made up the bulk of the ink. He had listed:

&amp;nbsp;
1.  high school graduation date 11 years ago

&amp;nbsp;

2. mortician's assistant, 3 months, 10 years ago

&amp;nbsp;

3. 1 year experience driving an ice cream truck 2 years ago.

&amp;nbsp;
That was dismal for more than a decade worth of work. Normally, that's strike two and I would move on to other applicants, but there was something about this man, even if it was only wanting to know what the hell he did with his life, and  he *did* have the licenses I needed. I personally saw him ace the road test.  I asked him what happened after high school. He cleared his throat and began to murmur before collecting enough of his courage to say:

&amp;nbsp;
“I want to tell you this right away: I am not going to lie. I don't lie anymore. I will tell you exactly what happened. Some of this may offend you... shock you. You may ask me to leave at any time, I will understand. Otherwise...I will tell you what I did with my life as vividly as I can.” 

&amp;nbsp;

So he did. 

&amp;nbsp;

Randal Ganes was a substandard student. His job options in the small town were the army, working at the gas station or living with his older sisters
Contessa, Mallory and Claire Ganes. All of their room and board was cared for by dear great aunty Viatrix Ganes, leader of the nameless self-proclaimed coven. Viatrix was already deeply obsessed with a native American legend by the time Randal joined to help resurrect a god no longer known by the people, of X'hawana Ihlaxwsa: *Zwana* *Hal*-*wah*, “she who shall be feared”. Viatrix deeply believed that giving this elemental force a human body to loan would grant the Ganes family favor with the goddess, especially if Ganes family blood was used in the ceremonies. Randal never specified what these ceremonies entailed despite my questioning. 

&amp;nbsp;

The Ganes coven found that locating a proper body for Zwana was very hard for them- according to the incomplete resources Viatrix had at her disposal, the sacrifices needed to have died in a very specific way- young, healthy, beautiful and yet dead ONLY due to natural causes. Nothing violent or unnatural would take hold Zwana during the binding ceremonies, so obtaining bodies by murder -even drowning or asphyxiation- would ruin the bodies. Bodies taken by burning or poisoning wouldn't work either. Graveyard corpses were too decomposed, and too risky. So were most hospitals. 

&amp;nbsp;
The four woman and man coven came to terms with the fact that they would never get anywhere stealing 1 body every 3 weeks; to be successful, they needed *volume*.

&amp;nbsp;
Viatrix unveils her new plan a few months after Randal joins them. She had overheard a very strange conversation concerning the nearest mortuary, how they always had “beauty pageant winners” among them.

&amp;nbsp;
“I had no choice. They had already pulled the strings. They were all working at legitimate angle for a while with the intention of establishing a supply line of bodies directly to Viatrix's house. The countywide mortuary was a one man show anyway, and the Coroner, Eustace Dust, needed unpaid help. Out of the 13 that applied, 3 of which were med students, my sisters got a 19 year old kid inside that facility somehow. I'm not going to ask how. Ever.”  

&amp;nbsp;
Randal described Eustace as a hunched ratty man who always spoke in a bawdy, twangy accent, hanging between French-Southern and cocky English. Eustace's long hair had curled into gray tubes that snaked alongside his bald dome, “perfect for an outdated face that was hard and thick...like if newer, fresher flesh had been slapped over the real face.” Randal described the head mortician's two long single horseshoe shaped teeth, as sharp as guillotines jutting out of constantly inflamed gums. Randal turned even sicker when he described Dust's wormy gray tongue that constantly probed his tender gums and licked his thin hard lips. Randal never knew if he was born that way, or somehow, he was *made* that was. 

&amp;nbsp;
Randal apparently never had a chance to say more than two words to his boss Eustace- the head mortician gushed words like he would never speak again. They would discuss things such as the fall of modern and ancient empires, world diets, politics, music, humor, religions and remodeling. Randal said the man was “disturbingly intelligent”, and that the coroner grew to trust Randal quickly after Randal demonstrated that he was a capable assistant. 

&amp;nbsp;

The oddest of Mr. Dust's quirks became apparent after the 1st month, when Eustace began carting the attractive women off behind a steel door before their autopsy had been preformed. The women who went into what Dust called “the meatlocker” had two things in common; they had no obvious wounds, and they were with families wishing for cremation. We swapped other bodies in the cardboard burn box for the witnessing ceremony. When Randal asked him why Mr. Dust kept these women, the coroner supposedly said the following with a smile: 

&amp;nbsp;

“I like you. You're *good* *people*. It's hard to meet good people, but you find them everywhere, you know? You know where I find a lot of “good people”? At the poshest parties, I swear. *Rich* *people*...ones that would hate to see all these pretty ladies go into the ground without one last final...hurrah. I personally do not partake in such acts, but hold no qualms with those who do...so I take them back to the meatlocker and show them my...well, what could be beauty pageant winners...you seen ALL of them, you can judge fairly, yes? And those people, mostly rich, white, single, young men, present me with a *problem*. They want to visit my pageant winners again...but they don't want to be seen frequenting a mortuary, even if they ARE well disguised. I had to become mobile...so I purchased an unused van from one of my most trusted frequent First Responders...it keeps the bodies cool and the *conditioner* flowing through their veins...” I asked Eustace what van he was talking about. He playfully replied “Oh, my meatwagon?”

&amp;nbsp;

It was a large plain white Sprinter van that was parked in a different secured location every night, except for when the bodies needed to be changed out. A collapsible ladder folds out, allowing the client to step with class up to four bodies of what had once been very beautiful women, each a different race, fully nude and strapped to their gurneys with silk restraints woven through the stainless steel. They wore makeup. One still wore sunglasses over unnaturally white eyeballs. Each had infected red ports near the base of their neck pumping several cocktails of chemicals in at once. Eustace made Randal to touch one of their bodies- warm. Eustace said: “not living- their brains are disposed of with honor. Not metabolism-The heat is exothermic preservation solution that keeps the living cells tender and free from decay as it kills all bacteria while keeping the body at 96 degrees for up to a month, or until we find a new pageant winner. I call it “conditioner”, and I'm always improving on it.”  

&amp;nbsp;
Eustace finally made his move and asked Randal how keen he was on the idea of “operating” the meatwagon- the venture was making more money than ever, and Dust didn't trust anyone else to take over the sole operation. Dust assured the young man that he would *just* be driving, he wouldn't even need to interact with the bodies, except through the security monitor to ensure that no goods were stolen or damaged in the back. Randal agreed instantly; he would have done it for free. Randal saw his chance to create a flow to the coven. Even when Randal retold it, I could see that bringing his family bodies seemed to be the most important thing in his life. I wonder if he had full control of his faculties, or if his drive was part of the coven's influence. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Dust paid me under the table after my 6 month internship in the mortuary was up. From then, I really don't know...exactly how long I drove the meatwagon. Years. I got my class A when Dust needed massive amounts of chemicals privately delivered from Mexico. Business was booming as Dust took over bodies from neighboring mortuaries and morgues...he would have a new girl every three days for the dozen -and growing- clients. They would tell me to drive to farmhouses. Abandoned lots. Cemeteries, of all places. I would try to ignore the *squeak* *squeak* and the security screen showing me four dead women an a molester. I had to to do my job well, and that meant always keeping my guard up...if Dust ever found out that every one of his “pageant winners” was given to Viatrix and the sisters to preform the ritual on, he would do worse than fire me.” I asked Randal why he kept working with his aunt and sisters when he now had steady check. He went on as if he didn't hear me. 

&amp;nbsp;

“None of the hundreds of naturally-dead pretty corpses took to Zwana...or maybe visa versa. None of the customers seemed to notice the tiny incisions left over from the ceremonies on the bodies. Neither did Dust. Still. We were failing; Viatrix knew she was missing vital information. I felt like *I* was failing. So I started getting drunk at bars between destinations. The...last time, I got so drunk that the only thing I remember about the ride home was that there was a full moon. I must have passed out on the bench seat; it would look like no one was in the van at first glance...I guess Dust didn't see me, cause a wet slapping sound woke me up around 1 in the morning. The image of Eustace was burning in the monitor, thrusting a bright white bare bottom into a pair of limp legs of another failed Zwana experiment, a girl who was a true medical anomaly, dead in her bed without any sign of trauma or illness. Dust was changing her out- I wasn't usually here for this process. I never believed him for a second when he said he “didn't partake”; I never needed to see the proof of it either.” 

&amp;nbsp;
“Dust was usual reserved, musing...but this man operated with the strength of goddamn madman, busting open the back doors to carry out the dead body he just fucked. He walked through a moonbeam with his pants and underwear around his ankles as he dragged the gurney out. When the body passed through the beam of white light, I saw the woman's feet spring up as if she was shocked with a bolt of electricity and leap out of view. Then I heard Dust yelp and then shriek, absolutely *shriek* with no regards to Ego...oh but Eustace, you chose this place because the mortuary was so remote, nobody could hear or help you...or us.”

&amp;nbsp;

“I heard groaning scratches on the side of the van, so deep that it sounded like giant's knife was carving into the metal...I couldn't see, couldn't move to see, couldn't do anything but hold but cry as I held my breath to listen to Dust's cries of agony slowly shrivel to moans. Then I heard the bar-door open and nothing else. I spent at least half and hour making sure it's safe before getting out- I can't see shit, it's pitch dark everywhere outside the moonbeam that brought Zwana to life. I used my cell's flash as a light and saw 5 symbols had been carved on the side of the van. I took a picture of them just as I heard Eustace somewhere in the dark. My light revealed Dust holding both hands between his crotch as he gave the last few weak kicks of life. There is a fleshy bloody lump next to his head laying in the same fatally large pond of blood that Eustace was in. I didn't know what to do, so I ran. I heard the police eventually came and impounded most of the operation. The police never contacted me.”

&amp;nbsp;

“None of my family believed what happened; Viatrix refused to believe the moon was the key until I showed them the symbols carved on the side of the van. They all recoiled and threw my phone back at me- they symbols said, in our crude language, “all in this cursed vessel shall remained cursed”. My family disowned me, claiming it was my fault that I didn't SPEAK with the Goddess, that the ceremony made it bound by Ganes blood, that Zwana saw the fear in my heart and was disgusted and decided to roam the Earth instead, judging me on behalf of all Ganes...all of this was conveyed into the symbols, I guess. So. I have no money. Nowhere to go. My only employer for my whole working life is dead. I have no legitimate work history and no real assets other than my ability to drive. But I heard that Howard Moxley is a charitable man. Hiring me would be saving a life, I- I'm cursed, and sleeping behind a CVS tonight. And *SHE'S* out there.” I looked out the window. A storm was arriving. 

&amp;nbsp;
“I will hire you,” I began, “if you can you get me access to your Aunt's house. I would very much like to see what her necrotorium looks like.” His eyes flashed nervously, then in guilt, he said yes. 

&amp;nbsp;

I hired him on the spot. "

I'm not looking towards a Big 4 or anything like that , but I will be applying to financial institutions that conduct Data Structures + Algorithm interviews.

I took Data Structures and Algorithms at my local community college over the summer due to the lower cost / more convenient location, but the course didn't cover much. It only went through basic sorting algorithms, linked lists and stacks + queues. (No Big O, Trees and anything else not listed) The credits transferred to my main four year institution but I've been reliant on self-studying on my own.

I've been going through a Data Structure / Algorithm textbook on my own, but want to make sure I've studied everything I need to know. I've been given conflicting information on what exactly I should be reading through.

Here are roughly the chapters of what I've went over thoroughly from the textbook:

- Review Chapters (Strings, Arrays, OOP)
- Algorithm Analysis (Big O)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks, Queues
- Trees (book mainly focused on BST's)
- Hash Tables
- Searching/Sorting

I'm comfortable with these topics and have completed some of the related chapters in CTCI. However, I skipped several chapters that are covered by my university's Data Structures class. These topics include many data structures such as tries, graphs, skip lists and heaps. I'll get around to studying them once the semester is over, but as of now my time is limited due to school.

Is the list I have enough to be going into an interview? As I said, I've read conflicting information on how important some of these other topics are for internship interviews. "

559ggu,17,2016-09-30,"I FINALLY GOT A JOB OFFER, but I have a question or two",roharia,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/559ggu/i_finally_got_a_job_offer_but_i_have_a_question/,"Hello, I've posted a few times here within the last 2-3 months. I am a recent graduate with a bachelors in CS and I graduated about 4 months ago now.

I've been struggling to find a job. I ultimately wanted to find a job out of state because I live in a rural area (this is sort of key to my question). After a couple months of not being able to get anything, I started applying more locally, still with little to no success. Yesterday a company finally contacted me (locally) asked me a few questions about salary and that sort of stuff. They asked me into an interview today and I went at 10am.

Now, around 2pm they actually emailed me just now and gave me a job offer for a programmer/data analyst position WHICH I'M SUPER STOKED ABOUT! The pay is a bit less than I was looking for though. I was looking for around $40,000 a year which I don't think is TOO unreasonable for entry-level in this field. Is it? Anyway, they offered me the hourly equivalent of about $16 an hour which is only $1 more an hour than I made at my internship while still in college.

I plan to take the offer (will probably accept it right after writing this) even though it doesn't really meet my salary requirements. I obviously can't afford to be too picky though right now since I have no other offers.

There is a company in NC that was looking at me, and they did say it would pay minimum $50k a year to start. I have been through many phone interviews with them and they have shown genuine interest. I even had a 3 HOUR webcam interview with them which was crazy. The interviewer (from internal) said he thinks I have a pretty good chance at getting it and to keep contact with the recruiter for an update. It's been about 3-4 weeks now since the interview and the recruiter keeps asking me to wait a bit longer but won't specify a time frame.

Like I said earlier, I really wanted to move out of my current state (KY). My question is, say I take the job with this company local to me, and then 2 weeks later the NC company actually gives me an offer. What would you do in my position? Would you up and leave the job that gave you a real chance with low pay in favor of the out of state job with better pay? Or would you stick it out with the local company and ""rough it"" for probably about 6 months (at least) and then try to apply for even better jobs?


I don't think I have room to ask for more pay (from the local company) considering I'm entry level with very little internship experience. What do you think? I really don't want to push them and have them revoke the offer. Personally, I think 18 an hour would be better for me. I would be a lot more comfortable taking that, although I would probably settle for 16 right now given my options.


**Update:** I accepted the job offer, they said they will officially sign me on pending my background check (which should be squeaky clean)! They said it will take a few days for the results. At the same time I emailed the NC company recruiter and let them know if they're going to make a decision they need to make it ASAP. So this buys them (NC company) a few days at least.


**Update 2:** For all of the people that are currently unemployed and looking for jobs, don't give up! Yes, this was not my IDEAL job in terms of pay and location, but it is work nonetheless! I probably submitted a million applications over the last 4 months and I was starting to feel depressed about it to tell you the truth. Seriously do not give up hope."

55a2df,5,2016-09-30,Molding into the complete data scientist ( or atleast thats what im aiming for),Antreas93,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/55a2df/molding_into_the_complete_data_scientist_or/,"So, i am currently in my last year of my Bs in Business Administration with a specialization in Management Science and a minor in Accounting. I should also add that i am from Cyprus(and my primary intention is to stay here)  and study in the University of Cyprus. In my degree i have stats courses, quantitative methods for businesses(which  most of it is basically linear programming in SPSS), some information technology courses like python for business purposes and e-commerce and now i have applied programming models(using excel and General Algebraic Models(GAMs) ).
 
The past 2 years i learned about data science and started liking the idea of it so i started the famous JHU data science specialization through coursera. I only studied during the summers and christmas so i just finished everything except the capstone. I also did some courses about Internet of Things and a more theoretical course about data science, to better grasp the key concepts, through FutureLearn (IoT and Data to Insight). I also did a basic course for SQL through Udemy. I think thats most of it.

This summer i had a one month internship in a big4 company in the data analytics department. The problem is, because of the duration and the fact that they used other programming language than R and Python, i couldnt contribute much. I was, of course, assisting and working with the team on the logical aspects of the coding and i learned many things. I would like to have a more hands on approach but one month wasnt enough. 

Anyway, i felt that i could do that job and enjoy it(most of the time) but its not easy to find many jobs that are willing to train you in Cyprus. So, i was thinking that i should do a Ms in Computer Science to get the programming background needed for that job, but i would need to get a full-time job and do the Ms part-time. I liked the Distance Learning master that Georgia Tech offers for CS and might look more into it.

According to these, and the fact that i do not want to work in a totally unrelated sector, i looked into some jobs regarding actuaries. I researched it a little bit and thought of starting as a Junior Actuarial Analyst while studying the Ms of CS. I even thought of completing the Certified Actuarial Analyst qualification. 

The way i see it an Actuarial Analyst is a data analyst more focused on insurance, health and investment sector. If i can accomplish both the part-time Ms and the CAA( it consists of 6 modules and i can study and pass the first one before i finish my Bs) together along with a job , in 3-4 years i could become a CAA and hold a Ms of CS.

I know its going to be hard but i think it would mold me into the ideal data scientist. Background in business from my Bs, computer science from my Ms and advanced analytical and statistical skills from CAA and the work experience as an actuarial analyst would be great.

I know i wrote a lot(also late night writing) but there arent many people to talk here and having read many threads here, you seem like you could help me out.
A big thank you to anyone who makes it out alive from this post and any insights appreciated.

tl;dr no summary feasible"
55a8b3,1,2016-09-30,Internship Return Offer Advice,Mandias09,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/55a8b3/internship_return_offer_advice/,"I am a freshman, and this upcoming spring semester I will be working with a company that has an office next to my campus. I have accepted the spring internship (and am excited for it!), but they just offered me an extension to also work for them during the summer as well. I told them I want to wait for a little bit, and they said there's no rush and the offer will always be on the table.

The company is a financial/bank company, but is trying to become much more of a tech company, and the office seems very tech-company esque, and the pay (for the area) is pretty good. 

My one gripe is that this area is not somewhere I'd want to live over the summer -- there's nothing here.

My question is: should I accept the return offer for the summer? Or is it a good idea to try to work somewhere else during the summer (to experience a larger variety of companies)?

If I were to try to get an internship at a different company for the summer, what is the best way to leverage my current and return offer to get an interview / offer? 

(Since I'm a freshman, so far, the hardest part has been getting the interviews). And I don't know if it impacts anything, but I go to what is considered a top school.

Thanks in advance for the advice!"

I don't know what to do at basically any step. I don't know how to edit open source projects. I don't know git or anything like that. Are there any resources to learn any of these things? Step-by-steps? Walkthroughs?"

I recently received an developer internship offer at Bank of America in NYC (thanks to the amazing resources in this subreddit!) as part of the Global Technology Summer Analyst program. Has anyone else had experience with Bank of America SE/dev internships or this specific program?
In particular I'd love to learn about the culture in the tech division of the company (workplace dynamics, office environment, dress code, hours, etc.), projects interns work on, the experience there compared to tech companies (or what the experience is like doing dev work in big financial institutions), cheap housing nearby, the intern community (and any events), etc. My fears are working on menial/insignificant projects and the reputation of outdated tools in banks. Any insights would be appreciated.
Thanks!"

Before coming to my uni, I had not known how to code and just recently learned from the classes different ideas such as linked lists/stacks/classes/pointers etc. and am now in my (standard) C/Assembly class, which I assume I would not be using for any potential internships or data work.

I used Python over the summer to create an analytics software, and also use it for general purpose coding. What does it mean to be proficient in a coding language enough to be able to do tech interviews in it, or what does ""language proficiency"" mean in general? I know python enough to use a SQL-connected library like pymysql/MySqlDB and also create classes and so forth, but dont know the full extent of what I should know if I were to use it as a language."
55apk1,4,2016-09-30,I'm trying to become a graphics software engineer. Help?,screenlit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/55apk1/im_trying_to_become_a_graphics_software_engineer/,"Hi, I've been looking for a second job for ~4 months now with limited success. My dream is to be a graphics software engineer, and most of the positions I have applied to have been that title or related. Unfortunately, my lack of experience in that specific field seems to be holding me back. Since I don't know anyone who specifically does this sort of work and online resources are limited, I was wondering if:

1. Anyone knew of any companies hiring for associate/entry level graphics SWE positions in the Bay Area.
2. Anyone is/knows a graphics SWE who can give me advice on how to break into the field.

My background: I graduated with a bachelors in CS from a top tier CS university in May 2015. My grades were mediocre and probably would not be enough for me to go into grad school. I've taken courses on linear algebra and computer graphics, as well as operating systems and computer architecture. I have graphics side projects and am pretty solid in C++. I currently work at a mid-sized mobile game company writing tools to process and manipulate graphics assets, making shaders, writing camera code, and other graphics related tasks -- but my title is Technical Artist, which for much of the games industry means ""some scripting, mostly art"" but at my company means ""mostly engineering, little bit of art"". I also had an internship as a developer at a mobile game startup."

I find myself in an awkward situation right now. Last summer I had an internship with a tech company and I enjoyed very much what I did and learned. Now I have to choose whether next summer I should stay with the same company for another 3 months and develop new technical skills or go abroad and do pretty much the same thing that I did last summer for another company. 

The international experience would be very useful but job-wise, staying and learning new skills could be better. Given that I'll soon graduate and next summer is pretty much the last time I can do an internship, I don't know which one to choose. Some advice would be appreciated.
