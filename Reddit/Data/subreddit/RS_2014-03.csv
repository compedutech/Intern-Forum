1z87zr,1,2014-02-28,"Top tech company vs your typical business (as it relates to IT), couple of questions?",berlinbrown,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1z87zr/top_tech_company_vs_your_typical_business_as_it/,"I work in IT (about 15 years now).  So most of my question is geared towards the IT arena.  I have worked mostly in the South and only brief experience with SF/Silicon Valley.  And of course, we all pine for working at Google.  And I try my best to follow the industry everywhere as much as I can.

Also, my post is a followup to this post about interns:

http://www.glassdoor.com/blog/25-highest-paying-companies-interns-2014-interns-earn-7000-month/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=hipaidinterns-14&amp;utm_content=hipaidinterns-14

As far as I can tell, most typical IT firms and big business operate like a ""big business"".  What does that mean?  You hire based on experience, typically a lot of experience.  Sometimes you hire based on word of mouth for a potential candidate.  You use technical recruiters.     Your upward mobility is based on how long you have been at a particular company, not necessarily your skill level.  You don't use interns.  You don't hire young.  Innovation is always passed over in favor a product the big company pushes on you.

I guess, my post is about, a lot of these companies you hear about in the news like Google, Microsoft, they seem to innovate and come up with new ideas and new techniques but most OTHER companies, just operate on a standard kind of business model.  Hire people, they do their work.  If they don't, fire them, start all over again.  With Google, search out top universities, hire young, use new ideas, try new things.  

And here is the question.  Why can't those big companies operate like Google?  Why don't the other companies take risks?

**Typical big company observations:**

* Doesn't hire young
* Doesn't use interns
* Pay raises, upward mobility is based time spent at company, not any type good work
* No new innovation on most anything
* Standard top down hierarchy structure.  Usually the top guy is the oldest
* Likes to spend a lot of money on software, hates open source
* Employees work there for years and years, or decades
* Universities?  Huh?  Why look there
* Uses technical recruiters
* Likes contractors
* Likes outsourcing on the cheap
* Less flat structure

**Top software company observations (Like Google, MS):**

* Hires interns  
* Hires young   
* Hires recent graduates  
* Encourages learning and education   
* Pays well   
* Incentives based on good work   
* Innovates, tries new things across all areas  

...  

I know everyone likes Google.    But some of the things they do, isn't completely new.  For example, I have worked at large companies but they don't even consider recent grads or interns.  Why not?    It seems like a great idea to bring in new talent.  In fact, I work at companies where the youngest guys are in their 40s. 

As it relates to this subreddit.  How do we find the truly innovative companies that aren't necessarily Google?  Do they exist?  Why don't they exist?

And to be honest, I read about all the stuff that companies like Google do.  They have Google Video sessions and allow employees 20% time to work on their project.  I can't imagine the typical business in doing that.  But why not?  Or a technology oriented commented.   Google contributes to open source.  Why can't big business do that?

One thing that big business does do, they are trying to use social media, like facebook and twitter.  A lot of big companies are moving in that space, in their own way."
1z8xom,3,2014-03-01,Should I wait for an opening at my dream company or take another opportunity that may be coming up?,tealandlace,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1z8xom/should_i_wait_for_an_opening_at_my_dream_company/,"Okay, so basically, I'm a recent grad (grad date in Jan '14) and I've been searching around for a full-time position in my field. I've been sending out applications for full-time paid internships, temp work (in my industry), and full-time positions. I've had pretty decent success with calls back so far, most likely due to how extensively I interned during undergrad (about 3 years straight, at all sorts of different companies).    
  
Okay, so onto my question -- should I wait for an opening at my dream company or take another opportunity that may be coming up?    
  
I previously interned at my dream company and loved it. It is everything I want in a career. I am still in contact with my old supervisor (who has since been promoted) and keep in touch with a handful of other people there as well. I recently had my old supervisor forward my resume onto HR for an open position and the interview went really well. However, the HR person told me that this particular position may not be as good a fit for me due to a couple factors, but that he would forward me onto the department hiring and see if they would be interested in meeting with me. He also said that he knows a couple of openings in other departments should be coming up over the next few months that he believes would be better suited to me, my interests, my personality, and my experience. He is interested in making sure I have the *right* position, and that I just don't take something else that may not be as good a fit just because it's open.    
  
Okay, so the other opportunity -- I've been applying to a few other companies, but there is one in particular that I am interviewing for and believe I have a fairly good chance at. I have a resume with *exactly* the kind of background they are looking for and the HR person and I connected over a mutual company we both interned/worked at, so I definitely think she's pulling for me. I passed through the initial interview and have another set for a few days from now. Okay, the downsides -- it's a full time paid internship ... so not a permanent role. It's also not exactly in the industry I want to work in (and they are not a big name ... which matters for the future), but I would have the opportunity to work with a really great client that I am interested in. Okay, so the pros -- it's paying REALLY well for my industry, the pay is pretty much equivalent to what my dream job pays it's entry level roles. Also, they said that it is a 3 month commitment, with the option to extend to six and after six months, you are evaluated for full-time employment ... which the last 4 interns have all gotten jobs after internship completion. At this point, I am not too interested in working there full-time. Yes, I know I haven't had the second interview come up yet, but this company intends to move quickly and I could imagine them picking a candidate sometime early next week.  
  
My question is, IF the internship offers me a role, should I take it or wait for another opening at the company I actually REALLY want to work for? Of course, that's not guaranteed either, but I feel like I have a good chance with being a prior intern, a recommendation from my previous supervisor, knowing some other employees who work there, having a good rapport with HR, and all my past experience. I just don't want to end up taking the internship if it's offered and commit to 3 months, then have my dream company have an opening that I'd want to go for. What do you think?  
  
Sorry for the essay.  
**TL; DR - Should I wait for an opening at my dream company (good chance of getting it due to prior internship there, experience, and connections) or take a possible FT paid internship (great pay, but not exactly what I want to do long term, 3 month commitment)? I'm worried that an opening might come up at the company I actually want to work for, when I'm interning at the other place and will miss my opportunity if I do so.**"

* I got myself a job as a help desk analyst in my college's help desk after 1 week in college. I was previously a student aide in the tech lab for my high school for a little over 2 years. After 7 months, I got promoted to full-time. I worked well above my pay grade because I always volunteered to take on projects or learn something new. I helped in training MBA candidates on the systems available at the college and I saw a need for a new hire reference manual so I created one. I also traveled to other campuses to sub as a supervisor when needed. 

* I left the job to pursue school full-time and got a summer internship at the DMV. They put me in the front (which I later found out was against the rules because I wasn't certified) to speak to clients. I speak two languages so I usually translated for those that didn't speak English well. I have a ton of patience and in the end they urged me to take the city exam so I could work there after the summer. 
* I found a part-time seasonal retail job. I was the person to open the most credit accounts in the entire department for the three months I was there. Guests asked for me by name and in the end, the manager there too wanted to hire me full-time but I only found out after I landed another retail job.
* The second part-time retail job was as a stock associate. My manager saw potential in me and although I wanted to stay in the warehouse where I was training because I saw opportunity there, she took me along with her to a new flagship store. She would often leave me as the supervisor for the stock floor when she wasn't there and I arranged shipments and created lunch schedules. I even convinced her to let us arrange days off among ourselves so when someone needed to call out, we could just arrange for someone else to step in for us so we wouldn't be missed at all. This is something that most places have but my manager had different ways of working.
* My last and current job is the one where I've had the most responsibility in respect to my position. I am once again a help desk analyst and my manager has me working on two projects. I've been here almost two years and I feel great that he trusts me enough to let me manage these projects on my own. I asked him to show me how to do reports so he can take some things off his plate. He'll start teaching me next week. I am consistently one of the top three if not the top employee every month and my boss often gets compliments from callers about me.

I asked for a performance review recently and he laughed because he says no one else would request one on their own. I wanted to know what are things I could improve on and he earnestly told me that out of all his analysts, he is happy he has me on board. He told me that what sets me apart from the rest of my colleagues is that I care enough to want to do my job the whole way and more. He continued and told me that when I don't know something I will figure it out and let everyone else know too as opposed to others that will just pass a problem onto someone else if they've never seen it before.

-----------------

**TL;DR:**  
My work ethic and motivation to grow and learn more has gotten me noticed by my superiors. This is despite the fact that my colleagues have way more experience than I do. I obviously can't bring in my manager into interviews to sing my praises so how can I let interviewers know that I am a great employee even if I do not have the most skills on paper?

1za2yw,2,2014-03-01,Post Graduation Jobs,deathstardown,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1za2yw/post_graduation_jobs/,"Hi Reddit,

I am an economics major who will be graduating this December with a degree in Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am looking to find a job in the financial services industry. I wanted to know what advice you would provide me in finding an entry-level job at a financial firm wherer I would have forward mobility. For example, if five years from December of this year I wanted to go back to University and pursue an MBA, which firms would provide me with an opportunity to do that. 

Companies that I have a strong interest in working for are Fidelity, Tradeking, Vanguard, Intuit, Bain &amp; Co., Boston Conulting Group, CitiGroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, &amp; Merill Lynch. I know that this is a very random mix of companies; some are investment banking firms, while others are brokerage firms. I am primarily interested in which companies offer the best employee benefits (health benefits, vacation time, &amp; retirement matching) apart from base salary. 

Some of the classes that I have taken in University are the following, if this might help align my interests with any of your recommendations:

Risk Managements &amp; Insurance, Analytical Public Finance &amp; Policy, International Business, Operations Management, Intermediate Microeconomics &amp; Intermediate Macroeconomics, The Statistics of Economics, Principles of Financial Accounting, Principles of Microeconomics &amp; Principles of Macroeconomics. I have also taken a trove of classes in the liberal arts area, so Ihave very strong writing skills. Some of these classes include: British &amp; Anglophone Literature, Interracial Literature, Contemporary Moral Philosophy, and an Ethics and Moral Philosophy class. 

I think that my primary interest would be in client-side consulting or banking. I also have very strong skills in the technical aspects of computers (operating systems, some coding, making computers; I suppose this is not very relevant). 

I am looking to study for any investment-related exams that I would need before getting my first full-time job during the summer (my semester ends in May). With the companies &amp; areas I listed above, would you recommend that I get sponsored to take the Series 7 exam, or the Series 63 exam? I am considering pursuing a summer internship with Northwestern Mutual if doing so would be able to help me accomplish this.

Thank you for any of your thoughts, ideas, or suggestions,

Rank all my devs 1 (2 of them)

Rank one of the dev jobs 5 because I would rather work for Fixmo over this

I go to UBC which is consistently ranked in top 50 in the world, but not particularly for its computer science curriculum. I feel as if a degree from this school wouldn't mean much. 

I have interned at NVIDIA in the past, and gotten a return internship offer; they were also willing to make a full time offer. 

You might have noticed it's odd I'm a senior but still a full year away from graduating -- I was supposed to graduate in December 2014, but both Amazon and Facebook made an internship offer. Because I don't want to lose either opportunities, I'm taking a term off to do both; Amazon in the summer, Facebook in the fall. Both companies are okay with me doing this. 

Here's the thing though. I hate school. Yeah sure, a lot of us do, but I really hate school. This school has done nothing for me, I'm on academic probation, and my GPA is ~2.6. I need an average of 57% this term or else I'll be required to withdraw and there's a real possibility of that happening. I've invested so much time in interview prep that I've neglected school work too much, and I feel like I'm too far behind to catch up at this point.

I know I can do good work from my experience at NVIDIA. I'm confident I'll be able to perform well at the next two internships and have return offers from at least one of them. But I don't know how they will react if I drop out. 

Currently, I am putting in the minimal effort to successfully finish my degree but I'm worried about the worst case. So I guess the question I'm trying to ask is, I'm almost done, I might as well finish my degree but what happens if I get kicked out? Am I screwed? 

EDIT: Alright I'll finish my degree. I think I was just frustrated and had a spur of giving-up attitude. 

EDIT2: I GET IT I'M FINISHING MY FUCKING DEGREE GUYS. STOP FIGHTING."

:--|:--
[Sooo...is the House of Cards representation of congressman any accurate (i.e. coke, partying, irresponsibility, etc\) or is it just sleepy old men?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cft9zze?context=5)|It's not even remotely accurate in my experience. The best and most accurate portrayal of staff culture and how process works is Veep.  That show nails how all of the climber sycophants, policy geeks, and creepy special interests gum up the process.  
[So much for the bad guys.  Who are the good guys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftfxjp?context=5)|People who vote. People who stay informed and work in their daily Lives to make change.
[As someone who has very little knowledge of congressional-staff-culture outside of House of Cards, I'm very intrigued. Could you go a bit more into detail about what was accurate/inaccurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthg20?context=5)|In HoC? Nothing really. House of Cards is not a show about politics. It doesn't really try to be. It's a pulp scandal story.  Watch a few episodes of veep. It's 100% accurate.  
[I find it oddly hilarious that you speak of the sycophants that gum up the process and then became one yourself by trade.  Well played on feeding a broken system and getting yours in the process!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftsu1m?context=5)|Oh we've met and you know about my personality?
[Granted the West Wing follows the West Wing, but how does that show compare to real life (if you have seen the show\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfti1h1?context=5)|To me, it's aaron sorkin speaking at us through characters.  Veep is 1000x more accurate, albeit still covering the administration. 
[One thing about VEEP is it seems that even the Vice-President wasn't immune to stupid mistake, comments, or gross incompetence. Would you say that is the same for Congressmen?  Oh what are your predictions/your congressman's opinion on 2014/2016? Or do you not discuss that much?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftiium?context=5)|And as far as VEEP: I've spent entire weeks fixing mistakes I didn't make.  It's pretty spot on. 
[What kind of field are you lobbying for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfta3om?context=5)|Big oil, increased off shoring of money, less oversight of PACs, etc...
 |(But really, infrastructure investments)
[For what it's worth, I thought it was hilarious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfvlxbf?context=5)|Thank you.  I don't know how I could have been more clear that I was joking!
[I would much rather not have a reason to be frustrated. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthbzr?context=5)|Me too! But it's not my fault the system is broken.  I didn't come in and break it 4 or 5 years ago.  I tried my hardest to always act out of idealism.  
[Hold on, how do you lobby for ""safer bridges""? Who pays you to lobby on behalf of public safety?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthm9x?context=5)|I don't advocate for safer bridges specifically. I advocate for safer infrastructure broadly.  Baby jesus pays me for doing god's work. And a non-profit organization. 
[Why do you specifically say 4 or 5 years ago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftm8gj?context=5)|Because it was broken for 100 years before I came?
[Saying 4 or 5 years ago makes it seem like it wasn't broken before then, not that you came to work with congress 4 or 5 years ago. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftqtv1?context=5)|Sorry for the lack of clarity. It actually broke the day I started working there =P.
[I believe what he's trying to express here is that you are difficult to communicate with. Your ability to transfer inflection through text is sorely lacking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftpzaw?context=5)|Sadly, we do not use in line comments to modify our speech in english, as most other languages now do.
 |That's a joke. No other languages do that.
[I read that as the House is where you go to start out and the Senate is where you go for the perks and to retire. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfttb4z?context=5)|Retire in the senate? I'd rather have the worst case of herpes of all time.  I think both are where you should go to leave, quickly.
[If you think like that, then why be in politics at all? Most people (I would like to think\) go to bring change for the better. Can't expect it to get better without putting in effort to change it. If herpes is what it cost, then herpes it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfuj4rc?context=5)|Right but ""bringing change"" while a noble goal as a staffer, can be done in many ways.  Your usefulness in shaping policy on the inside may wear off, and you may find yourself more effective focusing on narrower issues from the outside.  Or leaving DC and working locally.   
[How does the whipping process typically work? Any examples of strong-arming or horse-trading to secure a vote you can share?  I have an image of Frank Underwood going to work on someone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftaesr?context=5)|I was never at the receiving end of this.  There just haven't been that many crucial votes where one Democrat was going to make or break the legislation's success since I came on board.  I think prior to the tea party wave, when legislation was actually moving, this was probably far more common.
[How common is pay to play? Is it done with an envelope of cash (how it works in my state legislator\) or is it funneled through proper channels and campaigns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftauxo?context=5)|The two worlds are kept separate by law.  No campaign business can be conducted in a member office, and [lobbyists can no longer just walk around handing out checks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAC2xeT2yOg).  Both offices I worked for had outside contractors who dealt with their campaign finances, and they only communicated with my Chiefs of Staff.  The member is obviously aware of where his or her financial support is coming from, but because I worked for safe members, I don't think money drove their policy nearly as much as interests within the state (businesses in the district, ethnic groups, etc).
 |*Edit* I didn't really answer your question about pay to play: in both offices I worked ANYONE from the state could get a meeting with staff.  Both bosses would personally meet with student groups when possible.  Higher level meetings with the bosses tend to a bit more...selective?  But not necessarily based on who is giving money.  If a CEO of a business in state is coming in to talk about concerns, they meet with the boss.  If a group of folks who want the U.S. to put an embargo on olives want's to talk to us, staff handles it.
[I am curious if one was to talk to the staffers, how much influence would that actually have? I'm just picturing a summary being given to the boss that he bushes aside to deal with the big requests from big lobby groups.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk432?context=5)|It's the worst. Hah.
[I am also very concerned that these older politicians really have no idea or concept of how technology and the internet really work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk432?context=5)|I've changed my bosses minds on issues.  I literally got into screaming matches over keystone and sopa/pipa with my seniors.  Good staffers have a lot of influence.  Maybe not more than powerful lobbyists, but it doesn't mean we cant try our hardest. 
[You might be amused at a UK series from years ago, *Yes, Minister,* about the relationship between an MP and his staffers. It makes it pretty clear that staffers actually run the government. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftri07?context=5)|I will totally check it out. That sounds great. 
[Do you view yourself as part of the problem or part of the solution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcrhx?context=5)|I don't view MOST staffers as part of the problem.  I think the majority of them really do believe, in an idealistic way, in the work they are doing.  I think the problems are our campaign finance laws, our election laws, and our shitty fucking media that treats the whole thing like a reality show instead of doing their jobs.
 |As for myself, you know, almost everything we do is a moral decision.  Did you look at the tag on your shirt today to see where it was made? Did you buy gasoline? What city was your food grown in? Who picked it? How did it get to you?  We are all part of a problem despite our sometimes best intentions. 
[I finally convinced my dad after years of trying that fox news is NOT fair and balanced.  I felt like I had won the superbowl.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftgwi1?context=5)|Fox news is awful. I don't see MSNBC as *much* better.  News channels should not advocate on behalf of a party, but instead on behalf of the truth. It's so conflicting when corporate conglomerates prevent them from doing so. 
[*I think the problems are our campaign finance laws, our election laws, and our shitty fucking media that treats the whole thing like a reality show instead of doing their jobs.*  What do you think is the feasible way of fixing those issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthwvb?context=5)|Your guess is as good as mine. It's so overwhelming. 
[I liked how one poll showed that most people trusted The Daily Show the most where political news was concerned. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk28y?context=5)|Well if you watch one episode of the daily show and 30 minutes of MSNBC, it's immediately clear who is being objective.  Sadly, it's not the ""news"" show.
[I blame media consolidation for most of that. There aren't enough competing voices. A decade ago, I worked very hard on that, including going to D.C., to hold the line on media ownership caps. We already took a huge hit on that front in '96, and we're determined not to let it get even worse. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftlfcd?context=5)|Gods work. It needs to be broken up.
[Do you think Internet freedom and the transparency of organizations like Wikileaks is changing the ""reality show"" spectacle of American politics. Are they aiding in making the TRUTH more pressing to the masses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk915?context=5)|I don't think the masses have any idea what wikileaks is =(
[Well, they've at least been well-introduced to Julian Assange - the alleged rapist, sexist, and paranoid conspiracy theorist (as portrayed by popular media\). There has to be a level of basic recognition at this point. Is there a genuine tension among white house staff with regard to waiting for new cables to be released? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkjru?context=5)|I don't work with white house staff at all, and on the hill, I don't think anyone knows/cares/pays attention.  It really is an administration headache more so than a congressional one. 
[A ""headache."" That sounds like an understatement to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkqfj?context=5)|Hah. Probably is. 
[What is something small you were asked to cover up? Examples, ""I hate shaking hands, like pizza with no sauce, or extramarital affairs are neat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftddcs?context=5)|One of my bosses wouldn't let us take meetings with a particular lobbying firm because they were ""a bunch of whores"" (financially, not literally prostitutes).  He made us take meetings with them in the cafeteria so they and their clients knew where they stood with our office.
 |I probably have more examples. If I think of something I will come back to this. 
[How'd you get the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftavq2?context=5)|I worked for free for 6 months to prove my worth to an office and was eventually hired.  Blew my savings.  I think its similar to other fields where demand far outweighs supply. 
[Interesting that you see it as ""demand for jobs"" as opposed to ""demand for workers"". ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftft3e?context=5)|I probably just worded it poorly but demand for jobs definitely outweighs the supply. 800 resumes came in for my last position.
[Do lobbyists really have as much direct control over politicians as reddit likes to think they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcd6i?context=5)|Yes/No.  I don't think *most* people understand what lobbying looks like. Lobbyists help give people a footprint in Washington D.C.   Some corporations and interest groups have in house lobbyists, and some hire firms like The Podesta Group to work on their behalf. I can give a lesson on how policy is crafted from cradle to grave if people are interested, but shortly: lobbyists aren't the problem.  Campaign finance laws are. 
[I've gained a basic understanding of your views from reading your responses...or so I'd like to think.  I'd read your lesson one way or the other.  How would one get started working in your industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcva0?context=5)|In lobbying, work on the hill.  People talk a lot about the revolving door (although I would argue that returning to the hill, then to lobbying, ad infinitum, is the revolving door), but lobbyist are paid because they understand the process of policy making, and it is hard to gain that knowledge without firsthand experience.  
[In divided government and as a minority party member, is the focus more on shaping public opinion rather than policy making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftb5qj?context=5)|In a divided government, everyone is in the minority.  Holding one chamber still means you are sending legislation over to another chamber to die.  So yes, I think people take votes on bullshit bills they know are going nowhere simply to message to their base.  It's the absolute worst part about working on the hill right now, and is 95% of why I quit. 
[Disagree, taking votes gets people on the record and draws distinctions between the two sides, giving constituents a clearer choice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftbq2z?context=5)|Right, I agree in principle, but they are taking votes on legislation they love to have fights over but that very few of them would ever vote for if they thought it had a chance at passing. 
[In your opinion, how can we eliminate/limit corporate greed playing a role in who gets elected and how those representatives vote? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftaxao?context=5)|I don't have a solid answer on this.  While I can see how it affected the process day to day, I don't have a policy background on the issue.
 |1) Limit campaigns to 16 weeks.
 |2) Public financing of elections.
 |3) Open primaries with instant runoff ballots.
[I'm surprised to see these kind of suggestions (particularly the first two\) from an insider.  How do you see public financing work? Does every candidate get money? Is there a signature threshold that must be reached? Is 16 weeks for all levels of government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkeld?context=5)|To be honest, I am not super versed on electoral policy.  I have read proposals I really like, but I don't have any specifics to point to without doing some reading first. 
[Why are the oldest, most technophobic, out of touch members of society able to dictate sweeping laws in fields they have absolutely no area of expertise in? Why are old white men who got useless degrees 40 years ago making laws on bleeding-edge medical breakthroughs, internet protocol, communication standards, etc? How often do you think ""good god my boss is a moron""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftha0i?context=5)|I respect both of my former bosses, but they were old enough to be out of touch with modern technology.  Some older members are SUPER in touch.  It's weird how it lands on some and not others.  It's one of the most frustrating things on earth, having people who have no idea what they are talking about shaping particular policies.  Like when a room full of men hold a hearing on abortion with all male witnesses.  Way to go, Congress!
[Do you find Chuck Schumer's flip phone as funny as I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftjv50?context=5)|Does he have a flip phone? That's terrifying. 
[How much does a House staffer get paid?  How often can that change?  Does upward mobility imply jumping ship to either lobbying or a Senator's staff?  What makes a successful staffer?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftb690?context=5)|Congressional salaries are publicly disclosed.  If I recall correctly, average pay for a senior policy staffer are in the high 50s.  
[Chosen at random, Rep. David Scott \(D-GA\\) has an LD that's on track to make $80k. Plenty make more than that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftdh46?context=5)|I don't doubt it.  I never looked at other staffer's salary because it was too disheartening to know how little I was paid.  
[I am interested in changing the election process itself, specifically by enacting Approval Voting.  There are reams of evidence that this reform can improve governance, specifically help both incumbents (by avoiding the Spoiler Effect\) and voters (by letting them always vote for their honest favorite\). Do you have any advice in how to convince members of Congress that something relatively esoteric like voting systems is worth their time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftby71?context=5)|Sadly, I don't.  I am a huge believer in open primaries and instant runoff voting, but I think it just has to come from the local level and move up.  Change on that level is unlikely to come from the top down. 
[Thanks for the response.   Knowing there are people involved in Congress at any level who are aware of these issues gives me hope.  If you have a minute, I'd like to try and convince you that Approval Voting is better than Instant Runoff Voting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcakc?context=5)|Awesome. Bookmarking the link now!
[Maybe you could require larval politicians to pass a citizenship test. That might weed out the Michele Bachmans and other airheads from running. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftk0mj?context=5)|If stupid people want to elect stupid politicians to represent their stupid beliefs, thats the system we have and have to live with. For better or worse. 
[Spoken like someone who doesn't have that witch campaigning in your back yard. ;\)  Oh wait, you said you were from Virginia? Meh, you got plenty. :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftkbht?context=5)|Not from VA.  West Coast.  Sorry to hear it, but she'll be gone in months!  I do think its sad that the electoral process rewards people like her in the primaries.  An open primary with instant runoff ballots would probably prevent her from making it through to a general. 
[1\) Did/do you enjoy a career in the political arena in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcnoc?context=5)|1) No. Not really. It's frustrating working in a career field where people believe they have total carte blanche to attack you personally for working in (as is entirely evident by some people in this AMA).
[Thanks for taking the time to answer.  I was hoping you'd say Hong Kong or Australia.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcx4w?context=5)|I literally know nothing about either government.  I am not a smart man =P.
[Sure you are! I don't know much about either as well.  I mentioned them b/c they are extremely economically free. I support the free market, that's all. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftdamu?context=5)|Obviously the US could stand to learn a lot of lessons from our friends overseas.  We are slipping in almost every measure.  Unfortunately, I think that will have to come from the energy of Americans on the ground growing tired of how stacked the system is against individuals.  While there are many members of Congress who support good ideals and put their names behind it, its the minority.  
[You mentioned infrastructure investments. Can you be more specific? Roads &amp; bridges? Fiber optic networks? Gas and water lines? ETC...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftax4m?context=5)|Roads and bridges.  =)
[How scared should we be about driving over these crumbling bridges in this country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftbfy1?context=5)|REALLY fucking scared.
 |[Link to www.infrastructurereportcard.org](http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org)
 |Like...terrified.  
[That's kinda what I expected and yes I'm terrified every time I pass under a bridge here and see that orange spray paint circling a big chunk of concrete missing or a big crack in a bridge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftbr5f?context=5)|I legitimately wish I had a better answer for you!  Actually, there is good news. That D+ *is* an improvement over the previous grade!
[Any idea what the appetite for new infrastructure to relieve congestion in our biggest cities is? Do you see real change in federal budgeting or major projects likely to be approved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfth9d9?context=5)|Internet I know absolutely nothing about.
[Also, same question for internet (FCC? Google Fiber? net neutrality?\)and waterways (WRRDA\) if you have any insight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfth9d9?context=5)|There is a HUGE appetite for new infrastructure but the highway trust fund, which funds most federal-aid highway and transit projects in this country, is nearly bankrupt and there's not a huge appetite in this congress to find a way to fix it.  We'll see how that goes in August.  
[You'd think someone would do a study to show that new/wider/better roads and public transit would save more money in the long run (less time and fuel wasted\). Then someone would translate that into plain english so a politician would both understand and believe it. Am i describing your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthki5?context=5)|Kindof.  It's not a question of whether or not safer roads and transit improve public health. It's an ideological question as to whether or not the federal government should help foot the bill for it. 
[What was the most comprehensive piece of legislation you worked? Do you think current bills have gotten out of hand in terms of length and the number of amendments added?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfte6jf?context=5)|Amendments, yes. With so called ""must pass"" bills, there are so many non germane amendments attached for various reasons. And often times members will attach ""poison pill"" amendments to kill legislation they are opposed to or to gum up the process.
 |I don't think bills are ""too long"" as many people charge.  Amending or updating the us code is not always simple and sometimes requires long lists of technical corrections, insertions, and amendments. It's also worth noting that bill text fits in incredibly narrow margins. A 2000 page bill, in reality, is maybe a 10th of that.
 |I've authored several bills. Nothing over 60 pages. Mostly basic adjustments to existing policy. No appropriations or increased budget authority on any of them.
[My god, thank you for explaining what legislative text looks like on the page.  I get so tired of the ""there's no way they had time to read that!"" argument.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfu7am7?context=5)|To be sure, NO members read bills.  That's not an objective statement of fact but I'm almost positive. Staff and committee staff do though, and that counts for something.
[In general, how much of a members' vote is based on direction from leadership (""we want you to vote yes/no""\) vs. other factors (constituents' preference, member's own personal conviction, lobbyist's desires\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfta4i4?context=5)|It depends on the member and the vote.  Before votes are called, the whips office sends out an email blast to all of the staffers with vote recommendations unless the issue is highly controversial among the party (keystone, for example).
 |My bosses generally voted with leadership, but not specifically because leadership advised us to. We have also voted against leadership on some key votes.  When that happens it is generally either driven by completely different ideological positions on one specific issue or because *cough* lobbyists *cough*. 
[Can you elaborate on the last bit? Do lobbyists legitimately convince your boss to change a vote on it's merits? Is it because they need the campaign cash? Somewhere in between?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfth5dt?context=5)|Let's say a vote is coming up on a bill that democrats generally favor to give greater labor rights to toll booth workers.  But we haven't heard a word from the toll booth workers, so we assume they aren't in our district, and we HAVE heard from the highway authority who arent opposed to the bill in principle, but they are worried that the way its worded could have unintended financial effects, and they ask us to vote for it.  Way may normally vote with leadership, but because of who we heard from on the issue, we might decide to buck them.  Particularly if the highway authority has been a strong partner in the past.  
[Why not vote based on what is the objectively better choice? Who cares what the Highway Authority has to say, they clearly only care about saving money. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfthp8j?context=5)|It may be the better choice.  I just made that up.  But ""the better choice"" is not an objective measurement.  
[What kind of educational background and prior work experience do you have, and is your background typical of congressional staffers?  Regarding the legislator you worked for: How was their personality compared to the image that the general public sees? Did they seem to believe in what they were doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftaubi?context=5)|1) I have a bachelors degree in political science. Almost everyone on the hill has a bachelors degree in political science. (Which is kindof a bullshit thing, in my opinion, but there you go). Lots of lawyers.  Lots of grad students with degrees in public admin and public policy and foreign affairs.  I have background in international development, which was entirely unrelated to my policy portfolio, and rural development in the U.S., also unrelated to my policy portfolio.
 |2)  I liked both of my bosses a lot as people.  I think the process is totally fucked and makes people do things they don't believe in from time to time.  From our election and campaign financing laws to how ineffective our news media is at holding people accountable.  I could talk a lot more about this subject. 
[Has your experience made you more or less likely to consider running for office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftcqlc?context=5)|I have literally never considered running for office.  I am a painfully introverted policy geek, not an a-type politics person.
 |But lets pretend I wanted to run before working on the hill. I wouldn't now. 
[What did you major in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftfqg3?context=5)|Political science with a focus on environmental policy.
[May I ask where you went to college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftntsl?context=5)|Somewhere very mediocre. Not in the top 90.
[Oh okay. As a high school junior interested in politics (and environmental policy\) you can probably guess why I'm interested. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftrmz8?context=5)|If you go to a great school, that's great. Going to Harvard will *probably* get someone to take a second look at your resume before they toss it in the trash.
 |What WILL get you looked at is coming here, working hard as an intern or junior staffer, and having people advocate on your behalf when you start applying to jobs. Happy to answer any questions you have on here or over PM.  
[You say you're a staffer, yet you are upset by personal attacks &amp; misplaced anger?  Shenanigans.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftga84?context=5)|Honestly, it was such a small part of my experience. Most people I worked with were awesome.
[I envy you that.  I work as senior staff for the TX lege.  A large portion of our job involves dealing with furious constituents asking questions somewhat similar to what you're getting.  I've actually got 2 death threats saved on my voicemail pending investigation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftgm53?context=5)|It's hard to blame people for being misinformed. I try to be empathetic. The news, aside from the daily show and npr, certainly isn't doing it's job.
[I understand you don't want to be a recipient of anger. However, don't you think you contribute to the problems by engaging in, and profiting from, the system? I've talked with many financial industry people who are nice people with good intentions but they have been so conditioned in believing what they do carries more social utility than it actually does that they're entirely incapable of objective assessment of the value - or even worse, purpose - of their role. I see politicians and those who engage in that spectrum as very similar. They have extremely inflated views of their roles. I'm an engineer and it bothers me intensly to hear politicians - mostly attorneys - talk about STEM careers when they have zero clue on the subject. Zero. When Obama recently said the Dem's are doing ""God's work"" it reminded me of Blankenfein's testimony on Capital Hill where he said exactly the same statement. They're - financial industry and political class (politicians and career political engagers\) - cut from the same cloth. Do you see the similarity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftdv7x?context=5)|Wait for it...I am not a politician.  I am not your member of Congress. Nobody voted for me. I am not Obama. I do not represent fundraising dollars or donated dollars.
 |And if you think I am profiting from anything, you should come to DC and have a look at my pay stubs from the last 5 years.
 |And as a quick aside, if you don't think you too are engaged in and profiting from a system of corruption, have a look at the tags on your clothes, the pay folks make in retail at the shops you shop at, where your energy comes from, where your food comes from and who produces it.  I am in no more of a moral position as a former staffer than I am as a citizen. 
[Mind the ignorance but I'm from the UK. So what is lobbying and how does the process of lobbying work ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftgwnn?context=5)|Lobbying is petitioning the government to take, or not take some specific action.  Anyone can lobby their member of Congress simply by advocating for some position.  But a professional lobbyist is someone who has connections to the legislature or administration, understands the process intimately, and can help give people a footprint in government.
 |As an example, lets say business X in ohio finds out the government is going to require a product be used for some reason (I don't have a great example here. How about industrial diamonds?) and they happen to produce industrial diamonds.  But china produces them for less money.  So they may hire a lobbyist to come in and say ""great idea, but can we slap a make it in america provision on that?""  In theory that will make them far more competitive, so its worth the money they spent to hire that lobbyist. 
[I'm currently interning on a congressional level (remedial office/constituent work\) and working in my statehouse (same type\) as a senior in college. I'd be interested in your basic credentials. Degree, previous experience etc. but I'd also like to hear what you have to say as far as the intangibles and strategies for breaking into the job market go. Of course connections make a difference but I work with a lot of people that picked their guy from the state level and worked 3 sequential campaigns just to get him into Congress, as current and recent graduates.  I don't know whether to take whatever I can get or ""pick my guy"" and work my ass off essentially for free just to get him and myself a job. What have you found works best for you? What do you think naturally sets you apart and what are some things anyone can improve on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cftl3xz?context=5)|1) There are *no* remedial jobs.  Don't speak about yourself or your work like that to anyone.  Are you answering calls? Great, that frees up someone above you to pursue policy initiatives.  Answering constituents? Now they feel like they have a voice in government. It is ALL good work.  2)  Make your own connections.  I didn't have connections when I moved here (my parents dont donate to politics, or work in politics, or have any voice in it.)  But I worked hard, met people, asked for their advice, and followed the best of it.  3) Take what you can get to get your foot in the door.  You can work for a mental slug and still be an incredible staffer.  In fact, lets say you do work for someone less than ideal who other members dont respect. But then they see amazing legislation coming from that office. They KNOW the boss isn't writing it.  Just take what you can get and go kill it.
 |4) Be the best staffer you can.  Meet everyone. Work hard. Don't ass kiss.  Lead from behind when necessary.  
[On a scale of one to ten, ten being maximum corruption and one being completely devoid of all corruption. Where do you personally view Congress in general to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfte18z?context=5)|I don't think you can separate Congress from the vague idea of ""the system"" that surrounds it.  I'd say the system is inherently incredibly corrupt when it comes to how power is represented.  The day to day operations of Congress (policy making and voting), maybe 4?  But our campaign finance and election laws? 7 maybe?  Relative to some other countries much better. Relative to Sweden? Not great.
[What is your favorite part about living in DC? I spent a few months their on Internship, and I love the city.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zfxgx/iama_former_senior_staffer_to_a_member_of/cfte2fj?context=5)|Leaving for vacation =P.

I am proficient at using Creo 2.0, ANSYS, and MATLAB software, and have a solid foundation in the field of Solid Mechanics. I believe that I could learn SolidWorks software at an accelerated pace because I already know how to use the newest version of ProE. 

PM me if you wish to see my resume. 

Thank you for your time."
1zgess,1,2014-03-03,A dongle? The hell is a dongle?,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1zgess/a_dongle_the_hell_is_a_dongle/,"Before I begin this story, I need to preface a few points for you guys so you can properly uh... experience, this situation.

* I am an intern at a local repair store.

* My town is very rural. The techs at the different businesses/schools are all friends and will help each other out if someone has a hefty work load that week. (there's only like 4 certified techs in the entire town.)

* I'm your average intern/college student. Hoody, presentable pants, back pack full of necessary things. A little bit on the hefty side. Kinda clueless and prone to confusion.

* I'm still pretty sure this didn't actually happen. I must've been day dreaming.



The start.

Average day as an intern. Running scans and testing hard drives. Mr.Bossman gets a call from the tech at the highschool. He's been slammed recently with a new computer lab to set up and embroidery printers for the advanced home ec students.

It's early in the morning and we're not too busy today so Mr.Bossman decides to close up shop for a little bit and take his trusty side-kick ActuallyRich for a learning experience. 

Fast forward an hour and a half. I've set up all the wiring for the embroidery printers and now I'm starting to work on installing the appropriate software while Mr.Bossman and the home ec teacher just shoot the wind.

Lunch is getting close. Mr.Bossman decides I'm trustworthy enough to install software by myself without causing some sort of space-time anomaly. Mr.Bossman heads off to grab lunch and miss home ec teacher goes back to her office.

Que the beginning of a strange and embarrassing encounter.

For this software there is no ""company license"" one disk for everything. Each computer(3 of them, 2 printers for each. Don't ask I don't know.) has it's separate cd and cd case. Little did I know, each instance of this software **requires**  a USB security verfication thing when you reboot the computer to verify the software. 

Like I said, don't ask, I don't know. 

Things are going well, all three of the computers have completed the pre-reboot step. Then each computer prompts me for a reboot. I'm the kinda guy that talks to myself while working on a computer. [(duck syndrome)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) 

""A reboot for printer software? Uh... okay I guess.""

Proceeded to reboot each computer. Each computer starts up fine, and on each computer a window pops up prompting me.

*""Please insert the security dongle.""*

""A dongle? The hell is a dongle...""

I don't currently have internet access so Google is out. I don't carry my A+ book around. Mr.Bossman is picking up lunch. Might as well ask the Home Ec teacher yah? 

I'm an intern. I don't usually work with customers directly. I'm currently on the job. 

***I'M NOT TRAINED FOR THIS!***

So I shuffle over to the office door. Knock three times, as seems the most polite number. She calls me in.

Me: Uh, excuse me. Do you have.... the dongle?

Teacher: Dongle?

Me: Yeah, the computer is asking for a dongle. I thought you might have it. 

Teacher: *sly look* Are you trying to tell me something ActuallyRich?

Me *clueless*: Uh... yeah. The dongle. Need a dongle for the computer.

Teacher: You don't have to play games ActuallyRich. It's okay if you find me attractive.

Me: Uh... uhm... what? I just need the...

Teacher: I think we should maybe talk about this more later. Would you like to go to dinner tomorrow?

Me: Uh... I just want... uhm... the dongle. I uh... I'll just wait for Mr.Bossman to uh.... to get back. I think he uhm... he might... the dongle. The dongle. 

Teacher: The dongle.

Me: Yeah... the dongle.

The following silence. Sweet tap dancing baby Jesus, I didn't know what to do. I just avoided eye contact and sidled out like some socially deprived gray clad crab.

Mr.Bossman explained what a dongle was. Just a USB drive. I know that now. I've learned an important lesson.

I'm also pretty sure miss teacher lady expects me for a date tonight.

[Also, bloody floors and haunted warehouses?? Please elaborate!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcg4y?context=5)|I was in the IT Dept.  Bloody floors: some guy in the factory was sick one day and he started to throw up blood. He walked all the way across the factory while throwing up, so that whole pathway had blood all over it. All of the sewing workers were screaming and running away, because they were scared. It was intense  Warehouses: They have a basement below one of the warehouses and security guards constantly quit their job because they report seeing a girl with no head during their night shift. The basement is creepy by itself, for example there is a room that was shut off with hinges on both sides, and chains to keep it closed. We went into it, and there was a red rug with baby dolls aligned in a circle. It looked like some straight up cult shit haha.
[Srsly wtf.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftht69?context=5)|I have no goddamn idea. When I initially saw the door, I just thought: ""Oh hell no. That shit is weird."" Me and one other guy were the first ones that had gone into that room for a while, because no one wanted to open it and go inside.
[Where did that room come from? just left behind from previous owners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftht69?context=5)|It looked like this but with chains and door hinges on both right and left sides:  [Link to www.polyvore.com](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=24176156)
[Where do i sign up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkg8a?context=5)|Haha, are you ready to join the Scooby Doo team?
[What's with the image shift of the company? I think I bought my first AA hoodie something like 7 years ago and back then, the advertising was much more tame..the quality of the clothing was also higher.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftd396?context=5)|Well, thats what Dov (the founder) wants because, mostly, hes a pervert. I don't know why the quality of the clothes went down, but im guessing it is because the company has been in decline due to its lack of control. Dov really wants to control everything.
[American Apparel: Overpriced Spandex or genuinely good company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftbvw0?context=5)|Alright, this made me laugh. Its a terrible company. Flawed in a million different ways. But I wouldn't say anything is overpriced. The company is just chock full of weird ass people that are, most of the time, not entirely smart. (Not including the IT Dept., they are smart. Real smart.)
[Well, at least the clothes are made in the USA, which is exceptionally rare.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftg9h9?context=5)|Thats true. I really like how they hire not-so-fortunate people, and actually give them a chance to make their lives into something. Given that they get paid lots more than other clothing producers.
[*Flawed in a million different ways.*  What's the biggest or most interesting way it's flawed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftieqi?context=5)|Well, when the CTO left (the person that brought up web sales a ton), Dov tried to take over the web portion of AA, and web sales plunged about 75%. He was saying, ""oh, I can do it better, just watch."" Then he made himself look like a fool. It was actually pretty amusing. So, I would say Dov is one of the largest flaws, but at the same time, he runs the company like no one else could. Its a really weird thing to see.
[Can you elaborate on a description of these ""not so fortunate people? Are they people with criminal histories? unemployed? homeless? bad credit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgsvc?context=5)|Homeless, recent immigrants (lots of the time illegal), and unemployed.
 |Now, let me clarify something here before people get all upset. AA doesn't hire illegal immigrants with the knowledge that they are illegal. Many of them turn in fake papers, and lie about who they are. A lot of companies have this problem. At one point, I worked with the company to fish out the illegal papers, and to find these people. AA always fires them, because it is illegal to employ them. Just clearing something up :)
[What bad decisions did Dov make that swung web sales so greatly in such a short time?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkq7o?context=5)|Specifically, im not sure because I had left the company by that time. But my previous co workers were telling me that he just couldnt manage the people that were on it. The team needs management, and when they didnt get it, the whole thing just collapsed. His methods of ""managing"" were yelling at people and telling them to ""get shit done"", making everyone stressed because they had to meet ridiculous deadlines. It was all sorts of bad.
[I almost forgot--thanks for doing the AmA.  Reading through it, I picture an adventurous IT intern sneaking off to the basement with an innocuous messenger bag, filled with 3 days worth of food, a flashlight, sleeping bag, and night vision goggles.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgzu3?context=5)|Haha! Thats funny, because I actually went down there with my laptop bag full of snacks from the vending machine, and a flashlight on my phone. You pictured it very well! I was telling the guys around the office: ""does ANYONE want to go down there with me"" and they were all like: ""its too creepy"", so I just went down by myself! I wish I had NV Goggles, that would be so awesome.
[For my next question i would like to ask - are these said employees receiving a wage comparable to other employees? For conversations sake can you answer the question in regards to other AA employees as well as employees of any similar/competing companies? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth7hh?context=5)|Well, the AA workers that produce the clothes make a set wage, and then on top of that, they get paid extra for however many clothes they make. The set wage is a bit over minimum wage. (I believe it was around $11 per hour). Now, as an intern I was paid $10 an hour, so in comparison, they made more money than I did, and they make more money than most clothing producers than any other company. Dov is a really great guy to the workers who make the clothes, and his generosity shows.
 |You can explore the factory here: [Link to www.americanapparel.net](http://www.americanapparel.net/aboutus/verticalint/factory) (the 6th floor is sewing)
[""Give ya a dollar if you spend a whole night down there.""  I picture it playing out like an episode of Scooby Doo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth6q7?context=5)|Who would be the guy that takes the monster mask off at the end? haha.
[Thanks for the answer. It's something ive wondered from time to time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfths44?context=5)|Of course! It really is an incredible company.
[You would have to simultaneously be Fred, Shaggy, Scooby, Daphne, and Velma.  Scrappy is your call.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthdj4?context=5)|Oh damn. Thats a tough job, but im sure we could catch the bad guy then.
[Have you seen the album? Can you take some pics of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgbfh?context=5)|I cant take pictures of it, because he hides it somewhere. A lot of my co-workers have seen it though. They are all 100% sure that its real. Hes just a really really weird guy. And also, Im not really willing to see that sort of stuff anyways. 
[Are you sure they weren't all just giving you a hard time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth79p?context=5)|Yeah, I'm positive. Because I'm related to one of these employees. (not going into the relationship between me and the employee)
[Did you get the job because you were related to that employee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkbw6?context=5)|Not really. I still had to go through all of the interviews and testing. I wouldn't have been hired if I didn't show that I was a value to the team.
[Is it true that AA owns a hotel room in each city with an AA store where executives do drugs and screw the employees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftezm5?context=5)|Yes and no. They do have hotel rooms and business apartments in many cities, but the executives dont screw employees or do drugs. If any employee is under the suspicion that they are doing drugs, then they have to take a drug test. BUT, as for Dov, he probably has sex with a lot of employees. Hence all of his sexual harassment lawsuits. I doubt he does drugs too.
[What was your favorite/least favorite memory of working at American Apparel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcwxl?context=5)|My favorite memory was working with the IT Dept. They are funny and welcoming (nerf gun wars, pranks, etc.). But I cant say that I have a least favorite memory from working there. I can tell you that Dov yells at just about everyone. He makes people cry, and all that junk. Hes just greedy, and wants everything his way basically.
[You seem to have a very mixed view and opinion of Dov. Earlier you said he was a genuine and generous person, whereas now you say he's greedy. Is there a special reason for this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkk1i?context=5)|Yeah, it is *really* hard to label him. People call him a ""Greedy Jew"", and I agree (with no offense to Jews, he is just Jewish). But, on the other hand, he supports gay rights, and went on campaigns to support it, he hires unfortunate people, and he tries to support immigration reforms. He is a great man. I cant begin to tell you how hard it is to explain him, he is just *weird*. 
[Are you still an AA customer? Would you advise to buy from them as opposed to their competitors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftd7qo?context=5)|I still love their stuff! I think its great. But, there are better places to buy clothes too. Such as Urban Outfitters. Basically the same style of clothing, but without sexual ads and a crazy owner. haha.
[But are Urban Outfitters clothes made in the States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgap9?context=5)|I dont think they are. American Apparel is one of the last. There are a couple of companies that do, but they aren't as large as AA.
[Urban outfitters is shitty quality and super overpriced. That's my opinion anyway. And the style is like going to a thrift store without thrift store prices. Stupid. Not you, just urban. Sorry for being kind of randomly rude I just really don't like that store/company! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftkb5h?context=5)|Yeah, I guess its sort of you like it or you don't. You know? I haven't gotten many clothes from them, so you might be more qualified than me on them, but from what I see from the outside, they seem pretty similar.
[Could you give em their names please.  I know New Balance makes their socks and 1/3 of thier shoes in the USA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftjjsn?context=5)|I don't know any big names off of the top of my head. It is probably pretty easy to search up.
[It might be different for different stores. There's an AA and urban just blocks from each other in university city and they are pretty different. I like a lot of Urbans style but there's always something wrong with the quality or fit for me, I'm also a girl so I can't speak for the men's clothing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftl85p?context=5)|Urban and AA are usually always pretty close together (store wise). The womens clothes seem, like, loose and laid back. I'm not sure on how women's clothes fit, but I don't find a problem with what I have for men's :)
[What's the weirdest experience you had while working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcl08?context=5)|The basement for sure. I responded to someone elses question about it. Those basements, man. Creepy. Most employees don't want to go down there anymore.
[Can you elaborate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftd9av?context=5)|They dont want to go down there because its reported that there is a little girl running around without a head. Lights flicker, and rooms are locked up with chains, and boards that are nailed to it. Also! There are lots of mannequins down there, including baby ones that just creep you out. I dont know how to explain it.

Are you high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftdsgr?context=5)|A ghost. Not a real girl. I'm sure the police would have been there by now if she were real hah.
[If it was a real ghost wouldn't the ghost police have been there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftfbz0?context=5)|Im surprised that there hasnt been a ghost busters joke yet. But who knows if the ghost police were there or not. Im sure we could ask the Ghost Hunter guys to find them haha. 
[Spoiler alert: ghosts aren't real.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfth0oe?context=5)|:0.
[Next week on Supernatural, Sam and Dean face the inner chambers of American Apparel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftieoe?context=5)|Oh god. I would love to watch that, I feel like it would be pretty damn funny.
[I've been looking to alternatives to AA for a long time and haven't found any -- are there any you would suggest? Is there any talk within AA about the competition, or is there simply no one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftdu9m?context=5)|There is really no talk of competition within the company. And as for alternatives: AA is known for a lot of basic designs, like plain t shirts. But you really can't find plain t shirts of that quality anywhere else.
[Yes, sadly i have found that to be the case. The closest people have told me were canvas/bella shirts but their non-sweatshop status is dubious.  Do you think the company would do better without Dov in charge? In other words is this a profitable business model without a maniac control freak at the helm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftedhq?context=5)|The company would burn to the ground if Dov wasn't in control. No one can run his company better than he does. Dov is a really good business man, but on the other hand he's terrible. It is extremely difficult to label this man. I don't know how else to put it.
[You a 50/50 or tri-blend type of gal?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftfr8h?context=5)|If you read the top, I said I'm a man lmao. But I like tri-blend. It feels like fucking heaven.
[Sorry about that..forgot that detail as I worked down the thread before I posted.  Tri-blend is the tops I agree, despite the strength of the necklines beginning to decline 2010-present, it still fits great and you get 40+ washes out of them easily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgb2l?context=5)|Oh yeah. They are just the softest of the softest. I adore those things.
[Is it true he wanted photos of all his employees and fired the ugly ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgnli?context=5)|I'm assuming you mean ""fired"", but no. He doesn't ask employees for photos. Now, there is a rumor that he hires only good looking guys and gals for the retail stores, which I believe because they are, for the most part, not the brightest (no offense to the smart ones, if you're reading. There are plenty of smart retail people). 
[They took my picture to send to hq with my resume when i applied at my local store.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthxy2?context=5)|Probably for your ID badge, or account info.
[Why would they need that when i applied? they didnt hire me btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfti1ip?context=5)|Im not sure. I interned for the IT Dept, Im not sure what they needed it for. 
[They only hire people who look the part. the picture is for whoever is in charge to decide if i look enough like one of the models in the ads. im not ugly or fat, but im not a hipster so i wasnt even given an interview. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftiol0?context=5)|Well, im sure its not completely based on that. Its definitely not like that for the warehouses, that must be retail stores only. But, you know, Abercrombie and Fitch are just about the same. Im positive they do it too, and they arent the only ones. I probably wouldnt get hired to an AA retail store either, and Abercrombie for that matter.
[Any insight into why the clothes aren't made very well anymore? Seems like half the stuff in the store will have hems or sleeves that are sewn crooked. Do they just not give a shit about QC? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftc2f5?context=5)|Well, I'm not sure about that. The only thing I could possibly suggest, is that the workers are paid by how many items they produce. So, the more they make, the more money they get. I'm sure this causes them to get a bit sloppy at times from speed sewing haha. 
[Why were you an intern for 2 yrs? That seems very long to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgb1z?context=5)|Well, I'm not out of high school yet. I had just gotten the opportunity to work there to make some money on the side.

I was paid ($10 per hour) I usually worked 10-12 hours a day, but they let me work when I wanted, and from home, if I completed the work they assigned me of course.
[My questions: Were you paid? and why did the online store crash ALL THE TIME?!?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthfwj?context=5)|The online store USED to crash a lot more because our maintenance guy would not keep the server room cold, so it would get real hot. But, they have that fixed now. The site crashes frequently, probably because we were pushing out the new website, and there were kinks and bugs that needed to be fixed that werent caught in the QA stage. (My best guess. I dont work there anymore, so I couldnt tell you why it still is crashing, if it is)
[That sounds terrifying!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftg1mp?context=5)|[Link to la.racked.com](http://la.racked.com/uploads/AmericanApparelToyFactory_2013_1.jpe) Part of the mannequin warehouse.

There is always a security guard that watches the entrance to the basement, and whenever I go down there, they always are like: ""Be careful, that place is scary"" or something along those lines. Im not one to be terrified of ghosts, nor have I actually seen the little girl (because she is only seen during the night when the guards patrol the basement) but just the size of that massive basement is breathtaking, its so open, cold, and dark. With the exception of a couple of flickering lights. I havent seen one part of the basement, and I actually refuse to go down it, because its all the way at the very end, and you go through this doorway, and you turn right. When you turn right, you find yourself looking down this real creepy hall, and im telling it looks like its straight out of a horror movie (like a murderers lair), and as you look down the hall you can see some moonlight shining through the grates that are a part of the street above. At the end of the hall there is a chain linked fence that stops you from going any further, but on the other side of it theres just a wooden chair in a open room. It creeps me the hell out haha.
[Oh hell no ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftgeol?context=5)|I had a couple pictures on my old phone of the whole basement, but im not sure where theyre at. If I find them, I'll post them.
[Any idea why the models on their ads sometimes look like they really don't want to be there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftcr7i?context=5)|Well, a lot of photos are taken casually. AA selects pictures that have the casual look, and you're right, maybe some of the people that are in the photos really don't want to be there at that moment. But mostly, its just casual photos. 
[What are your thoughts on thigh high tube socks and thong leotards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftj8ti?context=5)|Well, if I were a girl I would wear thigh high socks, because, honestly, they look pretty damn comfortable. Thong leotards: I don't even know what to say. I wouldn't tell my girlfriend to get one, but I think they are alright. I have nothing against them, they're just different.
 |Why do you ask?
[The socks because they look awesome lol, and I wonder if they're comfortable.  The thing leotard because how the hell does someone think of that and who wears that lolz.  I guess someone must be buying it though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftjknq?context=5)|Yeah, I guess people buy those. The socks are very comfortable. I've tried the knee high ones on before, just to see how they feel and they are pretty nice socks. 
[Lol should have went for the thigh highs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftjy6h?context=5)|Well, I wouldn't wear them. The only occasion I would even wear knee high sicks is if I went snowboarding or something involving the snow haha. 
[Is everything made in the US still? Labels and advertising can lie and I really like the idea that all AA stuff is made in the US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfthp0m?context=5)|100% of it is made in the US. Absolutely every clothing item.
[I've heard things about the owner. What kind of practices and policies has he developed at the company that assist his creepy ways. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftbs71?context=5)|Well actually, he's not as bad as the media makes him out to be. For example, the HQ is right around the corner from skid row, and he would go out there and employ a lot of homeless people. But, the creepy side of him, is that he dates a lot of employees, which creates a ton of drama within the company.
[Haunted warehouses. Tell me more.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cftfq6l?context=5)|I mentioned one of the warehouses earlier in the thread: 
 |&gt;Warehouses: They have a basement below one of the warehouses and security guards constantly quit their job because they report seeing a girl with no head during their night shift. The basement is creepy by itself, for example there is a room that was shut off with hinges on both sides, and chains to keep it closed. We went into it, and there was a red rug with baby dolls aligned in a circle. It looked like some straight up cult shit haha.
 |But there is another one thats not haunted but it gives me the creeps. AA's mannequin warehouse (yes a warehouse to store the thousands of mannequins that they bought) is pretty god damn creepy because there is row after row of mannequins (sort of like the terracotta army in China.) The funny thing is, no one really works at that warehouse (maybe about 10-15 people) so it seems empty. There are mounds of baby mannequins piled up on top of each other without limbs. (that I found funny) But, overall that place is just filled with echoing noises and lifeless mannequins. I always think I see one moving in the corner of my eye, but its kind of bound to happen when there are that many around you.
[Uniqlo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg35f/iama_past_intern_for_american_apparel_and_ive/cfte1vz?context=5)|Yeah. I agree with you. How is the quality of their clothes? I've never tried to get anything from them before.

Work, school stress, and other personal issues kept me from creating anything meaningful as a side project during my final semesters of CS undergrad.

I've been trying to teach myself new things and work on new ideas at home over the past several months, but responsibilities and other distractions in my personal life, as well as fatigue from spending too much free time (in addition to my 8 hour work days) also on a computer, have all really put a damper on my efforts.

Just got a crushing rejection and I wanted to see if I am in the wrong. Let me explain:

I had an initial phone screen with my dream company about a week and half ago for a summer internship. They scheduled a Skype call but abruptly cancelled it about 5 minutes before it was scheduled to take place. We scheduled another call and I thought this phone screen went really well. I was prepared, I felt chemistry with the interviewer, and I solved both (relatively easy) programming challenges quickly and efficiently.

Several days after the interview, I sent my interviewer a quick thank-you note since I really did enjoy the conversation we had. He said that he enjoyed the conversation as well, and indicated that I could expect an invitation to interview onsite.

I didn't hear anything from the recruiter so I asked for a status update today and was sent a stock rejection letter about 15 minutes later. Was I being too persistent? Or did I just count my chickens before they hatched? Is it out of line to let my interviewer know what happened and see if he'll go to bat for me?"

1zicni,1,2014-03-04,Started new job last week and may now get the chance to interview for a better one. Jumping so quickly? Am I think this through correctly?,fuckugumby,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zicni/started_new_job_last_week_and_may_now_get_the/,"Quick background:

- I'm two years out of college and just changed careers
- I'd only had one job, which was my first one out of college. It was at a big name company.
- I did well at my last job. but unfortunately got laid off despite my performance being some of the best in the entire region. Couldn't help it because the company slashed the entire office in a cost-cutting move.
- Pay was on the low-end of entry-level for that job despite my quality work. Position also had no room for growth, hence the reason for my career change.

I was pretty bummed about getting laid off despite doing outstanding work. After getting laid off, I interviewed for a few months and then accepted a job offer in February. I just started last week. We'll call this Company A.

Company A info:

- It's a small company that's growing very quickly in my chosen field. To give you an idea, they already have a nice, big office downtown that they're outgrowing, so in a few months they'll be moving into an even bigger one a block over that's still under construction.
- This company is not a big name company like my first one was. However they may be recognizable if you follow the industry closely. They're popping up more and more often.

- The pay is entry-level again, and will only be $0-5000 more than my first job. Also, instead of having salary/benefits like at my first job, I'm basically an intern, getting paid hourly with no benefits. I'm told that we are guaranteed to be converted to salary/benefits as long as we gut out the first three months. The flipside of that is that they're training us pretty thoroughly.
- Conversations I'm having with people who have been there for a while indicate they are definitely good with promotions. So while I may not like the work now, there are some positions I'm eyeing that I may have a shot at in the future.
- Despite the current position not being great and getting worked hard already, I like my coworkers and the company seems to treat everybody very well. Definitely was not treated this nicely at my first job.

So prospects seem decent at this current job at Company A. I'm actually happy enough at the moment and if nothing else was going on, I'd be content to hang tight here. 

Well, I have a friend who works at Company B. Before I accepted the job offer at A, friend at B let me know that a position may be opening up within B that she could help me get. I give her my resume without thinking much of it and now I'm told that I'm going to get contacted by HR this week. 

Here's Company B's info:

- Huge company. Big name.
- Position at B is much closer to what I want to do compared to my current position at A.
- I've heard mixed things about how the company culture is, though they generally skew towards positive as opposed to negative. Generally any complaints sound like the ones that exist at any big company. Maybe tougher to move up?
- Starting salary is supposed to begin at least 20000 more than what it was at my first job and 15000-20000 more than what it could be once I become salaried at Company A. I'm also a salaried employee right away, with benefits.

Fortunately, I don't have to make a hard decision yet. I haven't been contacted by B's HR yet. She may not call me. Even if she does, it'll still take some time to interview and go through that process, so if I leave it'd be after a month or two or three instead of after a few weeks. Training for the position at Company B is not supposed to be until June.

Is it okay for me to think about switching given how much better the pay and position sounds at Company B, who is also one of the biggest companies around? Should I hang on to Company A because of its impressive growth-prospects and because I just started there? How would I even take time off from A to interview with B? Am I too preoccupied with pay after how low my salary was at the first job? I'd love your guys' input."

1zjfgm,981,2014-03-04,{C}remation.,nicmccool,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1zjfgm/cremation/,"I come from a small town where the only jobs for freshly graduated college kids stupid enough to return home are fast food and Walmart, so I practically peed myself when Anita called me out of the blue and offered me an internship. It’s not the most ideal job, and it’s something I have to lie about when I talk to other people or I get a lot of really stupid questions -- “Does it smell in there, Cassie?”, “Do you ever, *you know*, check out peoples’ wangs?”, “Are you scared?”-- but it’s a weekly paycheck and I have the chance to stay on after a year. 

First off, I’ve got two brothers so I’ve pretty much seen it all. Steven used to bring home deer and rabbits, and skin them right outside my bedroom window. Chad, he was normal, but he’d always show up with some freak injury that he’d be more than happy to shove in my face while I was trying to eat my Cap’n Crunch. I can safely say I was a already fairly morbid midwestern girl far before I started working at Reynolds Funeral Home. 

And secondly, you can’t just turn down an offer to work in a funeral home. Forget all the dead bodies stuff, being a mort tech is a *cushy* job. I mean, that’s why they always keep it in the family! I think I work about twenty total hours a week, get paid for forty, and spend all my free time in the upstairs lounge on one of the pastel rose couches reading my kindle and avoiding Centaur, Anita’s mastiff with a affinity for humping my hip. Plus, did I say I may get to stay on in a year? I mean, that’s like a *life* gig; the golden ticket and all those other corny cliches. So, when weird things happen in a mortuary you tend to ignore them, because the perks are good. 

That’s normal, right?

Okay, so a few days ago I got called in to prep two bodies; a mother and son poisoning, which as sad as it seems is a pretty big cash cow for funeral homes. We’ll take nice safe heart attacks and poisonings any day of the week over gun shots and car wrecks. There’s no physical reconstruction, maybe a little around the mouth if there happened to be a large amount of bile or resuscitation efforts, but it’s way better than trying to jigsaw puzzle somebody’s face back together. And as in any business two is always better than one. 

We’re a small funeral home, you could almost call us mom and pop, except Anita’s husband died a few weeks ago, so I guess we’re a mom and random girl business. We don’t have a whole lot of money for sub freezes and heavy duty storage like you see on tv with the stacked drawers and stuff. We’ve got one positive temp storage in the basement with an old Mopec table, and three gurneys for overflow. The door to storage is one of those big steel insulated ones that seals when it’s shut, so when you latch it down you can’t hear a thing on the other side. Which is why the noise really freaked me out. 

I was washing down the boy, he smelled like strawberries and stomach acid, and I was lost in thought about some teen romance I was reading when I heard a shuffling sound. I said the storage was sealed shut, right? Like, no sound? Because, that’s what I was used to and when I heard it, let’s just say I jumped *over* the table like I was an Olympic freakin’ high jumper. 

“What the fuck?!” I screamed. Not the most eloquent I admit, but it got the point across. “Anita, are you messing with me?”

She wasn’t, I mean, she never had in the past and she wasn’t the type to randomly prank an employee surrounded by dead bodies. She’s like a grown up Wednesday Addam’s, but with less personality. I scanned the room slowly, looking at the empty corners first, then counted all the tools on the instrument cart. One saw? Check. Two bone cutters? Check. Two flush retractors? Check. One really big pair of scissors? Nope. 

“Seriously?!” I screamed. It came out much louder than I was expecting in the small room and I raised my hands to block my ears. In my right hand the scissors came extremely close to stabbing me in the temple. “Oh,” I said to no one. I must have grabbed them off the cart when I hurdled the boy. 

*The boy*. 

I raised the scissors up in what I thought was an intimidating pose. “Don’t be moving. Don’t be moving. Don’t be moving…,” I chanted in my head; a prayer to a god or gods or whatever was enjoying this shit-show. “Please, please don’t be moving.” My eyes cut from the instrument table to the grossing station along one wall, to the sealed concrete floor that concaved into a drain under the table, and then up the table to two tiny feet that shone a waxy pink in the harsh overhead lights. The toes moved. “They didn’t move, Cassie. You just blinked.” I stared at them for thirty seconds, wanting them not to move, but somehow hoping they would. They didn’t and I traced up the rest of the body with my eyes. “Definitely dead,” I thought. 

And then something launched itself against the outside of the door. 

I screamed. Of course I screamed. I screamed so loud I looked over to see if the woman on the gurney would sit up and tell me to keep it down because she was trying to sleep. The scissors clanged to the floor. They weren’t just dropped, they were propelled against the steel door with all the force I, the person directly referenced in the insult “you throw like a girl” because I *am* that girl, could muster. I squatted down and covered my head, because I heard somewhere that’s what you do when everything goes freakin’ bonkers, and kept screaming. 

On my third pause for air I realized that everything was dead quiet again. “Dead quiet? Nice one, Cassie,” I thought and pulled myself up off the floor. My hands brushed the fingertips of the boy on the table and I was half tempted to either hold his hand for comfort or crouch back down and start screaming again until the Army, or Navy, or freakin’ Marines blasted through that door to rescue me. “Daddy was a Marine,” I thought. 

Fuck. 

What would my dad think of his only daughter, crouched on the floor of an over-sized refrigerator, scared of some random noises outside? The trembling in my arms slowed, my lip stopped quivering. “It’s probably just Anita moving in a new table,” I thought. “Or maybe they’re replacing the propane for the cremator.” The latter was probably true. We hadn’t gotten new propane in months, so we were due for a refill. “Just poke your head out, Cassie,” I said to myself and the two cold bodies behind me. “Just poke your head out and see.”

My fingers grasped the metal latch and pulled up. Stuck.

“Fuck this, I’m done,” I said as panic started to wash over me. And then, in some rational part of my brain my dad said, “Push down, Cassandra.” I was calm again. “Duh,” I thought and pushed the latch down. The door opened outward with a soft release of air. 

The basement of the funeral home goes the full length of the building, but the building itself is not that big, so when standing at the partially open door of cold storage and looking out one can see the big gaping metal mouth of the industrial furnace the house was built around forty years ago. Brickwork lines the outside of the furnace marred black from residual blow-back after years of “cooks”. A rack of rollers stand on metal stilts and angle into the furnace’s mouth like a long, silver ridged tongue. Today the rollers were empty, but the mouth was open. Fire licked up on the inside of the furnace casting the entire side of the building in a blue-red strobe. A black shadow inside the mouth twitched and thrashed in the flames.

Twitched and thrashed.

I thought I was blinking again, I thought my eyes were lying, so I stared. My head poking out from behind the clean steel door looking across floors grooved by years of gurneys into the wide mouth of a furnace where a black object morphed to ashes and twitched. I stared until the light from the flames hurt my eyes and left rose blooms of red on the backs of my lids when they were closed. I blinked out what I thought I saw, re-saw the image, and tried to blink it out again. “Definitely twitching,” I thought. “Maybe it’s just a cross-breeze coming down through the chimney -”

And then it screamed.

A howling painful yell ripped from the throat of whatever burned in that fire. A scream of seizure and ecstasy. A scream both primal and knowledgeable enough to know that this sound was the last imprint it would leave on the world. A scream that gurgled out with the boiling blood of its throat until nothing was left but the soft whimpering pleas of the remaining dust. 

I slammed the metal door behind me and latched it shut. I slid to the floor and tucked my head between my knees and covered my head. I stayed in that position for what seemed like hours but could have been minutes when the Marines finally came knocking at the door.

“Cassie?” the Marine who sounded an awful lot like Anita Reynolds said from outside the door. “Cassie are you almost done with the wash down?”

“Almost,” I found myself replying. “Almost. Give me another few minutes.” 

“Okay,” the voice said, and then it was gone. 

I found myself standing, picking the scissors up off the floor, and putting them back on the instrument table. I thumbed down the switch on the shower head. “That wasn’t really a scream,” I said to the dead in the room. “I mean, it was definitely *not* a scream, right?” I took their silence as affirmation. I went back to washing the boy and his mother and never mentioned what I saw or heard.

I consider myself a pretty decent problem solver as well as a programmer. The thing is, is that I have no experience programming in a professional environment. All the programming I've ever done ranges from ""Go read about depth and breadth first search and implement it on an adjacency matrix of a graph"" or ""sort a pair of students by birthday using merge sort"". I can code these problems up with enough research, caffeine, and a white board and If I need to implement something such as utilizing a particular class that I'm unaware of, a google search is only a few clicks away.

This semester I signed up for a course that I believe is more ""real world"". It teaches a lot of enterprise technologies such as MySQL, writing servers, PHP, creating GUI front ends with database back ends, etc I signed up for this to try to start programming something more than binary trees and quicksorts, although I do understand the importance of learning data structures and algorithms.

As I said previously, I feel competent enough to program in school, but since I've never programmed in a work environment, I have no idea what its like. 

Is it the same thing as read a spec, break down problems into subset of problems, hit the whiteboard, google the stuff you dont know, start typing away at the keyboard? I know this might seem vague, but I hope you know what I am trying to ask."

1. Doing UI development for a web based system interface, Java/JS/HTML/CSS

1zjtis,3,2014-03-04,Fitting in on a Team,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zjtis/fitting_in_on_a_team/,"Hi Everyone, 

So I’m a recent college graduation working for an up and coming international company.  (That’s really all I can say about it. Don’t want to identify the company) 

I’m looking for some advice on how to strengthen the relationships I have with my current superiors. I’ve been interning here for a few months and I just got an extension and a raise with the possibility of salaried employment. 

I am somewhat shy, but still very sociable. However, I struggle with low self-esteem and just generally being awkward. I’m also gay and my bosses (and most of my teammates) are straight men who are also all a good decade older than me. We don’t have much to relate on. I’m trying to find a way to show them that I respect them and to give them a reason to invest more interest in me and delegate more work. Any Dale Carnegie inspired tips are welcome. I don’t want to be obnoxious and go out of my way to socialize, but I don’t want to distance myself either.

A bit of backstory to my internship -After coming onto the team two of my superiors were fired and I was moved onto a different team. The one I was moved from was a subsidiary of the team that I am now on. My bosses, for the most part, are very nice and professional people. However, there have been some bumps in the road of transitioning onto this team since I wasn’t previously a member and just showed up out of the blue. 

So now, I’ve got two months left to make myself irreplaceable. This is a company that I really want to work for. Any advice just on how to carry myself, how to interact, what to do and what not to do? Again I’m a shy guy just out of college trying to fit in on a team of men in their 30s with little in common with me (at least on the surface).

I currently have two balances in collections, one of which is a large hospital bill that I have not been able to pay off.
  
I was in a bicycling accident about 3 years ago that resulted in about a ~20k debt, being uninsured. Some supplemental insurance covered about 10 of that, and I was left hanging with the other 10. I was not able to pay it off, so those 3 bills went to collections.
  
Two of those totaled to $1,000, which I have paid off, but the other $9,000 still remain. They want me to pay off the full $9,000 over 12 months which is impossible going to school full time, making only 600 a month, 400 of which I give to my parents each month to help with bills. They remain rigid on the 12 months, and thus, the bill is still in collections.

The other amount is for $72 which is a bill from a doctor that I had a health check with about 3 years ago, of which I only received notice about a year ago saying this was in collections. My mother paid this in cash when we went in, but they still claim that it remains unpaid.

I explained this to the gentleman who had called. I was wondering what role is this going to play in my offer for the internship? How big of a deal is this, or what can I do in order to help this situation? Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any comments/advice."

For about two quarters now I have been asking myself if Engineering is right for me. I always thought that I would love to major in any math or technological based field but I am having second thoughts. I am not sure if I am just studying the wrong way or if I am just not 'Busy' enough that I cannot get through everything. Thinking does not count as being busy by the way, that just makes matters worst. From being alive these two decades I have come to conclude that a body in motion does tend to stay in motion. Hence if I just study and study, there will be no motion to motivate me. The busy I am referring to is the kind that makes you forget about the stress that is waiting for you at the other end while maybe getting a taste of a social life. I have failed one class so far and after this quarter it will be three total. I am a very logical person and I know after having a couple F's in my transcript, an internship may seem nearly impossible. I thought about changing majors but I don't think that will solve anything. What I need is a good old friend to be able to talk to and vent all my sufferings to. Sadly, I realized that I have kicked most of my friends out of my life due to the time demand engineering classes have. I have attempted to form study groups, online study groups and even make Youtube videos to force myself to learn the material. My last attempt is to get a part time job and give myself another chance at being a hybrid student. The funny thing is, I had a job last quarter and I left it because I thought it was bringing me down but as I feared it was helping me get through all the horrible thoughts that school accompanies. I should be studying for a midterm I am going to have in a couple days but I have lost hope to be honest. I just gave up in that class after getting a 35% on my first midterm. In addition to that, I got a 32% on my other midterm leaving me with two F's and one B this quarter. I haven't even talked to my counselor which is going to be very embarrassing. I know engineering is for me but I question myself over and over again since I am not doing so good in my grades. I had a plan be to go into Computer Science given I have already taken several Java, C++, and Python courses and I enjoy doing the homework assignments but again, that was the case with math and physics a the community college level. Now that I am taking upper division courses I feel like the subject just lacks my interest. It's all theory and disconnected from what I am used to. We do have labs but they are strictly limited and lack room for creativity. I think I may have gone to the wrong University since I am not doing the hands-on part of what I like to do. I will continue to try my best and hopefully not get kicked from the major. I will be on probation this next Spring quarter so the pressure will be on. I just hope that I can make it out alive and one day become an electrical engineer for Tesla Motors."

I can figure out just about anything I put my mind to. I can quickly and easily learn languages and figure out how to solve most problems I come across.

Except theory stuff. Algorithms. Proofs. Recurrence relations. Automata. Random bullshit that isn't used much outside of academia (at least, my experiences from internships I've had). 

I can figure out how to implement an algorithm, but when it comes to figuring out how to formally prove anything, I'm totally lost. Today I got a homework back where the grader counted off for not having enough information on one problem and too much for another.

I don't care much about ""doing science"" in the actual sense (not the internet-culture ""I Fucking Love Science"" way). Once I have something working, I don't want to write a proof on why/how it work. IF I have time, I might try to improve my implementation, but that's not ""science""; at best it's engineering (at worst, ""dicking around"")

My question is: What is the best source for learning this stuff? I have always gotten very little from classes and have to research on my own to ""get it"" (youtube, stackoverflow, etc). This method works just fine for writing code for an assignment, but has been less than fruitful for figuring out recurrence relation and such.

TLDR: academia shit confuses me, how do I learn it?

First was when I was at the career fair, the recruiter was talking about how they are looking for interns because they are practically ""slave labor"". Next when I was being interviewed I asked about what I would be doing, she more or less told me ""you will be doing things around here that we don't want to do"". Next another thing they told me was that sometimes I will be doing system administration stuff like installing some software on computers and what not. They didn't say it was the main gig, but she did mention it. Other than that they were really nice. I know the things I say make it sound like they were evil, truth is I just think its a person who has no filter, as they seemed pretty polite otherwise.

Should I take this internship? Its a cool product that I am very intrigued, but some of the red flags, combined with the shit pay, and the fact that I make $15+ an hour as a waiter is making me think twice. I would have to work 45 hours a week, 20 at the internship and 25 as a waiter. This is so many hours a week, but I have no experience and have interviewed with 5 other companies and this was the only one to extend me an offer and I believe having experience is more important in the long run is what this sub preaches to students.

What do you guys think. I feel like responding and saying I need more money so I can quit my other job, but I don't know. "
1zlv7w,35,2014-03-05,[Rant/Discussion] Self-teaching into employment is bullshit (mostly?),iMightNeedHalp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zlv7w/rantdiscussion_selfteaching_into_employment_is/,"Many of you are here because you take the field seriously and want to give good advice. That's awesome, and I applaud that. Software engineering and computer science are hard fields and should be a hard fields, and it's only going to get more complex as time marches on.

I've been messing with programming in general for about a year and a half. Like most who start out as self-taught, I followed a standard template of picking up a language from a cute ""Teach yourself X"" site or book, doing some stuff with it, pushing it to github, making some more stuff, making dumb mistakes, missing semicolons, and other general newbie crap. My stuff is crap, I realize it's crap, and everyone here has gone through the same feeling that all you make or ever will make is crap, crap, crap. It's a boot to your head in precise intervals.

So what's next? You put some things out that accomplish a function at least. You put the lotion on the website and make it look pretty or something. You push your limits and pick up a lot of stuff that isn't in those ""Teach yourself X"" courses. You've left the 'newbie island' for the ""free-for-all PvP island"" in this MMORPG. My plan was to wade through this crap, fix my math deficit at some point, then go tackle algorithms and data structures, which seems to be the benchmark 5K runner's marathon for newbie programmers. Eventually you put out some stuff that resembles a real, useful product. After accomplishing that, then I thought I might get a job. I accepted this and it's still very interesting to read and think about algos and DS. 

For some languages, there are books that have a similar function, flow, and reader involvement as the ""Teach yourself X"" stuff: just at an intermediate to advanced level. Most of these intermediate books read more like a reference. Like the standard library references. The references that are available online and sometimes have better writing than the books and are more up-to-date. For free. That makes these books useless. Maybe I should be writing useless books for money? Not much guidance from these books.

My plan was to get good. I wanted to be given a problem and have an off-the-cuff approach with napkin math *and* the ability to go research that problem properly *and* establish design requirements *and* come back with a badass presentation that was clean and professional. I wanted to consume basic $language programming, advanced $language programming, advanced-advanced $language programming, Code Complete, SICP, Mythical Man Month, all of those well known books, and finally, the holy texts of Knuth himself. Can you guess which of these I've read recently?

**So what's the core of this rant?** The gulf between the basics and employ-ability is large, strange, and filled with guesses and hit-or-miss advice. I'd be fine with a difficult bridge to cross, as long as there was a bridge. There really doesn't seem to be a bridge, or at least a consistent one.

This is not what I signed up for. I have a practical problem in that my job sucks. Programming was going to lift me out of a terrible job and a poorly chosen degree. ""Hah!"" said the software industry veteran. Even a measly position doing the most mundane of things would have been welcomed. 

You don't read about this on ""Teach yourself X"" sites. It's not their place because a bleak outlook could potentially hurt page views. They also aren't necessarily targeting career-changers because a bit of Python magic is useful to non-programmers. Even after I would have built practical stuff with the algos and DS's I intended to learn, it would still be tough to get a job according to the posts I was reading. They say this path is hard and they're right, but they aren't specific. This bothers the shit out of me. I don't know if I'm being helpful by pointing this out, but I know something stinks about the whole situation, and you seem to step knee-deep in it shortly after you get done with ""Teach yourself X"". It feels like a swamp full of crappy code.

The idea of self-teaching to employment is deceptive. I think it might be slowly fading out because now more business-leaders and decision-makers are aware of CS and programming as a science instead of a mystical skill. It was once a great path for people who grew up with tech. You can't be that ""computer whiz"" who fixes ""the gadgets"" and suddenly get $20/hr because the manager thinks your skills will look good in his business menagerie. That was the era I grew up in, and like missing out on cheap bitcoins, I missed a potential life-changer by not sticking with a tech career path. I chose health and found out I hated that.

However, picking a CS school that's behind-the-times can also potentially lead you into unemployment and debt. Maybe not, because apparently those graduates are getting hired anyway. The only saving grace is usually an internship, but betting your future on the success of an internship still seems like a hail-mary to me. A hail-mary not unlike trying to become employed through self-teaching. 

I'm still perplexed though, because according to some of you, even CS grads can't write good code. I don't hear much about the self-taught applicant code quality. I do hear that some self-taught guys are better than CS grads, and vice-versa. Is the frequency of terrible code production between these two similar? Do you get self-taught people at your door that have no business even applying to janitorial positions, just like you might get CS grads who can't comprehend Fizzbuzz (never mind write it)?

**Finally**, getting to employment through self-teaching is painful and leaves you utterly lost. You constantly wonder if it's worth wading through that swamp of crap that is your slowly improving code. You do slowly get better -- even respectable or clever -- but they will continue to push for CS grads during the hiring process. Save for the blessed few that are mathematically brilliant, who start young, or know someone willing to hand them a job based on faith, this path seems foolish to start."
1zlx1q,0,2014-03-05,I don't get it why am I fucked with student debt,What_Is_Love69,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/1zlx1q/i_dont_get_it_why_am_i_fucked_with_student_debt/,"I just don't get it. I don't deserve this. I just tried to be as good of a person as I could be and now I feel really bad for my parents that their child has no choice but to become bankrupt and have the bank seize their house and live a live of despair, never being able to reproduce and ending the family line as a loser.

I don't blame my dad for not being able to contribute any money towards my tuition although his income level barres me from receiving better financial aid. He spends his entire paycheck on the mortgage and credit card debt and I personally watched that the credit card debt which cripples him was created from groceries, clothes, gas, and in general things that supported our family. 

I never felt entitled to a nice life. I understood as a child that living in a single family house was a luxury, fast food was an occasional treat, and by no means is brand name clothing okay to pay more for. It was quite a strange process the first time my dad would buy me candy I wanted on the grocery line or get me mcdonalds on the way home because I was hungry and wanted it. I am really grateful for our family being poor in nyc at first and progressing to a very comfortable life in a central jersey suburb. Then at some point, although very luckily never losing his job throughout the recession, my dad fucked up with credit cards and stuff and by the time college came around had no savings or monthly earnings to contribute. You can't really blame parents anyway as many other parents out there do save sizable sums for their kids educations but are dumbfounded by how much tuition has raised since they went to college once it comes time to pay. No I was always ok with living my days in a struggle and being poor. But I guess I imagined the poor life I was ok with as a simple one (small apartment, carpooling with wife, living by immigrant values: my kids will know and respect the word ""no"", and doing the best we can to laugh and love). The future I see now is somehow different in that if I am lucky and get a high paying job I will still pay $950 a month to the loan which will prevent me from ever accumulating savings or avoid stress. 

Yes the topic of stress. I have come to accept it as an unavoidable element of our paradigm. I do one of the ""hardest"" and thus most respectable majors here at rutgers which is a fuckload of stress. All my peers are stressed, whatever everyone's stressed including you reading this. So all I have to say about that is that college is preparing us to be stressed out and have no time for human connection which is what being poor is like. 

I am extremely resentful towards two groups of people: one's whose parents are paying for college. 

And here is the second group I am resentful towards, and really this is what I came here to say to see if anyone feels the same way I do about this: Low income students and the fact that they get GRANTS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE PAYED BACK and WORK STUDY POSITIONS that I am barred from by virtue of being poor. And a lot of these kids were cool in high school and got to have sex and party a lot and I didn't get to do shit and now they get to have better adult lives than me too :'(.

Fuck. I'll reveal I'm a junior now and I am extremely grateful that I am on track for graduating and haven't messed up with grades too bad and have to take out more loans to study more semesters like oh so many more unfortunate people I know. Last year was the first time I really started thinking about what $95,000 in loans will mean once I graduate (And granted I dormed my first year and have been commuting since which really fucks my social life/happiness over) and I had never become so mentally derailed in my life before. It's wierd because nobody as a sophmore could think ahead like I was and that drove me even more crazy cause everyone was in denial that they will get a job and make a good salary. During my month-long lapse into being mentally broken due to the inability to handle the magnitude of the situation I was in my heart beat fast almost all the time, I experienced insomnia and panic attacks for the first time, and in general I had never felt so in danger and unsafe ever in my life before. Luckily as soon as school ended my mom was helpful enough to get me professional help and that summer of taking SSRI's and taking to a therapist while having a more relaxed schedule actually calmed me down over time. Now I will turn 21 soon and although I anticipate drinking a lot I am not looking forward to not having access to professional help due to being retired from health insurance. The dumbest part of the whole episode was that NO ONE from my therapist, to my professors, to people working at suicide hotlines, to my peers, to my parents (they just interpreted me bringing it up ever as making them feel guilty), to my friends understood the grave danger I was in and many of them are in too. 

It doesn't matter whether you are engineering or whatever the fuck, your chances of getting a job are desperately low and any job you do get will have a much lower salary that you can hope for and much less benefits than your parents jobs as well. Even pharmacy majors aren't guaranteed a job anymore as much as the schools limit enrollment. The pharmacy school must raise the number of seats somewhat in order to raise tuition money to pay costs and they have no control over the number of positions in retail pharmacy going down as people don't retire and new places don't open up. And don't get me started about pre-med and med school and not being able to get a residency and law school. My heart really goes out to the Biomedical engineering pre-med's because not only will you not get into med school but you are training for a profession that doesn't exist! So the perfect plan of having a backup good job in case you don't get into med school that your teachers, parents, family friends and peers all sold to you IS A LIE.

I haven't given away my major but basically it is one of the hardest STEM ones. I once met this girl who is a dance major. WTF? So to be a dance major does that mean you are either from a poor family and got all grants or from a rich family who doesn't give a fuck and will pay for that? I will shed a tear for whoever is taking out exorbitant loans for a humanities or performance art. Hell even people who take out loans for majors kinda in the middle like public health are fucked with your only option being unpaid volunteering for senior homes and township health departments. You guys will have such a terrible time ahead not being able to find husbands that will accept your debt. (Am I being sexist? Idk but public health is %95 females right?)

Which brings me to what is making me pretty sad. Someday I will fall in love with a girl, I will want to take care of her, make her happy and give my life to her and have kids with her BUT her parents WILL NOT allow her to marry me because of all the debt I have to my name and my lack of savings and financial stability. Hell I kind of love a girl right now and as much self control I have not to marry her young because that is stupid for a bunch of reasons it really hurts me that if I want to, If I really really want to, I can't say fuck the status quo and parental expectations and societal norms and run away and be with this girl because I am already owned by a banker.

I don't see this story ending in any other way than suicide and basically all I can really see as a priority in my life is enjoying youth. If anything that is the ultimate mistake most people regret in their life right? So I am hell bent on having as much sex and getting as much fucked up as possible senior year because nothing really makes sense to me other than that youth is fleeting and I must enjoy it cause that's the only way to win in this stupid life. I know in any case having a job at graduation versus not will be better and thus I have slaved  over the internship search. It is brutal. I spend almost 2-3 hours everyday in one form or another applying and networking for internships. And I am so scared I won't get one and it will really seal the deal of me being destitute my entire life. In fact I am even going to another school for a career fair tomorrow but writing this rant has kept me up very late and I still have to research and take notes on the companies I will talk to. Oh well; this life is turning out to be quite the roller coaster ride of crazy hard classes, impossible money situations, and contact with people who get 4.0 gpa's (and are president for clubs and make a lot of money and do a lot of drugs) who keep me inspired and I am no stranger to being tired. (Man I really wish I could just be some kid who got a presidential scholarship and get a 4.0 every semester and just smoke a lot of weed. That would be the life)

What's nice about rutgers is somehow I don't feel like i'm the only one. Tbh it's really great how well I fit in here with being a stressed out, second generation immigrant, slighly above average intelligence,  middle class surburban, athiest, generally kind of a nice person. I feel like all the struggles ive mentioned I can find people to relate to here. And other schools ive visited friends at that are ""higher ranked"" and ""more prestigious"" are full of some socially awkward ass people as well as some pretentious rich people as well. And some of the ""lower ranked"" schools i've experienced are full of people of a way lower average IQ than Rutgers new brunswick which I missed a lot. But then again I am jealous of the people that go there because they are poor and get pell grants and don't have to worry about the debt issue I'm having. (Oh god did I say poor and stupid are correlated? I really need to stop. I have an internal conflict about whether it is OK to hate poor people)

Thank you. Good night Rutgers. Please let me know if you can relate."

Given that I'm learning an assortment of topics as a student, such as web, mobile, and architectural concepts, I find it hard to choose a path. I enjoy everything,  but I can't seem to master anything specifically. 

One of my questions: should I choose my path or continue exploring? I'm learning AngularJS,  with the intention to learn some back-end library to complete the link between the two.

This is gonna be a bit longer. So, bear with me.

**My Background:** I have a computer science degree from one of the top 10 schools in the world. I'd realized that coding/geeking/tweaking wasn't gonna be my cup of tea around the end of the 3rd year but by that time I was too deep into my degree that switching wasn't an option. So, I carried through with some courses which were more non-technical in nature. 

**My Experience**: I have a year and half internship experience before graduation which was your run-of-the-mill Enterprise Software development in a small firm. And after graduation I have been doing Test Development (QA) for a mid size corporation. I have also started taking Project Management classes and will hopefully write PMP sooner or later.

**My Problem:** I understand that getting that tag of QA on your resume does more harm than it helps. I have been applying to a lot of places and from couple of places I have also gotten phone interviews.  So, at this point I think it may not be my resume but my phone interview skills. 

**My Question:** If I want to work as a Technical/IT/Product Consultant what are the steps/things I am missing at present? What do I need to do if I am not missing anything so far?

I have never lived on my own so I am really excited!  I have gotten into a few universities but have narrowed it down to two, mainly because these are the cheapest.  I can't decide which to pick. 


****University of Pittsburgh****

Positives
1. it's in Pittsburgh, which is a great city!
2. it's well ranked. 63 on US News. 
3. they accepted all of my credits and I would only need to take 3-4 classes once I get there to complete my general education requirements.
4. i'm sure i could get some solid internships in the city

Negatives
1. transfers don't get on campus housing and i'd have to get an apartment
2. it's $17,000 a year for a PUBLIC school for tuition alone and they don't offer transfer scholarships
3. the large class sizes are something i'm concerned with especially because I want to get a good gpa because I plan on going to law school
4. i have heard that Pitt is a little grade deflated.  I am more than willing to work hard but I really want to keep up my 3.8+ gpa for grad school.



****University of Tampa****

Positives
1. It's in sunny Florida! I really would like to live somewhere warm for a change.  Also, it's in the best area of Tampa.
2. I was accepted to the honors college which has a cool opportunity for a few students to go to Oxford each semester along with other perks.
3. I got an $8,000 a year merit scholarship making the tuition $17,000.  This is the same as Pitt.
4. I can live on campus.
5. I could probably get a better gpa due to honors college small class sizes and it being a less competitive environment. 

Negatives
1. It is kind of far from home. 15 hour drive. 
2. MY MAIN CONCERN: it's not nearly as well-known or ranked as Pitt.  I actually only applied because they emailed me a fee waiver since I'm in Phi Theta Kappa.  I am DEFINITELY doing grad school afterwards and really want to go to a top 10 law school so I don't know how much my undergrad this will affect it.  3. The price is also a negative, it's still kind of expensive but the same price as my state school.


I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO! If Tampa was as well ranked as Pitt I'm 99.5% sure I'd go there.  But the fact that Tampa is such a regional school really concerns me that it's a waste of money if I could just go to Pitt.

Do any of you have any suggestions or advice?

What are my chances?,ClassicMilds,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zngq1/terrible_gpa_in_nondegree_required_classes_and_i/,"Hi, I am a junior at a reputable state university. I took a lot of not-required-whatsoever classes before I decided to be a CS major and had terrible grades.I have a terrible GPA and by graduation I think I will end up with a 2.6-2.7 GPA. However in the 39 odd classes I need for BS Computer Science I have 3.5 GPA Is there any way I can write this better on my resume since I think good companies do like to know GPAs. I have good grades in my core classes and specially in my last 50 credits I have over 3.6. I have interest in system dev, computer security, or software dev if I cannot get masters at a good university. I did great my freshmen year but I lost interest in college because it felt like relearning highschool. I could barely afford college so I left it before I realise there are things in the Computer Science coursework that would be fun to learn in a class and I want to work in a good company. I was trying to really figure out what to do with life till then. I have been coding since I was very young as that was my hobby and I wanted to challenge myself and learn more by taking other classes.  I understood the concepts but I had no passion for most of them. So I came back to Computer Science and it has been very fun and I managed to get my classes finished for the most part. I love coding the most so I would love to work in this field. I cant afford to stay out of college unemployed for a month since I have lots of student loans and private loans so I will try to start job application right after my summer internship (which I hope I get an answer for soon). 

I wanted to know that are my chances of getting a job at a company leading in the computer science field? Would i even be eligible for interviews with sub 3.0 GPA?

What can I do more to have a chance if I am screwed? 

extra:
I have dont plently of extra stuff like solving lots of projecteuler, pythonchallenges, check-io, etc. recently I have made sample websites for fantasy football, some win C# apps, I love functional programming and passionately trying to learn more and more each day. I absolutely would love to study at a place where CS is amazing but I know I have bad GPA. I love reading books, and coding for fun more than working for school and I think that has come back to bite me. "

What happened with academia though? I’m curious what you think of academia, and why it wasn’t for you. I know you can’t read the minds of your readers and editors, but do you think a doctorate helped get you established in the early days? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7gw8?context=5)|Oh boy. Well. It wasn't me that rejected academia but academia that rejected me: I finished my Ph.D., went out on the job market for several years running, and never got offered a university job. At the time I thought this was a sign of the injustice of the hiring system in the humanities (which is, in fact, screwed six ways from Sunday) but looking back I am sure there were candidates for those jobs who felt more sure about their profession. I never loved teaching--I wanted to love it because I revere great teachers, but I'm only an OK one. So when my writing started taking off (i.e. going from blogging 1x/week at the High Sign to actually gettin' paid, initially as a TV critic at Slate) I wasn't too sad to leave academia behind, though I miss some things about it. There are a few critics who have had a similar trajectory education-wise: A.O. Scott and Virginia Heffernan both either have or went a long way towards getting lit Ph.Ds. I know I wouldn't be the writer and thinker I am if I hadn't had those years at Berkeley. They were incredibly formative.
[Does Stephen Metcalf refuse to read advertisements on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7gbo?context=5)|To refuse he would have had to have been asked. I think Julia and I just started doing them because he had enough on his plate hosting the show, introducing guests, doing transitions etc., and that became the norm. But at some point in my life I want to hear him reading that copy about Neanderthals and cilantro.
[The Adam Kempenaar scenario: aliens land and will erase every single copy of every film ever made - except one. And you get to choose which one survives. What's your pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7h0k?context=5)|So this would need to be a movie that contains strong enough cinematic DNA to allow a future alternate movie history to spring from its preservation--I think for the sake of humanity you have to pick Citizen Kane, The Wizard of Oz or Buster Keaton's The General. Preferably a mutant clone movie incorporating elements of all three.
[Aside from being one of my favorite critics you're also among the coolest users of Twitter I know, and not just because you share interesting thoughts and links but especially because you take time to interact with and respond to people, more than any other person with a 5-digit number of followers I know. Is that something you actively seek out to do or does it just occur naturally? And is Twitter something that is always on (in a separate tab or on your phone\) or do you only check up on it when you're taking a break from working?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7hso?context=5)|Ach Twitter. My temptation, my enemy. I spend way too much time there and yet I have trouble dismissing it as simply a distraction, because I've gotten so much out of being on there for the last 5 years: made real friends, found out about countless interesting things I would otherwise never have seen, LOL'd a million times. I periodically get disgusted with Twitter for a day or two (and try not to use it much if at all on the weekends.) But it feels integral to both my work and personal life (and yes, I'm embarrassed to say, the Twitter window is always up, sometimes multiple windows.) As for responding to people, I love doing that when I'm on Twitter just hanging out. But I don't go back and try to answer every @-reply, because that would reach a volume that would start to make Twitter feel un-fun and un-free.
[We’re 4 (some would argue 5\) years into a new decade – what would you say is the best movie that’s been released so far?  P.S. Big fan of The Spoiler Special, Gabfest and The Movie Club. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7gp3?context=5)|Oh wow, best movie released since 2010? I'm so not a list maker, and choosing just one is sort of the ultimate list. But off the top of my head I'm going to go with Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master.
[What's your favorite non-Slate podcast? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7jc2?context=5)|Sometimes Filmspotting, sometimes BBC's Start the Week, sometimes On Being with Krista Tippett, depending on the topics and guest and circumstances of listening. But the one podcast I never miss actually is on Slate--the political gabfest. It's the way I compensate for feeling perpetually behind in current events during the week--just wait till Friday and Plotz, Dickerson and Bazelon will explain all.
[What do you think of major film awards like the oscars and golden globes? Do you think enough recognition is given to smaller/independent films?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7i14?context=5)|Ugh, this is the wrong time of year to ask me that question. I, like every critic I hope, am so awards-seasoned out right now that I just want to sit on a mountaintop for six months and contemplate a Buddha statue. Or maybe Keanu Reaves in Little Buddha.

But I have thought about this: Maybe there should be an ensemble cast award? Or a 2nd best score category that would include some use of pre-existing music as well as new? A lot of the best scores don't get considered now because of those rules.

No, I will definitely not be doing that. But I would not be surprised if he was the single most fragrant member of the Gabfest.

Which Pixar films missed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7ke1?context=5)|Notes in the Dark! That's the title for my biopic, guy who asked below. Yes, I do scribble stuff in the dark though I rarely look at it later &amp; would prob not be able to read it if I did.
 |Golden Age--I don't know what we're saying that is, but some of my favorite classic filmmakers are Buster Keaton, Fritz Lang, Preston Sturges, Douglas Sirk, Nicholas Ray, Billy Wilder--the usual suspects, I guess.
 |I think I've seen every Pixar movie except A Bug's Life, which I never got around to because nobody seems to love it.
[What other movie critics do you read? Are there any up-and-coming critics that you particularly like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7idq?context=5)|I never read anyone before writing mine, like most critics I imagine--fear of unconscious influence. After I've filed, especially if it's a movie that there's a sharp divide or controversy about, I sometimes check in w/ my regulars, who I guess would be: A.O. Scott &amp; Manohla, David Edelstein &amp; Bilge Ebiri at New York, Wesley Morris at Grantland, Stephanie Zacharek at the Voice, Andrew O'Hehir at Salon. (As for up-and-comers, Nathan Heller, of Vogue &amp; the New Yorker, is a heller.) But other times after I write on a movie--even if I liked it--I'm just done with it, &amp; I can't bring myself to use my limited time and energy to care about it any further.
[Pancakes or waffles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7g5i?context=5)|French toast. Though I do love a good thin Swedish-style pancake too.

[Also - what's been your biggest challenge as a female journalist and movie critic? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7l6h?context=5)|3) I'm doing a panel on women in film criticism this Saturday at NYU and wondering how to answer that very question. The truth off the top of my head is that I have not found it to be an impediment, and there's obviously a long tradition of women being well represented in film criticism as compared to other careers (for example, filmmaking.) I do find being a parent and a film critic to be tough sometimes--a lot of tight deadlines, a lot of nights away from home. But I don't see how that would be different for a male critic if he was really pitching in as a parent, which most fathers I know are.
[I love how well-read all three hosts of the Culture-fest are.  With two former humanities grad students and one J-school'er among you, I love the literary insight that each brings to the table.  That said, I find the culture of literacy seems to be waning.  Is this in our collective minds, or do you think people in general are reading less than they used to?  Am I grasping for the 'good old days' that were never there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7mwl?context=5)|Thanks for your nice words. I know I read way less now that I ever have in my life, like 15 minutes a day instead of hours--but then again, I now have a child and a full-time job, as opposed to being a grad student whose job was to read, so I'm not sure how much I can attribute to The Way We Live Now as opposed to simply life.
[Who should play you in the Dana Stevens biopic, and what would it be called?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7jcc?context=5)|Someone once told me Naomi Watts should play me in a movie and I ascended to heaven on wings of angels. I think I am more of a... I don't know...Jennifer Jason Leigh? But 20% less crazy? I don't have a title either. How about The Scribblin' Samurai?
[As Metcalf would put it, hello Danaaa!  At what point in your grad school career did you decide to move into film criticism? Which is to say, at what point did you turned away from academia?  Former academic-in-training asking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7j7z?context=5)|I answered something like this below--scroll down.

Original citrus, black cherry citrus, or peach citrus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7onh?context=5)|Is my Fresca fellowship dependent on this answer? Black cherry. No, Peach! Peach! Shit.
[Is the job of a critic really the way we think it is? Do you really watch movies for a living? What is the complex part behind that stuff? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv93wh?context=5)|Clearly you are a greater writer than I, because you thought of the Reddit screen name ""Osama-bin-chillin."" I am not being even slightly facetious here.
[Now, movies:  What's your view on why ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" got no Academy Awards love?  I've seen all the nominees except ""12 Years a Slave,"" and so not having seen the winner, I can't say ILD should have won, but I can say with confidence that it should have been nominated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7nv3?context=5)|As for Llewyn Davis, that is clearly not Oscar material--way too small, too subtle, too good. But there's a line from Hamlet that comes to mind whenever people talk about awards in terms of what ""deserved"" to win: ""Use every man after his dessert, and who shall 'scape whipping?""
[I love Stephen, I do, but sometimes he drops $10, $20, and even $50 words when you know that a $1 word will do. I roll my eyes in protest. Have you ever had the same reaction, and when?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfva422?context=5)|You know, I always wanted to do that genetic test just to find out about the Neanderthal thing! I'm always fascinated by the science of early man and the speculation about what roles Neanderthals played in the lives of Homo sapiens. I would enjoy picturing my cave-ancestors by the fireside as much as the next podcast host--but those tests cost $100!
[Also, have you ever sent your DNA in, and if so, what percentage of Neanderthal are you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfva422?context=5)|Oh and about Stephen's vocab: take it up with him! I am sometimes guilty of using fancy words on the podcast as well. It's just nice to have a safe space where you can drop a ""chthonic"" or what have you.
[Dante Stephens, How do feel about aggregate review sites (metacritic, rottentomatoes\)? Do you think they help or hurt film criticism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7l8b?context=5)|I don't see how they would hurt--they just organize data. I use them a lot just to find out stats about a new movie, or remind myself how something went over in the past. Obviously if you start choosing your movie based solely on Tomatometer averages you're overly in thrall to data, but it's a place to go find work by critics you might be interested to read. Overall I am pro-Tomato.
[I'm regular listener of the gabfest, may be even a fan :\) do you think you and Julia ganged up on David a bit too often? OK, j/k. I know you and David, especially David aren't big fans of long-form story telling (TV dramas, TV series\), so why do you even review them at all if you've only watched a couple episodes and didn't give them a far whack? Case in point, wouldn't it be better to review True detective after you've seen the whole season rather than just the pilot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv86rx?context=5)|I think you mean Steve, who is the David Plotz of the Culturefest! We always go back and forth over whether to do TV shows near the beginning or further on. Had we known that True Detective would catch on the way it did, we might have waited and talked about it more toward the end. But realistically, we are not all three going to be able to watch eight hours of TV to prep for one 10-minute segment of the show, so we try to slice off a manageable amount to talk about. 
[Who's your most underated director/film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv7pgi?context=5)|Mind a blank, mind a blank ... well, of people currently working, I think Todd Haynes is an amazing director who people don't talk about/revisit enough. Nicole Holofcener gets praise from critics, but not the size audience she deserves. And among classic filmmakers, Max Ophuls is every bit as original and brilliant as, say, Orson Welles, but because he has a small filmography and worked in ""women's"" genres, he doesn't get remembered as often.
[Which is your favorite Pessoan heteronym?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv9kax?context=5)|Great question. Probably the one whose poetry I know &amp; love the best is either Alvaro de Campos, in his Whitman mode, or Fernando Pessoa ""himself."" But the book that first made me fall for Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet, is by the semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares.
[What do you think is the most overlooked piece of cinema since the turn of the Century? In my opinion it's The Assassination Of Jesse James etc etc. I think it's a masterpiece.

That movie has great cinematography but it never quite cohered for me as storytelling--Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck were good, but it was a bit too self-conscious in its myth making &amp; the script just didn't knock me out. 4 Months 3 Weeks though...that's in the 21st century pantheon so far for me.
[I was curious about your thoughts on the ""Act of Killing."" I thought it was incredible and was disappointed that it did not win the Oscar. Were you surprised at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv85ln?context=5)|Nah, The Act of Killing is absolutely brilliant but not the kind of doc that would win an Oscar.

No, I haven't seen it, but I kind of want to . From what I've seen of his work it's more closely related to art installation than narrative film--but the guy can create unforgettable dreamlike images, even if you're not sure what the aggregation of them is supposed to mean.
[Hey Dana! A while back I submitted a track to the summer strut fest that actually made it to the air (Tiny Spark - Brendan Benson\). I haven't had any luck with recent submissions.

It could take a long time before you're making a living at it. But if you really have to pursue it, do, and God be with you!
[You bring a cool philosophical and intellectual angle to your criticism that I find pretty unique. Do you find that you filter your critiques through any specific philosophical concepts?

I read philosophy and literary theory in grad school along w/ a lot of literature, and got tons out of some of it--but I'm not consciously writing from the POV of any school of thought or criticism.
[Why did you pick The High Sign for your Twitter name?  P.S. I enjoy the Spoiler Specials!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1znian/i_am_dana_stevens_slates_film_critic_and_culture/cfv8ve4?context=5)|Thanks! It's the title of a Buster Keaton comedy short, and also the phrase for a secret hand sign used between members of a group (like the Masons or something.) So to give someone ""the high sign"" is to exchange a gesture with a meaning that no one else in the room is privy to. It was the name of my old movie blog and since Twitter is the closest thing I do to blogging anymore, I imported that identity...
[In the 48 hours after John Travolta accidentally mispronounced someone's name at the Oscars, the @slate twitter account tweeted references to its ""Travoltafied"" bot over 200 times.

[Dana, you've mentioned a few times on the SCG that you speak Portuguese.

Then I ended up studying in Rio, learning the language well enough to teach beginners (which I did through most of the rest of grad school), and writing my dissertation on a Portuguese poet (Fernando Pessoa, of course.) So I speak with a Brazilian accent but have spent some time in Lisbon too.

I also loved Sam Anderson when we had him on for his piece on stupid phone games. He fit in so well with the three of us, I felt like we could have adopted him as a 4th gabber that very day.

1znwij,13,2014-03-05,I've reached the end,Mr_Alex19,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1znwij/ive_reached_the_end/,"I was the first person in my family to ever graduate from high school. Neither of my parents ever received an education, because they grew up as poor farming peasants in Mexico. They raised me, but I was never given any instruments to play, nor was I ever placed in any sports, or any drama classes or self-defense classes or classes that bred hobbies or taught any skills that would have made me even somewhat of an interesting person. I don't come from money or a background that values education or ambition. I realized, way too late into my life, that I missed out on a proper childhood. I spent my summers and free time at home watching TV and playing video games rather than going to camps or discovering an intellectual interest or participating in sports programs or engaging in any social activity. 

I've been diagnosed with a mild form of autism, and have also been diagnosed with intense general anxiety. Even if I try to connect with others, I can't. I'm just too different. Not even with my family do I feel a close attachment.

Somehow, I excelled in school and through divine intervention I attended a top private liberal arts college. I thought the world would be my oyster, but I'm not cut out for the world. I offer nothing and don't have the social skillset or any of the artistic or academic talents to mesh with any of the school clubs or its members. I was ill suited for higher society, but now I'm too educated and too ambitious to go back from where I came from.
Everyone around me is being elected to leadership positions and attending conferences and earning internships to elite corporations and organizations, and I struggle just to keep up academically.

I used to try so hard to fight. I saw myself as an isolated fighter who had to navigate the cruel, difficult world on my own. I sacrificed my health to push myself, give it all I had. But even when I put twice the effort as everyone else, I still finish behind everyone. I kept trying and fighting. I refused to go down. I needed to believe that I was worth something and needed to prove to myself that I was capable of doing something worthwhile. For everytime I faltered, I pushed and fought harder, but I still failed.

Now I've reached my limit. I'm not meant for this world. I had nothing and I still have nothing. I'm just a freak to everyone. I tried, and I gave everything to my cause, but it was all in vain. I guess I'm just some nervous, autistic low life who can barely do anything right. I'm tired of fighting by myself. I'm tired. I hate myself, and I hate my thoughts. I can't do it anymore. I just want to rest forever. I wish there was a heaven, because I don't want to be here anymore. 20 years, and nothing to my name. I'm tired of fighting, I just want to rest easy and sleep away the rest if eternity. I've never said this before, but it feels good to finally get this out of me. Now I can rest easy. "

One of our executives is trying to map network drives after establishing a VPN tunnel to our office network using Net Extender. Our network is using a SonicWall TZ 205. The VPN works to the extent that the executive can use Remote Desktop to access his office computer, using the network IP and port for that computer. He cant bring up network shared drives or file servers.

After a bit of google-fu I found some cmd lines for making a .bat file to map the drives using either drive name/server IP, but the .bat file didn't work out at all. 

Did I mention that I am the only IT person at this company, with the general knowledge of a first year computer science student, who has never done anything related to this sort of thing in the history of ever? I should probably mention that. It would be really nice to have a mentor. Any MSPs or sysadmins looking for an intern in the Salt Lake City area? I learn fast! Honest..^(help me..              ^please...)


Edit: **My Plan of Attack**

When I get a chance to test from an internet connection outside of our network domain, I am going to first confirm I can see/ping the file servers I am trying to map to. I know I cannot access it by server name, but I am hoping I can at least access it via IP address."

1zoteb,8,2014-03-05,High School junior with a general question about college choice,Axonalt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zoteb/high_school_junior_with_a_general_question_about/,"Hey /r/cscareerquestions,

I am a junior in high school and after taking AP Computer Science this year, I am absolutely positive about a career in CS (or some related field.) I have a good idea of where I would generally like to go to college and I have a pretty well-researched list already, however, I would like to cleanse some of my fears about my ""category"" of choice.

I'm not going to give you my SAT score or GPA and ask you to chance me to a college. My question more stems from the fact that there is a feeling from those who I have talked to that school name isn't important and I should just go to somewhere I can afford.

So hypothetically, let's say my application would be a slight reach for Berkeley/CMU or something. If this helps at all, I live in Pennsylvania, my family does not make that much money. Obviously staying in-state would be cheaper, but I've always wanted to move out to the West Coast or NY/Boston where there is a huge tech industry.

So, which path would be smarter?-

1. I am accepted into UC Berkeley/CMU/UCLA/UW/NYU etc. etc...but it would be difficult to afford/aid is low. Is it worth it to go to a big name college with a lot of opportunities for internships and employment, but take on most likely a decent amount of debt? Does not going hurt my chances of success later on?

2. I get accepted to a smaller school, say Cal Poly SLO, San Jose State, which is closer to the areas I would like to move to and cheaper, but not as ""prestigious"". Does going here severely hurt my chances of getting a ""Big 4"" internship for example, or is the chances relatively equal throughout most decent CS schools?

**TL;DR- Is going to a more prestigious university (Berkeley, CMU) worth the additional debt compared to a degree from a lesser known university near a huge startup city (Cal Poly SLO, San Jose State, SUNY Stony Brook)?**

1zoxsj,0,2014-03-05,Hi /r/advice. I'm in a conundrum and need guidance. I'm dating an older man and my loved ones do not approve,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1zoxsj/hi_radvice_im_in_a_conundrum_and_need_guidance_im/,"I’d like to apologize in advance if I am in the wrong subreddit. I would also like to apologize for bad grammar, rants, my edit, and anything else wrong with this post.

Basically these past few days have had me thrown into a web of assumptions and thwarted by a boot of power. I am dating a forty-three year old man and I am a nineteen year old woman. As one might guess, my parents and older sister don’t agree with this based solely on the fact that he is older. There’s a bit more, but that’s the main reason.

Let me start the events with this past weekend. I get a phone call from my mother saying that she does not approve of my relationship with this older gentleman who I admitted to having relations with. It was a mutual choice to become romantically involved. I am legal as well. I think it would be strange if my mother had no concern, but I feel as though I was completely honest when it came to our relationship. 

This gentleman and I have been dating for about a month. We’re very close, and for the first time I feel comfortable and happy in a relationship but not overly so to the point where I don’t have my priorities straight. Things for me have been better than ever. I’m a theater major who is doing the light board op for our next show this spring, and I just got a nice internship for the summer that’s close to home. I’m doing very well for being a college freshman. I’d been happier than ever before my mother called.

After the phone call, I go to her house to speak in person. She’s blocked my boyfriend’s number and she refuses to let me leave until I give her my phone and truck keys. Now, I do not pay for insurance on my truck, or for my phone. I am fine without both, but I’d rather keep my phone in case of emergency. I’m not to get my truck back until I get insurance and tell my father about the relationship I have with this man. After giving her my keys she refused to drive me back home so, like a child, I was forced to stay in my childhood bedroom in a house I did not want to be in. If I walked too, that would be something else she could use against me.Either way I lost, and  I was trapped right where my mother wanted me.

So far I’ve looked into getting a new phone plan which I will address this Saturday. I’m very much excited to slowly wean myself away from my mother’s financial power over me. I’m going to look into car insurance next, and hopefully get my truck back. If I don’t , I can pretty well just ride the bus to work and school. I wish she could see though that she is not strengthening or weakening my relationship with this man, but dampening our relationship. The one time I told her something to avoid the current situation, and she uses it against me. It shows that I truly cannot tell her everything, and that anything I do she will twist and hold it firmly against me. Honestly, to me, this has become less and less about me dating an older man, but moreso about getting loose from her. I made that assumption without being “brainwashed” by the man I’m dating.

For now, the boyfriend and I have decided to lay low or not see eachother as much until a good deal of this blows over so that we can concentrate on school, finances, and in my case, dealing with family issues.  I don’t expect him to fight my parent’s because it’s not his battle, or duty, or job. However, he is willing to stay by my side, offer advice, and if he needs to speak with one of them he’s willing to do so. I’m just disappointed that my family, without meeting him have demonized him to such an extent. He is not wealthy, he’s going to college to finish his degree, he is by no means prime dating material, but he makes me happy. I’m in no helping him out because I don’t have the means to. Even if I did I probably wouldn’t based on the fact that I will not be used. This man is someone I genuinely care for and love, and I’m not willing to let him go by anyone’s terms but my own. 

I’m so afraid to tell my father though. I’m afraid of what might happen, but in reality I guess there’s not much to lose. I’m not willing to give up on this man because I genuinely care for him and I know he’s not a monster. I know he’s not a pedophile. I know that even if I did end things, it would only mean that my parents would not believe me and think I was lying. I might as well be honest, but I’m not sure how to approach the matter or even how to cope with it after. My father is a drinker, a redneck, a guy with about 20 guns, but a man I respect as my father.  I just want some guidance as to what I should do or say. Sorry for the long rant, but I wanted to get some of this off my chest as well.

Although I'm only starting my formal education now I've done some self-study over the past few months so I'm feeling really positive starting this degree and where I'm at with my programming knowledge.

I've had the desire to travel and live in the US for years, and now that I've dived into the CS/SE world I feel I have a legitimate method of achieving this.

What should I do over the course of this year to best prepare myself?

My classes will cover:

* Java
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Discrete Mathematics

In my spare time I've been leafing over:

* 'Clean Code' by Uncle Bob
* Head First Design Patterns
* 'Design of Computer Programs' MOOC at Udacity

I understand that for a company to hire an international for an internship they have to show something special. What can I do? 


*P.S*

If anyone is familiar with visas and how that would work I'd love to hear about that too.

I've been in constant depress last year and ended up receiving bad grades and got a warning letter from school about my satisfactory academic progress. It says that I need to stay in at least 12 credits and term grade of 2.0 or better. The things is that I'm taking 4 classes right now which is 12 credit but I'm thinking about dropping one class due to danger of not being able to pass the class. I called the financial aid office about this and they told me that although it won't affect my financial aid for this semester as they already provided the aid to me, it might affect the academic progress warning. So should I just get a D in class or withdraw? It seems that in terms of gpa, w is pretty much same as getting F because I made an attempt to finish the course. But if I just take it and get the D, for the term grade, I won't be in danger.
The reason why I'm hesitating is that due to those years of depression, I receive 3 F's (which I retook and passed), 3 D's and 2 W's (I know, really bad). Adding another D to this seems like really bad, but if I withdraw, it'll affect the financial aid as I might not pass the satisfactory academic progress.

How beneficial would it be for me to go to a Community College and get my Gen-Eds and then go to a University? (Like would it hurt my chances to get internships because I wasn't working on my Major from Freshman year; or do I have this process all screwed up?)

A couple things about the question above. I live in Wisconsin and there is one UW College in particular that doesn't have many Majors or Minors, it's more for doing your Gen-Eds, but it makes it easier to transfer to the numerous UW School across Wisconsin. 

What would be a good PC or Laptop to invest in?

How hard would it be to get into colleges to pursue Mechanical Engineering when I slacked off in High School?

I believe I'll have more questions, but I'll start with these starter questions.

I have no prior work experience which I feel is my biggest problem. I have a few years of voluntary work with a charity where I dabbled in some basic IT stuff towards the end, but that doesn't seem to be enough. I am A+ certified. I also have a bachelors degree in Photography for what it's worth.

I use the usual sites like Craigslist, Indeed, Monster, Dice etc. but they are full of stuff they is way above me and full of the same jobs that get posted every day that I've already applied to months ago. I feel my best bet currently is Craiglist because there is a higher chance of seeing entry level positions posted there but even those positions don't get back to me. I've even applied for internships (even though I would really like to be earning money at this point) but they seem to favour recent graduates or those currently enrolled.

I've tried some unconventional methods like typing in 'computer repair' to Google maps and checking out everything in my area but very few of those places have a career section and when I contact them directly I receive no response.

I'm just really frustrated and looking for some ideas, maybe some job sites that I should be paying more attention to or good ways of getting in the door. I am 24 and have never had a job and this stresses me out a lot and makes me really worried. I simply need that one opportunity."

[ The public is always told when we have the meteors that are passing really close by Earth...should there be one that is on a collision course, are we going to be told abou that one, or would it cause too much chaos to tell us?  What is the protocal for such an event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0mha?context=5)|The answer is yes. Should an asteroid be detected on a collision course, the public would be informed. As a matter of fact, you can see all known close approaches of asteroids by going to [Link to neo.jpl.nasa.gov](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca) The protocol for such events is that NASA would inform the appropriate government agencies such as FEMA and the Dept. of Defense, who would coordinate a response. If time is short before an impact, that would probably consist of evacuating the area. B.C.
[Even if it were an Earth-killer size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1bgo?context=5)|There are no objects that big of which we are currently aware. I sincerely doubt we would have to face this scenario. B.C.
[What's the largest object that could possible come anywhere near us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1lzg?context=5)|An object a few tens of kilometers across - won't destroy the planet, but would make it very uncomfortable for life for a few decades. Mass extinction and all that stuff. B.C.
[What did ""Gravity"" get wrong in regards to how objects orbit and move in space? Specifically in regards to re-entry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw18w9?context=5)|""Gravity"" had a the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station, the Russian space station, which no longer exists, and a Chinese space station, fairly close to each other in space. This is very wrong. But I go to movies to be entertained, not to evaluate their scientific accuracy. Star Wars would be very boring without sound accompanying all the explosions. B.C.
[How useful are the minerals we can obtain from meteors or are they just as easily obtainable on earth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0suz?context=5)|Meteorites contain basically the same elements as found on Earth, just in different abundances. So it is easier to get them here on Earth than wait for them to come to us. Exceptions may be iridium, which is more abundant in meteorites than on Earth, so if you're constructing an inter-dimensional portal like in the movie ""Thor,"" you may have a need for such. B.C.

[What are my chances of being killed by a meteor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0u7c?context=5)|No one in recorded history has been killed by a meteorite, so I would say very small. A lady in Alabama was hit by a meteorite crashing through the roof of her bedroom in the 1950s. It bruised her side and she had to see her doctor, but no long term damage. B.C.
[What is the present condition of the comet Shoemaker Levy 9 impact zone on Jupiter? Will JUNO image this site?   Will New Horizons encounter meteor risk during its travel to Pluto and the kuiper belt?   How many impacts on the lunar surface had been imaged?   Will MRO, Odyssey, Mars Express, MAMEN or MOM be impacted by Comet Siding Spring c/2003A1? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1d7i?context=5)|Going to take a couple of your questions... 5) We have seen over 300 impacts from meteoroids on the lunar surface. 6) Because of how big it is! Another popular place for large meteors to occur is over the ocean because... well... it is about 2/3 of the surface of Earth. 8) It is possible, and The Meteoroid Environment Office has done work to try to predict this risk but it is hard to say definitely if and which spacecraft will be affected. However, the risk has been decreasing as time has gone by and we have been able to get more accurate understanding of the dust production of comet Siding Spring. It is currently a factor of 20 less than the original calculated risk.
[What's a way that I, a typical guy in Los Angeles, can be more involved with NASA and space exploration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw112f?context=5)|There are numerous citizen science opportunities out there.

I always found the idea of rocks falling from the skies fascinating, so I decided to pursue that when I came to NASA. Who can resist the idea of playing Chicken Little. B.C.  Meteors are something that I can observe with my own eyes.  That makes them more real to me (and more understandable) than other fields in astronomy.  And despite seeing a lot of meteors, I still feel a sense of awe and wonder when I see another.  It's that sort of continuing excitement that makes this an awesome job!
[Have you found any precious or new elements at a meteor impact site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw10wl?context=5)|Nope.

If we have decades or longer, we can try using the gravity of a massive space ship to gently tug the asteroid off course or paint one side of it a reflective color so that the difference in heat radiation off the asteroid will change its trajectory. If we don't have a long time, we may have to resort to the movies favorite planetary defense scheme, i.e. nuclear weapons. B.C.
[Did you have any more details about the large fireball that was seen over the eastern U.S. on February 27th?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1isy?context=5)|I'm not sure what you know already so I'll just summarize.  The American Meteor Society received 290 witness reports about a fireball seen on Feb 27 around 19:10 EST (Feb 28 00:10 UTC) from Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington DC, and North and South Carolina.  It was also featured on CNN.  The fireball was detected at EXTREME range (hundreds of kilometers) by two NASA all sky meteor cameras located in Brevard, North Carolina and Hiram, Ohio. Because of this range a trajectory is difficult to determine.  Our cameras first detected it on February 27 at 7:07:58 PM EST at an altitude of 80 km above the town of Montebello, Virginia, moving SW towards Roanoke with a speed of around 15 km/s (33,500 mph). Our cameras lost track of the meteor around an altitude of 68 km as it disappeared below the horizon, though it undoubtedly penetrated lower in the atmosphere. Magnitude was approximately -8.5, which is brighter than the crescent Moon. Taking into account the speed, we are dealing with an object having a diameter of about 1 foot (30 cm) and a mass in the vicinity of 50 lbs (23 kg). (DM)
[Which are better for getting to know the meteors? The telescopes (on earth / in space\) or the radar-like scanners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw15p3?context=5)|The Meteoroid Environment Office (MEO) uses telescopes, cameras, and radars all to detect meteors. There are benefits to each. Radars are great because the forward-scatter radar that the MEO uses sees a huge area of the sky resulting in over 10,000 meteor detections every 24 hours. So we get a lot of data from there. Radar also sees the very smallest meteors (sub-millimeter). Cameras are great for millimeter-sized meteors and centimeter-sized meteors. And telescopes are used to observe meteors hitting the moon which are from meteors several centimeters across. So to say which one is 'better' is hard as we need to observe meteors in all those size-regimes. I'm personally partial to radars as I worked with radar data for my MSc thesis. :-)
[Which is your ""Oh that's something extraordinary!"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw15p3?context=5)|My ''wow!"" moment in my career was the Chelyabinsk meteor in Russia last February. So crazy! Loved getting to work on that event. -RB.
[You mean that you consider even the sub-millimeter particles as meteors? And what is the need of observing such tiny sized meteors hitting the moon - I mean they are so small, why do we consider them if they are hitting the moon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw2w88?context=5)|Yes, meteoroids can be quite small and still be detectable by radar when they ablate in the atmosphere. These are small particles but they are traveling very fast!  Think tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of mph.  In terms of energy, that really packs a punch.   A 1 mm sized meteoroid could have the punch of a 22 caliber bullet.  A cm sized meteoroid could have the destructive power of a cannon shell.
[Could we ever harness the power of a meteor, redirecting it to hit an enemy combatant, such as Russia, should things escalate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw0sa0?context=5)|In theory,  such a thing can be done, but I don't think this is a practicable weapon at least for the next few centuries.

[Okay this isn't really about meteors, but in the movie Gravity, Russia uses a missile to destroy one of their satellites, and the debris from this explosion starts a ""chain reaction"" blowing up other satellites, which then takes out the ISS, the space shuttle, and a Chinese space station.  THEN, the debris continues in the same orbit, going much faster than the ISS, goes all the way around the earth and ends up hitting the ISS again, 3 consecutive times.  So, first of all, how likely is it that any debris from any satellite could hit any other satellite? I understand the earth is very large. Is there any chance debris could ever cause a ""chain reaction""? How would this compare to, say, a comet trail?  Secondly, if there was debris in the same orbit as the ISS, but going thousands of km/h faster, is there any chance it would meet the same object when it came around again? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zqlzm/were_a_team_of_nasa_meteor_experts_from_the/cfw1zog?context=5)|Any explosive event in Earth orbit generates fragments. If this event occurs in a region where there is a concentration of satellite orbits like sun-synchronous altitudes, the fragments could collide with satellites in those orbits and create more fragments, sort of like in a chain reaction. However, it would only affect satellites in those orbits and would not be quick like in ""Gravity."" The collisions would occur over many years, not just in a few hours. As far as your second question, it depends on the nature of the debris; if it is strongly affected by atmospheric drag, it's trajectory will be changed enough that it will not pass near the ISS or some other object it previously encountered. B.C.
[I've heard that some people think microorganisms like tardigrades came to earth on meteorites.

After that the debris would be affected by gravity from the Sun &amp; other planets, radiation pressure, P-R drag, etc. which would change its orbit and place it on an intercept course with another planet.

The Earth's atmosphere breaks up most meteors smaller than a football field. Take Chelyabinsk, for example, it exploded before impacting the Earth. It was about the size of a 3 story building but and only pieces made it to the ground. Still, the explosion did damage - many windows broken and many people injured in Chelyabinsk. Thankfully no reported deaths. Something larger than a football field would likely impact the Earth and create even more destruction.

1zr4jy,0,2014-03-06,Average Salary for a Data Engineer Intern?,newintern1234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zr4jy/average_salary_for_a_data_engineer_intern/,"I have an offer for a data engineering internship in a startup in San Francisco. They want to pay me just over $2,500/month before tax (no stocks, bonuses or anything extra) which, to me, seems incredibly low. I'm not a US national and I need to take the internship so they can sign off on my visa papers but I'd like to try negotiate the salary with them. It seems to me that the average salary for a software engineering intern is about ~$50,000 (indeed.com) but I'm not sure if there's a distinction between a 'software engineer' and a 'data engineer'. I'll be using Java and MongoDB etc and there's a quite a lot of programming involved. I also have a year's work experience back in my home country so I'm not 'fresh out of college'.

What do you guys think?"
1zr9fe,1,2014-03-06,Job/Career advice (currently in mental health),[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1zr9fe/jobcareer_advice_currently_in_mental_health/,"Hello Reddit! As the title indicated, I'm looking for some advice regarding my career. I'm trying to formulate a backup plan if the PhD route doesn't work out. Thoughts, opinions, and advice are all welcome. I'll start out with my current situation.

I graduated last May with a master's degree in Mental Health Counseling. I specialize in suicide prevention and crisis intervention but chose to have a wide variety of clinical experiences in school to make sure I'm fully qualified to handle anything a client may throw my way. In my state (FL) I am granted a sort of provisional license after graduation to be considered a Registered Mental Health Counseling Intern (RMHCI for short). With this, after two years and 2,000 hours of experience working under a qualified supervisor (and a few other minor requirements) I can then become licensed. This has the two notable distinctions of being able to work independently as well as perform a Baker Act. The Baker Act allows for involuntary confinement of a person for up to 72 hours in a mental hospital for observation and treatment if they are considered a threat to themselves/others due to mental illness. This is very important to be able to do if I'm working with potentially suicidal clients. I've performed plenty of lethality assessments before and been consulted with by licensed coworkers regarding a Baker Act but I cannot perform one myself.

After graduating and eventually obtaining a job, the realities of real life set in and I realized I'm not particularly happy making $30,000/year with a Master's degree. This is compounded by the fact that I can't obtain most jobs in the state as I am an RMHCI and not fully licensed; I get access to the jobs no one else wants or will take (for example, my last job essentially had me babysitting adults with developmental disorders and filing medicare claims). Looking at my options, I decided the best solution would be to pursue a PhD in Counseling Psychology. Due to the timing of this decision, the deadlines for programs, the travel requirements, and my work's inability to accommodate this I had to resign. I am fortunate in that I have a place to stay while going through the application process. I've used most of the money I saved from my job to apply to different colleges and make the interview trips. After putting in ten applications, I received four interviews. I have been put on a wait list at three of them and was rejected by the fourth. One of the universities made a point of telling me I was high on their wait list, so I may still get in. I will find out in late April or early May. I do not think I am high enough on the wait list for the other two schools to reasonably expect admission. If I get accepted, this post becomes pointless. I stand a very real chance of not getting accepted at this point though, and this is where my quandary lies.

What should I do if I don't get accepted into any PhD programs? I like the mental health field but most of the jobs I want demand a PhD to be considered for employment, and even then the master's level jobs with plenty of experience seem to top out at $50,000/yr, maybe $60,000. My current plan is to up and move to a college town with research in the field I can participate in; relative lack of research experience is the biggest weakness on my CV. I would need to do this in May and then be ready to submit applications by December for admission the following fall. On the plus side, the closest town to do this in has a professor I've been in touch with as I applied and interviewed with him there; he may be willing to let me work with his research projects which I'm guessing would help my chances if I apply there again the next year (assuming I do the research competently, of course). I'm very much open to switching careers and moving elsewhere, even to a foreign country, if it provides me with a secure job with a good paycheck. I'd like to reliably earn $60,000+ a year but to my knowledge I don't currently have the skillset to command that salary. I'm open to learning new things; I tend to excel with math and other logic-based tasks but haven't gone much past Calc 1 in school.

I have plenty of freedom at the moment as I'm relatively young at 25 and I don't have a wife or kids tying me down. I'm fine moving and I'm fine picking up a new trade or skillset. My limitations are that I've currently got $1,500 to work with for the move, a $35,000 debt that will need to eventually be paid off (no immediate repayment required though), and no immediately obvious means for funding additional schooling or other means of learning a trade. I'm also not the greatest at networking. Given all of this, what are you thoughts?"
1zrhf5,40,2014-03-06,"Debilitating anxiety, can't even apply for jobs anymore",[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1zrhf5/debilitating_anxiety_cant_even_apply_for_jobs/,"Sorry for the lengthy post, I realize that begin overly verbose is another area I need to work on. I don't have anybody to talk to about this stuff, so it all comes pouring out when I finally do open the tap. I also think this is a combination of depression and anxiety, so I wasn't sure exactly where to post this.

I have always had a touch of social anxiety, not ever being comfortable in large groups and always being starkly aware of every action I take while around other people. My anxiety seemed to multiply in college. I think it's due to some misconception I had as a child that once you become an adult, things start to make sense and you sort of just mature all at once. I remember being almost panic attack-inducingly nervous for an oral report in 10th grade, and thinking ""I'll just learn how to talk in front of people when I become an adult. All adults do it, so I'll just be able to deal with it, plain and simple."" Here I am, 26 years old, and I still feel like the exact same person that I was when I graduated high school. Maybe even a bit less mature now, after years of relative isolation.

I've been graduated for a few years, and it has gotten to the point where I dread even applying for jobs now. I always mess up interviews, or don't know how to ""brag"" about myself on resumes. I have zero experience, and never had internships in college. I don't even want to send out resumes due to the lack of responses I've gotten, and every ""resume expert"" I've talked to has given me wildly different advice, all to no avail.

Now I've been jobless for years (minus a summer job at a camp run through my old university), living under my parent's financial umbrella, and my anxiety is becoming heavily twinged with depression. I seriously think if I found a job and started busying myself, I would improve vastly. However, I haven't even sent out a resume in weeks now because I don't particularly want any of these jobs (as in, I don't know what to say in cover letters/interviews under ""why do you want to work here?""), and the lack of responses I get from places where I do apply is becoming more and more depressing and scary. I can't do anything sales related since I've never been good at selling anything to anybody, and the jobs in my fields (physics undergrad, finance grad degree) all require internships to get even basic jobs. I basically don't qualify for anything that requires the degrees I have, and I lack any real world experience to get more retail/customer service/etc jobs.

Right now I want to find any job just to get some financial independence, improve my self-image, and also because my parents are going to make me move back home in a couple months if I can't find anything. The deadline, the lack of finding jobs in the past, and my natural anxiety are all mixing together into one hell of a crazy cocktail. I find myself spending hours online to escape from my lack of a real life and prevent myself from thinking about how my entire post-college adult life has all been one big useless blur of hiding from the world. Then at night, I spend hours tossing and turning as I can't stop thinking about all the issue that I put off throughout the day.

I'm embarrassed about my situation, which I know for sure is 100% my fault, because I have had everything in life handed to me and I am absolutely terrified that I can't do anything on my own. My attitude of ""why bother applying for jobs if I won't get them?"" is enough proof of my silver spoon attitude. I want to change and be a better person, but I keep falling back on these self-pitying ways."

So I'm restructuring my resume since I've found an internship that I think I'll like and I'm sort of stuck. I'm trying to work out how I should list the software and computer skills that I have. 

The position is a marketing/communications internship for a software company and they have a list of software that would be useful to know.

My problem is that as a tech oriented person I have a wide breadth of experience with a lot of different software but a lot of it doesn't have very much depth to it. For instance it'd be nice to be able to communicate that I can function well in Office programs or Adobe CS6 programs but I'm not necessarily a wizard with them. How do I best communicate that? 

I thought I'd do a Proficient vs Familiar titling for the different software but I end up with two issues. My familiar list is much larger than the proficient one and most of the ones they named as important would be on the familiar list rather than proficient. 

Thanks for any help. "
1zrmo0,11,2014-03-06,I had to drop out (CS major) and now I'm working on setting up a plan to enter the field ASAP through alternate means. Seeking any advice and guidance.,obviouslyCPTobvious,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zrmo0/i_had_to_drop_out_cs_major_and_now_im_working_on/,"**My current position:** Long story short, I had to drop out due to financial problems. At the moment I'm just looking for something to pay the bills, I'll probably have to go back to my old factory job. The only CS classes I've finished that I have credit for are Intro and Intermediate C++. I don't have any projects completed to put on a portfolio. I'm familiar with python and C++.

**Short Term Goals:** Simply, I want to make money sitting in front of a computer learning and solving problems. I would prefer a software development job, but at this point anything is better than working in a factory. 

**Long Term Goals:** I want to be in a position where my job is secondary to my life. I would love to be able make a living while traveling or working part time. I want to enjoy my profession, but I want to focus on enjoying life more, if that makes any sense.

**My loose plan of action:** First, find any job to pay the bills right now. Second, build a portfolio of projects that I enjoy. Third, do something that will get me a job.

**Options:** I've consider programming bootcamps. I would have to save up money working in a job I hate until I have enough to pay for a bootcamp and hope that it leads to a job. I've thought about waiting until I have a portfolio I'm happy with and then starting a job hunt. Since I'm not a student anymore, I'm not sure if an internship is a viable option. **I'm willing to relocate almost anywhere.** as long as I make enough money to survive in the area.  I'm currently near Chicago.

**Questions:**

* Has anybody been down a similar path and what did you do?
* Which CS jobs have the lowest barrier to entry? Jr. software dev? DBA? QA?
* Are there any places where it easier for somebody at my level to enter the field?

**tl:dr:** Want to become employable ASAP. Currently have very minimal demonstrable experience. Willing to do the bitch work. Will move just about anywhere. What goals can I set for myself that will lead to a programming related job in a quick manor?"
1zrqvq,0,2014-03-06,"worst phone interview experience with a startup that doesn't even pay, so heated right now (warning: wall of text)",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1zrqvq/worst_phone_interview_experience_with_a_startup/,"Basically I applied to a job on craigslist that is unpaid but for a startup and I would get a chance to do android development(remotely) and be 'mentored'. First off no one would apply for this job if they were not open to learning from a startup and wearing different hats, its the reason people might apply to start ups.

She talks and tells me about the company and basically before I even talk about myself she goes from telling me about the company to telling me why I am not a good fit  ....'you definitely are not passionate about our company because you did not research it. I said I did I checked facebook/twitter/website/app and did a brief search on what it does and how its publicized but was leaving it up to the interview to learn more about it and hear from an employee the ins and outs. 

She says every one who calls us and asks us a bunch of questions so I know they are passionate, and I was like ok well can I ask questions then?(keep in mind every time I tried to talk before this she cut me off and I let her) So finally I can talk...What would I be contributing to ? why do you need me? what does the team look like? how does the mentorship work? how many developers? etc etc.... oh you don't know? its confidential? we work remotely and its not required for the team to meet except 2 times a month????how is that mentoring going to work...well it works because you meet twice a month(her answer)

Basically she got fed up that I didn't know enough about the company even though I applied 1 night before and said I thought the phone interview was for you to tell me more about it, and she said yes well you should do more research if your passionate and open to new things. Fair enough. But telling me I am not passionate and not open to trying things because I did not ask any questions, when I TRIED to she cut me off explaining why I am not a fit, then said that because I tried to cut her off I was the worst experience she had and she NEVER had any problems before(prob because no one else applies) and I am rude and sarcastic?!?! I could of swore she was describing herself. In fact I said I am not giving attitude until you cut me off and she said I can say the same for you, you need to work on your social skills (basically, again just taking the insults left and right and the most bitchy tone I don't even want to describe). When I do ask questions she couldn't give a solid answer for anything, I still did not know what I was going to be doing because its confidential and I can't find out until I am hired. 

She was really mad that I left one question unanswered prior to the call in an email, and I said I left it blank because I did not understand it fully and wanted to ask you about it. At this point she was FURIOUS saying then WRITE IN THE EMAIL YOU DON'T KNOW.

I said I was going to ask you on the phone. She said if you don't understand that simple question then I am worried about you being qualified(still talking down to me with a tone and literally laughing that I asked that question, she said this after saying you need to ask me questions so I know your excited and willing to wait to be put on the tech team).

 After a nice intro she began to insult me every chance she got and I just listened and when I tried to speak she cut me off and said ' I never had to deal with someone like you you keep cutting me off and giving me attitude(I did not until she talked down on me about not asking questions which I did and she had no answers)... and also about me not being passionate enough which again I applied for an UNPAID role offering FULLTIME

keep in mind I barley talked she just assumed all this about me from a brief email which I explained my background and experience.

this is the question I left blank and she basically decided I wasn't fit for the job before 'If your current tech skills do not match the fundamental requirements for the tech team, are you willing to function in a tech liaison capacity with the marketing team, while you improve and strengthen your tech skills?   '

I wanted to ask what exactly this means(would I improve tech skills on my own time? or by a mentor, this is important to me). Because I left it blank, which I probably shouldn't have, she was implying I meant I am not open to trying new things, but I kept saying what is this phone interview if I can't ask questions about the job or the email and she said you should be better prepared before the interview..again fair but every phone interview I EVER had the caller talks for an hour explaining things, and asking If I have any questions no matter how dumb. I thought this was how its supposed to be. 

..Seriously applying to an unpaid internship is bad enough but then getting talked down on because I didn't answer a question in the email but every question I asked had no real answer..She said I don't ask questions over 100 times and every time I asked a question it was either a 'dumb question' or she had no answer. I am pissed at this because I asked so many questions and all the questions I had were valid but she scoffs at me saying ask prepare better and ask better questions(literally said ask better questions wtf) and we can talk again next week(ya right)

has anyone had a bad interview? I have never ever ever gave attitude or fought with someone verbally that I do not know, so I can't believe it came to this but this bitch brought the worst out of me and I am upset that she let me

1zszsi,20,2014-03-07,I found a job! Advice on moving to Europe from a non-European,elle_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zszsi/i_found_a_job_advice_on_moving_to_europe_from_a/,"Hi /r/jobs,

I've taken lots of advice from this sub and since I've just found a job (whoop!) I thought it was time to give some back.  I see a few posts asking about relocating to Europe so, as someone who's done it, here are my thoughts on the topic.


**My background:**

Mid 20s marketing professional from New Zealand.  I have a UK passport which means I did not require a visa/sponsorship to work in the EU (more on this later).  My background is in fast moving consumer goods.  I'd done a three-year graduate programme with a well-known multinational and one year at a Brand Manager level for the same company.


**My Advice:**

1. **Do your research.**  When I first came over I did some traveling and then settled in Berlin.  My boyfriend and I thought this would be a good idea because 1) he speaks German and 2) we both love the city.  I'd done research on Berlin before leaving home (expat community forums, /r/berlin) and the sentiment on working there was quite negative. I stubbornly refused to hear it and stuck it out there for four months with little traction outside of internship offers for €300 a month.

    When I realised that I wasn't getting anywhere I did some more research.  I made a list of English-friendly countries, a list of companies that I'd like to work for and created a spreadsheet of if/where they had offices in those English-friendly countries.  If only I'd done that earlier...Berlin had a grand total of 2/54 (although I think I still would have been stubborn and tried it).  This exercise lead to me relocating to Amsterdam.

2.  **Be prepared to compromise.** If you're looking to move to another country, chances are you're motivated by more than just career progression.  Don't get me wrong; career is important to me and I didn't want to take a job that would get me nowhere.  I just think that you have to be realistic in what you're looking for - getting a promotion (or even maintaining your current level) may not be possible if you have no local market experience or language skills.  In my case I'm taking a step down in title ('Manager' to 'Assistant Manager' level) but the learning opportunities are still huge.

3.  **Have your finances in order.** In the end it took me almost 7 months and 74 applications to secure this role I'm happy with.  Thanks to a lot of saving before I left home I've been able to support myself the entire time.  Yes, you canlook for other work to support yourself while you search (e.g. temp work, hospitality) but even those roles can be difficult to come by if you don't speak the language or have a network.  I'd recommend having at least three months worth of living costs in your bank account before leaving home.

4.  **Make it about more than just the job hunt.** As many of you in this sub know it's easy to fall into a slump when you're job hunting.  If you're moving away from home to do so make sure you're still doing things to experience your new hometown - take a language course, travel, learn something new.  This can be difficult to do on a tight budget but there are always ways (shout out to [MeetUp.com](http://www.meetup.com)).  Then if - *worst case scenario* - you don't find a job and have to go back home, you've still had an amazing experience and remember more than just the gloom of sending off endless applications.


As promised, **thoughts on work permits:**

Unless you have the right to work OR are an experienced professional in a field that's *truly* in demand where you're moving to (refer point #1), I wouldn't go.  The economic situation in most of Europe is still difficult and not having local experience/language skills already puts you on the back foot.  From what I've seen no companies have been willing to sponsor working visas.  Look into any reciprocal working holiday agreements your country may have as they'll provide you with a good way to start out ([this website](http://www.anyworkanywhere.com/visainfo.html) appears to have some good information despite using Comic Sans).


That was quite a ramble!  Apologies for the length, but if you're interested hopefully there's some helpful information in there for you.  Of course these are all just my own thoughts / experience.  If you have any questions I'm happy to answer :)


**TL;DR:** If you want to work in Europe do your research before leaving home, be prepared to compromise, get your funds in order and have fun while you're there.  If you don't have a work permit it's going to be extremely difficult.

I'm currently taking discrete math, calc 3, data structures, and intro cs class(mandatory).  I'm actually doing really well in these classes so far but I've looked over my degree progress with my advisor and said it would take at least 2 years to finish this degree(can skip almost all gen-eds).  As a 25 year old, I'm tired of the school system and want to get out asap and start working full time.  


So I found out my school as another program called the undergraduate certifcate degree  http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=15&amp;poid=5631&amp;returnto=1031 Pretty much its a years worth of credits to complete and it goes through all the important CS core classes.  As apposed to taking more classes if going through with the BS; such as stats, linear algebra, more upper level CS classes.  But this certificate is mainly used for people with bachelors unrelated to CS to go into grad school.  Im not looking into grad school bc its more expensive and will take an additional 2 years to complete.  


Im looking into the mobile development field, primarily android once I am done but I don't know if I should just finish my 2nd bachelors which will probably only take an additional 2-3 semester or get this certificate.  I also applied to many internships and waiting to hear back from 2 soon, so I can build up my resume.  But in the mean time I am learning android sdk on my own through a book I bought.  Right now I'm leaning towards the 2nd BS but want a second opinion."

I am talking about universities like UMass, MSU, Texas-Austin, UVa, NCSU, UIUC, TAMU, Penn State, GaTech, Illinois, Maryland, UMich Ann Arbor etc.

I was able to apply only to UMass, MSU and have not heard from them yet. I had applied to a lot of programmes in Europe (esp. the ones with scholarship but I've not received funding in any and I am on waiting list in most with dim chances). Won't be risking an education loan to Europe.

- Are there any disadvantages of getting into a spring entry programme? Less chances of assistance or so? (I am aware that very few places have spring intake)
- Are there good universities in USA that do not ask for GRE like those in Europe or focus mostly on GRE quant score for CS programmes? TOEFL is 111/120.
- Did not mail any professors, even those whom I mentioned in my application or on SOP. Planning to do that this year. Matters? I am applying to MS (not PhD or combined).


Anyone from Canada? I am also planning to apply to McGill, UBC etc.

- One average LOR (or I don't actually know) from my internship guide (used to be  a professor, now in industry) - his research profile is strongest among all 4, by a huge margin.
- My SOP is good; it seems so from the feedback I have received, from friends and people who are doing graduate study or have finished (numerous revisions)
- I might try for some papers but as I am not in academia, I am not sure how that's going to turn out."
1zvaix,8,2014-03-07,I'm diagnosed but I'm not sure if my problem is ADHD,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1zvaix/im_diagnosed_but_im_not_sure_if_my_problem_is_adhd/,"I was diagnosed back in high school.  I just finished college and now I'm having a crisis and I think ADHD is feuling it.  


I went to school for copywriting(the mad men kind).  I loved it and had a blast doing projects in school and finding connections between two seemingly unrelated things to make a cool, clever ad.  

I graduated, and now I'm at an internship at an agency right now doing some work for small clients that the agency has and things like that.  My boss is really cool and its cool getting to do real work.  But unfortunately I feel like the things I'm working on aren't the fun things that I liked doing in school.  And I know that people have to pay dues etc to get to do what they want but honestly I have a hard time giving a fuck that that's what you're supposed to do.  I want to work on ads that I want to work on.  I don't want to make shitty poster using cliche lines because everyone is too afraid to take a risk with their brand.  I'm starting to resent the internship and copywriting as a whole because it seems like this is an omen of things to come with my career.  


I also love writing.  I'll read a good book once in a while and think, ""I want to write this.""  I want to write novels and short stories and screenplays.  I buy books about wring screenplays and I write short stories in my free time, often when I'm at my internship also, instead of doing work.  I want to master writing and become successful as a writer.

But wait, I also love to record music.  To make rap beats for my friends to rap on while we hang out.  I went to a show recently and running around on stage while everyone parties looks like the most fun anyone can ever have making money.  Now I want to do that.  I want to devote all my time to making beats and I throw writing and copywriting to the side as I order drum machines and chop samples late into the night.  

I see a good movie and want to become a screenwriter and spend time developing stories and plot outlines that will never come to fruition.

I saw a drawing that really spoke to me and I started drawing on paper and practicing that to get better.  

In order to clarify,  I do spend a lot of time with all of these hobbies, and I'm slowly getting better at all of them.  Due to this [quote](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish) from Ira Glass, I force myself to believe that I'm getting better, and everytime I listen to an old song, or read an old story and cringe with embarrassment, it only serves to remind me that I'm improving.  

I'm terrified that I'm in love with too many things and I'll never be able to master any because I get distracted and move on to another thing.  I just cycle around: writing, copywriting, beats, drawing, writing, copywriting, beats, etc etc etc

What am I supposed to do to break this cycle? My meds put me in a mild manic state where I'm full of motivation but no direction.  

Edit: Wanted to thank both you guys for writing thought out responses.  It helps to know that there are others who are in the same spot that I am.

1zx74p,12,2014-03-08,The Mirror,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1zx74p/the_mirror/,"I bought a mirror about three months ago at an antique store. It's a pretty mirror, and I still have it. It was a fancy trim around it, as if it were a portrait of a family's patriarch. I found it odd that anyone would want to frame a mirror in such a way, but I also thought that it must of had some sentimental value or something. At the time however, I couldn't figure out how a mirror could even have sentimental value, perhaps, I thought, it had been owned by a very vain woman.

When I brought it home, I hung it up on my wall over my dresser. I figured, maybe I can finally realise how silly I looked all the time and change it *before* I went out into public. I didn't hold any sort of value on it, it was just a mirror.

Two nights after I set it up, I woke up in the middle of the night. A strange light was coming from the mirror, and as I stared into the mirror I saw the reflection of the moon. I saw then, a different image entirely. Instead of my room, I saw a (american) football field. I wasn't sure which team it was, as I didn't follow football. I saw the team that won, and then it stopped. I went back to bed.

The next morning I was certain it was a dream, though I remembered it so vividly. Two days later, I saw a news report where the team I saw in the mirror won. I was confused, and thought maybe I had just heard something about the game and saw the team. 

I hadn't seen anything in the mirror since that point, so I doubted it was some sort of ""magic mirror."" In fact, I didn't see anything until a month after my first viewing. 

Once again, I was awaken by a light coming from the mirror, and I stood and looked in. At first, it was just my room, the moon, and me. Then it was a woman in a red dress, approaching what appeared to be a homeless man. Like you would expect, the homeless man asked the woman for money, and she told him that she would feed him if he wanted instead. The homeless man grinned and nodded, so the woman hailed a taxi.

The mirror changed to an image of the woman's house, and the woman was cooking something. The homeless man walked into her kitchen, and behind his back I could see a knife. He walked to the woman, and held the knife to her throat. He told her she was a very pretty and sweet lady, and he was so lonely. I can't describe what happens next, but I can still see it in my mind, I couldn't take my eyes away from the mirror.

Right before the image faded, the mirror changed one last time, and I saw an image of the woman lying dead on her kitchen floor. Her neck was slit and her dress was torn. The man was raiding her kitchen. I couldn't handle anymore, and I threw up and passed out.

In the morning I woke up, next to a pool of my own vomit. I knew that it was real this time, but I didn't know what to do. Should I get rid of the mirror? Should I report what I saw to the cops? What would I say? All these thoughts came flooding into my head, and in the head I decided to keep the mirror and do nothing.

 I saw a report on the TV a week after about the dead woman. She was a kindergarten teacher, and had a daughter. The police said someone broke into her house and raped her, then killed her to keep her from saying anything. Her nine year old daughter found the body. Once again, I couldn't handle this. I had seen the woman die a week before she did, and I felt I should have done something, but I knew there was nothing I could have done. I did, however, call in an anonymous tip to the police about seeing her with a homeless man, but no killer has been found still.

I was wary of the mirror, I couldn't tell if it was evil. But I figured it probably wasn't, how can a mirror have a moral alignment? Once again, no visions until a month after I saw the woman die. This time, I saw another woman. She was wearing a blue dress, and appeared to be frightened of something. She walked down an alley, where a man with a knife came out, demanding money. She screamed as loud as she could, and a man came out and yelled something, causing the mugger to get scared and stab the woman. The man who yelled came running towards the woman, and the image faded.

This time, I was determined to try to stop this. I knew that the vision came from somewhere in my own city because I had seen the alley she walked down many times. So, all I had to do was find the woman which I thought would be really difficult. Surprisingly, it wasn't.

The next day, I had decided that I needed a drink, so I went to the bar. And, at that bar, lo and behold was a beautiful, yet familiar face of a woman in a blue dress. To make it easier, she noticed me see her, and she smiled and waved me over. I sat next to her, and we hit it off. I won't tell you her name, so let's call her Emma. 

She was a really likable person, and had recently landed an internship at a local hospital. In fact, the bar was suppose to be a celebration, but no one had shown up. I really liked her, and she really liked me. It was all going perfectly, until I accidentally said something about the vision in the mirror. At that point, she got really creeped out, and quickly ran out. At that moment, I remembered how scared she had looked in the mirror, and realised this was the moment I saw. I quickly rushed after her, and saw her turn into the alley, but she was so far ahead of me. I heard her scream, and I shouted, but when I got to the alley she had already been stabbed. I called for an ambulance, and when they got there she was still alive. They allowed me to ride in the ambulance with her.

In the hospital, when she woke up, I talked to her. She wanted to know how I knew what had happened, and I told her I didn't know. I told her I was so sorry, and it was in fact my fault that she had gotten stabbed. She told me to calm down. So I did. 

We spent the rest of the night talking, and she told me she believed me when I said I saw it in the mirror, as she had no other explanation on how I knew all the details. We've been going out ever since, and she had spent the night over at my house when the mirror showed me it's latest vision. 

I got up once again to see the mirror lit. I slowly scooted away from Emma, whose arm had been around me, and looked in. This time, when the image changed, it was still me. I was walking down the stairs in my building, when I tripped. I fell down hitting my head over and over again, my body was broken when I hit the ground. My face was covered in blood, and my limbs in angles they shouldn't be. I saw my landlord discover my body, but it was too late I was dead.

I haven't left my apartment, and Emma has been staying here with me. It's almost been another month since I saw myself die. Just three more days, and I haven't left the apartment building. Maybe the mirror was wrong. Oh god I hope so."
1zxkwq,1,2014-03-08,Help me decide if I want to stay an extra semester and find another job or stay with my current job (starting in Aug.)!!,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1zxkwq/help_me_decide_if_i_want_to_stay_an_extra/,"I'm currently finishing up my Master's, graduating this May. I accepted a job offer for next August in Philadelphia. It's not my top choice but it was the only one I got. However, now that my start date approaches I've begun to feel really hesitant about going there. I feel like it's not right for me and have really been entertaining the thought of doing an extra semester in the fall, going through fall recruiting at my school, and trying for a smaller firm closer to my boyfriend (who works in NYC). 

However, I'm also really reluctant in going through recruiting again. My GPA is above a 3.0 but still low enough that many places just don't interview me at all. I think I'm just a sensitive person and being rejected by so many companies really took a toll on me. Many of the companies I applied to last year never responded to my resume, so why would they respond next year? However, I do believe that I've become more mature since the last time I went through recruiting. I feel like I'm better at the ""small things"" that get people to like you when they're interviewing you so I should hopefully have a little more success this year. Also I got my resume reviewed and my GPA is higher for my Master's than my undergrad. However, none of this is a guarantee that I'll find something.

I did do an internship in January at a company in NYC that seems to want me back. However, it pays 50% less than the company I accepted. My BF will make much more than either of these companies but I also don't want to rely on him.

If I do do this extra semester, I can take a few internships over this summer and next term. I got a few really amazing internship offers and I just want to do them all. I can work at the internship while taking 1 night class and working on my thesis. I've talked to my adviser and he says that we may be able to get a paper out of my thesis. And I'm really excited for these internships and would love to do them. They're not in the field I want to go into full time so that wouldn't help but they are paid so I'll be able to sustain myself. This is probably the biggest reason why I'd want to take another semester.

So here's the breakdown of pros and cons of staying another semester, ranked by how important they are to me:

Pro:

1. The company I accepted the offer from is really big and I prefer a smaller, more startupy environment.

2. I get to do multiple internships at places I'll have a lot of fun at and are also paid.

3. I can get a better job that might lead to more connections in the city in the future.

4. I can find somewhere in NYC to be near my BF.

5. I can maybe get a paper out of my thesis.


Cons:

1. I'm really scared of recruiting again and my undergrad GPA will probably prevent companies from 
interviewing me.

2. I fear my peers will be ahead of me. I'm going into a rather cutthroat business that is hierarchically stacked and being behind 1 year might have high opportunity costs in terms of potential openings for promotions.

3. I'm already on my 5th year of school (undergrad + masters). I already feel behind and my friends have already all started working. Many people finish both undergrad and masters in 4 years and I'll be doing 5 and a half.

4. If not for my BF being in NYC I would probably have sucked it up and gone to Philly. I know I wouldn't want to stay for many years but I wouldn't have mind going there for a few (~5 years).

5. The pay difference (not a huge deal).

Thanks for reading my rant and give me any advice you might have for me. Don't be afraid to give some tough love as well :P"

* I am intern at a local repair store.

* I man the front desk when the secretary isn’t in. She’s been sick for a couple days.

* The front room is pretty sizable. Can hold 5-6 customers comfortably. 

* I'm your average intern/college student. Hoody, presentable pants, backpack full of necessary things. A little bit on the hefty side. Kinda clueless and prone to confusion.

* I usually think a bit before I talk, results in a slow drawl.

Story time.

Usually I’m only scheduled to come in on Thursdays and Fridays. However, my boss doesn’t mind if I pop in and help whenever I want. When I’m not in school I usually have nothing better to do besides video games and help out down at the store.

Today I should’ve stayed home and played video games.

 I pop in the back door and everything is hunky dorey. Drop my backpack by the fridge and ask Mr.Bossman what needs to be done.

“Secretary is still sick. Do you wanna man the front desk?”

‘Course I do! Customers are much more fun than chopping my hands to bits on old sharp computers. (I’m not pointing any specific brand out, but it starts with a *C* and ends with a *ompaq*.)

I put on my company hat and set myself at the desk. Yeah, we wear hats inside. We’re cool like that. First hour goes by, only Mr.Bossman’s mom coming to visit him. Twiddle my thumbs a bit. Another hour goes by. Only a couple customers just checking in on their computers. I help one out, he pays and is on his way. 

I was rocking back and forth in the chair and spinning a defunct drive, just waiting for time to pass. My thought's right before the moment that taught me to be careful what you wish for,""This is boring as hell. I wish I had something to do.""

**YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED MORTAL**

This tiny man bursts into the shop. He must’ve been 5 feet tall max. He rushes up to the desk and slaps his computer down. A full tower, right on the desk. just slaps it there. 

Shorty: HeymistermycomputerisbrokenmybrotherlikestoplaywiththebioshessuchanasshedoesntlistenwhenItellhimthatwillbreakit...

Now that he set the computer down I got a good look at him. The man looked like he was just skin draped over a wire frame. From the way he was twitching and talking someone had probably plugged that wireframe into an outlet not too long ago.

Shorty: hedoesstufflikethatallthetimehedoesntlistencanyoufixit?

Me: Yeah, I think we can fix it. Shouldn’t be too tough. Do you know what he did in the BIOS?

Shorty: IdunnohejustdoesstuffitsnotworkingIthinkhediditbutitsbrokencanyoufixit?

Me: Yeah, we should be able to. Here, write down your contact information on this form. Does the computer have a password? 

Shorty: Yeahithasapasswordit’s *super speed gibberish*

 Me: I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.

Shorty: *slower super speed gibberish*

Me: Again please?

Shorty: a... b... c... 1... 2... 3... (Password has been changed for ""papers I signed"" reasons)

Me: Thanks, once you’re done just set that paper on top of the computer there and we’ll take care of it for ya. 

Shorty: *slaps paper on tower*

You’d think that was the end, that he’d leave then right? That’s what I thought. Boy was I wrong. I was rotating in the chair and spinning the drive, noticed his reflection in the disk. 

Me: Uh, is there anything else you need help with sir?

Shorty: YescanyouputsomestuffinthecomputerformepleaseidlikethatitdmakeitsomuchbetterandI’dbesohappy.

He swoops across the room and out the door.

He came back two times later that day. 

The first time he came back is was right before another customer came in. I knew I couldn’t make eye contact with the other customer. We’d both laugh, that’d be bad. 

The second time he came back Mr.Bossman was at the desk and I was in the back. Surprise, his computer at home had been stolen. My boss got a good 30 minute talk in with him. More of a 30 minute listen really. 

Now whenever we’re both in the back and the front door rings (sensor that makes noise when it opens) I whisper “He’s baaaaack.” poltergeist style. Mr.Bossman groans every time. 

He’s supposed to come back tomorrow to pick up his computer. I suspect he’s going to try to pay in drugs.

1zy7ta,0,2014-03-09,The Best Two Bucks I Ever Spent,[deleted],gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1zy7ta/the_best_two_bucks_i_ever_spent/,"So I figure this one was worth sharing with the world. Preemptive sorry for the wall of text. :)

So as an engineering intern from Georgia Tech working in Claremont California, I was pretty excited to get to see the Pacific Ocean for the first time and see if the waters truly were colder on the West Coast. For the 4 weeks since arriving and starting my job in metro-LA I had hiked and explored the foothills a bit but still hadn't made it out to the beach. Once I started making a few friends, I had kept trying to see if I could organize a trip to the beach to no avail. Finally, fed up with all the cancellations, I headed out to Huntington Beach all by my lonesome. I rode the hour drive from Claremont to the beach rocking out to the country station with two books, a tube of sunscreen, a towel, a Tupperware filled with grapes and cheese to snack on the beach, a water bottle, and a grocery store plastic bag to wrap it all up in. After an enjoyable drive through the sun, I arrived at Huntington Beach and even managed to find parking on Beach Boulevard. I got out of my car, and made change with the help of a passerby out of the two bucks I had in my wallet. Depositing said two bucks into the meter by the big red truck I had driven up from Atlanta, I made my way to the beach, plastic bag in hand.

As I got to the beach, the familiar scents and sights of the Atlantic flashed into head as I gazed out onto the cresting waves of the Pacific. The taste of salt water filled the air and I hurriedly cast off my things, laid down my towel and made a B-line for the waves. I rushed into the arms of the Pacific, laughing as I tried to tackle the waves and not too taken aback by the only slightly chilly water. After minutes in the surf. I returned to my towel and snacked, watching the other beach goers reveling in the sand and surf. I finished my snack under the constant eyes of a sea gull hoping to grab a bite of my scraps. I stood and looked out at the sun setting into the sea and took obligatory pictures of the coastline for the family and friends back home, enjoying the pleasant decision I had made to go to the beach. Luckily enough for the gull, I had even accidentally dropped a grape into the sand, and the gull did his duty grabbing it with his beak and flying away with it.

As the sun set I figured that I would gather up my things and head to the Pier figuring I could get a great shot of the sun-setting from the Pier. I packed my things back into my bag taking special measure to load my phone, keys and wallet into the Tupperware I had brought so that they wouldn't get wet or sandy as I strode along the surf. The water was nice as a I walked along the shore gazing back and forth from the Ocean to the land. I quickly realized however that I had over packed my bag and it was beginning to tear. I suppose it was rather foolish of me to bring two books to the beach that I hadn't so much as opened. I adjusted to carry the bag rather than hold it from the weakening straps and continued towards the Pier.
As I was two life guard stations from the Pier, the sun began to set. Figuring that I hadn't much time left, I exited the surf, crossed the beach and made my way to the paved bike/ pedestrian path that enclosed the beach. I stopped before end of the beach to snap a photo of the sunset in case the sun set vanished below the waves before I got to the end of the Pier. Re-placing my phone in the Tupperware, I jogged toward the Pier meeting the crowd that shared my interest with the sunset and the Pier. As I got halfway down the Pier I figured it was about time I pulled out my phone so I could prepare to snap the setting sun. It was then that I was driven frantic; for as I looked through the remnants of my grocery store bag, I realized that I only clutched two books and the Tupperware containing my phone, car keys, and wallet was no longer under my arms.

It came to me quickly that I had just lost the entirety of my life. Having had my phone moments before I raced back to the beach against the crowd frantically looking at the floor for my Tupperware. I had no luck as I made in down the pier and back to the path. I must have looked like a fool as I stood in the middle of the bike/pedestrian path muttering ""shit, shit, shit"" under my breathe. That's when a rather cute college aged blond walked up to me and asked me if I was alright.
Her name was K****** (stared out for her privacy). She wore a Sailor Moon sweatshirt over the bikini straps around her neck. I was thankful for the help and explained as my heart raced of how the entirety of my life was lost in a Tupperware and that I was searching for it. She smiled and me told me that she would help and asked me where I had seen it last. With her prompting I recalled the last photo I had taken at the beach and I figured that we could cover more ground if we split up. I asked her if she could search for my Tupperware from where I was standing to the middle of the Pier. I would then cover the ground between the path and the beach where I had taken the photo. She agreed and we decided to meet at the sign for Sandy's, a beach side restaurant off the Pier. Newly focused, we parted ways.
I retraced my steps to the beach with no luck keeping my eyes to the ground. I then headed up the beach to the green head life guard station to see if anyone had turned in my Tupperware. Again I was met with no luck. I wasn't surprised. It had been moments since I lost my Tupperware and the sun was still setting in the sky. As I made my way back to the sign for Sandy's, I contemplated the gravity of my situation. I didn't have keys to my car, nor the phone to call AAA to get that car opened, nor the license to drive said car to the apartment which I also lacked the keys to get into. As I meet K******, I had moved into despair. She had met with similar results in her search. Feeling guilty at wasting this cute girl's time I urged her to head home, thankful for the kindness of a stranger. I repeated her search of the Pier and again came up empty. Hopelessly I returned to the beach when I found the first sign of hope an empty water bottle, the same brand as I had brought.

Racing up the bike/ pedestrian path, I realized that during my first search I had searched the wrong entrance to the path. I had actually entered the path one stop further toward the Pier. There I found my next clue the Sunscreen tube that I had brought. Jogging up the beach I found the object of my quest, the Tupperware container resting on the sand. As I approached my Tupperware I rejoiced at the blinking blue light of my phone resting inside with my keys and wallet. I had been saved. Thanking the Lord, I returned to the life guards and informed them of my discovery. I was going to be okay, but I was still a little sad that I would probably never seen the girl that had thought to help a stranger.

As I thought about the finality of it all and that I would never see this girl again, I pulled my phone out and I kid you not started writing out a post for K****** in the /r/huntingtonbeach  subreddit. As I struggled to mesh out what I wanted to say on the touchscreen keypad of my smart phone to thank this girl I looked up and you will never guess who was facetiming on the path in front of me. I exclaimed ""No way!"" and K****** turned around surprised to see me again and smiled as she saw the Tupperware I carried securely in my hand.

We talked and laughed. I introduced myself formally and asked about her. Turns out she was on her Spring Break with her parents staying in a nearby hotel. She was studying Music, as a singer in a college that was close to where I was staying in Claremont. I thanked her from the bottom of my heart for the simple act of helping a stranger in need. We chatted for a couple minutes and she looked at her phone and said she had to go. It could have been her parents, or maybe an unmentioned boyfriend texting her. I never asked. The foolish me didn't ask for her number.
I headed back towards my car kicking myself for not asking for her number when I should have. It had been an awesome day. I had truly had an adventure with all that comes with that. As I approached my truck I was also blessed to find my car without a ticket even though my meter had expired 40 minutes ago. As I drove home I realized that was the best two dollars I ever spent.

TL;DR: Spent $2 for parking to see the Pacific for the first time. Lose everything I own. Kind cute beach girl helps me search but then has to leave. I find everything I lost. Am sad about not getting to thank the kind girl. Run into the girl as writing a reddit post about her. Don't get girl's number."

I can't apply this year, as the deadline has already passed for applications. So, that being said I have a free year as of now up until September 2015. Unlike most of my peers, I don't want to go for an apprenticeship as I feel that would be a waste of my time. 

I have good skills in Python, C and Java -- most of my classmates haven't written a line of code since the start of the course. I also have a good understanding of algorithms, big O notation and some other mathematical aspects of programming.

I have applied for a few companies, who have said that my skills are fantastic however they would not consider me because they aren't taking ""juniors"". This is down to the assumptions they have about the course I have taken, skills and portfolio aside.

My ideal job is for a big 4 technology company, but I do not expect them to consider me as I do not have a degree nor do I feel adequate for that kind of position right now. An apprenticeship wouldn't help me progress to this stage, so I'd say the best choice for me right now would be an undergraduate-equivalent internship.

Does anyone have any advice on this kind of situation?"

So I dropped a post in this subreddit about a month ago about finding internships, and I received some awesome responses. 

As it turns out, I recently received an offer from a engineering consulting company out of dallas, tx! It is sort of what I am interested in, I would be kind of an assistant to an EE who's designing electrical systems for things like office buildings, housing complexes, etc. They even offer a stipend for housing/transportation, because they know I would have to relocate from California.

The problem is, in the offer they said they want a yes/no by March 17th, and I am still waiting to hear back from interviews (on-site with agilent) and applications that I think just haven't been evaluated yet.

I'm not against moving to Dallas for the summer, but obviously its not ideal. I'd prefer to work up in the Bay Area, since my family/friends are located there, and I could live at home for free. 

How should I go about making this decision? Because if I take the offer, I might miss a potential opportunity in the Bay. However if I don't take it, I could possibly not get another offer altogether.


Follow-up question about negotiating: Since I have this offer, and am waiting to hear back on a decision from Agilent for a co-op, should I email them [Agilent] and mention that I have another offer and need to hear back from them sometime next week? Or is this too much ""playing hardball"", as they say. Or, could I ask for more time on my decision from this dallas company?

I won't really need anymore courses but I guess I could take electives. I just want to know if an internship is this important? Also what if I decide to do the extra semester and I don't even find an internship (which seems to be common here). Thanks for your help.

I studied economics and finance and graduated with a mediocre GPA from a top tier public school.  I worked for a year after graduation at a financial consulting firm.  I found the pace tough and had a horrible work ethic at the time, so within 7 months I was let go.  I spent the next few months working on a farm and regrouping, I think took a job as a camp counselor, meanwhile taking database courses.  

I am now an intern at a french automotive company with a location in the US.  I am a database analyst and have been in the position for about 3 months.  It's a weird system where I start out as a ""trainee"" without any benefits and low pay- I am getting paid $20/hr, which is about 10k less than what I was making in consulting.  I am doing well at the job and the people are generally nice.  The issue though, other than the pay, is the lack of organization.  I haven't gotten clear directions, and there are some communication issues.  Regardless, I have taken initiative and tried to solve any problems I run into.  I do enjoy the level of decision making I have- I'm also on a team that is redesigning the company's data system.  I have taken a lot on my plate and generally work 10 hour days.  Though the ""traineeship"" can last as long as 18 months, it is not unheard of that one can move from trainee to full time in a few months.  I have asked about this possibility but have gotten no clear response.  For the amount of work I am doing, I really do not like my situation.  

-I like the autonomy, room for creativity, atmosphere.  This is a growing organization (the US branch is still growing, just broke even last year)
- Do not like the compensation, lack of certainty, and lack of employer concern.  

I asked today about full time potential again, and they said there is no possibility before 6/30, but no indication of after.   

Should I stick with this company where I have created a positive reputation and have potential to take on and lead new projects.

OR 

Should I make the move in searching for a more permanent defined role.  

BTW, this role has never existed before.  
 

I have suffered from depression and ADHD so I have to be careful about the jobs I take, so I'm reluctant to move around too much, but on the other hand I can't help but feel like I want more.  "

I recently graduated with an engineering degree. Throughout college I desperately searched for internships and failed. Once graduation neared I switched over to searching for a full time position. And failed. I spent about  two months unemployed after graduation. Then I received a phone call for a technical position. Somewhat related to my degree but far from what I wanted to do. After failing for so long through college, and slipping into a depression, I decided to take the job. The job was salaried, benefits, 401k but I took a massive underpay. 

Fast forward one month after I took the job. I was called by my dream job. Software engineer. The job offer includes everything, and even pays about 15k more. I'm going to take it. 

Now here's my dilemma, how do I quit a job where I'm still training? I've only been there for a month. Part of me wants to man up and just walk in and hand in a two weeks notice. But I know those two weeks will be hell, everyone will hate me. 

Should I just resign? Email, goodbye?

I need some professional advice. Anyone have experience in this situation?

- B.A. Economics &amp; Political Science, Ivy in Northeast - 3.1 G.P.A.
- 4 year service in USMC, honorably discharged, served in Afghanistan
- B.A. in Computer Science-Mathematics, another Ivy in Northeast.

I am literally sprinting through this second B.A. It's seriously difficult and my GPA is suffering (GPA about 2.7-2.8).  I started it last January and I'm finishing it this December.

Now, before you all start telling me to do better, I know, I'm working on it. But at this point with the graduate level math courses I'm taking, it's unlikely my GPA will rise much above a 3.0.

I am okay with this. I figure once I get my first or second job I can leave my GPA off future resumes. I just want to know what my next best bet would be to find a software engineering job. I have not had the time for personal projects or internships. 

I have a good chunk of cash saved up that is presently invested in Vanguard funds. I'm planning on living off of that while I do one of the following:

- Attend a ""Hacker School""
- Apply for full-time internships
- Work on my own portfolio of projects and attend conventions and network as much as possible.

Even with a poor GPA, I think I am still in a good position to be looking for jobs, potentially a great position in regards to defense contractors.

What do you think? How bad off am I? What steps should I take after I graduate in December?

I've recently accepted an offer to the wonderful company [thatgamecompany](http://thatgamecompany.com/) (the redundancy is quite funny isn't it)!

How I came into contact with the company was totally informal compared to what my previous imagination would have fancied. I also include a small tidbit of what advice I can muster for anyone else still attending school in a similar situation. I'll try to copy/paste the article here, but there is a picture of my awesome T-Shirt at my own website :)

[Link to article](http://www.randygaul.net/2014/03/10/thatgamecompany-internship/)

&gt;Recently inspired by my colleague Allen's interesting blog post about his hiring experience I've decided to follow suit and share my own experience on acquiring an internship the year before graduation!

&gt;I'm sure most anyone reading my blog knows of a company called thatgamecompany. I have recently been offered a summer internship! The company is an amazing one and I personally feel that I belong at such a place. I'll see how good of a fit we make in the coming months, though I remain extremely optimistic about the whole thing.

&gt;Smaller game companies seem to work like a mini-Valve in that the team structure is flat. When speaking with thatgamecompany's lead engineer John and researching the company I was drawn towards the way that John detailed about the internals of company working. One thing that stuck out to me most was that John had mentioned that often times a developer will get an idea, experiment and try it out and see how things go. If a good idea is placed into the game other employees will recognize this and ""hop on the bandwagon"" to work together to get to the next iteration. John had mentioned that he feels a good fit for a team structure like this are individuals with a lot of initiative. I myself strive for an environment that embraces initiative, experimentation and professional growth.

&gt;They even sent me one of their AWESOME T-Shirts! Special thanks to a particular someone's mom :)

&gt;So I've been struttin round with my snazzy shirt for weeks ever since I was made an offer. I think it would be fun to describe how I actually met John Edwards, one of the founders, in an effort to perhaps inspire others to do similar.

&gt;In my early studies at DigiPen I was hungry to find all resources that exist on the C++ topic of code reflection. thatgamecompany's lead engineer John Edwards had made some sample material available to students at my university a few years earlier, and at the end of his material he left his email in case anyone wanted to contact him.

&gt;Happy to have found the exact reference material I needed I implemented all that was presented, and then added a whole lot more atop. After feeling great about the results I emailed John thanking him for his contribution of knowledge and linked him to one of my portfolio videos. I do this with most people that give out GDC lectures or other types of online-material, as I know from experience that seeing others' work benefit from your own material grants a very rewarding feeling -like a sense altruism satiated.

&gt;John ended up liking my video and asked me to shoot him an email next year if I was interested in interning at thatgamecompany. At first (as a Sophomore) my mind wasn't on internships or hiring in any way, and I was really just lucky I sent him an email at all.

&gt;The interview process was actually super long spanning a couple months. Albeit Christmas did strike through the middle of the process, it was still long. The usual is programming tests, phone interviews followed by some form of in-person meetup and additional interviews; interviewing with thatgamecompany mostly followed this format. Knowing 3D math to point where it feels like a language in and of itself, and proficiency in C++ seem to be pretty much the only requirements to make oneself appealing as a potential hire (as for as tech skill goes for engineers). If anyone wants tips on how to practice for interviewing my advice would be to make sure you're proficient in your area of study. Beyond this I find that practicing writing code on a white-board helps for formal coding interviews, practicing with a mock-interviewer. For me personally the biggest practice was just repetition of mock coding interviews to keep me from being nervous. When I'm nervous my mind can go pretty blank.

&gt;Hopefully my luck will last out a little longer as I proceed towards graduation!

&gt;In this I would say the moral of the story is: people that write or put forth educational content always do so with an interest to teach others. If one is genuinely interested in the content and contacts the original authors with a thank you, they will inevitably be interested, especially if intelligent followup questions are asked. I would suppose that seeing others benefit and take interest in your area of study is just irresistible. It's a great way to thank wonderful people and educate yourself at the same time. I've done this with dozens of various authors of all sorts of content, and every single one of them has always responded very generously; I'm very thankful to them all for their willingness to help."
2046yi,1,2014-03-11,Irony of my suicide ideation.,failureasian,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2046yi/irony_of_my_suicide_ideation/,"Third year college student at one of the top liberal arts colleges here. I came from a small city in the Midwest, where education wasn't exactly the most advanced and I had no academic competition. I got into some top ~20ish universities but I feel like that was because the adcomms took a look at my test scores and EC work and said ""He'll do."" Truth is, my parents were the driving force behind all of my test prep and EC work, which ranged from volunteering at the hospital, donating to food shelter, and working at various summer research internships. 

Once I got to college, however, I completely fucked up. I didn't party excessively, do drugs, or even socialize that much. I felt kind of isolated, tired of forcing myself to put on a happy face and make &amp; maintain friends. Instead, I spent most of my time surfing the web, watching tv shows and movies, and generally procrastinating. In my 5 semesters at college, I've gotten 3 Cs, lots of Bs, and not enough As. The main point of my worry is that I claim to be on the pre-med track, but actually don't really know what to do with myself, and can't find a suitable replacement for a physician so I can back out of the pre-med track. 

I also feel like I've been a disappointment for my parents, bringing in so many terrible grades and pretty much killing any hopes of getting into a DO school, let alone MD school. Every time I go back for break, they give me a sincere lecture on how they hope I will push myself, study harder, and get my grades up, and every time I nod in agreement. I really want to improve my grades, but as soon as I arrive on campus, I lose my motivation to study for my classes.

My Cs have been in organic chemistry and psychopharmacology, and I'm pretty sure another one will come from biochemistry this semester. The irony in my ideations is that my suicide plan is to buy equal ratios of concentrated formic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid, mix them in a confined space, and listen to music while I drift to sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning. 

I really don't know how to handle my life, I feel like I'm a disappointment to my parents, and I feel like I could never repay their patience."

I worked 2 years at a company as a software engineering intern while I was in school. Unfortunately right as I was graduating they had a budget freeze and weren't able to bring me on full time.

So I went out into the job market. Had a lot of interviews and actually had about 5 offers over a few months. The best offer overall was in another department for the same company. Unfortunately this was a test position. The main product in this department is a lighting control system that also has associated software. When interviewing they played up the automated testing that would be associated with the position.

I took this position. Now I find out the software product is shipping in a couple of months. The next product we will be working on in the foreseeable future is more of a firmware project. I'm also hearing rumblings about doing all the automated testing in labview!

The job is laid back and pays better than any of the other software engineering positions I saw and the company has the best benefits I've ever seen. I am exposed to many different technologies, including SOME programming. If my goal is to move into development, is working in test going to hinder that? I'm afraid I might have taken the best short term option and destroyed my long term options. Any advice would be appreciated."

I'm just so lost right now.",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2053ef/recent_grad_bsba_accounting_low_gpa_and_had_to/,"My GPA was about 2.5 upon graduation due to things that I would find too personal to disclose to an interviewer (ranging to what I've been told were symptoms of PTSD from a parent's death in conjunction with trying to perform CPR on another person later who ultimately died to marital separation). Just, the last 3 years of my life have been T-total hell in that regard.

My associates is in Computer Science, I had a nearly 4.0 GPA, was in all the community college's academic honor societies, etc., before these life situations--that is the best reflection of my typical performance, IMO, too bad it was at the beginning of my college career. I finished college with ~$8700 in subsidized government loans because I had scholarships from academic performance in my beginning at college (I say this only to say I haven't had a crappy record for my entire college career). 

I also have 153 semester hours from the major switch, but I'm not sure if I meet the accounting hour requirements for the CPA exam. I'm confused by which classes count for upper division, lower division, w/e. I graduated in Alabama, had to move home to Tennessee, and have also considered looking in and around Atlanta, GA, so I wouldn't be opposed to taking the CPA exam in any of those 3 states.

I don't have any internship experience. I didn't have any bites for internships, and I've worked unrelated jobs just trying to finish school (largely cashiering in grocery stores, but some other things). I've worked for VITA the past 3 tax seasons, and worked for a small accounting office while doing VITA this tax season as well. I just wanted to get any experience I could possibly get.

I just don't even know where to go from here. I'm kind of lost. That may sound strange but... I have no idea where to start with this. I have no one I can ask for help or guidance. I'm the only one in my family to even graduate college, and I feel like this experience has been an uphill battle and reinventing the wheel the whole way. I mean, there were times I was going to class 3 days a week, hand washing dishes from Friday-Sunday, and volunteering for VITA the rest of my spare time.

I had an alumni say to me that I was ""working a job sophomores would be working"" in the most condescending tone you can imagine, when all I could think was: ""I'd love to start a career somewhere, but no one has called me back and I can't refuse a job that's giving me food and a means to get to school just because it's not up to your standards and you were *so* much better off than me when you were at my level."" 

I just... I don't know where to begin. I feel afraid of not starting my career, financial strain makes it necessary to do whatever I can possibly do when an opportunity arrives, but I don't know where to even go. I've had to move to a completely different state than my university, and I don't have many connections at all."

205adx,1,2014-03-11,Need help choosing between two internship offers,AwkwardActually,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/205adx/need_help_choosing_between_two_internship_offers/,"I am an undergraduate student (junior) majoring in finance and Chinese. I am very interested in international finance with a focus on the East Asian market. I've secured two offers for summer internships and am at a complete loss for what to choose. For either company there is a good chance of getting a full-time offer after graduation, so this internship will greatly impact my future career path.

**Offer 1** is from a large US bank in their commercial banking department. 

* Pros: Great pay, located in the same city as where I go to college, big name would look great on my resume. Since it is a large bank, I would learn a lot about finance and the industry that could be easily transferable to other jobs in finance.
* Cons: I'm not extremely interested in commercial banking but it could be a good stepping stone to a more lucrative career. This bank's operations are domestically focused so I would not get the international exposure that I want. This bank was hurt badly by the great recession and is still in the recovery process.

**Offer 2** is from an East Asian automaker in their capital services area. The internship would be in their headquarters abroad.

* Pros: International experience, I would get to travel to a country I have always wanted to visit, they have a large presence in China. This company, while not as large as the bank, is still a fortune 500 company and has experienced significant growth in the past decade. 
* Cons: They are only paying me a third of what the bank is offering. I do not speak the native language (though I would be willing to learn) nor do I have a particular interest in the automotive industry (though I would be willing to learn). The headquarter country still has a lot of issues with gender inequality and the automotive industry is already so male-dominated, I worry if I continue working with this company I may hit a glass ceiling, so to speak. Also, auto finance is a more specific line of work with skills that would not be as easily transferable. 

Personally, I would LOVE to take the internship abroad for purely personal reasons, but I know I need to focus on the long-term career impact of my decision. Another issue is that money is definitely a factor for me. With the bank offering my 3x more pay, it is really hard for a cash-strapped college student to turn down that offer. Is it acceptable to try to negotiate salary with the foreign firm? 

So which offer should I take? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

  companies and VC firms recruit, e.g. UWaterloo, MIT, CMU, UW, Caltech,
  Oxbridge, Edinburgh. Essentially, be near the top for at least one computing
  discipline.

Additionally, some people have suggested adding:

* **Application Method**: How you applied to the company. Was it via on-campus
  recruiting, a career fair, internal referral, their careers page, etc...

* **Application Process**: Something as simple as a date range, e.g. `Applied:
  9/25, Offered: 10/12` or a detailed explanation of the interview process.
  Whatever you feel works best!

206hyz,4,2014-03-11,[For Hire] seeking an internship or entry level position in software development(CALIFORNIA),[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/206hyz/for_hire_seeking_an_internship_or_entry_level/,"I live in SoCal but am willing to relocate almost anywhere. I am self taught in Java programming and have been studying full time for close to half a year. Some projects I have made include a client/server chat program using Java and Swing, a Reddit web crawler using Java, and an Android app that searches for movies and returns top 10 results. 

Went to school for a degree in business and found out I hated it half way through, at this point I just decided to finish the degree. After college I landed a QA internship which led to a full time salaried career. Did manual testing these 2 years and decided that I want to do more and so I began self teaching programming.

Please pm if you want to see my resume or github. I am very in love with programming and am open to learn any technology required for the job."

In my last two years I obtained an internship working as a support member in an algorithm development team half-time.  I got along great with the whole team, and this is where I began to learn programming.  I have become quite proficient in Python, and have been picking up a little Java and more OOP practices as I've been going along since my internship ended.  
  
I would really like to turn software development/engineering into my permanent career, however I am having a lot of trouble finding a places that are willing to give me a chance; i.e. an interview.  I know I'm at a disadvantage since I don't have a CS major, or much to show (as of now, but I'm working on that).  Some people have suggested that I look into Web Dev, but I'm just not all to thrilled with that idea.  When I think back to what I enjoyed the most about my internship, it was the problem solving and the science/engineering involved developing the product that they sold.  
  
I would really like to find a position working for a company that produces a product, and not so much a service.  I know that this probably severely limits my options, but I think this is where I would thrive the most.  I am starting to get to a turning point where I am ready to start flaunting what I've learned and how to apply it to real world situations.  So my questions is: Where do I go from here?  I'm not necessary looking to do embedded programing (but not opposed either), but I would really like to find some place where I assist in creating something that ends up in the real world.  Some examples of stuff that would interest me would be; software for guidance systems, machine vision, automotive computing, GPS systems/navigation, personal electronics, etc.  
  
I hope this has been clear enough.  My experience and knowledge of professional software lingo and roles is still somewhat limited.  Thanks in advance for you responses and advice.  It is greatly appreciated."

2089ui,350,2014-03-12,Beneath the ice,jdpatric,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2089ui/beneath_the_ice/,"Lake Vostok is covered by some 4,000 meters of ice. It’s been cut off from the world by the thick ice sheet for approximately fifteen million years. The water is kept liquid by the massive pressure exerted by the ice above, and possibly by geothermal heat from beneath the Earth’s crust. The Antarctic summer is the only time the continent can be regularly inhabited due to the incredible cold. In 2011 Russia began drilling to reach Lake Vostok. It’s thought that the water can offer a unique view on life that has evolved separated from the rest of the world for fifteen million years.

In 2012 I was a PhD student and was lucky enough to be able to work with a Russian scientist on examining the ice cores created by the lake drilling. Once the drill was just above the surface of the lake it would be extracted slowly, drawing the water up the borehole. This water was no longer under the massive pressure that kept the rest of the water liquid and it would freeze in the borehole, creating a plug. This plug itself could be drilled out and studied. I was one of the interns who made the trip to Antarctica in the summer of 2012. We finished our work in early February and left the next day. 

Once we had the cores back to the lab we were able to safely analyze them. We’ve been keeping them frozen to analyze the dissolved particles and gasses as they are in the lake. There are some theories that the many subglacial lakes under Antarctica are connected via passageways. This would mean that we’re studying not just one, but all of the lakes under the ice. This past year we finally got the go ahead to let one of the cores thaw. We’d finally be able to analyze water that hasn’t seen the light of day in thousands of years, quite possibly far longer than that.

I cut a small section of the deepest core, the one right next to the water’s surface, into an enclosed environment and began to gradually increase the temperature above 0° C. We wanted to capture the gasses as they were let off, so we had a small balloon-like device working to capture and monitor the gas release. The device is very sensitive and can basically tell if you’ve eaten seafood in the last six months, for example. It immediately picked up on an incredibly high oxygen level in the water. We knew that there would be a lot of dissolved oxygen in the water, due to the enormous pressure above it, but the water seemed to have enough oxygen in the water to support all manner of living things. The PhD I was working with, also one of the smartest people I knew personally, and probably one of the smartest people alive at the time, said, and I quote, “if a dinosaur were alive today he could probably breathe that water to survive.” Now, I know he was joking, the age of the water was probably ~13,000 years give or take due to the residence time of Lake Vostok, but he was at the very least a little bit serious about the water having a high enough oxygen content to sustain life.


We tested several other gasses from the water and found that it contained nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and several other trace gasses that were in such small amounts they could have been introduced by a dying lizard or fish as it swam by millennia ago. We just kept coming back to the high oxygen count. When the dinosaurs were alive the temperature on earth was much greater, and the oxygen in the atmosphere was also much higher. After the entire sample had melted we took stock of our information and finally found the first trace of life in the new water.

It appeared as though several species of algae had evolved to withstand the incredible temperature and the massive pressure of the water. It thrived in the oxygen rich water, feeding off of small inorganic particles that were carried by the massive glacier above. No light made its way that deep, so the algae were small and mostly stuck to the bottom of the glacier. It was amazing; I had the information I needed for my thesis, the PhD I was working with was surely going to win yet another award, and we were both going to be famous. But then catastrophe struck.

The man I was working with, at this point I can call him a friend, suffered a massive stroke during the following night. He stayed on life support for several days, only briefly coming to consciousness a few times. He said goodbye to his loved ones, those still living, and told me to continue my research with his blessing. He lingered for about a week before finally passing due to another stroke. I was devastated. I knew the man professionally, but in the past several years we’d spent enough time together that I regarded him as a second father in my life.

Finally after two weeks off I decided to go back into the lab. Only…everything wasn’t the same. I don’t mean that it wasn’t the same doing my research without my mentor. I understood that, my brain could comprehend it. I didn’t like it, but I know that no one lives forever. The lab had changed. Something seemed different as soon as I walked in the door. The sample looked like it was in a different spot; I was sure I’d left it in its balloon/container, but yet it was sitting now directly on our lab table. It was still in an airtight location, but I wasn’t about to just leave it there on the table, so I again moved it inside the balloon. The remainder of the core was still frozen in storage…or so I thought. We had each core separated to prevent cross contamination. It was very unlikely, but we basically went with the “why risk it?” mentality, and it paid off; the deepest core had thawed completely. There was a short in the circuitry of the refrigeration unit for that specific core. It had nearly caught fire. We had one core that was close to it, and decided to defrost a section of that core next.

While doing so we filmed it via a high speed camera for future use. We wanted to see in many frames the structure of the ancient water as it broke down and became liquid again. It was an interesting experiment until the camera appeared to be malfunctioning. The levels of dissolved organic compounds in the water were unusually high. High enough that it was as though a large creature had died in the water before it was frozen. Particles we usually found in large fresh water bodies such as the American Great Lakes were found in abundance in this sample. The camera was actually capturing sediments trapped in the frozen water at the surface of the lake; something had to have disturbed them. My supervisor, another PhD, requested permission to return to Antarctica for the summer of 2013-2014. We nearly didn’t make it due to the US government shutdown, but our project was one of the few that were spared the axe.

I arrived in January and began setting up shop at our scientific outpost. We had been partnering with the Vostok Station, but due to the shutdown and several poor coordination policies our spot in Vostok had been booked so to speak. Our solution was to use a more dated facility that had since been abandoned. Basically everything inside was frozen solid when our team arrived, but we were able to thaw what we needed and replace the rest, and within our first week we had a fully functioning station.

The borehole we were using was situated directly below the station. It made for easy access during the coldest months of the year, and was designed to be able to operate year round. The hole had been drilled prior to my arrival and was simply waiting to be cored when I landed. The core process is incredibly intricate; the drill pulls the cores up from beneath the ice and a sharp blade cuts them to a specified length, and so that they fit inside our building. Once we’ve reached the bottom core the drill uses itself to plug the hole and the water inside freezes again creating more samples from the lake.

I was to have two assistants and my supervisor, but due to my expertise on the matter, and the fact that I’d worked so much on the initial project, I was to be handling most of the work on the project. This was great for me; I enjoyed it, and I really felt like I was going to have an incredible thesis and a fantastic starting point for my post grad career. 

Things were going smoothly until the drill became lodged in the borehole. The assistants were both undergrads at the university I went to. One of them wasn’t properly operating the drill and managed to get it lodged at a very slight angle in the hole. Over 4,000 meters a slight angle can be catastrophic, but the bit didn’t shear; it was just stuck. This required a specialist to dislodge. I had a few small core samples and a solid scientific lab onsite so I continued my analysis.

The technician arrived and informed us that the end of the bit was likely going to fall into the lake when he removed the rod; indicating we’d need a new drill. We’d still be able to core out the “plug” that would form, but we’d need to get a new bit for future boreholes. My supervisor decided that he would be taking both of my assistants with him once we had enough cores for me to work with. I’ve been alone before in our research base in Antarctica, so I wasn’t really bothered by this prospect. We cored out the plug and I had several thousand meters of newly frozen lake water to work with. They left the following day, leaving me alone, presumably for a period of three weeks.

The first few days after they left I didn’t have any problems. I hadn’t melted any of the samples yet. As soon as I went to melt the very first one, a sample of about five kilograms, I began to run into problems. While it was melting I had our camera on it for posterity, I looked away and the fragment had moved completely out of the frame. Just like that, maybe two or three seconds. I quickly ran into the lab to check the gear and the sample. The ambient temperature in the room was only slightly above freezing, but there was already a small puddle of water around the core on the tray. I replaced it and went back to my observation room where I’d be able to watch in relative warmth that the lab didn’t offer.

Back in the observation room I noticed that the door leading to the sleeping quarters and kitchen was slightly ajar. That was a big no-no; we didn’t like to leave compartment doors open in case of a bad storm, like the one we were having; if the outer compartment was breached the inner compartments needed to remain warm enough to support…life…well, us. Sure, we had emergency survival suits, and backup plans with backups, but I was sure I’d closed that door.

Nothing else seemed to happen that day, and I went to bed without incident. When I woke I could hear the storm hammering loudly on the outside of the building. It was intense. The weather report for the station was 90 kilometer per hour winds, and a driving blizzard. The temperature was below -60° C. It was close to condition 1 weather; the worst it can get. Luckily for me I was happily going to work on another sample today, this time extracting the dissolved oxygen and studying how it increased or decreased with depth in the borehole. That was what I was going to do…until I got into the lab. My sample was gone. The initial sample I’d melted the previous day had vanished. It hadn’t evaporated, the air in the lab was filtered and climate controlled; if any evaporated it wouldn’t have been the entire sample.

I was perplexed, and I began to think that there was someone else in the facility. It wasn’t a large base, there weren’t many places for someone to hide, but I began to see things. Right as I went into the kitchen that night for dinner I briefly saw what looked like a person running from the room as I entered. I just saw a shadow…it might have been my imagination, but it really looked like a person. 

The power went out that night; the facility blew a fuse. I was awoken by bitter cold and an alarm that should have woken me earlier. I quickly dressed and went to swap the fuse with a good one. Once I got to the electrical panel I was standing at the end of a long dark hallway about forty meters long. I briefly shined my light all the way down to the end and managed to see a person duck behind the next hall. I put the new fuse in, flipped the power and tore off in a run, determined to catch my target. I rounded the bend and…nothing, no person, no surprise, just nothing. Puzzled, I made my way back to my room and tried to fall back to sleep. The storm was still hammering on the side of the building, and it was doing so with an eerie frequency; it seemed to have a rhythm to it…I began to think that maybe something was stuck to the side of the building and floundering against the wall in the extreme wind. I laid there for hours until I finally fell asleep for a few minutes before I had to wake to begin the day.

My day finally began to get better when I was analyzing a small piece of sediment that appeared to have come from the lake bottom. It was incredibly old, and actually had a small amount of algae that had accumulated on what I assumed to be the upward facing side of the particle. I was looking into the microscope when something heavy fell off of the table behind me. Startled, I quickly went to turn around and bumped my microscope, moving my sample without realizing it. When I looked back into the microscope I saw blood. Not mine, not human for that matter, it was brown, which made me think it was dead blood, but there were living blood cells that I’d never seen before on my slide! I had made a breakthrough! It was incredible. I’d discovered a type of life that had evolved on its own separated from the rest of Earth for millions of years! My jubilation, however, was short lived; how were the cells alive? They were floating in water cold enough to freeze yet remaining liquid due to the incredible pressure placed on top of it. Most living creatures don’t possess the proper coping mechanisms to live through this…let alone to produce a blood cell that can live outside the body in these conditions.

I began to quickly test the remainder of my sample, and sure enough there were more blood cells floating freely in the water. This was amazing! I was suddenly far less concerned with the odd things that had been happening around the facility. Nearly two weeks had gone by since my colleagues had left to get a new drill bit, and here I was making an earthshattering discovery that was going to lead to the next “Galapagos Islands,” except this time it was under 4,000 meters of ice in one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth. I went to bed that night under full condition 1 weather. It was bad. Warning claxons went on and off throughout the night indicating gusts of well over 100 kilometers per hour. The temperature had dipped to a record low for the month of March; -80° C. The facility could withstand this onslaught, or at least it was designed to handle much worse. 

I woke around 1:00 am local time to a loud smashing sound on the side of the building. The walls were double thick and insulated by a vacuum space between the outer and inner walls, yet something was banging on it loud enough to wake me. I knew I couldn’t go outside in condition 1 so I tried in vain to go back to sleep until I again noticed an odd pattern to the banging. I’ll describe it best I can.

After it repeated a few times I thought that it might be Morse code, and had the horrifying thought that there might be someone trapped outside our station. Maybe my colleagues had returned and I was basically ignoring their pleas for help. I ran to the monitoring station where we had a CCTV camera attached to the outside that we could use to monitor the main entry door. I quickly flicked it on and found, to my dismay that it was fully iced over. I could see only a small corner of the door and ice. I was about to give up when I briefly saw a shadow on the door. Someone WAS there! I ran to get fully dressed. I was going to have to break the rules and open the door and airlock to condition 1 weather. No one is allowed outside in this weather, but if someone was already out there…something bad had happened, maybe there’d been an accident on the return trip and they’d been unable to alert me?

I ran back to the door as best as my thick clothes would allow and flicked on the light to the airlock and the outside. I opened the first door and found the airlock filled with frozen moisture that had accumulated on the walls and floor. The door was nearly frozen shut. I clipped a safety rope to my waist and then to the railing on the wall and forced the door open. If I hadn’t clipped in…I probably wouldn’t be here today; the door was ripped from my hands in a massive wind gust and I fell straight into the abyss.

After struggling to stand for a few seconds I saw that no one was there. The entryway was slightly out of the elements, but for the most part it was in the thick of the storm. I tried screaming to see if anyone was nearby and I couldn’t even hear myself. I glanced towards where my sleeping quarters were, now fully illuminated by the outside lights, and saw two sizeable dents in the wall. I couldn’t see any further than that…it was only a few meters anyways, and I decided that I had lost it. I reached for the door to shut it and head back inside when I thought I saw something in the snow.

Eyes can play tricks on you when you are staring into snow so thick that visibility is limited to a distance of a few meters in winds so severe you can barely stand upright while holding onto a safety rope. But…I could see a figure standing in the snow. That shouldn’t be possible; no one should be able to stand upright in this without support, and yet I could see all the way through the madness and clearly tell the outline of a person as I had turned to go back inside. I quickly stopped and tried to yell at them…but as I did so I moved suddenly and had to readjust my glance. They were gone. Had I imagined it again?

I had to get inside. I grabbed the heavy door and tried to drag it shut, but my feet weren’t catching on the slippery terrain. I ended up having to tie the safety rope around one of the railings on the doors and use the wall railings for leverage to pull it shut from inside the airlock. As soon as I was surrounded by an odd sense of silence. The storm was still raging outside, but suddenly my overloaded ears were ringing in the relative silence of the airlock. I made my way back to my quarters and noticed that the banging had picked up again. Something had to have come loose from the facility. It had to be stuck to the walls. That was the only rational explanation.

I forced myself to sleep. It wasn’t easy. Finally it happened. When I woke I was greeted by a call saying that my colleagues had again been delayed due to the horrible weather. They were going to have to emergently evacuate me soon if things didn’t improve. The bit was ready to be delivered, but they couldn’t access the station. The goal was to get station drill-capable again before full winter kicked in. Meanwhile, I continued my research and made one of the most amazing discoveries of the millennium.

There was tissue in one of our frozen samples. TISSUE! Our drill had hit a living creature in the water under the ice. Whether the creature survived or not I had no idea, but our drill had managed to hit it and cut a small sample of tissue. I immediately went to record my findings and report to our home base, but as I did I noticed our communications were down. I tried to connect to the internet and was greeted with the spinning wheel of lag; nothing. I was now cut off from the outside world. 

As soon as this happened I heard an alarm that I hadn’t heard before. The severe weather alarms were shrill and short; this one was louder and longer. I ran to my instrument panel to figure out what it was…water was coming up the borehole into the station. That shouldn’t have been possible; the ice should have frozen all the way up to the top long ago, and created a plug. Like an artesian well the water under pressure would have a certain head to it and come so high up the tube before finally equalizing and remaining stationary. We’d calculated that distance as being less than 3,900 meters from the surface of the lake. We should have had 100 meters of safety, but when I ran into the borehole room I was greeted by several centimeters of water sloshing about. I had waterproof boots, and quickly donned them. 

The borehole was open. The ice plug…gone. I looked down it with a light, and as far as I could see the ice was gone. We needed to seal the hole in a hurry. The hole was only about fifteen centimeters in diameter, but water seemed to be coming up from the depths…apparently our calculations were wrong. I began to run the drill controls. The bit itself was gone, but with nothing to impede it I could insert the remainder into the borehole and use it as a plug…the only problem was the ambient temperature in the room. I suddenly noticed that it was warm…unusually so. I had to flood the room with the outside air, and then the water would freeze in moments. There were vents in the ceiling that could be manually opened allowing the harsh air in, for just such an occasion, only we didn’t expect to have to do so in condition 1 weather. I quickly climbed up and cranked the lever opening both the inner and outer walls. The air whipped in through the slits and the temperature dropped to freezing in moments. With the drill in place the water began to solidify nicely, I was then able to remove it and let the hole freeze over as before…only I had no idea what’d caused the thaw.

I made my way back to my sample to find that it was gone. That was the last straw. My equipment was disturbed, slides moved, and my groundbreaking discovery was missing. I made to go cut a new sample and as I did I opened the door to our freezer room, which was actually normally slightly warmer than the outside temperature at present, and found…that everything had defrosted. Our 4,000 meter ice core was sloshing about on the floor of the facility slowly freezing again. My samples were ruined. I was about to storm out of the room when I noticed something lying on a shelf near the back of the room. If the ice had defrosted nothing should be there. I went to investigate…and it looked like a mummified corpse. It was black, blue and withered. Shriveled into a contorted position and it looked like it had too many limbs. Suddenly it started crawling towards me, using more than two arms, and maybe an extra leg. I fell backwards and caught myself on a shelf before I landed in the water. I was trudging through several centimeters of water to begin with, and now I was running. It moved on the shelf about waist high and climbed around the outer edge to get to the next level up. I reached the door moments before it did and slammed it, locking the sample room as I did. I opened the ceiling vents to try to freeze the room…and whatever was inside it…and then realized that this probably wouldn’t bother it much if it’d been living where I thought it had.

I ran to the crew quarters and locked myself in. I had access to the kitchen, living quarters, and sleeping quarters, without having to go near the lab. I was going to be emergently evacuated soon…I could just wait it out. Except…I couldn’t be reached via coms at present. I tried to access our communications and found that the internet was back, but that our radio communications were down. I had several messages asking if I was OK; apparently they were receiving emergency distress beacons from within our lab. The water alarm had also caught their attention. I told them what had happened and they didn’t believe me. Told me I was crazy. Maybe I was. I was alone in the Antarctic, and I’d been there for nearly a month. They likened it to an astronaut on the ISS suffering from anxiety. I managed to calm myself down a little. The CCTV’s showed nothing moving anywhere else on the station. I grabbed a flare gun and a pry bar; I had no other weapons, and slowly made my way through back to the lab. Everything seemed…normal. I received a report that they were sending an emergency transport to pick me up the following morning. The weather was going to break for the last time before full winter and they were going to deliver the parts for the drill, get me and go. I still had to pack up some equipment and whatever samples I could save.

I avoided the sample room at all costs. The lab still had a few samples under lock and key and I quickly placed those in our freezer coolers for transport and grabbed a few pieces of equipment that we’d need back at home base. I needed to visit the sample room eventually…I needed to inspect for damages and deactivate the internal thermostat. It was still on to keep the temperature regulated and I’d need to do that from inside. The room had been freezing for several hours and when I cracked the door open the water was several centimeters high frozen on the door. I carefully trekked across to the far side of the room and turned the thermostat to nil; letting the outside air control the temperature for the winter. I carefully watched the waist high shelves where our ice cores had once lain and made my way back to the door as quickly as I could. When I was nearly there I caught movement and looked up.

There it was, on the very top shelf, frozen nearly solid. Reaching for me and the door as best it could, but the ice was finally freezing it to where it couldn’t move. I swung wildly at it with the pry bar and it managed to grab it out of my hand. I slipped and caught myself on the handle. The thing tried to slink down the shelves as it had earlier, but its previous grace was gone and it was cracking ice off of its arms as it moved. I slammed the door and locked it once again. I didn’t have a camera on the inside, but I could hear its stiff movements…the ice breaking from its limbs as it moved. It was like ice fishing; the water had finally frozen the fish.

As I slowly backed away from the room I heard a light humming sound and realized that something had closed the vents from the inside. I was done. I returned to my quarters and locked the doors yet again. That night before the storm abated it struck again, hard. I could hear the same weather alarms, and finally the banging on the walls again. It seemed different that night though…almost defeated.

The banging eventually subsided and I never actually fell asleep. The weather slowed down shortly before morning, and once it was truly morning, it wasn’t actually light outside, but 8:00 am our time, I was finally close to leaving. My colleague radioed in, yes my radio had finally came back; apparently the storm was blocking the communications to some degree, he was less than thirty minutes away. After a short wait with all of my gear ready to walk out the door I was alerted to our main airlock being opened. I thought I’d have received another call, but maybe he made it early. I went to check and there was no one there. No snowmobile, no vehicle, no people. Puzzled, I stood around for a moment until I saw footprints leading away from the facility, and into the snow. There seemed to be too many of them…and they were bare footprints...the gait seemed to be off. A fresh snow was falling, and I was about to take a picture of them when I again realized…no one would believe me.

I went back inside and received a burst transmission from the Russian Vostok Station. It was static-filled and mostly incoherent. They must’ve known that I didn’t speak Russian because the voice was speaking heavily accented English. It was hard to decipher, but I finally could make out a few words. “We…tried…warm.” It didn’t make sense at first so I replayed it several times, eventually I realized they weren’t saying “warm,” but instead…”warn.” Startled I deleted the message and backed away from my computer until I heard the airlock door open again. I grabbed a different pry bar and went to investigate. This time it was my ride. I loaded the sled and got out of there as quickly as I could.

The Russians in the Vostok Station had been carrying out a similar experiment to ours using a different cored location a few miles away. Their schedule was a few weeks ahead of ours, however, and I can only assume they came to the same conclusion as I did.

It isn’t around.  
I’m sad.  
  
A new radio sits on my desk, a reward for becoming head of security.   
Not a reward I wanted.   
  
I get a call. Its an IT intern, he’s helping our head of sales with her computer and apparently it’s causing trouble.  

&gt;Intern: Hey, this lady is asking for you. She says she needs the boss.   
&gt;Me: Okay put her on the phone.   
&gt;Sales: Hey Airz, heard about the new promotion. Congratulations.   
  
She said this entire line with such distain I could hear venom dripping off every word.  
  
&gt;Sales: I need you to get up here and fix this machine. The tech you sent up can’t handle it.  
&gt;Me: I’m sure he can. Put him back on.  
&gt;Intern: Yep Im back.   
&gt;Me: Whats wrong with the machine?  
&gt;Intern: Nothing major, just a hard disk error. It probably needs replacing.  
&gt;Me: Okay pack it up and bring it down.  
  
As I wonder how far I can stretch a budget for HDD that currently sits at zero I hear through the phone an argument erupt.   
  
&gt;Sales: You can’t take it, give me the phone I want to talk to your boss. We NEED this machine.  
&gt;Intern: It needs replacing Im afraid…. You know what? Okay, here.  
  
I hear the phone crackle as it passes between the two.  
  
&gt;Sales: You need to get up here now, and sort this issue out. He keeps trying to take the desktop away.  
&gt;Me: Yes unfortunately I think it’ll need replacing. It’ll be back soon though don’t worry.  
&gt;Sales: No.  
&gt;Me: No?  
&gt;Sales: No.   
&gt;Me: Okay. No. It’ll stay as it is.  
&gt;Sales: No. You get up here and fix it.  
  
I look out over the department. I see other techs doing work.   
I feel bad for the intern who’s at sales dealing with this lady.  
I give in.   
  
&gt;Me: Fine. Ill be up in a sec.  
  
I get up to the floor. I can see intern looking glad to see me, I send him back downstairs with a smile and an order for coffee.  
  
I sit at the computer. The HDD is corrupted.   
  
&gt;Me: This computer will have to come with me I’m afraid.   
&gt;Sales: No, it stays.   
&gt;Me: I can’t fix it here.  
&gt;Sales: You’ll stay here till its fixed.  
&gt;Me: No?  
&gt;Sales: Im going to call the VP.  
&gt;Me: Okay.  
  
We waited around till the VP arrived, he gave me a big smile. I knew he worshiped the feet of Sales however. Its where the money comes from.   
  
&gt;VP: It does seem like you’ll have to fix it here. I must insist.  
  
I sigh, and look around for any coffee. There wasn’t any.   
Im getting out my screwdrivers and staring intently at the back of the VP’s head. It didn’t explode. I was sad.  
  
It was at this point that my radio crackles to life.  

&gt;Radio: All security please report to main desk immediately.  
  
I smile flashes across my features.  

&gt;Me: Oh dear. Im afraid I have to go… security head and all.  
  
Turns out security had been given a box of chocolates.   
I took one.   
It was nice.   
Perks of the job I guess.

208mwy,94,2014-03-12,Today I learned about speed.,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/208mwy/today_i_learned_about_speed/,"Let me give some preface points to help you understand the situation. 

* I am intern at a local repair store.

* I man the front desk when the secretary isn’t in. She’s been sick for a couple days.

* I'm your average intern/college student. Hoody, presentable pants, backpack full of necessary things. A little bit on the hefty side. Kinda clueless and prone to confusion.

* I usually think a bit before I talk, results in a slow drawl.

Story time.

Usually I’m only scheduled to come in on Thursdays and Fridays. However, my boss doesn’t mind if I pop in and help whenever I want. When I’m not in school I usually have nothing better to do besides video games and help out down at the store.

Today I should’ve stayed home and played video games.

 I pop in the back door and everything is hunky dorey. Drop my backpack by the fridge and ask Mr.Bossman what needs to be done.

“Secretary is still sick. Do you wanna man the front desk?”

‘Course I do! Customers are much more fun than chopping my hands to bits on old sharp computers. (I’m not pointing any specific brand out, but it starts with a *C* and ends with a *ompaq*.)

I put on my company hat and set myself at the desk. Yeah, we wear hats inside. We’re cool like that. First hour goes by, only Mr.Bossman’s mom coming to visit him. Twiddle my thumbs a bit. Another hour goes by. Only a couple customers just checking in on their computers. I help one out, he pays and is on his way. 

My thought’s right before moment that ended all plans for the rest of the day included something along these lines,”This is so boring. How far can this chair tip back. Hmm... not too far. That’s kinda lame. Wish I had something to do.”

**YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED MORTAL**

This tiny man bursts into the shop. He must’ve been 5 feet tall max. He rushes up to the desk and slaps his computer down. A full tower, right on the desk. just slaps it there. 

Shorty: *Hey mister my computer is broken my brother likes to play with the bios hes such an ass he doesnt listen when I tell him that will break it...*

Now that he set the computer down I got a good look at him. The man looked like he was just skin draped over a wire frame. From the way he was twitching and talking someone had probably plugged that wireframe into an outlet not too long ago.

Shorty: *...he does stuff like that all the time he doesn't listen can you fix it?*

Me: Yeah, I think we can fix it. Shouldn’t be too tough. Do you know what he did in the BIOS?”

Shorty: *I dunno he just does stuff its not working I think he did it but its broken can you fix it?*

Me: Yeah, we should be able to. Here, write down your contact information on this form. Does the computer have a password? 

Shorty: *Yeah it has a password it’s* ***super speed gibberish***

 Me: I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.

Shorty: ***slower super speed gibberish***

Me: Again please?

Shorty: *a... b... c... 1... 2... 3...* (Password has been changed for ""papers I signed"" reasons)

Me: Thanks, once you’re done just set that paper on top of the computer there and we’ll take care of it for ya. 

Shorty: ***slaps paper on tower***

You’d think that was the end, that he’d leave then right? That’s what I thought. Boy was I wrong. Rocking in the chair and spinning the drive, noticed his reflection in the disk. 

Me: Uh, is there anything else you need help with sir?

Shorty: *Yes can you put some stuff in the computer for me please id like that itd make it so much better and I’d be so happy*

Me: Come again?

Shorty: *Can you put some stuff in it please*

Me: That depends. What kind of stuff do you want put in it? 

Shorty: Whazzat ***points at the drive***

Me: That’s a hard drive. It holds all your information.

Shorty: *I want some of those please put them in the computer*

Me: Okay, how big of a drive do you want?

Shorty: *The biggest you have I have a lot of videos they need a lot of room it sucks having such little room I want bigger please do that*

Me: The biggest one we have is two terabytes. Your model has a 200gb drive in it. Two terabytes is about 10 of what you have there. 

Shorty: *Oh yeah I have nine of those in my computer at home I dont need them nevermind*

***Half an hour later of him claiming to have everything from 3 GTX Titan cards and half the earth in his computer at home.***

Me: Before you leave, let’s go over your list.

Shorty: *Okay that sounds good your such a nice guy*

Me: You want an RCA adapter, a wireless card, and new keyboard?

Shorty: *Yes thats what I want can you get a cool mouse too and a password for bios*

Me: Yeah, we can do that too. Sign here and we’ll get that all taken care of for you. 

Shorty: *Okay thanks bye*

He swoops across the room and out the door. Good riddance.

He came back two times later that day. 

The first time he came back is was right before another customer came in. I knew I couldn’t make eye contact with the other customer. We’d both laugh, that’d be bad. 

The second time he came back Mr.Bossman was at the desk and I was in the back. Surprise, his computer at home had been stolen. My boss got a good 30 minute talk in with him. More of a 30 minute listen really. 

Now whenever we’re both in the back and the front door rings (sensor that makes noise when it opens) I whisper “He’s baaaaack.” poltergeist style. Mr.Bossman groans every time. 

He was supposed to pick his computer up last friday. It's still here.

208pdi,26,2014-03-12,"Win Wednesday! Engineering Student Edition , I hope this inspires you like everyone here inspires me!",Dat_Lebanese_Tho,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/208pdi/win_wednesday_engineering_student_edition_i_hope/,"First off I would like to thank every single person who posts on this subreddit, for you all are equally responsible for my success so far. I really would like to tell you my story and I hope it'll inspire you like many of you inspired me.

So to start off, I was raised poor, homeless at one point. Ever since I was a kid, I was amazed by anything that is technology. I remember the moment I wanted to be an Engineer was when my mother dropped the T.V remote on the floor, splitting it in half and showing the electronics inside, and instead of her throwing it away, she went out and bought a broken PC, an old Cellphone and another Remote for me to look at.

Senior year of high school , After a couple of visits to my Dr., I was diagnosed with ADHD and was advised to start stimulant treatment. However, having ""brown parents"" (not an insult, but more of a fact of life for me ) , nothing is wrong with me and I am just looking for an excuse. I did receive a Scholarship to the University that I've always wanted to go to , but my symptoms were becoming more noticeable as days go by.

Freshman Year was the toughest, Engineering was not made for people like me, I was never able to keep a schedule, my friends were becoming annoyed by the fact that I could not listen to them or carry a conversation without interrupting. I started doing bad in my classes, not that they were not interesting or hard, it was the fact that i couldn't just sit down and do homework. I started to become really impulsive and do things without thinking twice. My parents still were apposed to me getting treatment. My wake up moment is when one of my closest friends said "" you just might not be cut out for this sort of thing"". That was the moment I knew that if I don't control it, I will not become the man that I once wanted to become. 

After long fights with my parents, I finally started treatment, and everything changed. I started to become more organized, started taking interest in the field that I loved. It wasn't just the medicine, I started lifting and running everyday, my diet is healthier than ever. In a sense, I stopped running from my pain (ADHD) and embraced it, I controlled it without it controlling me. 

Now I am in the top of my class, and I was just elected Captain of the Solar Racing Team at the University.  Best of all, I accepted an internship at GE this summer in which I was interviewed alongside students who have 4.0 GPA's and all the contacts in the world on their side, they didn't even stand a chance, because once you set your mind on something, ADHD or not, you will succeed. 

Moral of the story, don't let your ADHD control you, if you need help ask for it,there is no shame in it. We are people with the power to change the world, but we can't do it by surrendering to ""normal"" we are way more than just that, there is NO ONE who can tell you that you can't do something or has the right to stop you from becoming the person who you want to be.

Sorry for the long story, I just really wanted to share my success with all of you!"

I've applied to probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 positions and have had five interviews.  One of those interviews was as a water resources technician, which I did get an offer that I accepted. The position is a good foot in the door in the field, but it only pays $15/hr.  It's more than I'm making being unemployed, but I have a considerable amount of student debt and that amount is a far cry from what an engineering role would pay.

I recently had a phone interview with an engineering company for an entry-level water resources engineer position and did not get the second interview.  My background is arguably the strongest in this area, and I can't even land an entry-level position.  Meanwhile, I'm seeing my friends land positions left and right.  I've always finished in the top 5-10% of any program I've attended, but I just don't know what to do anymore.

I had already implemented into our certificate environment with no issues.  I was busy working on a high priority project to fix an ongoing production issue, so I figured the steps were easy enough I'd let an intern do it. I showed him exactly what needed to be changed and where to go. The change was simply adding a jvm start-up argument and copying some files over. We were not going to restart the jvm until the next day, but I figured I tried to get as much done as possible. Later that night an issue happened which caused us to restart the JVM. Turns out the files were not copied over but the argument was in which prevented the JVM from starting back up. I was called and I backed out the change and got the JVM started up. Turns out there was still an issue. 12 hours later we found out he did not add the start-up argument, but replaced what was already there, which was breaking a core piece of functionality in the application. The issue was highly broadcast and several execs are aware of what happened. I 100% take responsibility for the issue. I did not properly train/instruct/document and verify with my intern on the change that was needed to be made and I was not aware of what the argument needed to be in case we had to back out the change. This kind of mistake could be enough to lose my job, but even if I don't... how do I come back from this? Should I try to apologize for the mistake? Should I try to ensure the execs that the mistake will not be made again?"

I am a junior studying Computer Science at a major B1G school. I have a pretty decent GPA (3.35) but not many side projects besides a website I made for one of the engineering groups I am part of.

I am looking for a summer internship and have been applying to a bunch of places over the last couple of months. Last week, after an on-campus interview, I was flown to Milwaukee to Kohls headquarters for final interviews for their IT internship programs. I had three back to back interviews with department VPs and I thought I did really well. One of them even said he was impressed and that I was a good fit. I was pretty buzzed and I thought I had the job. I was pretty impressed with their program and was looking forward to contributing. Then I hear back yesterday and they say I did not get the job. Needless, I was pretty deflated and this has made me doubt myself. 

I have phone interviews with Amazon and QuickenLoans next week but I keep asking myself, if I can't get in with Kohls, how am I going to get in with these big companies. I guess I am feeling too sorry for myself right now.

My question is, how do you guys deal with rejection? Any tips on how to get over rejections and feel more confident about yourself?

Thank you for your time"

So, continuing from my last post seen here:

[Previous Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1znvpa/entry_level_materials_engineer_resumecover_letter/)

I have done significant changes to my resume and cover letter. They can be viewed here

-- -- --

The big changes are obviously the length. I reduced my resume to one page, and cut my cover letter quite a bit.

Things I am looking for help with are:

**Resume**

- My branding statement: I still don't fully understand how to make one without sounding either too much like an objective or like something that just repeats what is already on my resume.

- Is my order okay? In my last thread, someone mentioned moving skills to the top, but I'm not sure what is more important to highlight as someone who has graduated and hasn't had that much professional experience. 

- I attempted to put only accomplishments for my internship experience that seemed relevant to my education and what the company could use from my skill set.

- I left relevant courses on there, but I am wondering if I should switch that to something more along the lines of 'relevant topics covered'

- Also, in terms of format, I appreciate the feedback. For this particular application, it will be submitted as plain text on the website, so while I will take your suggestions into account for future apps, it won't necessarily be too much of a concern just yet.


**Cover Letter**

- I really didn't know how to write this. If it was for a specific job, I might have had an easier time, but since it's general and I'm basically asking them to consider me when something related to my education/skills opens up, I'm at a loss for words. So any and all feedback here would be greatly appreciated. 

- I took materials engineering in school and had taken electives focused on nanotechnology, which is what the company does analysis work on. However, a large part of the company is also computer/mobile hardware and nanotechnology. I was already previously interested in this stuff, and do my own studying/reading on the topic, but I don't have a degree for it. Is there a better way to demonstrate my interest in pursuing the field and showing that I can contribute to the company with my current skills but also willing to learn at the same time?


Anyways, feel free to take my application to the acid vat if necessary. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all the help, feedback and tips! Looking forward to see what you have to say"

The company I'm interning at was founded in the early 2000s, makes enterprise software, has probably around 2000 employees, and IPO'd relatively recently.

the good:

* they are flexible with the hours and accommodate class times and stuff
* boss seems reasonable and coworkers seems cool
* no set date for my internship so i can intern until i decide to quit or i get fired

the bad:

* low pay (~$20/h)
* boring work 
* not a well known ""name brand"" company like google, microsoft, facebook, etc.


i dun care that much about the low pay at the moment, but i'm afraid that if i stay w/them and eventually get hired full time then the pay will still be low. the work is boring right now, but i've only had one assignment so far so i can't judge that muhc. the ""name brand"" thing only matters because in a year, ill have to start searching for full time positions and that this isn't going to look as good  on my resume as one of the more well known companies.

so should i start trying to look into other internships or should I just play it safe and stick with my current employer? "

20bxtf,1,2014-03-13,Engineering vs. Economics Dual Degree (Canada),[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/20bxtf/engineering_vs_economics_dual_degree_canada/,"I am a high school senior who is almost certainly going to be attending the University of Western Ontario to pursue a Honors Business Administration degree from the Richard Ivey School of Business next fall. The business program is a second entry program which can only be entered after two full years of university study and it is designed to allow students to earn dual degrees within 5 years if they choose to do so. I have high hopes to have a career in finance (most likely in Canada) and after talking with several people, I feel that this school is the best fit for myself, and provides some of the strongest finance opportunities of all of the Canadian universities.

I have applied to and been accepted to both the engineering and social science (economics) faculties as well as been given pre-acceptance to the business program as long as I maintain an 80% average throughout my first two years in university. I applied to engineering and economics because I have strong interests both areas but I am having troubles deciding which would be the most beneficial career wise.

As an Albertan, having an engineering degree would give me almost guaranteed job opportunities through friends and family in oil and gas but honestly I don't see myself working as an engineer for my whole life. I also realize that an engineering degree would add a lot of depth both to my skills, knowledge and credibility, but I am worried that the immense time needed to do well in engineering may hamper opportunities to get involved in finance related activities, such as a investment clubs, and also probably hurt my GPA.

I think that the economics program would be a fair bit more relaxed in contrast to engineering, and give me a lot more free time to dedicate myself to extra-curriculars and keeping my grades as competitive as possible. Also I think that the extra two years focused on economics may help me come out stronger in the field of study, but may be a fair bit redundant in addition to the business degree.

Does anyone have any recommendations choosing between the two programs to supplement my business degree, particularly in regards to university life, competitiveness for internships, overall job prospects and opportunities. Any guidance is greatly appreciated!"

20cyg7,352,2014-03-13,Are you intentionally breaking things?,lawtechie,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/20cyg7/are_you_intentionally_breaking_things/,"

It's 2000 and I'm at the advertising agency [here](http://redd.it/1rgd61). The ad agency believed that it was cutting edge when it came to cool technology. If it looked cool, we bought one to display when clients came to visit. We had picked up a handful of the iMac G3s, since they positioned us as hip and cool. They were positioned at the ends of cube farms so a passerby would think that everybody had one.  

One of the junior account execs wanted to enhance the coolness of a direct mailing to prospective clients. Instead of a letter explaining the firm, it was going to be a CD with the agency logo and nothing else. She wants to send it to several hundred companies. 

She wanted a cool video to load, with loud music 'borrowed' from the Matrix. It was supposed to automagically load on both Macs and Windows PCs. Someone from the Art department did the video and my job was to make sure it worked when put in a CD drive. 

When the Art department was done, we were at about 22MB. No problem. While Macs could play ISO9660, they wouldn't autoplay from them. Account Exec didn't want even a sentence of explanation. She wanted seamless.

So fine. Hybrid CDs wouldn't reliably autorun on Macs for some reason when I burned them using Toast. 
So I make a 2 session disk, using a HFS (Mac) and ISO9660 (Windows), each with autorun enabled for the appropriate OS. The Mac partition's autorun points to the ISO partition, where the video lives. 

I test it a few times, show the ad exec and she OKs it. I set up every burner I can get my hands on and I spend a few hours making sure each drive is burning successfully. I'm waiting for the print shop to give me the custom sleeves while I stack the CDs. 

Then I get the sleeves. They're for non-standard,  mini cds. I don't happen to have any mini cds. 

I call the exec and tell her.   

Me:""Uhh, there's a problem with the sleeves""  

Exec:""What's the problem? They have to go out tomorrow""  

Me:""The sleeves aren't for regular sized CDs""  

Exec:""Oh, that's not a problem""  

Me:""I don't understand""  

Exec:""We didn't want regular sized CDs""  

Me:""But that's what I burned. Remember when I showed you that cd and you OK'd it? I've burned a spindle's worth""  

Exec:""So what you're telling me is that you can't make the deadline""  

Me:""You didn't tell me you wanted mini cds. I didn't order any""  

Exec:""Why not?""  

Me:""As I said before, I didn't know you wanted them""  

Exec:""I did. I sent you an email today""  

Me (getting angry, afraid that I'll be the epicenter of the blamestorm):""No, no you didn't""  

Exec:""Well, what are you going to do about it?""  

Me:""I'll give you two options. You can get new sleeves, which will take several hours. Or you can insist on mini CDs. It'll take a day or two for delivery.  A duplication shop will take another day or two. Your call, but I recommend the first""  

Exec:""Because you're lazy?""  

Me:""Because mini cds are stupid. They don't work in slot loading drives""  

Exec:""I don't think that's a problem""  


I call around and find a print shop that can do the job and has the cds in stock. I run the CD over with the appropriate artwork and tell them that it's urgent.   


By the next morning, they have a stack of octagonal CDs with the right silkscreen and a stiff invoice. I get an intern to help me with putting them in the sleeves. I then deliver the box to the exec, hoping I won't have her complaining to the spineless account manager. I know I didn't do anything wrong, but at our outsourced IT shop, techs were always wrong, even when I could document it.  


So I go back to work. I get a call from the head of the agency. He's got a problem with his laptop. I run up, since his displeasure could easily result in no job for me.   


He's got the latest Powerbook G3. With an octagonal CD stuck in the slot-loading drive.    

  
I pull the optical drive out of the bay and walk back down to my office. I disassemble the drive enclosure enough to remove the offending mini-cd. I put it back together and walk back to the agency head's office with one of the CDs I burnt the day before.   


As I walk back down, I see the ad exec. She wants to talk about the problem she's having with her iMac. Turns out, she tried feeding a minidisk into a slotloading drive.   


I ask her if she's deliberately breaking things. Her response still makes me wonder fourteen years later:""I thought the smaller disks looked high tech""

I could really use some advice for the situation I'm currently in.

   
First a little bit about my background:

I dropped out of college to start my own company. Unfortunately I developed a depression while doing it. Upon realizing I had to change something about my current situation i went into therapy and consider myself healthy now.

Now to the Job part:

I live in Germany where apprenticeships are a pretty common way to get a job education and experience. I decided it would be the best way to start my way into the world of being an employee. 
The apprenticeships typically start 1th of August(keep that in mind for later on).
I got a pretty good reply to my applications from several companies, which put me in the situation I'm currently in.

I had a job interview with Company A two weeks ago. Three days later they called me to say that they really liked me but would really like to do a week long internship to check if I could handle the work enviroment/load given my history with depression. If I could handle it they will over me the job. Back then I scheduled the internship to start on the 24th of April. 

This Monday I had a job interview with Company B. Yesterday Company B called to offer me the apprenticeship, but they would like to have an answer by Monday, the 17th, which means before my internship with Company A. They want the reply so fast because they are afraid of not finding a good candidate before the start of the apprenticeship.

I really don't want to decline the offer from Company B given that I don't have definitive answer from Company A.


BTW Company B knows I have an internship with Comany A.

How would you handle this situation? Accept the offer, do the internship and try to get out of the contract with Company B if Company A offers the position? That seems like a dick move.

Declining the offer doesn't seem to be the right move either as I have no other offer.

tldr: Company B made an offer, wants reply before I can start an internship at Company A, which has a high chance of resulting in an offer as well. How to deal with this situation?

I have owned a small, successful healthcare recruiting business for the last six years .  All of my work is done via telephone or email and I find myself becoming burned out and bored.  One of the things that really stuck with me about your show is that you always require businesses (owners\) to be passionate about what they do. I no longer have the fulfillment I once had and really do not enjoy this job anymore.  I am thinking about applying for jobs that would once again challenge me. One stigma I've noticed with small business owners re-entering the job market is that they are unable to take direction because they are used to running the show.

I am a computer engineering student looking into quant work. I plan on entering an MFE program after finishing my undergrad. However, since I am in a CO-OP program I have the chance to complete internships before I graduate. In fact, I have an 8 months internship coming up next winter.

I am looking for advice on types of firms and positions that I should contact and look into. What can I do during my undergrad to increase my marketability. Should I take extra finance courses, work on a personal software project relating to quant work?

On Monday I filled out a form for a background checking agency (Verifications Inc or something). 

Anyways, I have nothing to hide, my only concern was that I had listed my work at a family members company that had a bit of trouble with the law (before I went to help out, which was why I went to help during their hard time). I only went to help out, so I considered it more as an internship than anything else and it was what I had told the people at my interview too. 

Now I am somewhat worried that the fact that the company had a run in with the law (violation something while doing government-related business, don't really want to go too much into detail), and how it might affect me. I don't really think it will, as the background check should only be verifying that I did what I said I did, but it is also a large company and we are working with trading supplies for airlines, so I don't know if they will make a bigger fuss if that information were to come out.

Any thoughts?"

20hmrg,26,2014-03-15,"My supervisor gave me horrible reviews and I might lose my internship, what can I do?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/20hmrg/my_supervisor_gave_me_horrible_reviews_and_i/,"For context, I'm a 21 year old female student in computer science, he's a 50+ male working in corporate IT support. I've been working with this man for about three months now. We are in a separate office away from all of the other employees on the floor. 

Everything was going fine until two weeks ago. We began arguing a lot over work related issues (it started when another intern needed my help with something, I went to help him before doing as my supervisor asked -stacking boxes in the supply room). I did not realize that this week was also the week of midterm evaluations. He flamed me to the point where I may lose my internship if I don't show improvements. I've never had issues with any of my other supervisors, and I've always had good reviews. 

Yesterday I was called in to see HR, and I lost control and started crying out of frustration. It was horrible and I'm extremely embarrassed. This man is very difficult to work for (short tempered, loud, condescending, type A personality) and I dread going in to work each day. I set up a meeting to talk with him about ways I can improve, he listed things such as showing more motivation (this is fair), completing all of my tasks quicker and more thoroughly, and learning all of the names of the people on our floor (about 50 people, this is not necessary to complete my work). He sees my natural shyness and quiet nature as a huge character flaw that I need to change. 

We are working in a very high stress environment due to a project that will take several months to complete. He works through lunch everyday and expects that I do the same, though he hasn't outwardly said it. I barely have time to check my email and he often gives me multiple tasks to complete at a time, then becomes angry and dismissive if I ask questions. What can I do to salvage this situation, I cannot lose this internship, but this person is extremely petty and likely to hold a grudge against me. I am not the first intern to have trouble with him. 

He is the type of person who loves to gossip and judge other people. He often calls the users stupid once they're immediately out of earshot, and I'm sure he does the same to me. If he gets in trouble for my emotional breakdown in HR he will make sure I'm removed from the company. I feel lost here and I'm to the point where I've started applying to different companies, just to get away from this man. "
20htm7,5,2014-03-15,"I'm pretty much giving up on my ""ideal"" jobs(Snapchat, etc). Just wondering if I should keep hope or not?wall of text, but cliffs provided.",throwaway676767671,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/20htm7/im_pretty_much_giving_up_on_my_ideal_jobssnapchat/,"I ended up in MSE, after applying to almost every major other than it at my school. I applied to( in order of preference): CS, CompE, Mech, Chem. The only program that actually took me was MSE. I blame nobody other than myself, as my gpa wasn't up to par(3.65 at the time, 3.4 now). 

I'm a current 4th year(will take next year to grad), as I developed major anxiety during college and took a year off to self-help, and then came back, got school counseling and now I'm here. I failed to get any internships, failed to join any clubs, and don't even have a job. I blame nobody other than myself.

Now that you have my background allow me to tell you what I truly wanted:
I've always been interested in energy, and I've loved the idea of working with drilling for resources, that, or working in the mining industry as that also interested me.
But, as soon as I entered college, and took a java programming course, I wanted to go into CS(probably a bad choice, but at the time seemed like the right thing to do)
I started ""day dreaming"" of things I wanted to do with my degree(s):
-I wanted to get a CS degree, and work with snapchat(software eng), or other mobile applications. Or work with trading software.
-Back-up plan was getting my ME degree and hopefully placing myself in good position to land a job in drilling on off-shore rigs or something related to drilling like at a place like BP or Chevron.


But now, after being rejected from all those departments, and getting a MSE degree, I've realized that I may have no chance for any of these jobs, and since I've gotten no internships, I've pretty much ruined any chances. 

I'm just here to ask, if there is reason to keep hope alive for these jobs? If so, is there anything I can do now to hopefully make me get into a decent position to apply for a senior internship or even a co-op during my senior year? What would I absolutely need to know how to do regarding things like soft. engineering at a place like snapchat? or drillling intern at Chevron?





Cliffs:
-Rejected from most departments, but wanted engineering, got MSE

-No internship(entering last year), no extracurrics

-Want to work in soft or drilling(two diff worlds, but my only interests).

-Places like Snapchat, Chevron, or a trading company(software purposes)

-If there is hope, what can I do over the summer/now to build my resume?

-What do I absolutely need to know in order to be successful in applying to intern/co-op spots for places like snapchat, etc

I have years of experience, but no degree or work history in the business. ( [Here is my post from when I got my job](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1qlfgm/i_just_got_my_first_web_development_job_what_do_i/) ) 

Everything is working out great with my new job. I work on a small team and learn every day. My main responsibilities are support for our custom CMS, building wordpress sites and maintenance on these sites. While my job is currently focused on front end work and support, I have experience with LAMP and I would like to pursue a career in software engineering. There is the opportunity for me to shift my role to back-end developer for our CMS. This requires skills in C#/MVC/Linq, I have been studying and building my experience using my personal time with the help of a mentor at my company. I've made good progress and I believe I will be starting this transition over the next few months.

I live in Houston and am salaried at $32k/Year. I believe I am on the low end of the compensation scale for an entry-level employee with my responsibilities in my area.  On the other hand, I broke into the industry only 4 months ago - you could almost consider it a paid internship.

A few questions:

- I believe I am currently underpaid with my current level of responsibilities. Do you think this assumption is accurate?
- What steps do I need to take to maximize my earnings as a newcomer to the industry?
- Is the shift to developing in C# a smart idea in terms of earning power and overall career potential?
- At what point is it smart to consider switching companies for better compensation? Is this effected by a possible new position as a C# developer (and all the potential that comes with it)?

And of course I always appreciate any general advice you may have for someone new to the web development and CS industry.

Thank you in advance!"

Theres no other word for it. In fact he lives on the same floor a few doors down from me. Hes extremely pretentious, he thinks he is far more intelligent that he actually is, and he's creepy. He constantly pesters me via facebook and other people even though he knows I want absolutely nothing to do with him. The hate all started a few months to a year ago. We play the same game competitively and he consistently beats me (granted hes been playing 5 years longer than me) and he is very arrogant. When I think about him being a smartass to me I just want to slap the shit out of him. I'm trying to find a way to deal with the hate so that it never gets to that point (although it never will, since I am a pacifist). I just wish he would grow up and leave me alone. I'm 20 and busy with a full time internship (CS) and taking 5 classes. He is 26, an alcoholic, and a graduate (IT) student that shares classes with me (whenever I take an IT elective because apparently his graduate classes are my bullshit IT electives). 

TL;DR: This guy has no redeemable qualities. When I look at it objectively I find no reason to be in a pissing contest with him, because I know that I'm much more mature and farther along in my career (which at its core has a much larger potential). But I still can't help but hate him. Why is this?"

I am currently a junior studying CS at a small liberal arts college with a 3.5 GPA. After my sophomore year I had an internship with a start up working on their automatic test handler and testing their product's REST API for 3 months and the internship went very well.

I have coursework in Data Structures, Databases, Operating Systems, and a lot more. I have a lot of experience with Java, C++, Python, Ruby and some experience with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Django.

I have a couple small side projects but not very many because until recently I was a varsity athlete and that took up a lot of my time.

This year I have applied for 50-60 internships at both small and large companies. I got one interview that went 3 rounds but did not end up getting the job and other than that I have had no interview opportunities. 

Is there something more I should be doing or other experience that I need to get? I feel like this summer is rapidly approaching and I am getting worried about not having an internship. I want more on the job experience to help with my job search next year and to increase my skills as an engineer.

TL; DR: I have internship experience and course experience, only got one interview that didn't work out, feeling nervous about prospects of getting a job for the summer.

I felt that the work was not helping me grow as a programmer, so I confronted my boss and asked if I could be put in a more challenging position. He has now given me work to do with a separate team alongside the work I was already doing. 

The work I am doing involves AJAX, JQuery, and Java. I am not very familiar with any of these, but I wanted this challenge - I am prepared to learn these technologies in order to solve problems. 

The issue is that I have stupid questions. I was asked to set up an environment, and to use git to get access to the dev environment I will be working in etc. However, I tried to take care of these things and ran into a number of issues.

 I am afraid of asking my superiors about this, because it seems like a trivial problem. I feel like a gnat confronting these people and getting them to solve basic dependency issues. I was the one that asked for this. I want to grow, but I do not want to seem incompetent to the extent that my request to be challenged will be undermined by these sorts of issues.

I would just like some advice on how to handle problems like this. I assume that they will be rampant in this line of work.

No internships. Employed for 2 years at an appliance factory as a generic mechanical engineer.

I do minor design/redesign, update drawings (with stuff like ""make wire 6"" instead of 4""), author engineering change notices, write other documentation (work instructions/documentation/etc), talk to vendors to source cheaper versions of existing parts, create unique configurations of our appliances for certain vendors (we don't sell directly to customers), write test plans, nag the testers to complete the testing, and then do a bit of code writing to play with the accounting database to make sure that we have the right amount of everything for each configuration.

Unfortunately I'm not very happy with my job. Our company is a bit of a revolving door - I think like 50% of the engineering department has been replaced (quit or fired) since I started. I end up with half-completed/half-baked/undefined-by-management projects that have been languishing for years in the hands of multiple of engineers and am unable to complete them since I've already got plenty of my own. We're asked to set monthly goals for ourselves, but I'm unable to meet them half the time since circumstances change (ie: project gets put on the back burner, parts don't come in on time for new configuration build) or I'm assigned to do something new.

Worst of all I'm not picking up any marketable skills at work - I feel that as an engineer I'm only picking up skills useful to my employer and nobody else. Who else would care why assembly X is put together in a certain way anyway? I've gotten some experience with solidworks and design, but only at a very minor level - certainly nothing to write home about. I've seen senior design projects that are more complicated and have more engineering thought &amp; design behind them than what I do. I hate the documentation &amp; pedestrian-level design aspect of my job.

Anyway, enough moping -

I really like coding, but don't want to be doing pure coding (ie: front+back end/business logic type things) - I want to put some of my engineering knowledge (or what I have of it) to work too. Figuring out algorithms/dynamic systems and then implementing them in code to drive things would be a fantastic endeavor for me.

Unfortunately: I have very limited work related experience with that stuff. I have some minor personal projects, but again - nothing to write home about. I'm also a bit confused as to what kind of fields I can get into or where I could fit in with my skill set. I know that it's a bit silly to be looking for a dream job with as little experience as I have, but heck I want to be happier.

Any suggestions? What do you all do? What kind of careers/employers can you suggest for me?"

About a week later I got contacted for a phone interview with an engineer at the company, which I thought I had botched and failed horribly. Seemingly against all odds, they contacted me again, this time for a face to face interview for an expected time of four hours.

What terrifies me is that I have no idea what to expect. The interviewer went over technical questions with me and some general stuff about my resume. 

What should I expect and what should I do to prepare for this interview? All I've done so far are phone and Skype interviews... 

EDIT:

 So for posterity and in case anyone goes searching like I did for info, I'm going to summarize what went down for me...

I interviewed at a really small company ~20 people and basically the interview consisted of 4 rounds, each with a different engineer at every level of the company up until I actually met and talked with the president of the company. 

Each round really was just a few technical questions to challenge me, mostly just basic concepts (what's a Java interface?) and nothing like ""here's a problem we're having, try to solve it"" problems. Other than that it was just getting to know the engineers and their role in the company. The interviews in total definitely did not take the four hours they were thinking it would take. 

And in the end I was given an offer which I gladly accepted!

Honestly I felt like what really sealed the deal was that I was really personable and really willing to talk about anything, being my projects and my experiences, to me actually weighing on the projects the engineers have been working on.

I am ready to move on but since I received Tuition Reimbursement I am unable to leave without having to pay some back until roughly January 2015.  
I can however switch positions within the company. I found this position on our job site labeled Network Analyst Intern the only issue is they do not seem to have a clear job description as far as what would be done. I will link it below. 
I do meet the requirements at least for Network Analyst I. If anyone has any insight on what the position may entail or possible wages of this position, any answers are appreciated.

20mhql,1,2014-03-17,Should I drop out of college and attempt to break into the tech/startup industry? And how would I go about doing it?,theConfusedDildo,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/20mhql/should_i_drop_out_of_college_and_attempt_to_break/,"So basically, I'm pretty ass at school. My grades are subpar, I don't really have motivation, and it really feels like I'm wasting my dad's money. He's the one who really needs to go to college to further his own career.

Thing is, even though I do not-so-good in school, I'm actually a pretty competent web developer/programmer. I've learned a lot more teaching myself than trying to go to class, I've got lots of code on GitHub, and I can do pretty well on technical interviews at this point.

And even with just one CS class last year, I was still able to get an internship last summer because of both my ability to do okay on interviews and teaching myself a bunch of web dev stuff.

I'll probably have another internship this summer, if all goes well in interviews and such.

I'm just wondering at this point if it's still even worth it to stay in school. Is it worth it?

And if it's not, and I drop out, how do I break into the tech industry more so I can, you know...not starve?

Any help is appreciated."

20mtso,1,2014-03-17,Getting out (long-term/forever) to Germany via internship?,digitalixus,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/20mtso/getting_out_longtermforever_to_germany_via/,"I'm a 24yo recent US graduate in Business Administration but with background working in web development and tech. Having read up on the Blue Card program (and their 35k Euro minimum for tech-jobs), I've been applying to a bunch of jobs, like 3 dozen in the past 2 weeks.

As optimistic as I can be, I am afraid inside (based on posts here recommending graduate programs, me just picking up the German language and being relatively 'new' to the working world, and as a non-EU outsider) that I won't find a job.

My citizenship is from a 3rd world country (made international news recently =) if that story doesn't 'prove' how third world it is, I don't know what else will) with really poor living standards and expensive cost of living, high crime, corruption etc I wouldn't want to raise a family there or live there any longer, so my long-term plan is to get out forever.

I see a lot of internships being posted by smaller/start-up level companies and was wondering if it was worth applying for these. Sure the pay would just be enough to cover 'warm' (German) rent and I would make a short-term loss paying for other living expenses out of pocket. But this gets my foot in the door and work experience in Germany. Has anyone done this before? What kind of visa would I need for this? If my employer likes me or I find a 'real' full-time job that means the Blue Card requirements, would I be able to 'convert'  (I'm assuming) short-term residence permit into a long-term one that lets me apply for a German PR after a while?"

I've been a stay at home mom for about 4 years now, and I still have some time before my youngest starts school.  I know I want to go back to work when that happens, but I don't know what I want to do.  I served in the military for six years as a paralegal, which as GREAT but I don't think I would really enjoy it as a civilian like I did when I was military.   When I was in the military, I received my associates in paralegal studies.  I got out and got my bachelors in criminal justice, then went on to get my masters in forensic psychology, which I'll be finishing in May.  They're both from online schools, which might hurt me a little bit... my forensic psych degree doesn't come with a license, and I have no idea what I need to do to get one?  I have no experience in that field at all, other than the tiny bit of court martial work I did in the military.  I'm kind of regretting online schools, but realistically, as a stay at home mom with a military husband who works strange, long hours, it was the only choice.  Plus, regardless of how they're perceived, I really did learn A LOT from the classes, and I really enjoyed them.  I feel like I'll never get a job as a forensic psychologist specifically, assessing individuals for mental competency and whatnot, but I worry all the time that my degrees are useless, and that even though I really feel I have the knowledge and skills needed to do jobs related to those fields, no one will ever take me seriously. 

I have so much that I'm interested in and I don't know where to start.  I've thought about blogging/writing, tutoring, teaching, politics, charities, even small counseling jobs and internships to help put me on a path to get my license.  Currently I'm most interested in juvenile corrections, specifically substance abuse counseling.  Is it worth it to try to climb that ladder, especially with a husband who plans on being in the military for the next 20 years with moves every 2-4 years, or should I stick with what I know and where I have experience, and just resign to the idea that I'll probably be working in a field that doesn't require my degrees, as a secretary or civilian paralegal or some other GS civilian job with the military for the rest of my life?

[So what's the weirdest thing you've encountered when someone opened the door?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4qrun?context=5)|A few months back I took a delivery to this dude's apartment. It was a little person who opened the door and he was clearly as baked as can be. He looked at me and said, ""This is your first time seeing a midget high isn't it?"" We both laughed, he invited me in to take a bong rip, gave me a pretty good tip, and we went our separate ways.
[What % of customers answer the door in the nude/lingerie/with a boner? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4qrvn?context=5)|Haven't gotten any nudies yet, but I have had a few women answer the door in a robe. Still waiting...
[It's the delivery driver dream. One day man...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4qw9n?context=5)|I'll report back if/when it does happen.
[What do you do with the pizza's left over from a prank call?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4ryhk?context=5)|Most times they are eaten by employees or people working in the kitchen. If someone is going to the big city that day, they'll normally take it with them to give it to a homeless person.
[Do you really draw the requests that some guys ask?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4rztz?context=5)|I've only had that happen to me twice. I'm a terrible artist, but I'll have someone else do it. We like doing it though.
 |There was a guy who once ordered online and put in the comment section ""Extra awesome"" or ""Awesome on the side"". So I printed out the word ""awesome"" multiple times on a receipt paper, put each paper in little to-go containers, and put them on the corners of the pizza box.
[What is the most awkward situation that you have been part of while delivering pizzas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4qruw?context=5)|There is one woman who orders from us all the time. Any time any of us get there, she doesn't answer the door for 10-15 minutes because her infant kids need help with something (changing clothes, food, bathing, etc). This happens every time.
 |Every. Damn. Time.
 |EDIT: I should mention that I don't mind her being a good mother and helping her kids. What I do mind is that she knows that we're waiting outside for her this whole time.

[How obvious is it when people are stoned and order pizza? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4rc7i?context=5)|Pretty obvious. You can almost hear them salivate as I tell them what toppings are on a certain specialty pizza.

Why are you not working in that field currently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4wx0q?context=5)|I'll just copy and paste the same comment from a similar question earlier (which has since been deleted).
 |""Actually, I'm happy someone asked this. I grew up in a relatively affluent area and had a great upbringing. I went to a very prestigious university and had a great internship that would most likely set me up with a job after I graduated. As my senior year went on, I started learning a lot about myself and what I was doing with my life. Though it sounds late, I was starting to form my own opinions on life and really started to adopt a universal and humanistic view on the world. My own personal evolution allowed me to realize that I shouldn't do something that helps the bureaucracy of business, but that I should something that helps other people. So I gave up on the ""dream"" that I had of getting a career and full time job, and have recently decided to open up my own business (One that would give a large portion of the proceeds to those who need help).
 |And believe it or not, I love delivering pizzas for a living. Sure the pay may not be the best, but I love interacting with other people and making them happy (even if it's on the minor scale of giving them pizza).
 |So I don't think that I ever went wrong in life. Success to me isn't measured by income. It's measured by happiness.""

But working for a business right now, you're helping that business mainly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4x8uy?context=5)|I'm working for a restaurant which provides a necessary thing for people: food.

[I see delivery drivers check their phones all the time while driving -- do your employers try to stop this or is there nothing they can do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4sdrj?context=5)|Usually we're on our phones to use our GPS apps. Unless our employers gave us an actual GPS, there's nothing that can really be done.

[3 Do you usually oder pizza yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4rsza?context=5)|Yes I do. That being said, our restaurant has more than just pizzas, so I order those items just as much at a discounted rate.
[Has delivering pizza caused you to not enjoy eating it any more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4y4ni?context=5)|My love for pizza (which has always been high) has stayed constant.

A few people who clearly had just gotten out of the shower and threw a robe on, but no ""accidental"" slips.
[Can I have some pizza?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4sia1?context=5)|As long as you're within 4 miles of my restaurant, sure.

Tip wise I've made anywhere from $10-$200 in a night. One can expect to work about 4-5 hours each night.
[If someone tips shitty or doesn't tip at all do you remember or write the address down?  Take longer to deliver, do something to the pizza or any other type of repercussion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4xmk6?context=5)|Nah we don't write anything down. We just remember that they're shitty tippers. Actually, we'll all take one for the team from time to time and take it if we're having a good day tip wise. 
[Have you ever eaten a pizza instead of delivering it, then pretend like nothing has happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4qwbk?context=5)|No. Most likely would be out of a job if that happened.

[What was the most hectic delivery you've ever partaken in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4ybrj?context=5)|About a year ago on a Friday night we were absolutely slammed with deliveries. There were 4 of us driving that night, and we had almost 10-15 up at one time. I was taking a quad (4 deliveries on one trip) and got towed at the first place I delivered to. One of the other drivers had to pick me up, but because we were so busy he couldn't make it for about an hour or so. I thankfully had all of the food with me, so we just called and explained the situation to the other customers. They were understanding.
[Was there a small panic when you discovered the car towed? I'd imagine there must have been a sinking feeling. Good thing the customers understood. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4yu7l?context=5)|Yeah it was awful. Especially because we were so busy and I had three other places I had to get to. Worst part is that I was only parked outside of this apartment complex for 5 minutes. 
[I've gotta say, this is a very interesting AMA. I was wondering, have you made any long-lasting relationships (friendly, no romantically\) with your co-workers over the time you've worked there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg54rb2?context=5)|Actually, I was able to get this job because my best friend was a bartender at my restaurant and put in a good word. He introduced me to everyone there and I've made some very great friendships with some of my coworkers.
[I've never tipped a pizza delivery guy before, only because I wasn't sure if I was supposed to. The pizza was delivered on time, which is what they're supposed to do.  Do you get offended when a customer doesn't tip? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg52w0w?context=5)|I don't get offended, but it can be annoying if it was an already slow day tip wise. It's gonna happen every once in a while, but know that the majority of our income (probably around 75%) comes from tips. 
[Do you deliver into hotel rooms? Not just at the lobby or anything, but directly into a specific hotel room.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg5qs1w?context=5)|Just depends on the hotel. Some let you go straight up to the room, but some ask you to wait at the front desk while they call them. 
[Is there a place in the city your company does not deliver for fear of being robbed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4xjpw?context=5)|The area I deliver in is relatively affluent and with low crime rate. So simply put, no. We go anywhere within a 4 mile radius.
[Why did you do an AMA? Haha, I'm not trying to be mean, I just am really curious if you woke up today like ""F*ck yeah, I'm gonna do a mothafuckin AMA today!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg52yvk?context=5)|We just got a bunch of snow and I was off today. Didn't get a chance to really do anything so I was pretty bored. 
[Has someone ever smoked you out when you delivered them a pie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4wo05?context=5)|Sure have. But they give a cash tip too. Most people realize that we have to make some money.
[Is there any areas of town that your store will refuse to deliver to based on safety or high chance of robbery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4wpgj?context=5)|Nah. The area I deliver in has a low crime rate.
[What was your best/funniest tip you ever gotten?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg5l0y9?context=5)|Best tip: close to $100 Funniest tip: had a guy draw a big middle finger where you were supposed to tip. Handed it to me and looked at me with a straight face. I was kinda confused at first but then he started laughing and got out his wallet. Gave me $10. 
[Would you be offended if a customer slipped money through the door and told you to leave it? I'm super paranoid of answering the door for men. Like, I avoid ordering food for this reason. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg56y8z?context=5)|Not at all. Actually this happens more often than you'd think. Whether it's the customer being uncomfortable, unavailable, or has a disability. 
[Does you cut the hole in the pizza first or do you stick your boner right through it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4sz4j?context=5)|Boner normally goes right through.
[Please tell me you're not serious...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4uq8z?context=5)|I'm not serious.
[Have you ever spat on or otherwise contaminated a pizza pre-delivery.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4v1qp?context=5)|Nope. I've worked at a few restaurants now and have never seen that. 
[Have you ever spit on a pizza or done something between those lines. Be honest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mpiw/i_deliver_pizzas_for_a_living_ama/cg4w7d6?context=5)|Nope, never.

20nl1y,1,2014-03-17,Would it be difficult to get a programming job without a HS diploma?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20nl1y/would_it_be_difficult_to_get_a_programming_job/,"I'm in high school right now and I really want to drop out, so then I will have a lot more time to learn programming and other CS stuff on my own. I don't have much time to learn though because I get so much homework in school. I love programming so far and I could do it all day. If I drop out, then I would have an extra 8-12 hours a day to teach myself things. That is a lot of time.

I heard that a lot of companies don't really care too much about a degree/diploma, they just care about what you can do and the skills that you have. I was wondering if I build a portfolio online, would that be enough to get a good programming job? Also I heard hackathons are a great place for a job opportunity. I am nowhere near ready for a CS job but I just don't want to drop out if I absolutely need that HS Diploma. I was thinking maybe eventually I could get my GED if I needed to.

I forgot to mention that I have had an internship at State Farm developing web applications. That should look good on a resume."
20nmve,1,2014-03-17,Life of Sr. Software Developer/Software Architect,vikster93,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20nmve/life_of_sr_software_developersoftware_architect/,"I currently intern at a mid-tier company that is not a tech company at heart; rather, it uses technology (and therefore employs a considerable amount of cs talent) to further its goals. My general impression of some of the older developers and architects is that they essentially had to learn one technology stack when they were younger, and after that they didn't really have to do much learning. It's more just come into work, use existing knowledge to solve company problems, leave, rinse&amp;repeat. The particular stack that seems to common around where I work is Linux+Apache Tomcat+Java+MySQL. This is, in my opinion at least, a pretty powerful and versatile stack, so I don't really see a reason for them to have to learn alternate technologies.

So my question is, am I mistaken in this perception? I consider learning new technologies to be the challenge, but once you get the hang of them, its just fun and easy. Does it end up becoming unchallenging or boring?

20npsp,2,2014-03-17,"How does it affect me if I couldn't get an internship at a ""good"" company?",picklebricks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20npsp/how_does_it_affect_me_if_i_couldnt_get_an/,"Am a third-year Computer Science student. I'm talking about not even being able to get into a certain *tier* of companies. I don't know how to describe this. I'm talking about modern companies using modern relevant tech stacks, where the engineers are smart and sharp and have a solid history of employment at other such companies. The best way to describe it is: a company that helps you grow your career in any way.

My first internship was at a non-high-tech company. I saw engineers playing around on Amazon, nobody cared or knew what was going on accept the tech lead, and this was about a technology as simple as front-end ASP.NET (pretty much just plain HTML/CSS). Work was slow, it would take an entire day to add a new page template when you could just copy an existing page template.

My second internship was much better, and I was surprised just how smart all my co-workers were. Everybody was on top of their game. It was a true high-tech startup. I thought to myself I wanted to work at companies like this from now on. I only got in through a strong connection to the CEO.

My second internship has filled their slots, and this year I wasn't able to get anything like my second. It's my fault I have such a terrible CS background (not practicing, zoning out of classes). I got interviews at some pretty nice companies, but I would always fail at the 3rd round because my CS fundamentals weren't enough (e.g. answering the 3-partition problem). I got an internship at another ""startup"" (they've been one for 10 years now?), and honestly everything is really nice (great culture, relevant tech stack) except I don't get the feeling this is a company that would help my career grow. It seems a bit *too* relaxed (almost lazy), and it feels like just a code-monkey job without applications of computer science or anything complex.

I'm concerned because I wanted to use this year's internship as a way to sneak in a full-time job, since I have such a low GPA (&lt; 2.8). I'm continuing to apply to more companies.

Do you guys see tech companies the same way (split into tiers of ""good""ness)? If so, is it a problem for me to start out full-time employment (after my 4th year, via my 3rd-year internship's company) at such a company?"

I have a 2.9 GPA and a ""normal personality"", but have not landed an internship yet. I have had a few interviews but no luck. I am starting to freak out that I am not going to get one this year at all. How important is getting an internship? I feel like employers will look at my resume when I graduate and wonder why I don't have any work experience related to my field and just pass me up.

I'd love to go to a UC or somewhere like UIUC but I'm wondering how competitive places are? Especially for an international student.

[Can you hook me up with a Jeter/Mariano autograph?  Kidding aside, how has being in the memorabilia business changed the way you watch sports? Do you watch games now and see something amazing happen, and think ""wow I'd love to get that bat"" rather than ""what an amazing play""? Has it taken any joy out of sports for you, or added to it?  Thanks for doing this Mr. Steiner!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4v3s3?context=5)|It's changed the way I watch sports every way. I'll never watch a game as a normal everyday fan again. I miss that. Sometimes I like watching a good high school game or a not-well-known college game to get that feeling back.. Anytime I'm watching a big-time athletic event means dollars. There's not any aspect of the game-people playing, watching, sponsoring, etc.- that I don't have a stake in. 
[Are there any secret/hidden rooms or old closets in Yankee stadium in which you could find old baseball equipment or paraphernalia from the days of old?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4t4wx?context=5)|Actually there were a bunch of things hiding in old rooms and different areas of the Stadium. Mr. Steinbrenner was a bit of a pack-rat and we were the beneficiaries of that...old jerseys, old bats, everything.
 |There's a good story about this in my most recent book, You Gotta Have Balls. It’s about the original bricks to the ORIGINAL Yankee Stadium (pre-1976). I knew that there was a possibility that we could find these bricks and I wanted them badly, but we had only found things from after the renovation. Couldn’t find them anywhere, though. A few days before the demolition started I walked through the old batting cages under the seats, in the Columbus Room of the Stadium—that was an informal name because “If you don’t get your swings in, they’re gonna send you back down to Columbus (home of the Yankees triple-A team at the time).” Sure, enough, the old Philip Goldbrick &amp; Sons bricks were in that room. We found 5,000 in all. 
[One of the last times I went to a Yanks game, I remember seeing cases full of preserved dirt and grass from the old stadium for sale. At first I laughed and asked myself who in their right mind would pay for a piece of dirt, and then ended up buying one. Who can say no to an actual piece of Yankees history??? Anyway, my question is, any idea how many of these pieces of dirt/grass were sold? Was it the entire stadium worth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4u19t?context=5)|I’ve sold more grass than anyone reading this…legally! We’ve taken grass from a whole bunch of fields…Wrigley, Notre Dame, Yankee Stadium, etc, about $1 million worth of freeze-dried grass and we're expanding this from baseball stadiums into more football stadiums, even with turf.
 |As for dirt, my goal is by 2020 to have sold over $100 million of dirt. We are at about $50 million worth. That is sales, not profits-yes, there’s high margins in dirt…but to authenticate it properly and to sell it the right way, there are costs. We now sell dirt from all 30 MLB parks. 
[How often do you see real Shoeless Joe Jackson signatures? Do you have any in your stock now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4t349?context=5)|Almost never. I may have come across one once. It's amazing, though, seeing the interest in an era where there was the Black Sox scandal...95 years ago! Makes me wonder if people are going to look at autographs from the ""steroid"" era in the same way in 95 years.
[Would you say it's more of who you know as opposed to what you know for someone trying to break into the sports industry? Trying to get into a career in either Baseball Ops or PR, both for an MLB team and I'm wondering what the best route is. I've had great internships so far. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4szia?context=5)|It's not who you know, but what you know about who!
[Who is the best athlete youve worked with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4t19k?context=5)|That's an unfair question because we work with so many athletes on all levels. To highlight a few, from Hockey I'd have to go with Mark Messier. Messier was the first athlete that we signed for the collectibles end of our company. He was a winner on and off the ice. Football is definitely Eli Manning. He's the most cooperative and amazing guy. A lot of athletes you havegreat relationships with and then when they win a championship they change, but he never changed. He has so much respectfor our partnership and always wants to help us grow.  Baseball would be Derek Jeter. What makes things so great with Jeter, not just the partnership we've had with him, but the ways I've been able to participate with the Turn 2 Foundation. I love being able to work with an athlete on that level, not just with signing autographs. The common denominator is that they all come from amazing families. 
[What is the best advice ever given to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4syw2?context=5)|There's two things: 1) When I was 13 or 14 years old and struggling in school, one of my neighbors took me aside. He was in charge of the custodial staff at CCNY, a very hard-working guy. He told me, ""Brandon, I know you're struggling in school, but you gotta make a decision. Do you want to work from the neck  up or the neck down?"" People that work from the neck up tend to do well in school 2) I was struggling to get a job out of college. My mom had a friend who was a car salesman and he said to me, ""What's wrong with you? You can't sit there and wait for the right opportunity, you gotta make the right opportunity. You're that type of guy"" Very few people are like that. but 
[Were there any other viable options concerning what to do with Old Yankee Stadium? Why did you demolish it instead of making it a museum or hotel or something? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4tsi9?context=5)|Well, with the new stadium being built, it had to be taken down. The way we took it apart was unlike anything that had been done before with other stadiums. As mentioned in another answer here, I wanted to give thousands of Yankee fans the opportunity to have a piece of the Old Stadium as a memory and I feel we accomplished that.
[How did you come up with the everything bagel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4su6v?context=5)|I worked in a bagel shop back in 1973 when I was 14. I was the morning baker two nights a week and then became the night baker. Just decided to screw around with a bunch of different combinations of toppings. Read a full blog post I wrote about it [here\] (\[Link to brandonsteiner.com](http://brandonsteiner.com/blog/i-invented-the-everything-bagel/))
[What is the one piece of memorabilia you want to own in your lifetime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4v3c8?context=5)|Probably a 98 Yankees World Series ring or trophy because I was so involved with that team. I had most of those guys signed and I was definitely a character in the middle of that summer. I feel really connected to those guys. I would love to have something on that level to remember the team by. 
[What part of the old stadium did you keep for yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4uaoq?context=5)|I actually didn't keep much. Just two seats, and game-used dirt that Mariano got for me. Oh and also a turnstyle.
 |I love everything from the Old Yankee Stadium, but purposely made it a point not to fall in love with everything in it, so that it would be easier to part with it all and get it into the right hands: the fans.
[What happened to the old ticket booths? Were they sold? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4vdxf?context=5)|Some were sold. We also have some still available for sale on our website.
[Besides Yankee Stadium, what's the most frivolous thing you have bought?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4t4zy?context=5)|The Don Larsen uniform that we bought and auctioned off last year was nice. Definitely on the top of my list. We've done some Jackie Robinson items as well and a a couple of very cool Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth items.
[Why did you buy the stadium?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4syhs?context=5)|Good question, the better question would be if I had the chance to do it all over again, would I? I would say 100% yes! I thought it was the crown jewel of our business. The most famous stadium with the most moments. At Steiner Sports we thrive and live on those moments. Taking apart that stadium was definitely a lot more complicated than I anticipated and was a much bigger undertaking than I had envisioned. I get into it in my book, You Gotta Have Balls, but to really answer your question: I didn’t want that stadium to be taken down without as many fans as possible getting something. My thought was to break it into hundreds of thousands of pieces, so that any fan could get something. I will say with conviction that goal was accomplished. Out of all the projects I've done, that was one of my most fun because of the partnership with the team and the interaction with so many players in helping them hold on to their memories with the lockers, signs, seats, etc. and of course, bringing it to the fans.
[Have you ever found any fake memorabilia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4sxxe?context=5)|When I go to card shows and online, from time to time I'll see fakes. The good news is that its probably at the lowest point it's been in the past 15 or 20 years.
[Good Afternoon Mr. Steiner, I would like to know why one of your sales staff misrepresented a Vintage Bobby Orr stick that I questioned several weeks ago when I purchased it ipo of the same stick on the Bobby Orr website that was cheaper?  This is ""Ask Me Anything"" correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg51zut?context=5)|Could you be more specific about hwo the salesperson misrepresented the product so I can get a sense of what you are referring to specifically? Facebook me with those details if you don't min ]here]([Link to facebook.com](http://facebook.com/steiner))
[Mr. Steiner, since taking over the New York Rangers' game worn jersey program prices have inflated and as many as five sets are being used in the regular season as opposed to three like they used to use. While some jerseys do sell, most remain in your inventory with an inflated market price. Why is there a need to flood the market with so many jerseys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg52rbr?context=5)|Good question, I don't know the answer to that, but let me look into it.
[What's your opinion on New York FC and MLS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4vgov?context=5)|At the end of the day, soccer is here to stay. When you start to see stuff liek that happening in the Big Apple, be prepared to start going to some live soccer games that should be highly competitive. Look at the Red Bulls franchise and that'll tell you everything. I'm ready to get into soccer collectibles a lot more, especially with the World Cup coming this summer.
[Where is the best place to sit(besides the legends suite of course\) in the stadium to sit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg5p5ex?context=5)|I'm a move-around type of guy. I think there are somany great places to sit that I sit in many great places throughout the season and I enjoy all of them. I love the Delta Club, I love the Legends Suite, the 100 level seats are great. I love the Audi Club, and once in a while I sit in the suites. Yankee Stadium is the first stadium where I feel there really is no set place I like best- I really love it all.
[Also, what is your favorite ballpark food item?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg5p5ex?context=5)|My favorite ballpark food: First of all, I've made it a mission to make it to every ballpark. At eevry one I have different favorites. I'm a peanut guy. Whenever I got to any ballpark I eat some peanuts. After that, depending on the place it varies. In Pittsburgh its pierogies. In Miami it's all the Latin food. In Milwaukee I have a brat. It all varies! 
[Hi Brandon, I own several game worn hockey jerseys from your company! I wanted to ask you two questions actually.  Do you ever worry about the sports memorabilia market being  saturated and how do you avoid that as an entrepreneur?  How do you authenticate your game worn sports memorabilia and how do I know when a particular item was worn or how do you track it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg51ooe?context=5)|Never worried about that. On its best day, I don't think we're going to meet the needs and demands of the memorabilia market when you look through all sports. The demand is just so much greater than the supply. What takes me aback is the amount of people that claim that their product is a collectible...like when food companies call something thats fat free when it isn't...there's too many companies in this business like that and that concerns me.
[Also,what do you see as the future for your company?  Having constant sales on products you were just selling for much more a month ago devalues the product. Are you looking to sell products where customers get a true value out of the product, as opposed to feeling they spent too much 5-10 years later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg51he6?context=5)|I totally disagree with that statement. I think I can name you tons of products that people have bought that are all worth so much more money than they were then. If you're counting on product to go up in value, though and not looking to buy for the sheer enjoyment of the product, then my company probably isn't best for you. No where in any of my promotions have I said, ""Buy Steiner because you can get rich 10 years from now."" 
[Thanks for the reply. A more specific question though, how do you keep track of when jerseys were worn? I.e. I have two set 5 Rangers jerseys from last year that I just don't know when they were worn. I have talked to my Steiner sales rep and he didn't really know either. I know that last year there were at least 5 home and away regular season sets, 2 Heritage sets, and at least 2 home and away playoff sets. That makes for 16 jerseys per player in a 48 game + playoffs season. How could I know when my set was worn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg5itqe?context=5)|Okay, I see now.

[What is your favorite moment that happened in Yankee stadium so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20mxfb/iama_brandon_steiner_ceo_of_steiner_sports_author/cg4ummw?context=5)|For me, some of my favorite memories go back to the Old Stadium. My dad took me to a twi-night doubleheader where Mickey Mantle hit home runs from both sides of the plate. Also, everytime I went to bat day as a kid was a favorite. One of the biggest memories would be about my first autograph. I was 11 years old and a few of the older kids I was hanging out with invited me to a game. My mom gave me $5 and said to bring her back the change. The kids I was with got tickets right by the on-deck circle. It was $4. Between that, a hot dog, a scorecard and the subway, I spent all the money I had. Of course, when I was there I forgot about what my mother was going to say to me after. Joe Pepitone was signing autographs a few feet away from me. Tom Tresh came by, as well. I was beaming. When I got home my my said, ""You spent $4 on a baseball ticket?!"" She ran out of the house and screamed at the boys I went to the game with. I was petrified and of course, she got her money back.

First, my background. I am a first year CS student at a college with a top 10 CS program in the nation. I went to a hackathon, did some stuff on my own, nothing really impressive.

I had an interview with a big (non-CS) company a couple of months ago, and, I thought, it went ok. Today, I got an email from them, saying that the hiring manager wants to have a 30 min phone talk with me about the 2 positions (business analyst and developer; I absolutely don't want the first one) and my background. 

Since it is a hiring manager, I would assume he is not a CS person, so there should be no technical questions, right? What should I be ready for? If it is a hiring manager, does it mean that I pretty much got the internship?

Also, the deadline for the summer semester is coming very close, so, if I don't get an offer by the end of the call, should I tell him that I can't wait another few months for their decision? I was planning to do summer semester because of no offers, but this might make me reconsider this, but I don't want to get in position of not getting the internship and not being able to take classes."

I entered college as a political science major and starting taking the math sequence in my sophomore year because I wanted to change majors to computer science (because of the job prospects). I was good at programming and usually the first person done with labs but I was not at all passionate or interested in it. I liked my math classes much more, so I became an applied mathematics &amp; statistics major. I only needed a few more political science courses to double major and the department came out with a bunch of new classes, so I decided to add it back as a second major.

It could just be my depression talking, but I'm not at all passionate about either field. I started off with the intention of getting into data analysis and maybe working for campaigns or non-profits as a data analyst. My school only has one data analysis course, which I will be taking this summer. There are only two statistics courses, which I haven't taken because the teacher is awful and requires us to learn all the material on our own through group projects. I was just going to teach myself over the summer, then over winter break, now it's back to the next summer.

I'm pretty lost. I have an average 3.5 GPA, no strong recommendations, no internships (applying for an awesome online internship this summer). My math skills are slightly above average, but nothing great (unlike some of my peers who are math geniuses). I spend most of my time studying and taking care of my disabled grandmother who I live with. I have taken care of her since I graduated high school, which has made it impossible to get jobs and internships.

I don't know what I am passionate about. I like American political history. I'm taking a class on GIS now and that has been interesting and I enjoy it. I can program on a basic level even though I don't really like it/fit in in that industry. I will be learning data analysis, R and SPSS this summer and maybe taking another GIS course. 

Does anybody have any advice? Can you think of any jobs that might suit me? I would really appreciate it. Thank you."

I feel it's better if you understand my background.

I've been programming off and on, here and there, finally getting serious in the past 3-4 years. I've written some neat software around 12-14 years ago when I was a kid, but I stopped writing for a while.

I have had pretty much zero work history, other than sporadic self-employment (not enough people in this small town to afford my services) and the previous IT job which I quit. I quit the previous job because they were paying me minimum wage to do entry-level work (small town, only job I could find) and I decided to go back to school, get my GED, and then go to college.

Now that I'm in college, and I find the coursework extremely easy, I feel like I have the skills to find work somewhere, just not here. There are quite literally zero IT jobs in my town, and very few in this state. I don't want to live here anymore, anyway. I've finished the vast majority of my IT courses already, only about 3 or 4 courses remain.

I need help understanding what employers want the most. I need help understanding, beyond my personal portfolio, what I can do to make employers want me. I have marketable skills, but I think I might be missing something here.

Now, it doesn't help that I'm pretty much deaf and can't use the phone in any capacity. Employers call my house and a family member answers for me. They don't like that I can't hear, and they usually hang up the phone, even when we explain it's because I can't hear. I can still speak perfectly, and I even speak two languages (I'm pretty good at reading lips, too) despite my shitty hearing, but... it doesn't seem to matter. 

A lot of potential employers email me asking for a phone number, but when I explain that I can't hear and need to use email, they completely and totally stop responding to me. 

The last staffing agency I visited started giving me hearing tests for a web development position, and kept telling me that my disability would probably prevent me from obtaining employment with their clients. ""They're probably going to say no, but we can try it anyway."" 

Some employers tell me that the distance (when applying to jobs out of state) is the main reason I haven't been considered, but I've repeatedly offered to fly myself out for interviews, and pay for my own relocation. I've been sure to mention this on my cover letters and applications as well, but they still aren't satisfied.

I seriously feel like giving up. I know I have good skills, but nobody seems to want to give me a shot. What the hell am I doing wrong? What can I do to improve my chances of getting a job? I'm sick of welfare and being dependent on SSI/etc. I want to work. I want to work really hard and prove myself to SOMEONE, ANYONE.

Please help!

They're difficult to find here in my home town, and even the state, so I'm actually wondering if I could find an internship out of state since I'm looking to get out... It would be awesome to find some kind of paid internship where I could afford to survive off of.  I do have three stellar letters of recommendations, including one from my professor.**"

[Why is so much corporate money involved in politics? Shouldn't it be up to the people, not the people with the most money?  Which decisions made it like this and how can we reverse them? When did american government stop being for the people? How many lobbyists are in Washington right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58qx1?context=5)|1) We DO need to get corporate money out of politics. The Supreme Court contributed to making it like this when they equated money to speech, essentially saying that if one denies a corporation the right to spend unlimited money to elect a candidate, you've denied their 1st Amendment rights. Which I think is just wrong. I support public financing of elections. No private donations or self-funding, everyone is on an equal platform, and may the best ideas win.  2) This may not be popular, but I believe it strongly. It STILL IS up to the people, and the people abrogate their responsibility by choosing to be ill-informed. Corporate money buys TV ads, it buys mail pieces, it buys radio ads. It does not buy votes.  If a corporation spends $100 million on a blatantly false TV ad, and everyone went to Google and did a quick search, and found ""Oh hey, that's total bullshit!"", then that money would have no power. The people are the ones who give power to corporate money by failing in their responsibility to be informed citizens.
[*The people are the ones who give power to corporate money by failing in their responsibility to be informed citizens.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5mfn7?context=5)|Yep. Can we tackle that without tackling campaign finance, though? I think if you first tackle campaign finance, and take away the ability of corporate/dark money to drown out other voices, you then make it easier to focus on education and substance. It really does make me sad, though. The influence of money in politics would be precisely dick if people did 5 minutes of online research before they voted.
[How did you get into your field? If you went to school, what did you go for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54mv3?context=5)|The answer may be surprising. I was a recent grad, I saw a job posting for literally the most entry-level job ever, I applied, I got hired. I didn't know anyone.
 |There's no experience or education required to get into it. You just have to be willing to work 100+ hours a week for shit money, and love every minute of it. Which usually means you have to be young, but not always.
 |I went to school for political science, and learned nothing relevant to American political campaigns (though I got a great education and am grateful for it). If you or others reading are students looking to get a leg up on getting into campaigns: Major in mathematics. For real. 
[I'm a college freshman studying business with a focus in marketing. Do you think I could use the skills I learn in this field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg556h5?context=5)|Yes.
 |Really, all you need to get started is a willingness to work hard and talk to total strangers who don't want to talk to you for 12 hours a day. You can learn the rest as you go. 
[Why major in mathematics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg56bai?context=5)|Predictive modeling. People with the data analysis skills to generate support/turnout models are at an incredible premium right now. It's by far the easiest and most lucrative ""in"" to campaigns.
 |People are slowly realizing that the old-school, horserace-focused consultants who ""go with their gut"" are completely full of shit. The analogies to ""Moneyball"" are easy to see. It's about to be a whole new world.
[We are learning about political parties, and I was wondering, do you believe 2016 will be a critical election?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55rxn?context=5)|1) Yes. Any time you elect a President, it's critical.
[With the all different ideologies  between Congress and House of Rep., do you find that we may never reach a compromise on anything anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55rxn?context=5)|2) No. And it's not about ideology, either. People in Washington only care about beating the Republicans or beating the Democrats. Nobody wants to get shit done. I don't see it changing. And that's too bad.
[Also, how does the administration deal with negativity from people, and especially from the media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55rxn?context=5)|3) I can't speak for the administration, I don't work for them. On the campaign, it depends on what type of negativity. If it's unproductive, such as ""I hate Obama, he hates America,"" we ignore it. If it's productive policy criticism, such as ""I think Obamacare is wrong because X, Y, Z,"" then we respond and tell them why we think we're right. 
[What do senior staffers, people like yourself, do in between campaigns? Most of the people I've met were field staff, and didn't work in politics between elections. They worked retail, etc.  How did you get your senior jobs on these campaigns? Was it a call a friend who called a friend, and boom you have an offer kind of deal?  I am considering getting a PhD in Political Science, with a concentration in methodology and political statistical analysis. How do you think this would benefit me, and following earning the PhD, how would I go about getting a job crunching the polling numbers for campaigns?  If I were to work, for instance, as a data director for a campaign, how easy do you believe the switch to, for instance, the political team, or the communications  or strategy teams would be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg572yu?context=5)|We're often no different! I've worked in retail between campaigns. I have enough money saved that I COULD do nothing for a few months, but I prefer to be active. And I worked in retail forever in HS and college, so it's easy to find work. A lot of people do nothing for a few months, though. That shit is draining! You need a vacation sometimes.  I've worked for the same bosses a number of times. When they hire for a position, they know I do good work and they call me. As they get progressively higher in the ranks, so do I. You just have to a) do good work, and b) maintain good relationships. Probably no different than any other job, really.
 |3/4. This is not at all a bad career plan. Here's my suggestion: offer your services for free or for little money to small/local campaigns. ALL of the advanced data analysis stuff that Obama did can be done on any campaign by someone w/PhD level knowledge. Best part: nobody's out there doing it. Everyone's focused on the big, easy money in Senate races/statewide races. Local campaigns are the frontier for data analysis, dude. And it's an untapped market. Get in on that. 
[Where does the Democratic party keep its spine, and when are we ever going to see it again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55b17?context=5)|Wish I knew, my friend. Too many members of Congress have made it a policy to run as far away from their accomplishments as possible. Too much catering to the lowest common denominator. It's sad.
[What famous politicians or campaign staff do you have in your contact list on your phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58l9m?context=5)|1) I keep that in my Gmail because of a time I drunk dialed someone. And that's all I have to say about that. Haha.
[What do you do in the off season to make money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58l9m?context=5)|2) I work retail sometimes. I have enough saved to go a few months without working until the next campaign comes up, but I like to do stuff. And the timing is usually good--campaign ends in November, oh hey, it's time for Black Friday! I go for commission jobs and usually make pretty solid money.
[What do the big consultants, such as David Axelrod, do in the off season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58l9m?context=5)|3) Those guys don't have an off season. They make a shiiit ton of money on speaking engagements, and they do a lot of media guest appearances too.
[What are your predictions in the following state Senate races: Louisiana, North Carolina, Alaska, and Arkansas? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58l9m?context=5)|4) I think Dems win 3/4 (I think Begich will get his ass kicked in AK). I'm not involved in any of the four and none of my friends are either, so I probably don't know much more than you, though!
[Oddest experience with a candidate or member of the public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55kmc?context=5)|2) Public financing. 100%. Give each candidate the same amount, and may the best ideas win.
[In theory you could ban candidates from using their own money, but the Supreme Court has ruled that spending your own money for your campaign is a form of speech and therefore can't be restricted. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg56uh6?context=5)| 
[I'm left as they come but I view it as a freedom of speech issue. There's no good way to decide what is and is not political speech in an election season. The saving grace is that at a certain point you start to hit diminishing returns, so that 1$ in October gives less result than 1$ in march. Do you see that at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5kgw9?context=5)|You're not wrong about freedom of speech. It's a complicated issue, and I did oversimplify it a bit. It's possible, though, to have your cake and eat it too. For example, one could make contributions to political campaigns tax deductible up to a certain dollar amount--it's public financing (as that money comes out of the treasury), but citizens use their 1st Amendment rights to decide where the money goes.
 |And keep in mind we're talking about direct contributions to candidates here. The Supreme Court has found numerous times that government has a compelling interest to restrict and regulate direct contributions to prevent government corruption. Independent expenditures are completely separate from this discussion, and that largely satisfies the 1st Amendment issue as well.
 |You are incorrect about diminishing returns--at least in terms of timing. A voter contact in October is exponentially more effective than a voter contact in March, and there's a good bit of academic research to back that up. You ARE correct that you eventually reach a point of oversaturation, where additional contacts are less effective. If campaigns reach that point in October, it's because they spent their money inefficiently. Which I'll grant you, many do.
 |Also keep in mind that the discussion contributions and expenditures in re: political speech is very different. See Buckley v. Valeo.
[*Public financing. 100%. Give each candidate the same amount, and may the best ideas win.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5m8e8?context=5)|I THINK I know what you mean. Please correct me if I don't. I think what you mean is that if you outlaw all private donations, they'll just find another way to spend money--but since donations are now outlawed, they'll spend it totally anonymously, resulting in the same amount of money in politics, but way less transparency. If that's what you mean, it is a real concern.  Keep in mind ""public financing"" doesn't always mean candidates just get money for nothing without having to work, and doesn't always exclude donations. I posted elsewhere that some well-run systems have given tax credits to citizens who contribute up to a certain amount to candidates/parties. So the contributions themselves are publicly funded,  but private citizens choose where they go and everything is still reported as it is now. 
[It would destroy the jobs that exist in the sector of private financing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5m8e8?context=5)|Worth it. Sorry to be blunt, all my finance director friends. Look, their skills are very valuable and translate well to private industry. They'll be fine. And I value their jobs less than I value my democracy. 
[What do you think the ideal time to hit the saturation point is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5njwj?context=5)|Election Day! The value of a contact on Election Day far outweighs the value of a contact on any day prior.
 |Answer differs depending on widespread availability/ease of early voting, too. Depends where you're running.
 |(Oh, and I should note I'm primarily talking about turnout/GOTV here. The value of persuasion contacts is incredibly difficult to study in a controlled experiment--because you can independently verify that a person voted, but it's quite difficult to independently verify WHO they voted for to prove/disprove your hypothesis.) 
[I would be running for reelection in the Islamic Republic of Turkmenistan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5nw2b?context=5)|Are you going to fall off your horse again?
[I'm sorry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5oagg?context=5)|[Link to gawker.com](http://gawker.com/heres-the-video-turkmenistans-president-doesnt-want-486251488)
 |Haha. You can scrub it from the local news, but Gawker is forever!
[In general, what's the pay scale looking like for senior staffers in all the fields (Communications, political, digital, grassroots, legal, finance\)? Some basic numbers, please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58awq?context=5)|Most department directors will make about the same amount of money, and on a major statewide race, you're probably looking at around $5k - $7k per month. The field (grassroots) director (on campaigns I've worked on, again, YMMV) will sometimes make a bit more and have the title of Deputy Campaign Manager. Why? Because when you're a field director, you're managing 100+ direct/indirect full-time reports. Your job is management, and that's a valuable skill. On other campaigns, the finance director will make a bit more than the others. But yeah, generally all department heads make around the same.
[How do the consultants who start their own firms get consulting jobs, instead of being in-house staff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58awq?context=5)|Starting your own firm is tough. Best way is to go to candidates you've worked for in the past. Getting work as a consultant from cold-calling campaigns is close to impossible if you're not an established name.  Remember--you're asking for a job from someone who got his/her start in campaigns by knocking on doors of strangers asking them to vote for a candidate. If you just walk right in and ask for a job, they'll respect your courage and they'll remember you. (You'll probably get rejected more often than not, of course--it's a tough job market. But you'll stand out from the crowd.) 
[For getting campaign jobs... would you recommend just like writing a generic cover letter and resume and sending it to the campaign totally unsolicited, without any sort of 'job posting?' What would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg58awq?context=5)|TOTALLY depends on the campaign. For the sake of discussion, let's assume we're talking about a major statewide or congressional campaign, with the understanding that YMMV.  Yes! I would recommend doing that (but not exclusively). Hell, just go to the office with your resume and ask to talk to someone. One of my best hires ever was a person who just walked in off the street, resume in hand, asking if we were hiring. We were, I had some free time, I interviewed them, hired them on the spot.
[What was your worst or best experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54mib?context=5)|Best experience was transitioning from the Hillary campaign to the Obama campaign. I was scared I wouldn't be accepted, or that it would be awkward, or that things would be clique-y.
 |A lot of us came over from Hillaryland after she dropped out, and we were welcomed as family from day one. People can say whatever they want about the candidate, the staff were top-notch talents and human beings.
[Wow that sounds really great!  How different were the two campaigns for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54y2o?context=5)|Not that different, honestly.
 |Here's a thing I wish the media understood better: The Obama campaign didn't do anything revolutionary. None of the stuff the media slobbered over (predictive modeling/data analysis, neighborhood team-based organizing, et cetera) was new.
 |The Obama campaign was a typical 21st-century American campaign. It was differentiated by the fact that it was really, really, really fucking well-run. They just did the usual stuff so much better than everyone else that everyone thought it was new!
[What was the most intense moment on the campaign trail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54q0i?context=5)|Tough to pick.
 |Not a single ""moment,"" but there was a week during the '08 primary where I had to do something like 30+ rallies w/President Clinton. It was...stressful.
 |Most intense single moment was (though not on the campaign trail), when President Obama arrived at the inaugural ball I was at in January '09 (there's not just one official ball, there are a ton--which I never knew before then!).
 |When they announced, ""the President of the United States of America,"" it was just...a surreal moment. After working so hard for the past year+, it was kind of the ""everything coming to fruition"" moment, you know?
[Best way to land an internship on the Hill for a veteran at GMU? I feel like I'm far behind the ambitious 19 year old from Georgetown majoring in International Affairs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54x90?context=5)|You probably are, and that sucks and is wrong. On the campaign side, youth is always at a premium. Probably true on the Hill as well.
 |I have very little experience on the official side, I've mostly stuck to campaigns, so I'm not the best person to help you navigate the Hill.
 |Do as much networking as you can. Being a veteran SHOULD give you a leg up (though I dunno if it will in reality). DC's all about relationships.
 |Sorry I can't offer much advice there. I've never worked on the Hill or for a member of Congress.
[As a senior staffer, what is a day in the life of the campaign political director, strategy officer, and the data director? How does these roles differ from similar roles, but for party organizations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg57qtn?context=5)|Most campaigns don't have a political director. Because they don't do much valuable work. Campaigns that do have them--the political director spends time managing relationships with elected officials, getting endorsements, that sort of thing. Thing is, though, that sort of shit just doesn't move votes. It's mostly a waste of time.
 |Strategy officer isn't really a thing? Closest thing would be ""General Consultant,"" who's kind of like the Grand Poobah of the consultants. Usually, this is not a full-time employee, but someone with decades of experience who just oversees, signs off on major decisions, and provides input when needed.
 |Data Director...Excel. Excel all day long. If you don't know what vlookup and pivot tables are, you'll find out real quick.
[What was the best campaign you were a part of and why?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg54oi9?context=5)|The Hillary campaign. For reasons having nothing to do with the merits of one candidate over another.
 |Working on a presidential primary campaign, you're constantly moving from one place to another. One state has its primary, you're on to the next. So on and so forth. And you get to spend a ton of time around the candidate (and, in this case, her husband) at various events.
 |Incredible experience, for sure, despite the fact that we got beat.
[What's your primary expertise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|1) Field. You couldn't have guessed from where I said ""fuck advance?"" Haha. I dabble in comms/general consulting a bit.
[Are you on the consultancy side now? Did you join an existing shop or open your own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|2) Yes, kind of. The latter. It's a little complicated, and don't want to go too far toward revealing what I'm doing. You know how it is.
[What's your take on large single-issue voters on our side? I'm thinking of Tom Steyer most recently.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|3) Ugh, man. I have no association with the DSCC and so it doesn't affect my professional life, but it irks me when they target vulnerable Dems (e.g. Mary Landrieu). Like, you really think replacing her with a Republican is going to help your cause? I just think they're often short-sighted.
[A lot of the cool modeling stuff that's being done requires large sample sizes, which is difficult to get on the local level. For campaigns that are smaller than their TV market, do you think there's a need to focus on data?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cd81?context=5)|4) Generally true, yeah. Though one can do rougher support/turnout models with smaller sample sizes. However, no, I don't think there's AS much need to focus on data. Modeling is all about increasing efficiency. The cost of creating a model + contacting your highly targeted voters has to equal less than the cost of just contacting all the voters, or you haven't really gained much. And I think in smaller races, that's less likely to be the case.
[Are there knowledge bases available to vetted staff on best practices for this sort of thing? Like I said, I've been out of the game for a bit but I'm considering coming back. I'd just like something both more flexible and more in-depth than a training. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5cz5v?context=5)|I went back to a candidate I worked for full-time, who was running for office again. He had all-new staff this time around, and he wanted someone on call who he trusted. I think that's the best way to go, hit up old bosses who are running again.  I find a lot of stuff by following poli sci professors on Twitter. Hahaha. You'd be surprised how useful that is! The best knowledge base I know of is Analyst Institute--which I had access to at one time, but now 2012 is over, so...damn. That's something I'd like to create, perhaps. It's a good point that there's not a good central location for all that stuff. Like the info's all out there, but you have to search all over for it.
[How many people on a campaign staff, and how are responsibilities divvied up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55akn?context=5)|1) Often way too much. I've seen campaigns where the campaign manager essentially runs the official (government) side office, as well as the campaign. During election season, government staff usually have to run press releases/policy proposals by the campaign manager for approval. I think that's wrong.  Additionally, I've seen a ton of candidates fight to take a stand on something because they believe it's right, only to be talked out of it by their staff because it'll hurt the campaign.
[10 years from now, what will be the 'rising' field in politics? I would say right now, it's the digital and social media teams. What is going to be hot?  Compare and contrast working for a national/state party organization and a political campaign.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5a9fv?context=5)|Most campaigns actually do digital/social media wrong, and render it useless. It's only useful if online engagement translates to offline action. The only reason for social media to exist is to get people to volunteer, donate, or vote for your candidate. Too many campaigns say, yayyy we got 1,000 Facebook fans...and then don't do shit with them.  1) This is rising right now, but it will rise further: Local elections. For two reasons. First is that actual government mostly happens on the local level. If you live in Omaha, NE, who the Mayor of Omaha is and who's on the council matters a whole lot more to your day-to-day life than who the President is. And as more advanced campaign tactics start to filter down to local elections, they'll become more ""professionalized."" The second reason is that local elections are candidate-makers for Congressional elections. The right has been very methodically getting people elected to state legislatures, city councils, et cetera for years, to groom them to run for Congress. The left needs to get their shit together and do so as well. For this reason, you'll soon see a lot more super PAC/outside money flowing into small-town races. Not making any value judgments on that being good/bad. Just a prediction.  2) This is sorta the other side of the coin, but I just want to throw it out there that TV advertising will be dead in ten years. There's a lot of academic research showing it's a bad investment, and people just don't consume TV in the same way. Because of that, I think the ""hot new thing"" will be something nobody's ever heard of. I'll let you know if I invent it. ;)
 |National/state party organizations almost never have their shit together. They're often staffed by the ""B team"" who couldn't handle the hours/stress of working full-time on a campaign. (Coordinated campaigns run through the state party = the exception). This is not always true, of course. I've worked with some amazing state party organizations.
[What is the state of international political consulting?  What do you plan on doing in the future if you don't work on national campaigns?  Who manages the campaigns... after the elections. Such as the Romney campaign, they still have reports they are filing, and people on payroll. They are still collecting donations, making disbursements, etc. Who manages these campaigns, and how much do you estimate they are being paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg59zag?context=5)|1) There are some American firms doing fascinating work on this front. A lot of international candidates and parties REALLY want to work with Obama campaign vets, and some firms have smartly set themselves up as conduits. They hire people on, contract with candidates/parties in other countries, and send them out! It's extremely lucrative. I've never done it, but I have friends who have. I'd like to some day--sounds fun! If what you meant is what is the state of homegrown political consulting in other countries...I do not know.
 |2) I...have no idea. Haha. Which is why I'm still in campaigns. It's REALLY hard to get out. Here's why: most people don't understand what I do. People will see my resume, and see that I've hired/managed a staff of over 100 and managed a multi-million dollar budget, and literally ask, ""So, a campaign? So you like, put up signs? Did you get paid?"" It's quite frustrating, and I wish I knew how to better translate it into private sector-speak. I like management--I think I've learned a lot about how to manage staff in high-stress environments. So I'd like to stick with that, in some form or another.
 |4) This is a great question. Larger campaigns (like Romney/Obama) have large operations staff who manage budgets, process payroll, take care of compliance/insurance/all that stuff. Usually one of those people (often the COO) stays on for a while after the election to manage that stuff.  Not sure how much they're being paid, but I can tell you that every dime spent by every campaign in America is public record, as is who it goes to. So it should be pretty easy to look up.
[Yes, my intent for the question was exactly how you answered it. I know that many consultants take in some income from international clients. Do they want anyone from the Romney campaign really? How do they get these jobs, and what parts of the world are they in? Thanks!  Perhaps you could work for a think tank (even though you have done/not done policy work for the campaigns\), the government as some sort of appointee, work public affairs for a company, become a lobbyist, or join some sort of public affairs/political affairs firm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5ajfu?context=5)|Haha, I don't think they want many people from the Romney campaign. All partisan differences aside, it was a poorly run campaign. I'm willing to give respect to opponents who run strong campaigns, but that wasn't one. Most of my friends who've done those jobs, they're in developing democracies--SE Asia, Eastern Europe, in particular. I think that the ""nicer"" places (Germany, UK, Japan, to name a few) are easily highly-developed enough to have their own professional consultant class.  On geography, there's a really interesting divide there. Some people set up shop in a single state and try to work exclusively for candidates there (often because it's their home!). I have been a little bit of everywhere, haha. I prefer it that way. It's a beautiful country, and I've gotten to see all of it.
[Do a lot of people working on campaign can make more money working elsewhere? I guess the real question is, how much of a financial sacrifice do people take on for the campaign? (or maybe perhaps it's a full career\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55bro?context=5)|Depends. If you stick with it, you can make a good living. In the mid-to-senior level staff range, you usually make a solid middle-class income. It's not a sacrifice, but I could definitely make more and work less doing something else.
 |When I was first starting out, I made no money at all. Less than retail. But once you pay your dues at the entry level, it's not bad.
 |Nobody's getting rich, though. Except the ""big name"" consultants. David Axelrod, those kinda guys.
[Are you going to work for Hillary's campaign for 2016? (if not, why not\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg55649?context=5)|I don't know! I have no ""insider info"" that she's running or not running (that stuff is all INCREDIBLY close to the vest right now). But...I think we all know she is, yeah?
 |I want to say no. I loved the experience in '08, and I'll vote for her if she runs. But a presidential campaign is just such an incredibly exhausting experience, and I'm not as young as I used to be.
 |But...I don't know if I'll be able to say no. It was one of the defining experiences of my life the first time. It would be incredibly hard to say no to doing it again.
[Do people in your profession have an 'office' with a desk, stapler, office door, etc? Like, where do you work, sorta?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5b1a4?context=5)|1) Depends on the stage of the campaign! Campaigns go from 1 dude/girl sitting alone in Starbucks to 30+ offices in a state and over 100 paid staff in the space of 3 or 4 months. You always get a desk and a stapler eventually, though! But sometimes you gotta scrounge it yourself on Craigslist Free. Haha. Campaigns are frugal.
[What's the family life like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5b1a4?context=5)|2) For most people it's non-existent. You work 7 days a week, minimum 12 hours a day. ""Relationships,"" such as they are, are generally with co-workers. It's not a super healthy ""family life."" That's why most people don't do it very long. I certainly won't do it forever.
[How much travel does your job entail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5b1a4?context=5)|3) Day-to-day travel? Not very much. But I usually have to move across the country every year to start a new job, so there's that!
[Another question- how does one ask for pay raises and/or promotions while working on a political campaign? I am transitioning into some paid political jobs, but am relatively unclear as to how to go about doing this with the raises and promotions. I'm aware of the bonuses involved for winning primaries, etc., but are these all the bonus/raise opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg57e2u?context=5)|Yeah, that can be a tough one! Pay raises and promotions aren't that common on campaigns. Since it's a short-term job to begin with, you don't run into that many scenarios where your boss is leaving and you have an opportunity to interview for his/her job, you know?
 |One thing I can guarantee you: Almost no campaign manager will give you a raise if you don't ask. Go to them and ask. And come prepared with data to back up why you deserve it.
 |But, most people don't get raises/promotions during a campaign. It happens, but it isn't too common. Good news is that once you do a cycle at one level of a campaign, you generally move up a notch or two in your next campaign--people who stick with it tend to climb the ladder fast, since most people just do a campaign or two and then quit.
[How do you adjust to the constant moving across the country practically every year? What are you living circumstances; do you lease an apartment, stay extended stay at hotels, etc., assuming some campaigns don't last all the long, it's not really viable to lease something.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5pv94?context=5)|Depends on seniority/how much you're getting paid. Most entry-level folks live in what we call ""supporter housing:"" Volunteers donate spare bedrooms to the campaign, and you just crash there for a few months. It can be...awkward. I've lived w/some weird people. I have an apartment now. I've done the extended stay thing before, too. Usually it's easy enough to find a place that'll do a short-term lease though! I've got a good month-to-month place now. 
[How do you find campaign jobs, that are lets say, across the country, if you don't have any connections? Most of the time, there aren't any job boards for political jobs. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5pv94?context=5)|Two ways. First is that there are job boards for political jobs--quite a few, actually. Every position I've ever hired for, I've sent out job postings and reviewed resumes from strangers. Second way, though, is connections. Most people who run campaigns at all levels are transients like myself. So, if some guy is running a campaign in California, he's probably not from there, and I probably worked with him on a campaign in Ohio a couple years ago. That sort of thing. 
[When working for campaigns, do they offer any sort of sign on bonus or relocation for when you just get the job? Or are the only bonueses if the candidate wins primary, general, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20o396/iama_senior_democratic_campaign_staffer_formerly/cg5pv94?context=5)|They'll offer whatever you can negotiate! It's just like any other job in that respect. If they want you bad enough, you can get it. Sometimes they just can't afford it, and you don't get it. At the very least I usually get gas expenses covered.

[Are Ukranians fearful that Russia will absorb more of Ukraine?  How do Ukranians outside of Crimea feel about the vote in Crimea? Was it (the vote\) a good representation of the wishes of the people in Crimea (ignoring the rest of Ukraine\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hx2h?context=5)|I will try to be as objective as I can.  1) Yes they are. But it definitely will not be like Crimea, there will be shooting, guerrila warfare and thousands of casualties. So I'm quite sure that this will not happen, because if Putin does try it - it will seriously undermine his support in Russia. Russia now is trying to push their agenda of Ukrainian federalization, basically to give very wide autonomy to every region, to try to take over several regions without shooting eventually. My best guess is that this will fail.  2) They feel this is a military intervention and not a legit vote. I don't mind a normal separation referendum like they are planning in Scotland. It should come after a lot of debate on how to divide both assets and liabilities etc. In Crimea armed men took over Crimean parliament, declared that it voted for a referendum and that it will happen in a few weeks, took all the assets and none of the liabilities and everyone who was against it was too scared to speak and boycotted the referendum. The polls I've seen before showed between 40 and 50% crimeans want to join Russia, and much more in Sevastopol.
[Are Russia's actions a complete surprise to the Ukranian people? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hx2h?context=5)|Yes, it was a complete surprise and everyone was shocked.  
[What is something the media misinterprets or publishes wrong and everyone seems to believe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i39c?context=5)|The worst lie is that Ukrainian radicals with guns took power in the country. Very large part of the population supported and took part in the protests. The whole Kiev investment community was there, most of local businessmen, artists, etc.  I've met many classmates from school and University I haven't seen for years. My programming teacher was beat up and arrested, a colleague of my dad was shot and killed. The actual role of far right radicals and their support in society is not higher that any other european country, it's hust a huge success of russian propaganda to display it otherwise. Just so you know: Svoboda far right party has very little support and is quite lickely to not pass 5% barrier in the next parliamental elections. Right sector - probably the same. They posed a lot for the cameras, but there just not much of them and not much support. Out of the 100 dead there's 1 from the right sector.
[What ""lies"" do we read in the News?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i39c?context=5)|Also, the parliament is the same, it appointed new cabinet of ministers with a consitutional majority and scheduled a presidential election on may 25th.
[Also: Should or could we take the referendum serious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i39c?context=5)|Another great lie is that russian speakers are somehow opressed in Ukraine. They are more oppressed in Russia IMO and I'm a russian speaker.
[Do you believe that taking Crimea was always on Putin's 'to-do' list or was Russia just taking advantage of the turmoil created by the overthrow of the government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5iupr?context=5)|It was always on the list. He deliberately helped a very weak leader stay in power while russian agents have been infiltrating Ukrainian secret services, army, police and local goverments for years. Protests on Maidan were certainly not planned, so after protestors won it was a now or never moment for Putin. And he acted. 
[So, in your opinion, is Crimea lost? And should the west just stay out of it at this point, or is there something that can be done?  Edit: thank you for doing this, btw... its refreshing hearing the perspective of someone with firsthand knowledge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kqo6?context=5)|For now - yes, it is lost.
[Do you think there's anything that the west should be doing to help Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5lqg2?context=5)|Economic support is very important and it is on the way. I understand that western leaders don't want to hurt their own economies with heavy economic sanctions on Russia and I don't really blame them, but the sentiment here is that the west always does too little too late.
 |A much bigger story than most realize is the arrest of mr Firtash in Austria. He's worth about 4 billion dollars, a business partner of Putin and his friends and a very powerful pro russian agent. He knows a lot about shady russian gas deals and is super valuable for USA. 
[Has the rest of ukraine given up on retaining/regaining Crimea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieyo?context=5)|1) Some (me) have, but overall not.  2) Not sure.
[Do you worry that if Russia succeeds in annexing Crimea it will grow even bolder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieyo?context=5)|3) This is a great question. There are several reasons.
[Is it purely the naval base?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieyo?context=5)|First, there's a widespread belief in Russia that Crimea was just given to Ukraine, that this was unfair and it should be Russian again. So biggest motivation for Putin is to please his voters. What they forget is the economic and other reasons for the ""gift"" and the fact that about the same amount of ukrainian land was exchanged and given to Russia at that time (no, they are not planning to give it back). Another issue is that a lot of local population were deported and a lot of russians were encouraged to come there, so this high percentage of russian population is not something that happened naturally. But I won't claim to be a history expert, what done is done.
 |Another reason is because he can and no one can do anything about it.
[How much money have you lost / gained directly related to the issues happening there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ih2z?context=5)|It was a roller coaster. Overall we made good money on Ukrainian eurobonds but it added some grey hair. 
[Wall Street guy here (I'm a sell-side analyst\). I'd like to ask more about how financial services operates in the Ukraine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ju1x?context=5)|I was considering that a year ago. Now I see a posibility of a huge 30 year bull market here, the kind of that makes fortunes, so I'm definitely staying.
[Do you guys have hedge funds and is the 2/20 fee structure common?  Did you see capital flight from Ukraine and/or Crimea before the conflict that might suggest some people knew this was coming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ju1x?context=5)|There are several 2/20 hedge funds in Ukraine. We run two :). Also there's a trend for some rich people to not invest in a outside funds, but hire a team to invest their money in global markets. There are a few such teams also.
 |Language issues and reputation of some businessmen that you can not see from the numbers  No, there has been capital flight for previous 5 years, but now there's hope again with all the western help etc.
[American here, I've heard several reports stating that some of the protesting Ukrainian citizens had seized and used firearms against the police agencies of the Ukraine and killed several law enforcement officers. Is this true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ixny?context=5)|I believe it is true. But they were certainly not the first to start beating up police. And they were not the first to start shooting and killing. I'm not sure about total number of police fatalities. I believe it's about 5-6 men. vs over 100 dead protesters and about 30 who has gone missing and was never found and thousands injured.
 |Also in many countries people don't like police, but there's a spectrum to it. In Ukraine before the protests public support of police was about 2-3%, which is about the number of policemen and their families in the population :). All organized crime here is well connected to people in power and police. All drug trade is controlled by police etc.
[So, what's the process for replacing law enforcement? Are there people willing to train to be police officers to replace the corrupt ones, or is it gonna be a transition where people are gonna have to self-enforce? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5krhn?context=5)|It's a huge problem, probably one of the most important right now. Basically police bosses are very corrupt and won't do anything. Lower ranked guys depended a lot on corruption too, because their official salary is really low. They are very demoralized now and won't do anything too. Now the government is recruiting people into the new National Guard. Is being made in a rush and there are doubts it work out right, but it's a good idea.  
[Do you think if the protest never got violent and people went about in more peaceful manner that there still could have been change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i8vo?context=5)|Great question. No simple anwser to this one. Theoretically if the government did something when the large protest errupted, like fire the prime minister and internal affairs minister - no more violence would have ensued. But after the violence and deaths we got much more than we would not have gotten otherwise.
[Do you feel your situation is better right now being on the brink of war, or the way it was before with the old government and no war about to happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5icdp?context=5)|What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. Long term this is all for the good.
[What is your hope for the elections in May? Are there any candidates yet, or any who might be strong candidates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5irhu?context=5)|It's going to be very competitive. There are three potential leaders: Tymoshenko, Klitchko and Poroshenko. From what I see Tymoshenko is a bit behind the other two. I hope she doesn't win, I have issues with her corruption scandals and affilation to gas deals in 90s, also it would be a preferred candidate for Putin.
 |Poroshenko is very smart and good businessman/manager, although there weren't any huge corruption scandals about him - I still doubt his motives. For example while being affilated with a local car factory he raised car import tariffs while being the economy minister. But he's definitely not a hardcore gangster like Yanukovitch.
 |You know Klitchko, he is not a great manager, doesn't have a great team, but I have less doubts about his inner values and I won't mind if he wins. Also he took part in protests a lot. 
[Thanks for answering these pretty objectively. What do you think about far-right Pravy Sektor (Right Sector\) Leader Dmytro Yarosh announcing his run for presidency as well; what would his chances be considering the protests may have stricken up feelings of pride or nationalism? Also, from what I've read (and what you've said\), the new candidates don't seem to be much better than the old; do you see protests happening again in a year or so akin to what happened in Egypt?  Edit: official party name.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5lyxx?context=5)|He's not a serious contender. And you read what he actually says on facebook and not in Russian media - he's not that bad, and he is not really far right eather. But I don't know. Saying what people want to hear is one thing. Living up to it is another.
[Is it an age rift that separates the ideals in your region? Do the older folks want to become part of Russia, and the younger folks want to stay independent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hxvw?context=5)|Yes. Older population that lived ok in USSR and could never adapt aftewards are more often pro-russian.
 |But many younger Crimeans also want to Russia, I do know a few.
[I am surprised that there aren't more people talking about the Budapest ~~treaty~~ memorandum. Obama has declared the crisis in Ukraine a threat to national (US\) security but did not elaborate. John McCain is one of the few people I've seen who has discussed the ~~treaty~~ memorandum and that it must be upheld. I think the issue with Crimea might also be that the ~~treaty~~ memorandum considers it part of Ukrainian territory and it splitting off is in violation of the ~~treaty~~ memorandum. This is important because it deals with upholding non proliferation laws and affects much more than Ukraine. From this angle it seems like Putin really needed an excuse to invade Crimea so he's not just blatantly violating this international agreement. I saw that the Ukrainian parliament has asked the other countries for protection from Russia under the ~~treaty~~ memorandum but it was just a quick article and, again, I'm very surprised how little attention this aspect is getting.. at least here in the US. Do you have any thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieh2?context=5)|This is a great test of real values in the western world. From the viewpoint of fairness and civilized international society - it's quite clear that it is in fact a violation of Budapest treaty, UN charter, etc. and should be punished.
[Edit: as the comments below have pointed out, I was referring to the Budapest memorandum. Here's a release from a more official source regarding current state of US involvement: Link to m.state.gov ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ieh2?context=5)|But to really do something about it the west has to hurt it's own economic interests. EU gets a third of it's gas from Russia, London parks money of russian oligarchs etc.
[I have a simple yes-no question if you don't mind answering!  Do you believe the IMF will help Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5k4b9?context=5)|Yes! and not only financially, they are also trying to make sure the money doesn't get stolen/wasted with varying degrees of success.
[Do you think the referendum in Crimea was legitimate? Namely, do the Crimeans overall want to leave Ukraine for Russia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hzzq?context=5)|50-50.
[Thanks for doing this, by the way. As a Ukrainian, do you feel a sense of possessiveness about Crimea in general? Will its loss impact you greatly or is it more of a feeling that it's an acceptable loss? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5i262?context=5)|I think everyone should have a choice. This annexation would not be possible if there wasn't a lot of support for it by locals. I feel that we can not force Crimeans to love Ukraine. We need to focus on economy, quickly become much richer and Crimeans will want back. Many Crimeans have been fooled by propaganda and made the worst mistake ever.  I'm really fearfull that there will be some ethnic cleansing there now. 
[Can you elaborate more about your concerns of ethnic cleansing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ilv3?context=5)|First of all - the new Crimean leaders will have unlimited power there, they armed a lot of local sort of militia forces with ak - 74s and they can do what the fuck they want.
 |At the same time - there will be horrific buerocratic mess. All ukrainian property rights have pretty much zero value now. They are already doubting some tatars land ownership. They will be able to just take the property of everyone who opposes their rule etc. The mess will last for years. 
[Your command of English is very impressive. You obviously lived/studied in an English speaking country. Your position as a money manager for the kleptocrats makes you  very upper middle class .  How do you think average Ukrainian outside of Kiev feel about the rift between Eastern and Western Ukraine? What is your opinion  of resurrection of Bendera's memory and deeds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5jyid?context=5)|No I did not, I just read a lot. My spoken English is worse than written. Not many people care about Bandera, and those who do are often very nice and educated people, not some bloodthirsty fascists russian propaganda would like you to believe. 
[Thanks for doing this. As someone who lives outside of Ukraine and in the U.S. it is always very hard for us to understand what is actually going on over there. What we here and see may not be the truth/ the whole truth which can be very misleading.  My question is with the turmoil and all that is happening what do you think will happen next. I know I am asking you to speculate but being on the ground with activism and being heavily involved in the world markets as a portfolio manager I think you are in a relatively good position to make a small judgement on what you think the next step is on this whole situation and how it will proceed. I.E do you see this ending with bullets flying, or do you see this ending without bullets and simply cutting Russia off economically at the knees and starting a battle of starvation between Russia and Ukraine and Germany and the rest of Europe. Everyone is so economically tied together that shutting dow trade and pipelines would have nasty results. Im afraid it will be a battle of who will last longer starving its people and im hoping Putin isn't as crazy as I think he is. What is your take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5jg3z?context=5)|I see it ending without bullets. I see Ukraine loosing Crimea for at least 10 years. I think Russia will try to destabilize other regions and my educated guess that it will fail. Western sanctions will be relatively weak, but there will be no intervention to other regions. I see russian corrupt system growing further until it collapses under it's own weight in 5-10 years. After that some regions will separate from Russia.
 |Ukrainian society has definitely made a huge leap forward in development, the politicians have not yet caught up. If they don't screw up - with all the western help we have a decent chance of really transforming the country into the like of Poland. 
[How can the average citizen of the USA best help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hznd?context=5)|Not by much. Support your government actions in helping Ukraine (I'm not talking about fighting Russia, but economic sanctions against Russia and economic help to Ukraine are very useful).
[What is the most important thing for us to understand from the perspective of the people living in the middle of this turmoil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5hznd?context=5)|Also don't let russian propaganda spread. The role of far right radicals in the protests was negligible, we don't have more far right supporters than any other european country for example. 
[How concerned are Ukrainian citizens about the possibility of fighting to hold/take back Crimea?  Also, how much support is there for such action?  Also, thanks for that superb write-up! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5jr12?context=5)|People understand it's not realistic. They are critisizing the government a lot for not supporing Ukrainian army which is locked there more. They are critisizing secret services for allowing this. But no one is actually calling to go fight russians.  
[What do you say about the Russian claim that a democratically elected government was overthrown in an undemocratic way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5iblj?context=5)|I anwered that above, but anyway it's not up to mister Putin to decide what is legal or not in Ukraine. It's ridiculous to even talk about it as Russian troops are taking over some Ukrainian regions. 
[Do you think the economic state of Ukraine will improve with the new government? IF yes, by how much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kj6t?context=5)|1) Definitely not immediately. Long term if proper reforms are made - Ukrainian economy can be the fastest growing on the continent because of very low starting base.
[Also, do you think that it's possible that the same kleptocracy will come back, but with new faces and new slogans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kj6t?context=5)|2) It's possible and kleptocracy is trying to come back as we speak. However I have faith that the people who were ready to die for democratic values will never allow the same level of corruption to return. There's really zero tolerance to corruption among society but not among politicians.
[What are you going to do when the shooting and bombing starts?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ly55?context=5)|I don't have kids and I'm not scared. I'm defintely not willing to die for Crimea or Donetsk. But if they invade and reach Kiev - I'm not running.
[I'm Russian and want to move to Ukraine (and probably get citizenship\).  What are the steps for that?  Will Ukranian government provide opportunity to people to move to Ukraine (just like RF government did for ""Berkut""\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5k41o?context=5)|I don't think it's hard. And real estate is much cheaper. 
[Do you agree with Frankin Templeton's view, the american fund that bought about 1/3 of Ukrania's debt, in regards to the economy?  *Mark Mobius, emerging markets fund manager at Franklin Templeton, insisted **Ukraine was “in a very sweet spot” economically**, Reuters reported. **“They have the Europeans who want to help them and they have the Russians who want to help them.”***  Source.  Also do you think the whole ""revoltuion"" was for democray rather or to make a lot of money for certain parties: american private sector, EU via the credit line, Russia in regards to Crimeea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5klq0?context=5)|The're taliking their book, and they probably got a lot of grey hair too recently. But yeah, I agree except for the part of russians helping. 
[What about the accusations that Svoboda are Nazi's? This seems to be the biggest knock against the new government in Kiev.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kmrj?context=5)|Nationalists - yes. Nazis - no. A lot of public support - no.
[What is your position when it comes to the US intervening? Does that scare you?  Also, what did you guys do to make the corrupt Yanukóvich flee? How did you keep up? How did you do when you felt like there was no hope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5n2qw?context=5)|We're watching and feeling for Vebezuela too. Best luck to you guys. The episode of Yanukovitch fleeing is mysterious to a degree. Basically when all the shootings happened. There was sort of a deal, wich Putin refers to a lot that constitution should be changed, some laws etc. and have an election in december. That night some magic happened right on stage of Maidan [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBOfS-14jX0)
[Do you believe similar social upheavals will begin in other Eastern European nations, such as Belarus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5jz33?context=5)|I know a lot of belorussians. No it's not likely in near term. Unlike Ukraine there's a certain feeling of order there among the population. Corruption is contained only at the highest level (in Ukraine it's everywhere), so there's a general feeling among belorussians that life's kind of ok. 
[American here! First off it's really cool to see someone like you doing this, it provides a lot of perspective to Americans and other Westerners that I think we otherwise would not have. I was wondering, now that a new government is in power in Ukraine how will this effect relations and possible integration with the EU? Do you think that a new president might pursue integration? Also you mentioned earlier the three primary candidates, where do you think each one would sit on the issue, if elected? The process is a very long one, certainly, but do you favor integration and if so how do do you think it would effect your business? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5lq6d?context=5)|They would all be for integration I guess. And all much better for business than Yanukovitch.
[Hey there! I'm probably too late to the party, but here's my question: did you drink tea while being at Maidan?  I lvie in Kharkiv, and since the events i've heard quite a few stories about people coming home from there with symptoms of narcotic withdrawal.  Story #1: My mom's coworker has a daugther, who visited dance classes (namely hip-hop\). The teacher went to Maidan, and came back with a hefty sum of money. Then he just died. All out of a sudden. A young, healthy, sporty guy. Story #2: My mother-in-law told us about a granny in their town, who also was protesting at Maidan, but didn't feel quite well for a week after coming back home. The doctor said, and i quote: ""Oh, you better stop taking that ""medicine"", dear."" ""What medicine? I'm not taking any."" To which doctor just smiled knowingly.  The culprit here, as we heard, is that protesters were given tea with something narcotic mixed in. It may be just rumors, but that's why i'm asking: have you heard anything about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5vgwm?context=5)|Oh that is just rediculous propaganda. I drank a lot of tea, because it was often very cold. It's and easy explanation for people who don't understand the protest to just assume they're on drugs.
[If you gave up Crimea, will Russia leave you alone? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5k64v?context=5)|Don't think so. A prosperous Ukraine would undermine Putin's strength.
[Is your family""at war"" with each other in any way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kk8q?context=5)|No, my parents divorced 25 years ago and don't care about each other much.
[Being in wealth management myself, I'm curious what notable rollercoasters you've been on the past few months. Did anything surprise you about how certain markets performed compared to expectations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5k5y8?context=5)|Most of the business after 2008 has been in bonds and still is. It was serious roller coaster in last 6 months. We were headed to EU association and everything looked fine, suddenly no EU, protests, students being beaten - crash. Russian bailout - rally. More protests with deaths etc. - crash. Protestors won, western bailout expected - rally. Russian invasion - crash.
[If a person wasn't part of the favored Russian middle or upper class, why would they want to be part of Russia again? It seems that only people who would want that were the people that the government bestowed lots of power and prestige to, but maybe I'm not seeing the full picture.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5k7b0?context=5)|For people in the West it's hard to understand this mentality, but no, not only the privileged liked USSR. In a free capitalist economy you have a lot of freedoms, but also you have a lot of tough choices to make. In centrally planned one - the state makes a lot of choices for you. 
[Thank you for doing this AMA. It is very appreciated. Ok so I have an adopted cousin from the Ukraine who's been living in the states since 2003, she's 22 now, and she wants to go back to her orphanage to do an intern, and to see and help out her real family. Would there be any consequences of her going back during this controversial time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5k5el?context=5)|Ukraine right now is pretty safe except Crimea. So she can go I guess. Unless a larger war starts :)
[There's a reason immigration is a huge issue in western Europe. ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5l00q?context=5)|And this is something the developed world should think about more. By helping developing countries develop you get rid of your own immigration problems and generally improve the well-being of humanity.
[*Many people in the west take their democratic institutions for granted,*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5lhh5?context=5)|I'm not an expert in Australian politics, but do your leaders have multi billion fortunes and live in crazy mansions where only the 130 hectares of land is worth between 60 and 100 million dollars not counting anything on it?
[Far worse even.  Around 3,000 people died on 9/11 while around 7+ million died during the Holodomor.  I would like to know how modern Ukrainians (in Crimea or not\) can still support Russia and Russification in spite of this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5ojdg?context=5)|This topic has been pretty much banned in USSR with the official position being that the hunger was the same in other parts of USSR and that it was not artificial. Both are lies.
[It's funny how AMAs on Reddit are pretty much always from people whom Reddit indeed agrees with.  It was funny to read an AMA from a pro-Assad Syrian citizen, people didn't seem to like him that much.  Great point. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20pf21/iama_portfolio_manager_in_a_ukrainian_investment/cg5kdvd?context=5)|Reddit is like collective mind of the planet.

20pz4s,1,2014-03-18,How can I get my foot in the door with no internships or CS degree?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20pz4s/how_can_i_get_my_foot_in_the_door_with_no/,"Here's where I'm at:

Current Job: Internet Sales Manager @ Car Dealership. 
Income: About $70k/year
School: BA in Journalism
Goal: Transition into CS Position. I'm starting to lean heavily toward pursuing a career as a software engineer. It turns out I really enjoy programming.

Being that I already have a Bachelors, it seems the consensus is that it would be unproductive to pursue a second one. I'm currently taking classes at my local community college. It's inexpensive and I'm actually very impressed with the quality of the courses. I realize I could learn most of this for free, but structure, financial investment, and deadlines seem to help keep me motivated.

If I'm working full time and making a solid living, how can I transition into a CS field? Presumably I won't have any internships or a BA/BS in the field. Is it more realistic to first aim for a help-desk type of job and try to transition from there?"
20q3t4,1,2014-03-18,Series: Fear,TheSockGenius,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/20q3t4/series_fear/,"I was always fascinated with fear, the way it toys with our minds and influences our thoughts to morbid conclusions without reasonable evidence. I always tried to frighten myself with scary stories or movies, just to experience and study what fear did to the human psyche. As I grew older I recognized my interest in psychology as an opportunity to get paid for studying a wildly fascinating subject. Long story short I majored in Abnormal Psychology and got a job in a mental hospital in Chicago as an ""intern"", but pretty much did all the things that the lead psychiatrist would do. Three years later, I had the job of ""Assistant Psychiatrist"" and got paid plenty. I never had many friends, and the ones I did have when I was young split and went their separate ways. So there I was, living in a house far away from my parents on the outskirts of the city, with more land and more money than I knew what to do with. My life grew extremely monotonous and my constant routine sent me home  leaving a piece of my personality behind those thick glass doors. My childhood dreams had dissipated into a fleeting memory of my former self, clouded by the ""vast luxuries"" of adulthood, and then Mr. Hellman was admitted to the hospital. I was the first to see him, as the assistant has to bring in new patients for the  doctor to interview. When I first saw him, he had an uncomfortable air about him that made him seem... sinister. His eyes were colorless, his pupils were extremely dilated and the whites of his eyes were grayish and cloudy. He was very still, which isn't too uncommon, but his behavior and look made me feel very uneasy. He was with who I presumed to be his wife, her face looked distraught, she had the look of one who had lost a husband or a child, and as they walked towards me I could see this frightened and sad emotion on her face intensify. Mr. Hellman's gait was more of a shuffle than a stride, and he nervously clutched his the inside end of his wrist. As they made their way up the stairs, I watched with anticipation as the couple neared the front desk which I was standing beside. The facility was rather small, but it was well equipped and had plenty of patients. Large windows graced the walls around the front desk and reception, allowing the fleeting sunlight to silhouette the two in their entrance. I hated this time of day, the light was always blinding when you faced the windows. The man approached me, independent from his assumed spouse, who stood by the doors, waiting. My hand was resting on the counter, and he placed his hands on mine, still clutching his wrist. His palm was ice cold, his black eyes rested on mine in extreme focus, those eyes... I couldn't see any emotion behind them, no life residing in those pitch black pupils. I don't know how long I stared at him, until Nancy the receptionist greeted him. He kept his gaze on me and the only thing he said was ""hello friends! Do you wanna play?"" I recognized this feeling, it was fear. And I loved it.
**Update:** I welcomed him to the ward and directed him to the lead psychiatrist, Dr. Kyle. I sat him down in the seat, and asked his wife to take a seat as well. I then took my seat and waited for Dr. Kyle to speak. He opened his laptop to make a file for our new patient, then thanked me and pardoned me from the room. After the interview I accessed my laptop to read Mr. Hellman's file. Lou Hellman was his full name, according to his file, and the elderly woman with him was his wife, Lynette Hellman. He was 56 years old, and lived in Chicago all his life. I looked down at the Irregular Behavior area on the form and gasped. Unlike all the other loonies here, who were brought in because of Alzheimer's, or other common brain illnesses, this man (if I can even call him that) was brought in for what his wife called ""black magic"". Dr Kyle simply assumed they were both off their rockers and sent them both to be screened for - schizophrenia. I paused, confused, then found a note on the bottom corner of the file, the wife's testament to her spouse's insanity. The note read: ""It started with the incantations, he would mumble by the open window at night, and talk to the empty space in the room. I was confused and scared at first, until I figured out he was talking to spirits."" I thought some kind of artifact was required to summon spirits, like an Ouija board or a vessel, but the note read on ""he finally told me one day when I asked him who he's constantly talking to at night, and he said to me 'my friends are here to play.' This window mumbling and late night conversations with spirits had gone on for two months."" The note ended there. I smiled in excitement and thought to myself with my old child-mentality, 'this woman abandoned her husband out of fear, even thought he hadn't harmed her, interesting.' I closed the laptop and proceeded to my new patient's room. He didn't look at me when I came in, but instead stared out the window, by now the sun had almost set and it cast a mellow crimson orange across the evening sky. He had a malicious stare in his look, like a man who was about to start a bar fight. I almost skipped up to him, I was so interested to discover what was in the workings of this man's mind. ""Feeling okay, Lou?"" I spoke with a gentle tongue, like a parent trying to persuade a child. He turned to me and grinned, his eyes now burning with intensity that would engulf all life with its black flames, the more I looked into his eyes the more they grew, I escaped his glare and glanced down at my touch pad computer.

20qk1i,8,2014-03-18,A student injured me (intern) while I tried to discipline him. Any tips on returning to the classroom normally?,ollenollebolle,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/20qk1i/a_student_injured_me_intern_while_i_tried_to/,"I'm an intern teaching four year olds. Yesterday, one of them (student X) hit me when I told him not to jump off a chair. I tried to discipline him, getting down to his level and explaining in a firm voice that he is not allowed to hit a teacher. Student X got away from me, which resulted in a chase through the classroom. I caught up with him, put him in a chair and once again told him it was not acceptable to hit a teacher. I asked him to stay seated. 
Student X did not remain seated, so I went after him and tried to get him back to the chair I put him on as punishment. The student got violent, tried to bite me and scratched my hands until I started bleeding. At this point I let go and another teacher took care of him. 

I have learned from other teachers that this was not personal, but that the child can get violent. The parents and the school board have been informed about this incident, so that's all taken care of. 

I was terribly shocked by this incident, but I will be returning to school tomorrow as a part of my internship. 

I was advised to leave this incident at home, and I will do my best to do so. Nonetheless, I'm not quite sure how this will effect me in the classroom tomorrow. Any tips or advice on how to deal with this? Especially on how to interact with the student in question.

20qrms,190,2014-03-18,Humanity's Children.,Zorkamork,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/20qrms/humanitys_children/,"I was so excited to start my work. I was so honored to be part of this. I've been studying all my life for this, ever since I was little I loved animals.

I went to a great school on a biology degree path, I even went to grad school. I studied the great apes for my thesis, I went full on Goodall for a while, living out of a tent, studying a group of gorillas.  It was great while it lasted, I honestly was sad to leave them when I did, it was like we kinda became family, you know?

I got some solid work after that, nothing quite as fulfilling to me as my past work but it was good. I spent a lot of time in the field, but just for short times broken up with long periods in some sterile, dull, lab. Eventually I started taking near any job the bosses offered that would get me out, I couldn't stand to be locked away all day.

Doctor Yu approached me after that, I guess she noticed that a young guy was pretty eager to do anything but stay in a lab, and figured I'd be up for spending a few years working on an experiment with a big chance of failing.

She was brilliant don't get me wrong, but we never really talked much. She seemed pretty intense, and that's a lot coming from me, always with her nose in a book or computer, writing things down like a machine would. When she offered me a place in her team I thought she was just trying to fill a spot out, you know?

Still, it sounded interesting. We were going to expand on previous work done teaching sign language and such to apes. We were going to teach a gorilla to talk. Well, not TALK talk, but we were trying to bridge the gap from sign language over to more 'proper' speech.  She had already done the prep work, a box was implanted in a male gorilla's throat, hooked to the brain and vocal cords. He had already been taught sign language and showed promise in reading and other areas. Basically he was as close to understanding human language as we could get, so he was who we were riding all our hopes on.

His name was Wukong, a more respectful name than most get I grant but still didn't seem quite right, I'm pretty sure that dude in the myths was a monkey, not an ape. He was in a cage, recovering from the surgery, kinda wobbly walking, but seemed mostly alright to me. When we approached Doctor Yu took out a treat from her pocket, a granola bar with fruits and nuts in it, apparently Wukong's favorite. She knocked it on the bars a bit to get his attention and he came eagerly bounding over. She held it out, but when he reached for it she pulled it back, wanting him to know he could have it, but not quite yet. Without missing a beat she asked ""What do we say?"" Just like that, like she was talking to a little kid who forgot his manners.

Wukong looked frustrated for a bit, obviously thinking he was being teased, before she repeated the gesture again, with the same question. He paused then, looking between her and me before raising his hands like he was about to sign. To be honest that alone surprised me, I never saw a gorilla respond that fast to a communication command. If we ended the tour right there I'd already think Yu was a genius, but she just shook her head.

""No no, not like that. Use big boy words"" again she talked to this thing that could throw her across the room like a child, and he just paused, like he was really being scolded by his mother.

""Wukong has been raised in the lab"" she explained ""We rescued him from poachers as just a baby, he's spent his whole life being trained in communication, he knows what we want.""

He lowered his hands, slowly ambled back over right to the bars before opening his mouth, face contorting not quite in pain but in discomfort. Then it happened, a robotic, child like, voice came out of that massive mouth. ""Please, treat. Wukong want treat. Wukong good.""

I could have been knocked over if the AC was running, the ape talked. Sure not with his own voice, he had a microphone in his throat, but still it was his brain controlling it, his brain sending impulses, Yu's technology taking those impulses and translating them into human speech. It was like hearing that famous ""Watson come in here, I need you"" test that Bell did! Yu didn't even seem that phased, simply smiling proudly and handing the treat over, free hand rubbing the gorilla's head. ""Yes you are,"" she cooed, ""Mama's good boy.""

Things went by in a whirlwind after that. We kept everything under wraps, wanting to be absolutely sure the results were right. We spent night after night with Wukong, getting him to say everything from simple baby talk to reciting the constitution. He never really got complex grammar, but hey he was a gorilla who could speak, he already won the gold.

We were about to go public, a big press conference with Wukong right next to us, we even trained him to be able to answer some questions, that'd really impress them.

It was the night before, Yu and I were in the lab with just a few interns, wrapping our projects up, preparing our speeches, it was gonna be a big damn day for all of us. Us nerds don't get to be rock stars often, so we really savor the few times we can swagger around a stage saying ""Look at what we did, plebeians, you can't even imagine this crap can you?""

Yu went down to check on Wukong, I let her go alone.

Fuck I should have gone with her.

We didn't notice she was still gone until an hour or so later, we figured she was just enjoying the last quiet moment she'd have with him. I went down to check on them, tell Yu to get some sleep. I grabbed a granola treat for Wukong from the bucket and entered his enclosure. We gave him a nice place to stay, not zoo big, but big enough for one gorilla, trees, grass, all that jazz, it wasn't home but it was a nice place.

I didn't notice Yu right away, I just saw Wukong, hunched over, his microphone making a low whine.

""Hurt,"" god that voice, that childlike monotone voice.

""Mama hurt Wukong...""

I got closer, I asked what was wrong, we had some issues with Wukong thinking us putting him in his cage or giving him a shot or something was 'hurting' him. I figured that was what this was.

""Mama hurt Wukong...Wukong head hurt...""

I kinda paused there, the room was way too quiet, just me and the gorilla, both breathing heavier than we should be.

""Wukong, where's mama?"" I asked, he didn't answer, just kept repeating.

""Wukong head hurt, mama hurt...""

I looked where he was looking, there she was. Yu was a beautiful woman, a bit older than me but not much, I always thought her long black hair was her best feature, it was always kept in a bun or something else to keep it up, but a few times, after work when we were chatting, she let it down, and it looked like a silk tapestry connected to her head.

Now it was covered in blood, stuck together in clumps, chunks torn out. She was laying against a rock, her head was bashed open, blood and brain splattering the rock behind her. She had a shocked look on her face, she had no idea what was coming. Her glassy eyes were huge, like she didn't know why this happened.

Wukong turned to face me, then I saw it. His right eye was bright red, blood vessels had broken. His nose was bleeding too, these were all warning signs we had been told to watch for. The things in his brain were supposed to be secure but we just had no way of knowing.

""Wukong hurt, papa"" he continued, ambling closer to me, eyes locked on me. God that stung, since Yu and I started working together with him I became the 'papa' to her 'mama' I guess.

""Wukong hurt, doctors make hurt"" he said, that voice never changed, but god I knew he was in agony. I couldn't move, I knew running would make it worse.

It wasn't fair. He had no idea what was going on. One day he fell asleep and woke up with a sore throat, then we kept talking to him, making him follow every order, throwing...shitty lumps of oats and fruit at him every time he did. Now he was in pain, with a wound he couldn't see. I felt so bad for him, but there was nothing to do.

""Wukong hurt, here"" he said. With that his hand came crashing down on my head. I crumpled like a sack of potatoes. That must have been how Yu died, she fell onto the rocks. Maybe Wukong didn't even mean it, maybe he was legitimately just trying to show his 'mama' where it hurt.

I don't remember what happened next, an intern found me and thank god she was smarter than me, she brought a tranq gun. I woke up in the hospital a couple days later. The doctors told me I was lucky, I had a crack in the head but nothing major beyond that, I was able to get back to work in a few days, though I now have the occasional migraine.

Wukong had been put down, they said the intern said it looked like he bashed Yu's head against the rock, they figured for a violent animal it was easier to 'put him out of his misery' that way instead of fixing what they broke. I don't know who's right, but that never sat well. We broke this animal, we turned him into an oddity for our own fame, and then we threw him away.

I still see them when I sleep, that bloody eye, that pained look, Yu's shocked face. I should have gotten worse than a headache, I deserve worse. I was an absentee father, I never thought of what could happen to Wukong until it was too late. Everyone looks at me like a victim, they ask me if I'm ok, if I need time off, they tell me Yu's death was a tragedy, but no one says anything about Wukong, I don't think anyone even remembers his name.

I was so excited to start this, this was my dream. Now all I can dream of is that pain, that suffering I was proudly party to. We like to think we're oh so advanced, but how great can we be if this is how we treat our children?"
20qta8,5,2014-03-18,Questions about the quality of the internship I've been offered at an IB,internshipquestions,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/20qta8/questions_about_the_quality_of_the_internship_ive/,"Hey all,

so i'm a graduating senior at a non-target school, and i was offered an internship at a top 20 IB. The position i originally applied for was a summer analyst, but i'm being offered a position at the marketing desk in their cross-asset solutions group.

I'm confused because the position i applied for sounded great, i'd have the opportunity to do trading for the IB, and even do some financial engineering. 

Here is the description of the position i'm being offered:

&gt;You will join the Marketing desk on a trading floor designing and selling structured products linked to any asset class, including equities, indices, commodities, interest rates, credit, currencies, hedge funds and hidden assets.  The position serves the American market (the US, LATAM and Canada), targeting retail as well as institutional clients.

&gt;This position is at the crossroads of different internal desks in the Cross-Asset Solutions Group: Sales, Financial Engineering, Legal, Research.
 
&gt;Typical tasks and day-to-day responsibilities will include:

&gt;Producing detailed commercial presentations, Term Sheets for distribution to clients and / or potential investors;

&gt;Developing/creating brochures, newsletters, marketing campaigns, in order to keep the clients informed of our capabilities, services, and latest product innovations and ideas;

 &gt;Backtesting products / excel computation (historical simulations of investment scenarios and product performance as well as analysis of returns - using macros (VBA or not) or requiring the development of macros);

&gt;Liaising with Legal department to develop and maintain US / Canada / LATAM compliant marketing and sales documents;

 &gt;Producing analytical reports;

 &gt;Strategic watching and competitive analysis on Structured Products markets in the Americas (data analysis &amp; statistics, competitors’ new releases and evolution, new development analysis – payoffs, underlyings…

&gt;Assisting with the organization of conference and related events for client and salesperson networking and education, including liaising with Conference Organizers and delegates.


now this doesnt sound all that bad to me, i'm definitely interested in designing products, and doing the backtesting, creating reports, and especially the data analysis part.

My only concern is that this position wont lead to many more opportunities afterwards.

I'm a senior so i need to have a job after this (unless i opt to do an MS in finance). 

I guess my questions are: what kind of jobs would i be able to go into after this? I'm definitely interested in doing research for banks or financial firms. I'd also be interested in doing trading. I'm just hoping this sort of job will open doors in data analysis/modeling? I'm guessing this experience plus getting the MS in Finance would be the best option? 

I just don't want to be a glorified office jockey doing basic marketing tasks (making brochures) unless it means theres opportunity to move to more advanced positions. 

Any input is greatly appreciated, i'm getting sort of concerned here.

Kids with lisps, the elderly who cannot swallow or had a stroke resulting in paralysis, all kinds of things). I was going through a lot of depression and anxiety my last semester (worsened by a break up that really fucked me up) and I was doubting how much I wanted to get my Masters and make this my career. I have a 3.75 GPA, and was involved in a few clubs, mainly the photography club, because that is what I really love to do. So instead of taking my GRE and applying to grad schools, I took a year to take some more photography classes while working two part-time jobs as a newborn photographer working on commission and at the university library. The next year I got a job at a daycare and began a 4 month Medical Billing and Coding course. I want to get my certification, but have heard a lot of people have trouble getting jobs in this job without experience, and that many of those jobs are also going overseas. 

Soooo basically: 
-I did well in school &amp; graduated Magna Cum Lauda. 
-I'm six classes away from a Psych degree, but I don't know if that would be anymore useful than the one I already have.
-I'd like to do medical billing and coding but I don't know if I can get a job without experience. 
-I love photography more than anything but don't know if I can do this realistically--I am not business savvy in the least and everytime I want to make marketing materials I feel braggy and annoying.
-I'm starting to think about saving money and going to grad school for Communication Disorders, but I don't know if I'd have a good chance getting in considering I took 2 years off doing things that have nothing to do with the field. I am so broke right now so I can't really afford to volunteer anymore.  

For the short term, I'm thinking of trying to get an office job to save money and sustain myself for a little while and then enter a program I can complete quickly that offers internships and job assistance that will allow me to have a secure career. 

Sorry if this is long and convoluted, but I'd really, really appreciate any advice!

20r8cy,2,2014-03-18,"I'm 22, dropped out of college, making six figures, and hating everything about my life. What happens now?",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/20r8cy/im_22_dropped_out_of_college_making_six_figures/,"I'm really hoping you guys can give me some idea of what's wrong with me. Here's a rundown of my situation:

I was a pretty bright kid in high school, never did AP classes but had mostly straight A's and scored high on standardized tests. After graduating, I went to a private university for software engineering for 2 years and hated it miserably. My university failed me at allowing me to switch to a major I was more interested in, so I hopelessly stuck with it. 

After 2 years of barely making it to class every day, I ended up landing a paid internship (~$40k salary) that I somewhat enjoyed doing web development as part of my school's co-op program. The plan was to go back to school, but they liked my work so much that they offered me a full time position (at ~$60k salary) and I decided to take it since I was dreading returning to campus so much.

About a year passes, and I (unsurprisingly) begin to hate my job. Management was clueless and I had no interest in my work, as well as the town I was located in began to feel pretty boring and dried up. Just as I'm starting to think about returning to school, I got **really** lucky and landed a position at an up and coming television channel in a very affluent city with ~$100k salary, benefits, 401k, and everything else you would want from your employer.

Guess what? I hate it. I hate every minute of this job, even though I'm doing more of what I thought I'd like doing (front end design work rather than backend database work).

Part of me thinks that I may suffer from depression. Another part of me thinks that I'm getting burnt out too young and I'm going to start losing my hair by the time I'm 24. And another part of me thinks I'm being an ungrateful Pusswhip-McGangBang. I really feel lost in the world right now.

I have a several other interests, I play music, draw, write, love to travel, architecture, etc., but I'm terrified that I'll go back to school and repeat the entire process all over again, but this time end up being 32, ready to quit my next career and hating my life and my job. 

Anyone? :/"

I'm wondering if people who have interned at Google or Facebook for sofware or Microsoft for PM (or, if possible, more than one) can shed light on which internship they preferred and which internship they learned the most from? I received summer internship offers for these three companies and am wondering which one to choose. Here are details and pros and cons that I've come up with for each company:


Microsoft

Pros:

- It's a PM role. I haven't done a PM role in the past and it seems like the type of role I'd want to do long term.

Cons:

- It's in Redmond, which is far far far from from my family, friends, and bf. It shouldn't be a big thing but it is (otherwise I would take it).

- The team sounded kinda boring.


Google

Pros:

- The name, mostly. 

- It's in NYC!

Cons:

- I've done software dev internships already. 

- I heard google projects are kinda boring and you don't get to do much.



Facebook

Pros:

- I've heard from a friend who interned at both Facebook and Google that Facebook was better because it 
had more of a startup culture.

- Potentially interesting project in graph search.

- It's in NYC as well!

- Gives out return offers and good signing bonuses for interns if I get it!

Cons:

- The software dev issue.

- I guess if I were to do software dev, Google would be a better name?

Help! I know it should be an issue but distance is kind of a big thing, and I figure that whatever jobs I can get having done Microsoft PM internship, I can get with google or facebook as well?"

Additionally I will be doing research in parallel programming with a professor next fall, so I am about to begin reading a book in that realm.

Does anyone have any good ideas for a project that that will help me learn to write large programs? Or am I better off learning a new language or framework (and if so which one)? The vast amount of options is just kind of intimidating at this point."

I wasn't arrested, put in cuffs, or given a written citation, but am afraid that this might show up on a background check when I am applying for internships this summer (I'm a college student).  I called the hotel today and they said that the warning will be filed with the PCB sherif's department but the lady almost ensured that it's not something that would show up on a background check.  Is this something that will show up on background checks or my criminal record?

20s869,44,2014-03-19,Desperate times...,wannabesq,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/20s869/desperate_times/,"Here's a story of a time when I was out of work.  My previous employer, which was an MSP had to downsize me, which is another story.  I was out of work for a while, had a temp job that was decent, but after that was done, I was running out of time on my unemployment, so I started lowering the bar...

I had a successful phone interview with a local mom and pop computer shop, and even though the pay was half what I was used to, and the work was a bit below what I could handle, I went in anyway.  Remember, I was desperate, I literally had one half of one week worth of unemployment before I was cut off, no more extensions.  I come to find out that the ""Mom and Pop"" owners don't even live in the state, and they have another shop two states over that they run themselves, and they have two employees that run day to day at the remote shop.  

I start my first day, where I will be working with their only tech $lazytech, who is lowering his hours to have more time for school, and that's where my hours would be coming from.  When I walked in, I was immediately saddened by the place, it was old looking, there was some ""inventory"" of software and old computers, that were worth more as doorstoppers than anything else, some vendor signs for long replaced lines of product.  I knew I wouldn't like it there, nor would I want to stay very long, this was just a stop gap until I could get back into the swing of things at another MSP or IT dept.  After the usual ""guided tour"" They sit me down where I have a final skype video chat with the owners telling me their processes.  The usual BS, but the part that got me, was that they claim to offer ""free diagnosis"" but they told me to inflate the hours worked on the invoice to reflect the time spent diagnosing...  I guess it's only free if you decline the work.  

After the paperwork, I finally sit down to start working.  This is a run of the mill virus removal.  It's not even that seriously infected, just your average fake antimalware infection with a browser hijacker.  I proceed to run some scans and manually removing some registry entries (I love autoruns for doing this btw) and the conversation between me and $lazytech goes like this

&gt;*Me:          ""Where to you keep your removal tools?  Or can I use the ones I have on my USB drive?""*


&gt;$lazytech: ""That's not how we do things here"" 


&gt;Me:     *dafuq?*


&gt;$lazytech: ""We just wipe and reformat/reinstall than remove the virus, because traces of the virus remain and it's just easier to reinstall""  


&gt;*Me:           ""But this virus is simple to remove.  On top of that, they have office installed, it would take longer to reinstall windows, run patches, install office, patch office, and restore backup.""*


&gt;$lazytech: ""This is the way we do it here, just backup the My docs folder, and the drivers and reinstall.  As for Office, the customer can install that themselves when they get it home.""


&gt;*Me:           ""Ok, but if it were my PC, I would be pissed if my drive was wiped without my consent, and that this is a simple infection to remove, what if the customer doesn't have the key to MS Office?*


&gt;$lazytech: ""If they can't manage their own software, maybe they shouldn't be using computers""


My words fell on deaf ears, and I had to do it ""their way"" which involved very specific backup of specific folders in user profile, documents, favorites, etc, exporting the drivers and backing that up as well.  I was used to imaging a whole drive, to make damned sure I didn't miss anything, in addition to a file backup of the obviously important stuff.  I mean, 1TB USB drives are cheap right?  Taking an image saved my bacon once when a user had a program that liked to store its data files in c:\program files\$application.  I was so glad I had a whole backup that time.  After I made the backups, the shop owner asked to skype him again where he drilled me on which folders I had backed up, as if he had hired an IT Intern that had never done this before.  I get that he's trying to cover his own ass, but why not at least attempt a virus removal, or even clone the drive before DBANing the thing...  Anyway, I wipe the partition table, get windows reinstalled and start downloading thousands of megs of updates,.  I then ask the tech for an MS office install CD, but of course they don't have one, and won't let me download one.  I'm told to just to put a note on the ticket that the customer will need to do it himself....  I am so shocked at this point that I know I'm gonna have to get out quick.  I begin formulating my exit strategy, maybe I can work there for a week or two to get a check, whilst keeping an eye out for a real job.  Luckily for me, I ended up leaving sooner than that.  The entire staff (even the remote mom and pop) are heavy smokers, and since they all smoke, they do so INSIDE the store...  That was it, I was done.  I left at the end of the shift (only 4 hours) head home, tell my wife all about it, she gives her blessing for me to quit, and I let the owners know I won't be coming back.  

As luck would have it, the VERY next day I land an interview for the job I have now (going on 3 years), twice the hours, twice the pay, and competent people that know how to do things right.  I still feel bad for that poor customer.  I never did hear what happened, but I'm sure he wasn't happy.  "

I really don't understand what is happening here.,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/20sclo/6_month_checkin_still_no_callbacks_i_really_dont/,"After 6 months of job hunting I am just at a loss for what I can do.  I have two degrees from some of the best colleges in the US, including a BSEE.  I do have some employment gaps/travel abroad which may be hurting me, but this job search is just utterly destroying me.  I don't understand why nobody, not a single employer, has called me in for an interview after hundreds of applications.  

I've been going for all types of jobs: entry level test engineer, entry level analyst (various kinds), product mangers, technical specialists... everything that I think I could be qualified for.  I've even applied for technician type jobs that only require AAs.  

[My resume is here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwikM7KKXnHtTndGT0ZveDdxT2M/edit?usp=sharing).  I've applied to some analyst/product manager type positions with this resume.  I also mix in the other jobs into the main category if they seem relevant to the role I am applying to.  

Aside from applying online, I have also fully updated my Linkedin profile and use it to view companies and recruiters on a regular basis.  I've connected with several recruiters by cold contacting them (usually alumni from my university), telling them I'd like to ""keep in touch about future opportunities.""  Usually I am either ignored or allowed to connect, but with no further communication.  I usually only get around 1-5 page views per week.  Sometimes they are anonymous recruiters, but nobody has ever actually contacted me about any opportunities.

I've even had my friend pass my resume on to the VP of his company.  He was told that HR would contact me, but that was two weeks ago and I still haven't heard from them.  If I can't even land an interview through an internal referral like this, I just don't know what else I can do.  

I never had a problem landing internships or jobs at anytime else in my career, but now that I have this master's degree, it is like the black death for my job search.  I really feel like I need a change in my strategy even though I feel like I've tried it all already.  What more can I do?  At this point I will take basically any job I can get.  I'm afraid I'm just not the 'average' candidate and for that I get constantly overlooked.

Any ideas?

20sfth,2,2014-03-19,How important is an internship? Am I screwed?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20sfth/how_important_is_an_internship_am_i_screwed/,"Hi guys,

I'm currently a Junior CS student, and wanted to know if internships are really as important as people make them out to be. 

I recently applied to several internships for this summer and got rejected from all of them (I did end up getting a coding challenge for one, and an interview for another, getting rejected from both after). This didn't surprise me, because all of the requirements seemed ridiculous for an undergraduate student to have.

Right now it seems too late to even try to apply to more, and now I won't have any internship during my undergrad. Is this going to hurt me in the long run? Should I drag out my education an extra semester so I can apply next summer, and attempt to land one? Is it worth it, or should I just graduate and hope to find an entry level job with no experience?"
20skhf,6,2014-03-19,Is it possible to get into the Big 4 after a couple of years of experience? Does it get exponentially difficult?,nottoosure87,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20skhf/is_it_possible_to_get_into_the_big_4_after_a/,"I will be graduating with my masters this May, and I have a full time lined up at a top 10 company.I also had a couple of internships one at another top 10 internet company, and the other with a semiconductors major(they also extended a full time, but I  most probably will go with the other offer). In addition I also have a couple of years of startup experience. However, I've wanted to get into the big 4 and seem to have a hard time converting their calls, mostly because I choked up (nervousness ) during their interviews. I've not lost hope and have been preparing for them. But, are these repeated setbacks going to affect my chances of getting calls in the future? Plus, does it get harder to get these calls with experience ? I notice they seem to be recruiting a lot of recent college grads .

EDIT:When I say ""Big 4"", I dont really mean just Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple. I intended it to be rather loosely covering top companies Y!, LinkedIn etc. Sorry for the confusion!

This fall I will be a CS freshman. I have some background in programming, but no projects just algorithm experience (C++) and recently I began to learn OOP in Java. I was wondering what should I do my freshman year and before in order to 1) secure an internship and 2) make some extra money during the year. What do companies look for? I bet that some basic programming skills are no use to any (big) company and that if I want to make some extra buck during school I should do some projects from scratch to finish.

[Hi, I am a student in a coding bootcamp in the SF bay area.  What kind of development technologies did you use to build this?  Java? Javascript? Ruby on Rails? Python? C++? etc..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o5zr?context=5)|It's an Android app, so most of it is written in Java. The core algorithms that power our disambiguation need to be fast and portable to other platforms, so we wrote them in straight C99. -- Xavier.
[What have you implemented which you were initially really against?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o7u4?context=5)|Our original beta testers (who supported us on Indiegogo) got to experience the first ever version of the keyboard with no full-sized keyboard mode. We resisted the concept of having a full-sized keyboard because we were worried it would detract from the concept of the smaller keyboard.
[How does the language model algorithm differ for US English and the yet to implemented UK English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o7u4?context=5)|Since announcing Minuum 2.0 last week, we've heard even more requests from people who actually want to use Minuum for its full keyboard mode, because they only occasionally need to switch to the smaller version. While this initially seemed quite strange to us, we ended up building in a bunch of new full-keyboard-specific customizable settings for the 2.1 release this morning.
 |We've come around to accepting people's desire for a full keyboard once in a while; I feel that giving people access to the full keyboard through a quick gesture shortcut might actually help to reinforce the direct visual+functional connection between the full/compact modes. That's why the little keyboard works, after all - because it's so similar to the big one!
 |The algorithm doesn't change there; it's all about getting the right dataset to build the language models from. We've built our current English language model as a hybrid between the two (US and UK) until we obtain enough UK-specific data to build a separate module.
 |We've been thinking of our bottom panel as a means of providing additional benefit to people who don't care enough about their screen space, and would rather us provide additional functionality instead. We're actually curious about the literary implications of having Emoji characters always present; i.e. how does the structure of the input method inform how people choose to communicate?
 |What do you find so horrid about the panel, and what would you prefer? An emoji mode that can be selected analogous to the switch to numbers mode?
 |Will.
[To whit, have you considered a feature which aggregated screen take and the corrected word to get some gainful form of average data about the word they were intending to type? Of might then also build up a database of contextually frequent words and refine the guess algorithm.  If you detect a used preferring the Canadian/UK spellings, could you weight the autocorrect to the S variants until the proper dictionary?  I must congratulate the team for simple but powerful gestures like the double press for switching between one-line and full keyboards. The odd occasion I'm using another keyboard or device, it frustrates me when it doesn't do anything.  Also, the mistype detection (and on the fly correction for full mode\) are great. I just wish there was an expandable smiley panel which you could add your own to!  Could a full character map style panel be added from the Shift button menu or something?  Finally, a more general AMA question - have you had any expressions of interest from OEMs or other companies about acquisition or exclusive licensing of the IP yet? ;-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6r48u?context=5)|Re: US vs. Canadian/UK spellings, a process of detection + weighting as you describe would certainly help to refine your language model much more rapidly, but we first need to get enough data about the differences between the dialects so that we can perform that detection properly.  We've considered letting the smiley panel serve as something closer to a ""character map"" style panel, with customizable symbols; but the hard part is figuring out how to limit what set of symbols you get so that it doesn't take too long to find what you're looking for.
[Don't know if you remember me but I was in /r/android suggesting things for the keyboard. You guys are freaking awesome.  The autocorrect turns off when the  keyboard goes down. Any way for that to stay on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6z2f7?context=5)|This should have been fixed in the version 2.1 update today - what version are you using? -Will.
[Just downloaded the app again (had purchased a while back\) so the 2.1 update. This is the full keyboard btw...and when i mean down, i mean goes away. Not the small keyboard. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6zas2?context=5)|Good catch! That was a last minute bug introduced yesterday, we'll put out a fix shortly. -Will.
[Hey, happy birthday! I'm curious, have you any plans on implementing minuum on the Moto 360? I don't even know if it's worth it but it would be interesting to type qwerty on a circle display. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o1i3?context=5)|Definitely! We're signed up already :)
 |The best thing about being a one-line keyboard is that you can curve more nicely than a full keyboard can. Alternatively, because we're so thin, we could nicely fit along the center of the circle display and have room for content both above and below the keyboard.
 |One of our ideas for a rounded watch display, depending on the hardware, would be to actually rotate the bezel from left to right to choose letters (so no touchscreen required). Kind of like the interface on the Nest... which we'd also love to type on.
 |Will.
[Like this? Link to mattlisac.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6p99f?context=5)|Precisely :)
 |[Edit: well, except for the whole knob-in-the-middle part]
 |Will.
[Can you describe your method of marketing while your Indiegogo campaign was live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6nu62?context=5)|In the end, it was quite simple: we emailed a couple of tech journalists, and [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/minuum-turns-to-indiegogo-to-fund-a-new-mobile-software-keyboard-for-smartphones-and-beyond/) wrote an article about us within 3 hours of launching - from there, the internet exploded with media coverage, and the single biggest contributor to our million YouTube views was someone's [Reddit post of our video](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1akas9/), which hit the front page.
 |My opinion is generally that our success was entirely dependent upon the shareability of that [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niV2KCkKmRw).
 |It's actually quite funny how we had a detailed plan for the whole month of the crowdfunding campaign, which we never ended up following - we heard that it was important to hit 20% of your funding goal within the first two days, so we had carefully prepared emails ready to send to everyone we knew. We also had a long list of events that we planned to attend to promote Minuum in. In the end, we never had a chance to do any of this because we were inundated with media inquiries for the next few weeks.
 |Will.
[I've been using your keyboard since being accepted into the beta. There was a rough patch where the keyboard would crash fairly often on my phone, so I had to use a different keyboard for a while. You guys fixed that issue though and I'm back to using Minuum full time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6opzs?context=5)|Another thing that we struggle with is different applications' implementations of the API that connects them with keyboards. If people just use the standard Android text fields they're fine, but a number of applications customize things and then don't implement the APIs correctly. We have our own workarounds for a number of popular applications that all fail in subtle ways. For instance, one application has strange behaviour if we ever empty its text-field, so we have to make sure to always temporarily introduce extra characters before correcting the text. -- Xavier.
[What are you going to do with your millions once a large tech company buys you out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o6fl?context=5)|[Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/puQBp)
[Which are your future projects? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6nvle?context=5)|Aside from our Android app, we're planning to focus a lot on [smart watches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA6ey1SzHdM), and are talking to a bunch of manufacturers about getting Minuum in on their devices.
 |Smart TVs / game consoles are also in [dire need](http://minuum.com/who-forgot-the-smart-tv/) of better typing solutions, and I especially like that any motion-sensing device could be used to fix that typing experience (e.g. a [wiimote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQoXajSCi4), [Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/), [Ring](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1761670738/ring-shortcut-everything), your phone, etc.).
 |I'm mostly passionate about the smart watch case because we really feel like we're unlocking so much more functionality in the device by letting you type there.
 |Will.
[Congratulations guys, do you have in mind adding a short way to add new words to personal dictionary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o2mo?context=5)|Hey tabrizz,
 |Right now if you precisely enter a new word, either by long-pressing to access the precise selection popups, or by switching to the 2d keyboard (long-press with 2 fingers), that word is learned, and will be in your personal dictionary. -- Xavier.
[Happy birthday!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|We have not yet talked to Valve, but if you have a connection there let us know.
[I don't know if you're still here but I have a couple questions that cover two areas: Minuum itself and entrepreneurship.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|Split Minuum for tablets has been put on the back-burner because so many more people use phones, but that's definitely intended to be a core part of Minuum's design there.
[Have you talked to valve to bring Minuum to the steam machines? The steam controller seems to be specifically made for a circular Minuum keyboard (eg 1 pad for the letters and the other pad for cursor control/other functions\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|Most of the machine learning that Minuum does occurs outside of the phone, when we're building language models that encapsulate the structure of an entire language (really, the work that we do is closer to natural language processing). If you want to learn more about machine learning, you might want to start with this online course: [Link to www.coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
[When can we have a split keyboard (probably even 2 arcs\) for tablets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|There is no perfect approach to Play Store pricing - our price is mostly determined by the standard rates that other keyboards charge - we've considered choosing radically different prices, but in the end $3.99 for a keyboard seems like a good in-between kind of price for something that will be so thoroughly used if you choose to adopt it as your primary method of input.
[How much machine learning is build into Minuum? Where can I learn about machine learning (books/online courses/..\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|Will.
[How did you figure out what the optimal price on the play store?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6u9es?context=5)|For the ML and stats that power Minuum specifically: we wrote [a blog post](http://minuum.com/model-your-users-algorithms-behind-the-minuum-keyboard/) outlining some of the details. -- Xavier.
[I watched your video form androidpolice and I was curious as to why all ""viral"" videos have the same up-beat music and editting style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o021?context=5)|We made that video entirely ourselves (I've done a bit of video work in the past), and I actually spent about four months starting-and-stopping on making the video, because we kept writing scripts and I kept not liking them. Finally, this one emerged and just felt right - the tone clearly is a bit over-the-top, but it made the video more fun. We actually ""borrowed"" a bunch of high-end cameras from a computer vision research lab at the University of Toronto (which Xavier was part of at the time), and captured all of the footage around campus - the total budget for the video was under $100 (mostly spent on buying the vintage typewriter).
[Is there a company you go to that specializes in these kinds of videos, or is it a multitude of companies that emulate the style because it works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o021?context=5)|Setting up the video to be slightly made fun of actually turned out to be one of the major contributors to its success, at least on Reddit. The most rewarding part was having all of the complaints be about the video's tone, and not about the technical content :)
[How long does a video like that take to create, and how expensive is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o021?context=5)|Will.
[I really loved Minuum when I tried it, the only problem is, and that is why I don't leave SwiftKey is the simultaneous multiple languages. Is there a plan to support this feature on future releases? Like using the dictionary for 2 or more languages at the same time, not having to switch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ptwq?context=5)|That's a difficult problem, but one that we hope we can address (some of us write in multiple languages, too). It will also be a bit more difficult for Minuum because it's already expecting such imprecise typing... So no promises, but we're as eager for this functionality as you are! -Will.
[I understand the difficulties. Perhaps it's easier to not support two languages at the same time, but allow for faster switching than it is now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6uhna?context=5)|Have you tried our Turbo mode? (It's experimental, and only works on some devices) Go to Settings-&gt;Experimental and advanced-&gt;Turbo Mode to enable faster language switching. -Will.
[Is there a particular reason why it takes so long to give support for other languages? I really like the idea but i really need to have it in Dutch before i can use it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pazl?context=5)|We took a step back to focus on improving our original language models before moving on to the next set - we're aware that Dutch is one of our most highly requested languages, and we'll be building support as soon as we get enough Dutch language put together. I also can't wait to let you use it! -Will.
[Will you ever bring back the quick "":\)"" key that was located above the ""k"" I  believe?  That was one of my most used quick keys and I was sad to see when it was gone.  I love everything about your keyboard though, keep up the good work!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o2b1?context=5)|You know, that key was originally always a placeholder, we meant to replace it with access to different functionality, as we have now. However, since then, we've all come to miss the little guy :(, and we've had a number of people tell us that they loved fast-access to their smiley too :), so we're looking to put it back in. -- Xavier.
[Really? Sorry like I said I drop in and out of keyboards as I feel like I can't fully commit to one just yet!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6xbcq?context=5)|Emoji bar height sizing is something we don't have yet, but I'll think about. We already do have an option to important words from the stock Google Keyboard, but unfortunately other third-party keyboards tend to be a bit more closed about their data storage.
[Is or will it ever be possible to import say dictionaries or common words from other keyboards? Although I assume that this may be something that might not be possible due to the way each dev stores this data? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6xbcq?context=5)|Will.
[Minuum represents one of many solutions to the above problem. What advantages does Minuum have that generates staying power in the market place as Minuum alternatives (Voice, Retina, Large Keyboard 2.0\) make steady improvements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ofd0?context=5)|Other communication alternatives (like voice typing) are certainly a very natural way to use technology - but they just aren't practical in every situation. Voice typing breaks down in social/professional circumstances where you don't want to speak everything out loud to your device, or when you're simply in a noisy environment. We're a big fan of voice typing, and we've made sure to integrate it into Minuum for Android as a gesture shortcut; I see Minuum as complementary there, not a replacement.  The real staying power behind Minuum is its extensibility to any imaginable input dimension; with only one dimension of input required, Minuum is less constrained (which is useful both to the manufacturer of a device, and to the user of a device). Whatever the future holds, Minuum will have a way to type there.
[I use Minuum as my primary keyboard.  You've successfully implemented a brilliant idea.  What's next on the Minuum roadmap?  New ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ofgf?context=5)|Our major direction now is smart watches. Letting people type on wearable devices makes communication that much more immediate, and we're excited about unlocking the potential that watches have to become standard devices.
 |Within the Android app, we've been playing around with an interesting new direction - we're exploring how the keyboard can be more than just a keyboard, especially because we have this extra screen space to work with. We just added in an optional dictionary/thesaurus-lookup bonus panel, and are curious to see what more we can do to provide useful tools/content/functionality when you're typing... We're always open to hearing more ideas on this front, let us know if you have any thoughts on the matter!
 |Will.
[Hey there, thanks for taking the time out of your day to answer some absurd questions from the Internet. I was an Indiegogo supporter, and continue to be an active user of the keyboard today. It's an awesome product, and I look forward to seeing what you make of it moving forward. Speaking of that..  What potential implementation of the minuum technology most excites you? We've seen demo videos of input using all sorts of creative methods (Wii remote dial-style, pointing at a screen\), but which ones are you guys looking forward to the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o9ph?context=5)|While I think that typing on smart watches will have the most potential to make a big difference in the world of mobile computing devices, I'm personally most excited by the concept of having a small-as-possible finger-worn device (i.e., a ring) that uses motion-sensing technology to let you interact with anything in your life (be it your computer, TV, car, public information displays, other people's devices, etc.).
 |I'm also excited by the concept of enabling many different useful types of input devices, which can be ultra-personalized to each user - perhaps one person prefers a ring, while another prefers a watch, and another a crazy fabric-based piece of smart clothing.
[Congrats, great to hear success stories like yours.  Besides reddit, where else did you raise awareness of your Indiegogo campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6noqo?context=5)|We actually never even considered using Reddit to promote the Indiegogo campaign - that just happened naturally, apparently. As I mentioned in a post above, all that we did was seed a wave of media attention by contacting a few tech journalists (we did also put out a press release, but that proved less effective than a small handful of the direct emails that we sent).
 |Will.
[Is there any ETA on support for Russian language?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o3uy?context=5)|We're working with some Russian datasets now, we'll see how it goes. :) -Will.
[I love the keyboard, but one thing I would love to see is swype texting when the keyboard is full sized. Any chance of seeing that in the near future? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6seuj?context=5)|We're not focusing on that kind of gesture typing at the moment, but it's not out of the question. Tapping with two fingers is distinctly faster than swiping with one hand, and we're really want to focus on perfecting the interaction with the one-dimensional keyboard before moving on to retrofitting other typing methods.
 |If we can get gesture typing working well on the one-dimensional keyboard, we'll ramp up our development of building custom gesture typing on the full keyboard as well.
 |Will.
[Just saw the video--be honest, did you dub it after you recorded the video?  lol...audio is sometimes the hardest part of starting out filmmakers/videographers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6wdgm?context=5)|:) That audio was remixed at about 4am the night before launching the video, leading to some poor mixing levels and some last-minute dubbing of a few words - we fixed all this, though, 24 hours later (after hundreds of thousands of views and much complaining from redditors) - hence our updated Youtube video at [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niV2KCkKmRw)

[Wow, that sounds GREAT if you could implement that!  Also, when you do this, will you then be able to store our typing habits/dictionary in the cloud, so when we get new phone, we can sync right back up with no worries about lost local files (dictionary, etc.\) backups on our phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6xvsi?context=5)|Cloud sync would be a separate feature, but yes, it's something we're hoping to work on soon. For now you can always export and re-import your data to your downloads folder in case you have to migrate to a new phone (just go to Settings-&gt;User Data). -Will.
[Using the trial now and quite like it after the last few days.  Do you have any plans for automatic spacing? Also the other difficulty I experience with your keyboard is typing things like passwords and URLs or any irregular word. I may purchase! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6oitc?context=5)|Automatic spacing is a more distant feature; we have more impactful auto-correction/prediction features that we'll be working on first.
 |The keyboard is currently to automatically switch to a full-sized keyboard for password/URL entry, to make that simpler - in general, temporarily switching to the full keyboard (by long-pressing with two fingers) can help when typing irregular words (and will still learn the words so that you can type them fast with the little keyboard next time).
 |Also, any time you type precisely by long-pressing on the little keyboard and using the magnified view to confirm each letter, the word won't be autocorrected (and will be learned for next time).
 |Will.
[I really like the idea, and I supported the IndieGoGo campaign, but I have found that I just type faster with more traditional keyboards. What are your plans for the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6o29t?context=5)|We do find that some people encounter a few hurdles when first using the keyboard, especially if they never manage to fully get into the mindset of imagining that they're typing on a normal keyboard and just letting the disambiguation do its work. Have you tried Minuum recently? A few months ago we shifted to putting the space bar on by default, which has helped many people type faster much sooner.
 |I also accept that some people may never be fully convinced by the desire to save screen space on their smartphones, which is why our future plans lead more towards Minuum for smart watches: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA6ey1SzHdM)

[As an Israeli user are there any plans to implement Hebrew?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6qe76?context=5)|We have some more research to do fully understand what is involved with supporting Hebrew, but we have some data available to us and so may get this supported in the near future. Keep your fingers crossed!

[Why did you decide to go with indiegogo rather than kickstarter? I feel like kickstarter was more widely known...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pnf5?context=5)|Two reasons: 1) At the time, Kickstarter was not available in Canada (we're Canadian) 2) Kickstarter has very specific rules about software - we wouldn't have been allowed to post the project on Kickstarter unless we went completely open source (which is not out of the question, by the way - just not something we'll be doing in the near-term)
[(Funded you anyway on indiegogo\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pnf5?context=5)|Will.
[I have Minuum as my second keyboard (after Swype\) and I must say the prediction is quite remarkable. That said I find it's weakness to be adding new words.  I switch to the full-sized keyboard to do this.  Might there be an option for displaying the literal input you're making and then you can tap to add it to the sentence and dictionary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6vehr?context=5)|All new words typed in the full or small keyboard are learned automatically. You can ensure that a new word typed with the little keyboard remains unchanged: just confirm each letter by pressing and holding until you see the magnified view appear, and auto-correction won't kick in.
 |Will.
[Howdy!  I like the keyboard quite a bit for how much screen space I get back.  I've also been liking the incremental improvements in word guessing.  Secondary question -- Anyone been playing around with Pebble (/r/Pebble\) and the accelerometer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6oe28?context=5)|1) That was an issue on a much older version of the keyboard - have you updated to version 2.1? Double-spacing for punctuation should be right as rain these days.  2) We've played with Pebble (and chatted with its creator, Eric), and the accelerometer is useful for typing onto a separate display (e.g. a TV), but unfortunately not really useful for typing onto the watch itself, because the watch screen moves while you wave it around. If anyone wants to try building/testing something like this for themselves, you might be able to whip something up with our SDK - just email us at developers@minuum.com for access.
[Hey man, do you know when Minuum will support Danish? I've been waiting so long, hoping it would be available in the beta (I donated money for the crowdfunding\). I tried it out with English, and it works amazingly well, but I'd love to see it for my native language one day. Take care!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6p6uy?context=5)|Thanks for the support! As I've mentioned above, Danish is a bit farther out that some other languages that have come up here, but we'll get to it eventually (hopefully over the course of the next few months).
 |Will.
[Ergonomic question for you: I find the bottom edge of the phone to be fairly hard to reach compared to other parts of the screen. Is there a user interaction argument for putting a keyboard at the bottom (vs along the side, top or floating\) or is it just aesthetics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pc5q?context=5)|It's all about letting you see as much screen as possible when your fingers are pressing on the keyboard - so mostly aesthetic, but I consider this to be somewhat functional as well. If you're able to hold your phone low enough (depends on the phone model), it doesn't have to be any less ergonomic. I used to think that functionality to allow Minuum to be resizable and float around on the screen was its most important feature - I think that's still useful, but not quite as dramatically useful on a smaller phone as on tablet, and we haven't very many requests for this, so haven't prioritized it. (We've had this mostly built for a while now, it's just a matter of squeezing out some major bugs that we haven't had time for.)
[Will we see a dedicated numbers bar on future updates? Or an option to increase, decrease long press special character key duration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6oxdz?context=5)|Are you specifically wondering if a numbers bar could be added as a bonus panel, à la our Emoji support? Because that's certainly a possibility, though we're trying to figure out how to build out our bonus panels while minimizing feature creep.
[What are the odds of getting more granular control over the gesture settings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6pbwn?context=5)|What device are you using? We're currently working on tuning these gestures, and I'd love to know which devices have it worst at the moment.
[Are there any plans to have ""shortcuts""? Like being able to define a mnemonic that gets replaced with a longer word? So if I type ""#pm"" it get's replaced with my email address, eg.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6un31?context=5)|No fixed plans yet, but I like the idea.

[long press time is crucial to me](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6re1q?context=5)|On the big keyboard, are you referring to the time it takes for long-pressing on a key to make the view appear, or for the actual jump to the secondary character to appear?
[While typing a word I delete a letter and continue to finish it, and than put comma or period, the trailing space is not added!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6re1q?context=5)|We designed that action to work fastest with a slide-up instead of a long-press gesture, so the view appears immediately in case you want to immediately slide up to choose the punctuation mark; long-pressing is more of an option to help transition new users into the slide-up feature. Do you prefer to long-press, or were you unaware of the slide-up functionality? We could fairly easily make this delay configurable, if that's really important to you...
 |That's an interesting edge case about punctuation typing that you've pointed out, we're looking into fixing it now :)
 |We're currently investigating support Russian, at which point we'll very naturally have a Cyrillic layout available. Do you type in Russian, or a different Slavic language?
 |Will.
[Hey guys big fan and beta user here...since getting a Samsung GS4 recently I have found that minuum is SUPER sensitive to touches (especially in Google hangouts\), I imagine due to the S4 AirGesture feature, but its so sensitive that it gets really confused by fast typing, I have to consciously slow down so it doesn't jumble words... have you seen this and/or are you working on it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6rwpz?context=5)|Hey upvizzle, we actually wrote a blog post about the gesture detection algorithms that can cause these kind of errors when fast typing: [Link to minuum.com](http://minuum.com/taps-and-swipes/)  We're in the process of recalibrating our algorithms to adapt to various devices, so we should be able to make fast typing work a bit more reliably for you. Thanks for letting us know that it can an issue on the GS4, I'll test that specifically!
[Why does it take so long to implement other languages?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6ohy1?context=5)|See earlier reply: ""Because Minuum relies on really good auto-correct to work our language models have to be fairly complex. So (as you probably guessed) it's not as simple as a list words and counts. As a result we need a big corpus of decent quality to generate a new language model. So far it's been challenging to find decent corpora for each new language. So that's really what limits us.""
[I'm so happy that despite my limited cash I could support a project this awesome (Oh and fellow Canadian here!\). I'm really proud to have the Minuum Indiegogo edition in the play store!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6q1ny?context=5)|We majorly improved on our handling of misspellings back in November when we revamped our algorithms to handle accidental inserted and omitted letters, though there is certainly more that we could do in this area. Have you used Minuum much since then? I'm not sure if we'll ever entirely be able to handle misspellings quite the same way a big-buttoned keyboard can.
[There is a Minuum subreddit, might you consider officially adopting it for soliciting feedback and interacting with users? Other users and fans could simultaneously offer support and tips to other users. BaconReader does this in a really good way. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20tw05/my_crowdfunding_campaign_went_viral_was_funded/cg6rf0q?context=5)|Perhaps, though it seems to have died out a few months back.

I have no internships under my belt simply because I’ve had no time to do one, I have been enrolled in 18+ credit hours since I started the program (including summers.). I was in the military for 5 years, other than that I have no work experience. At my university we have used nothing but VB.net, Asp.net, along with html/CSS and some JavaScript, I have touched on C++ and Java in my own free time but other than that I have no idea about the two. After reviewing the requirements for Jobs and even entry level positions, I’ve come to the conclusion there is no way I will be hired without experience. So I guess this leads me to questions about internships. 

1)	Is it possible for someone graduating in a few months that knows little about C++ or Java to get an internship somewhere? 

2)	Will companies train interns in the language they use or will they not even consider someone if they lack said language?

3)	Are companies even looking for people that are recent graduates or are the positions reserved for freshmen-juniors? 

4)	Is a 3.3 GPA good enough to get an internship?

5)	I have applied to over 50 internships throughout the United States and even one in South Korea, How long does the application process take and what should I be prepared for?

6)	Do companies really only pick people that go to like Harvard, Yale, etc..? I go to a smaller private university.



Any feedback would be great, I am kind of in panic mode at this point. Reddit save me please. Thanks in advance.

20ugm0,6,2014-03-19,"Web dev beginner need help with get, post and put.",okidno,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/20ugm0/web_dev_beginner_need_help_with_get_post_and_put/,"I am trying to learn web dev, as I heard personal projects will increase chance of getting an internship, I am interested in front end so I begin to play with nodejs, however I am a little bit confuse on the interaction between the html, frontend js, and backend js

I want to walk through a couple examples, can anyone point out my mistakes?

My first question is starting the node.js web frame work

    node server.js

So node calls server.js

server.js uses http and express

    var http = require('http'),
          express = require('express'),
          backend = require('/backend.js');

server.js create a server using http.createServer

    var app = express();
    app.use(app.router);
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
    var server = http.createServer(app).listen('4000', '127.....);

backend.js listens to server

    backend.listen(server);

Now here is the first question, who calls app.get('/')?

In server.js  
 
    app.get('/', function(req, res){
        res.sendfile(__dirname + 'main.html)
    });

In backend.js

    var socketio = require('socket.io');
    exports.listen = function(server){  
        var io = socketio.listen(server);
        io.socket.on('connection', function(socket){
            
        });
    }

No one seems to call app.get to get index.html?


My second question is  what is the difference between socket.io and express

1. From my understanding express seems to handle routing, and socket seems to handle the connection, but what if I want to handle both connection and routing at the same time? Say a user click on an html element that redirect to other page, how would maintain that connection


My third question is what is post, get and put, and how do you use them in the backend

From my understanding 

1. Post is when you want to hand information from frontend to backend, and it doesn't depend on what backend, you can have your html making post to twitter or google, or just simply your own server, 

but how would you actually do it ? for example if you want to make a search on google from one of your form, what would you do?

html

      &lt;form id= method=""POST"" action=""/search""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
        &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit""&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;

server.js

    app.post('/test', function(req, res){

    });

how about redirecting pages? If you want to redirect pages to another html on click?

html

    &lt;input type=""button"" method=""POST"" action=""route""&gt;

backend 

    app.post('/route', function(req, res){
	res.sendfile(__dirname + '/views/test.html');
        res.render(__dirname + '/views/test.html');
	console.log(""you have being redirected"");
    });


2. How about get and put, what actions do they correspond to?

do you always need an associate action ="""" to communicate between backend and fronend?


I am pretty sure most of my understandings are incorrect, can someone clarify these concepts?"

After working about 8 months at my current company, I have been promoted to a full time position that is paying $18 per hour.

This job is also very applicable to what I would be studying in graduate school. I am wondering how valuable work experience compares to having a degree in that field. 

Here is my dilemma- I just found out that I was accepted to my top choice California State University to complete my Masters in Industrial Organizational Psychology. Initially, I was stoked to be accepted to this school. However, after reflecting upon how broke and stressed about money I was throughout my undergrad, I am unsure that I want  to go back to that lifestyle. In addition, I am already in tons of debt from my undergrad and not looking forward to being in even more debt. 

I am also a little worried because I will not know what my financial aid package is until AFTER i need to respond to the acceptance letter. Does anybody know if the financial aid offered for graduate school typically offers enough aid to cover tuition and living costs? My savings account is not that impressive and if I decided to attend, I would probably not work to hopefully avoid being overloaded with stress.

Finally- the school I might attend offers internships. Does anybody know what the wages are typically like for paid internships in HR-type jobs?

Does anybody here have any insight on these topics? "

In about 3 months it'll be 1 year since I graduated from uni with a MechE Degree. I'm sure like most of you, I graduated not really knowing what I wanted to do yet, so I took the first offers thrown my way. Thankfully I've been employed since before I graduated:

* Engineering in the Food Industry internship 3 months
* Civil engineering Work 7 months
* currently back in the Food Industry for engineering on a contract to last at least 9 months

However, I feel like after being in the Food Industry for a good amount of time I feel like I wouldn't want to be here for a substantial amount of time. After thinking back on what classes I really liked and what I can really put my passion into I decided to try and go into the robotics field. 

I know it's vague, and I'm trying to specifically figure out what in that field I want to work on, but right now I thought it would be best to learn some coding(C++)/ refresh on control systems &amp; circuits/do DIY projects using Ardunio/ and get some certifications. So I was wondering if I could ask 2 things from you r/engineering:

1) How would a person in my situation go about getting into this field (what would I need to learn?)

2) Is there any certifications I can get to raise my chances? I am aware of CAPM and Scrum Master ( it's expensive!!!) but are there any others? ( I already have my F.E./E.I.T. btw)

as a side note: is there an collective opinion on the CAPM here?

Over this school year, I've applied to over 15 internships without a single interview. Recently, I've been having a change of heart with my major. But I feel it's a little too late. I want to work with computers. At least I think I do. I found a research opportunity with a professor in the IT dept (clearly unrelated to petroleum engineering). How can I market myself to him? The research is about search engines. I have experience in C++ and MATLAB. My cumulative GPA is only a 2.97. My major GPA, which seems irrelevant now, is a 3.6. I have volunteer work, and I am also active in my fraternity. Am I stupid for wanting something like this? Or should I just tough it out and get my petrol degree and hope I can find a job?

Thanks guys."

I have two options and need to make a choice soon. I'm earning a decent pay and able to keep my head above the water with bills and driving 1 hr to and from work. 

My choices are stay as an intern/co-op until a position in IT becomes available or take a phone tech support position unrelated to System and Network administration work. The phone tech position is for the product the company sells. 

I'm almost guaranteed the position as phone tech. But They are unsure when they could create a position for me as a System Admin. My life has always been about IT and my first job ever was 6 years of stockboy at a small town grocery store. 

If I stay as a co-op they'll most likely never see the need to hire a fulltime because I'm already doing a ton of the work along with another System admin out of the 5 man team (including me). Any advice? Questions?"

* Working on my BS in Mechanical Engineering at UT Austin

* Junior (Last summer to intern anywhere)

* Strong programming background 

* Worked in a research lab here at UT that has a partnership with Los Alamos

---


Job 1: Intern at a national lab (Los Alamos)

Pros

* A national lab, awesome resume material

* Exposure to government work environments. I have a strong feeling I wont *enjoy* this aspect, but it's a good experience to have without a HUGE commitment (only a few months internship)

Cons

* The work I would be doing is less exciting to me, probably working on really old programming

* Pay is marginally worse (~$5/hr less)

---

Job 2: Working at a contractor that does work for NASA

Pros

* Smaller company (20-30 employees)

* Would have 'my own' project to work on that I would probably enjoy

* Work is probably closer to what I would want to do in the long run, but who knows?

* Closer to home (~2 hrs away vs. ~15 hrs)

Cons

*  Tiny company that nobody has ever heard of, so if I decide I don't much care for the work I do here it doesn't look like much on a resume

---

So basically I need to weight the prestige and life experiences that come with a national lab vs. the more relevant work experience. I probably won't ever get a chance to 'try out' a national lab ever again in my life, if I ever go back it would be a larger commitment (full time job). 


 I suppose this is a better position to be in than not having any offers but nevertheless I'm still having a tough time deciding. Does anyone have any helpful incite/experiences/career advice that they care to share?"

I am an International student into my first year pursuing Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I am currently looking for internships in software companies and startups. 

I had made a mess on a phone interview for internship at the Top 4 last November. Since then I haven't received calls from any company. I am feeling a little lost here and I am not sure where and what has gone wrong with my job applications. My friends that I know have all received calls and few of them even with couple of offers in hand. 

Can I hope to get calls for summer internships now? Anyhow I'm looking at other options, maybe plan to intern during Fall (if I do get one).

Here's my link to the resume[0]. I had really appreciate if someone could review it if I something really wrong in it. I am just aghast that I don't even get any calls for internships!

Thanks!

After obtaining my degree in November 2010, I went out on a job hunt. I applied and applied, followed up and got no where. In need of money, I began working as a debt collector for the US dept of education. Salary was $32k a year along with commission. I would make anywhere between $1k-3k in commission a month. At the 3 year mark, I decided to quit. I have always been applying during my tenure as a collector, but didn't even land one interview. The reason I quit was because there was no growth at that job. I would trade in short term financial success for more of a long term position with growth. 

While unemployed I have been applying to marketing/advertising positions. I scored an interview with Comcast Spotlight. I went through a phone interview along with 3 face to face interviews during a month long process. Just got word today they went with someone who has ""direct experience.""  They said this was an entry level position. I just feel very frustrated and scared for my future. 


I am even being rejected for internships at this point. I just want to expand my skill set with an established company, but it seems no one wants to give me an opportunity. 

I don't know what else to do. I'm started to get a bit depressed and unhopeful for my future.

I am currently taking an online course from Harvard and I absolutely love it. I have learned more in that class than any other class I have taken in my life, including AP Calculus BC (a class where my high school has an exceptional teacher and we have a high success rate with the AP test).

I know that my current choice will be an exceptional education and I have about 75% of the cost paid for already. What is now bothering me it that a friend of mine told me about the financial aid provided by private universities such as these. I found out that I would be paying the same or less to attend Harvard/Stanford than the state school I am slated to go to.

At the beginning of this year I choose not to apply because I thought that even if I was accepted there is no way that I can pay to attend. I didn't want to waste my time and money applying. But this new knowledge has me kicking myself and I am very interested in attending Harvard or Stanford.

The way I see it I have a few options. First is to attend the state school all the way through for my degree. Second is to attend the state school for 1/2 years and transfer. Third is to attend a community college and transfer. And last is to take a year off, do volunteer work and job shadowing, then apply for these universities.

Going about life alone is a very hard thing. My family is not in a very good financial position which is why cost of attending these private institutions will be so low for me. I am looking for advice on what to do as I graduate high school and begin to go off on my own.

Here is some information about myself.
GPA: 3.5
ACT: 30 Composite (30 Writing, 34 Math, 27 Reading, 34 Science)
SAT: 2010 Composite (620 Reading, 800 Math, 590 Writing, Essay 9)
AP Tests: Calculus BC and Computer Science A (haven't taken them yet)
Activities: Varsity Track and Cross Country, FIRST Robotics, Relay for Life.
Work Experience: 2 Summers of Grounds-keeping for my local school district. And an IT internship for a local insurance company.
Interest in Major: Computer Science and Business.

The more I think about it the more appealing a year off sounds in order to try and get into Harvard, Stanford or another prestigious private school. I feel that I can make myself a more desirable applicant if I take a year to continue my internship, do volunteer work, and find job shadowing opportunities. Another thing for me to consider is athletics. I am currently being offered a scholarship to run for the state school I mentioned earlier. However, I am not sure if I have the ability to run at a more prestigious school. I will find out more after this track season, which will actually be my first full season.

Academically, concepts come fairly easily to me. This actually caused a problem for me early in my high school career. I had built up a habit of not doing work and relying on my natural intelligence to pick up the slack. I spent the later half of my high school career teaching myself habits such as studying, reading, and actually doing my homework. As a result of this my GPA suffers from freshman and sophomore year. While I may not have the best numbers I have become a motivated person who legitimately values my education.

Sorry if this post is somewhat unorganized, I have a lot on my mind at the moment and I also have classwork to finish up. I appreciate all of your input. Thank You."

I had an interview a week and a half ago with a great civil engineering firm last Friday (12 days ago) for a summer internship position.  Here's the story:
Mid January, I went to a career fair at my school.  While I was there I met a woman from HR from this company who immediately took an interest in my resume.  She gave me a card and asked how I would feel about working on a dam project that they are doing about two hours away.  We did all the career fair small talk, and she seemed really interested.

I called towards the end of February and she immediately scheduled an interview for me. I had three weeks to prepare; I got a haircut, practiced answers, all that good stuff.

I went to the interview and she was running late coming back from another career fair.  When she arrived (about 30 minutes after we we rescheduled to meet) the first thing she said was how great it was for me to wait for her.  Now, I had been stressing out and going crazy about this interview for three weeks by this point, but this immediately made me feel good.

So we go into her office and go through the interview motions.  She asks me about what I want to do, why I'm interested in civil engineering, my favorite subject, stuff like that.  She mentioned that I was able to keep my GPA up while working tow jobs, then she told me about the work that she would have me doing.
The entire time, I was feeling very confident about getting the job.   Then she told me that she would have a project engineer call me the week after to set up another interview.

We concluded the interview shortly after, following a bit of small talk.   I thanked her for her time, and she thanked me for coming in, and I drove home with the confidence of a thousand warriors.

Then nothing.   No call, no email.   Nothing.     I haven't heard from the engineer or the woman I met with.   I distinctly remember her saying that he would call the week after the interview.   I waited the whole week and didn't get that call.   It's now Wednesday of the second week, and I have yet to hear anything.    I've been feeling a bit worried since last week, and now it seems too long to simply be due to them being busy.  Should I be worried? Or am I just overanalyzing things? 

tl;dr: haven't been contacted almost two weeks after a what felt like a successful interview

How do I prepare?",whitehat511,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/20z0fo/interned_at_law_firms_through_undergrad_got_a_job/,"I studied Economics and Finance in undergrad, and I interned at law firms in the summers. I'm interested in becoming a lawyer or working in a law-related field eventually, but I've elected to hold off on law school in the short term due to the disproportionately poor current job prospects and disproportionately high current cost of law school. I'm an extremely detail-oriented person. 

I worked at law firms instead of financial institutions because even though I applied for legal and financial positions, my first job practically fell into my lap. I made friends with the managing partner of a small law firm in a park one day, and he offered me an internship at the end of our conversation.  I found further internships in law firms as a result of contacts I made while working in the first law firm. As you all probably know, it's much easier to find jobs and internships when you know somebody who can get your resume in the door. 

That's not to say I don't have the interest in the subjects of my degrees, though.  I *loved* my finance courses, especially the ones acquainting me with how banks work. I love learning why they do what they do, what drives their profit and how it interacts with the economy, and how that relates to the government's interests in the form of regulation.  While I easily understand corporate governance conceptually and the basic math of finance, I struggle with the more advanced mathematics and instruments. I've also steered away from microeconomics to focus on macroeconomics, which interests me far more.

All of that said, I'm searching for employment since I will be graduating in May. I managed to get an interview for an Operations position at a major bank. The position appears to be a nice crossover of my areas of interest.  Here are the details from the job description:


**Responsibilities Include:**
Interpreting guidelines and builds logic based rules for automated compliance testing and monitoring

Preparing for account on-boarding by requesting set up of accounts in various systems

Reviewing new and existing rules to ensure compliance with account mandates

Interacting with Client Portfolio Managers, Portfolio Managers and 
Investment Assistants to resolve any pre &amp; post trade issues

Partnering with the Client Service Team to ensure timely on-boarding / account closings – coordinating dates to ensure guideline rules are coded effectively prior to any trades taking place

Ensuring timely and accurate completion of assigned workload

Managing accurate guideline coding in various systems

Working on projects with strict deadlines, including the migration of accounts from one compliance system to another
 
**Qualifications**
 
Qualifications / Skill Set

Bachelor's Degree in Accounting, Business Administration, 

Economics, Finance or equivalent work experience

Financial product knowledge of fixed income, equities, and derivatives preferred

Detail oriented

Self motivated individual with ability to identify issues and escalate

Strong awareness of cause and effect

Understanding of risk and controls

Industry tools and software suites such as Microsoft Office

Experience with guideline coding in compliance systems (Charles River, Linedata, thinkFolio, Sentinel) a plus

I guess what I'm asking is- given what I've told you about my background and the details of this position, how should I approach this interview to make the best impression?  I really want this job, so  I'd appreciate any advice you might have. If you need more information to give me meaningful advice, please let me know."

I've been getting a lot of phone interviews but have been hearing the broken record of ""pursuing other qualified candidates.""

I've been looking on angellist.co, indeed.com, and have been getting calls from recruiters after putting my resume on dice.com.

Am I doing something wrong? Is there a site out there that I should be using?


Edit: I've recently accepted a full time position and will be starting next Monday!

What I did was I kept applying to entry level software engineering/developer jobs on indeed.com.
I actually didn't change much to my resume and have actually received praise from interviewers on it.
Looking up companies around me on Google Maps was also really helpful. As many don't put their openings on job boards.

My advice is to:

* Keep yourself busy with side projects and always keep learning.

* Read *Programming Interviews Exposed* by Eric Giguere, John Mongan, Noah Suojanen.

* Keep interviewing and study for all of them. The more you interview, the better you get at it so don't get discouraged!

* Dress nicely. I can't say that this was the reason for my hire, but I decided to wear a blazer, dress shirt, tie, jeans, and dress shoes and was able to get offers from 2 places I interviewed at wearing that attire.

* Exercise. Who wants to hire someone who doesn't look healthy?

* Cater your responses to fit the job description. Especially ""What do you enjoy doing?"", ""What classes did you really enjoy during your time at school?"".

* Enjoy yourself and never stop improving yourself!"

Just to preface, I am currently a student studying CS, getting ready to graduate in June. I've always wanted to work at a startup and haven't been interested in working at a big company since my last internship. I've applied to a few companies, but none of them have really interested me and I've been denied from all of them.


Recently, I went to a startup career fair and met another student who has his own startup. He is not a technical founder and doesn't seem to know much about programming. However, he is very passionate about his company and I think he is a hard worker. I think his company is a great idea and it seems like it has potential.


Last summer he had a team of ""interns"" working all summer, unpaid, developing the site. They were somewhat successful, but the site still has A TON of work before it is really ready. No one returned or really communicates with him anymore either.

I recently joined him as the head (and only) programmer. He wants me to be a founder with him, which means I'll get more stake in the company and have more responsibilities. At first, I was really excited about the idea, and actually joining a startup. I've always wanted to do this, and I know there will be many struggles along the way.


However, I think I bit off more than I can chew. First, there is no documentation for the code and very few comments. The style is terrible and I now understand why schools stress little things like relevant variable names (so many variables with only 3 letters), proper indentation and comments. 


I'm the only programmer and he has almost no idea how the site actually works. I've tried reaching out to the ""interns"" from last summer, but none of them have responded. Its using NodeJS, Javascript and MongoDB, which I know, but I'm still fairly new to. 


On top of this, it is all unpaid and I really need money so I'm working 2 part time jobs on top of going to school full time and being an active member of 2 student organizations. He has given me equity in the company, but if it isn't making any money, I could have 90% equity but that means nothing. 


Finally, he has been kinda unrealistic about the deadlines. I only joined a few weeks ago and he is already bugging me about a release when the site is no where near close. A friend of mine worked on the site last summer and warned me about this. He said the founder was terrible about deadlines and kept pushing the coders to release the site even though it was nowhere near close. I understand the importance of deadlines but I also think its important to listen to your team and be realistic about a deadline. 



I hope this isn't complaining, but I'm starting to wonder if I made a poor choice in joining this startup. One of the last things in life I want is to be working at a big company that I care nothing about. I want to be passionate about what I'm working for, and I think I can do that by founding my own company.


I'm starting to think I should quit, join a startup with some funding already, learn some more from people who are doing it right than go off to start/cofound my own company. But is that unrealistic and will these problems just exist at any other startup?


**TL;DR:**Passionate about startups and music. Joined a student startup with only one other person, a non-technical founder. Excited at first, but after stressful deadlines, no help and no money, I'm starting to wonder if I made the right decision. Is this seriously the startup life?"
210xn4,19,2014-03-21,Freshmen/First year Internships!,csgirlthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/210xn4/freshmenfirst_year_internships/,"Hopefully this is a post a lot of college freshmen/first years can refer back to; since I'm finishing up my first year, here's the big internships out there for the future freshmen/first years.

**Google - Engineering Practicum**

* Formerly had a FEP (Freshmen EP) and an EP but starting 2013, it's just known as EP. 
* Applications start somewhere in September/October. 
* Apply online, there's a few essay questions (3 with one optional, around 200 words maximum). 
* Do **not** wait until the last minute to apply, seats will fill up a few weeks before the deadline.
* This is for freshmen and sophomores.

**Microsoft - Explore Program**

* Don't really know when applications open up but I applied around the 1st of October and interviews had begun by the first week or so of November. So keep going back to the Explore page around early September.
* Apply online. Really easy, just need to upload a resume and a very short title.
* This is for freshmen and sophomores.

**Facebook - Facebook U**

* As of March 2014, this is their second summer hosting this internship so it's relatively new.
* Really really short application timeline ... started around January 6th, 2014 until February 28, 2014.
* Apply through your Facebook account with your resume and then you need to send in your college and high school transcripts and your SAT/ACT scores. Also, they will give you a prompt for an essay - 1 page maximum.
* **Important** First years/freshmen ONLY!

**Qualcomm - Early Identification Program**

* This one is a bit more unique, it is less advertised. So when Qualcomm visits your career fair, make sure to talk to the recruiters and give them your resume. Then do a followup around late December/early January. Last year, interviews were held in January, this year it was late February and early March.
* Just need your resume to apply. 
* Again, freshmen/first years only.

**Intel - IRISE**

* This is the one I know the least about.. I heard about it in early January so I don't know when the application process opened up. All you need to do is submit your resume when applying online.
* Freshmen/first years only.

My advice for all of these? Apply to all and apply early. Bookmark all the links to these internships and keep checking every few days to see if the application has opened or not. Go to the career fair (yes even as a first year) and talk to the recruiters. Mention that you're interested in their programs and ask if they can tell you more. It also helps to have some computer science knowledge (but not required) when applying - at the end of the day, companies want to see your passion for cs. Good luck!"

I am the 2013-2014 Chairperson of the student branch chapter of IEEE at San Jose State University.

Throughout the semester the IEEE officers and I have organized different types of events for the other students in the Electrical Engineering Department as well as the College of Engineering. Some of the events we organize are Workshops, Information Sessions, Technical Talks, Industry Talks, and Professional Talks.

As the summer is quickly approaching I've been trying to focus on getting companies to come in and do Information Sessions since I know there are a few quality individuals still looking for positions.

An Information Session is an:
&gt;Event in which companies have the opportunity to explain their various job and internship positions as well as give information about the company and its organizational culture.

Basically it's a chance for companies who are still looking to fill full-time and internship position to promote their company and take resumes from exceptional candidates.

In the past we've had Information Sessions featuring Texas Instruments, Xilinx, PLX Devices, Anritsu, NASA Glenn Research Center, and Brocade. This semester we still have two tentative talks from Ericsson and Lam Research.

So, if there are any Silicon Valley companies still trying to fill a decent amount of Electrical Engineering internship and full-time positions I'd love to get in contact with you and schedule something. Send me a PM if you're interested or I can give you my email and we can collaborate that way.

Thank you."

2135kn,2,2014-03-22,"Finishing my Computer Science education sort of early, but feel like I didn't learn as much as I should've. What's next?",AllyOmega,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2135kn/finishing_my_computer_science_education_sort_of/,"   I go to a small Liberal Arts University in Florida. I'm currently finishing my second year of college for my Computer Science degree. I recently realized that I only have two more Computer Science classes (AI and Software Engineering) I have to take for my major because my advisor recommended that I start my Comp Sci classes early in order to have more experience by the time I graduate. The rest will be either Gen Ed classes or classes for my minor. I do plan to take a couple of Comp Sci electives though.

   My problem is that I feel sort of lost at this point. My first year of college was marred by some depression and because of that I wasn't taking my schoolwork all that seriously. I had no motivation to do any programming (or school work in general); I just wanted to be at home and play video games all day. My GPA and my learning in general sort of suffered (my GPA less than my learning), and while I've gotten out of that phase and am more motivated and serious about my work, I feel like I missed out on a lot of important foundational knowledge.

   I'm not really sure where I'm supposed to be at this point or how much of that information I should have absorbed. It's difficult for me to sit down for more than 10 minutes at a time to read a complex OS concept in a book in the first place. With that on top of the depression I was going through my first year, I feel like I missed out on fully understanding some of the foundational principles I was taught. Now I feel like I'm trying to learn new concepts that rely so much on things I should have learned earlier that I'm too far down the rabbit hole to catch up.
     
   I know C#, a little bit of C++, Object Oriented concepts, some SQL, and html/javascript. I've come out of most of my more ""conceptual"" classes like Operating Systems and Algorithms a bit dazed and not really sure of what I'd learned, despite having gotten decent grades in the classes.

   On top of all this, I'm starting to plan on doing more independent work and contributions, since I'll have more time to dedicate to non-schoolwork programming. I'm also going to talk to my advisor about looking for internships soon. 

   (tl;dr) To sum it all up, I'm finishing up the ""Computer Science"" part of my Computer Science degree and feel like I haven't learned as much or done as much independent work as I could've/should've. I'm afraid that I'll be stuck doing some mid to low level corporate job I don't really enjoy doing because I screwed up my education and therefore limited my options. How can I gauge where I am as opposed to where I should be? Additionally, what are some good places to start for independent learning (books to read, sites to visit, etc.)? How should I move forward from here, in more general terms?"

And the most frustrating part is that they are all sophomores and I am a junior who is still struggling to find an internship, while many of them have intern in google the first year. How do I increase my CS skills in cool projects, I feel either they have invest a tremendous amount of time on personal projects, or they have some secret source to learn cool stuffs, I don't believe the former as I know quite a few of them and all they do is play LOL all the time, they produce most of their output at hackerthons (seriously I ask a guy at the beginning of hackerthon what he was going to do, and he said he didn't know, after 8 hours he wrote a compiler on his phone that can do all sorts of magic) or perhaps I am misjudging them, anyways I need some serious advice here, any advice if any would be greatly appreciated.

I've started to learn computer science in school. It all was simple document formatting in Word at first, then I discovered Excel - spreadsheets, diagrams, formulas - you name it. It was the whole new world for me and I liked it.

Then I was told about Pascal. Hours spent playing around with so called ""text based RPG"" - tons of ""if-else"" blocks, ugly code, bad practices - you probably know that feel. At that point I felt really powerful. I believed that I could change the world, that I could build something absolutely stunning.

So I entered the university, faculty of mathematics and computer science. I can't describe how disappointed I was. No one told me what a real world programming looked like. I never was taught to build a real application. Lectures barely covered algorithms and data structures. I have started to teach myself but turned out that I couldn't do it and keep getting good grade points. I could live with that because I kept getting benefits of self-teaching and spending my time taking online courses.

Now I am at my senior year, going to get a bachelor's degree this summer.

I live in a third-world country, have no job, not sure that I will land a job after getting my diploma, because no one here needs actual programmers. I have no work experience and more than that I had only one internship. I don't even sure if I am capable to work with rock-star programmers. I always wanted to leave this country and to move to Europe or USA and I don't have money. And that stories ""I used to be a carpenter for tren years and then I read a ""Become a programmer in 21 days"" and now I'm making six figures lol"" make me feel even worse. That's life, huh?

Things are getting serious with my girlfriend and taking the job would mean putting 2500 miles of distance between me and her for the next few years while she finishes her degree.

The job with Cisco is a big compromise for a variety of reasons: the pay isn't really that great for the higher cost of living, I don't like larger companies, and the job likely won't involve JavaScript-based web development, which is my main focus, despite an optimistic recruiter. However, I would really just be using the position as a stepping stone to something better. I figure once I'm in the bay area, it will be a lot easier to get a job at a smaller company, since they seem to hire locally for the most part.

The other option is to stay in town, a mid-sized city in Florida. I'm currently employed remotely doing web development (my division is experiencing a lot of growth but the technology is rather dated) and I have gotten calls from a few places doing work that really excites me. I'm also active in the startup scene, though I'm not holding my breath that those will take off.

The way I see it, I should have decent job prospects in a few years as long as I'm doing work that is engaging and relevant. However, I'm worried that the extra few years staying in-state might have a severe impact on my options when the time comes to leave. During the job search I faced a lot of rejection, and I guess a part of me sees the offers I did get as more luck than anything. However, I'm not a particularly distinguished student (3.5 GPA, no real internships) so maybe I'll fare better when I have some real experience under my belt?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm grateful for any feedback!

218rdb,5,2014-03-24,"How to decide if a CS or Stats PhD, and asking for advice",musiqua,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/218rdb/how_to_decide_if_a_cs_or_stats_phd_and_asking_for/,"This post has a few parts to it:

1. I am trying to figure out if a PhD program is right for me
2. If so, whether I should look at doing Computer Science or Statistics
3. Whether I even have a shot at getting in
4. How to go about applying if I go for it

I know these are a lot of questions, but I don't know anyone in my life who is doing / has done a PhD, and I have no idea where to get answers for these questions. If you have any suggestions for resources for information, I will run with them!


  1.PhD program? You're thinking about what?

I got my BA from a top 10 school in economics statistics, and spent a few years in Finance before defecting to a startup as a stats analyst. Along the way I discovered computer science and how amazing I think it is--I taught myself python, MySQL, Scheme, and now I'm working on Java. I'm interested in cache optimization, low level languages, compiled vs. interpreted languages, and pretty much anything else I can get my hands on. I feel like there is a whole world of knowledge out there, especially in the intersection of statistics and computer science, that I want to contribute to. I'm trying to teach myself what I can, but there's no real rigor to my studies, and I have no one to guide me when I have questions. I want to continue my education for real, and nothing makes me more excited than the idea of spending a good chunk of years thinking about computers. I read white papers in my spare time. This seems like what a PhD is supposed to be for.

  2.CS? Stats?

Despite my enthusiasm, I don't have any ""real"" computer science experience. I've never taken a programming or theory class, and all I know right now is what I've been able to glean on my own. I feel like no Computer Science program would ever admit someone who doesn't know any C++ or hasn't written a compiler or never even took a BA class. This makes me think that maybe I should try applying to a Statistics program and then try and make my area of study heavy in the area of Computer Science, since I at least have a statistics degree and some idea of what I might be doing. Is that even an option? I don't know.

  3.Don't matter if they won't take me
The requirements that I've seen so far for PhD program admissions have been pretty daunting. My grades from undergrad were pretty good (3.8), but not 4.0 worthy. I never did any research except one summer internship with a climate science group. I took the general GRE and got a 660 on the Verbal and a 770 on the math, which I take to be average at best, and certainly not good. Are these qualifiers good enough to apply anywhere at all?

  4.How to...
The other wrinkle I have is that these scores expire on July 1 of this year. Do programs ever let you apply early for fall admission? I haven't taken a test in a while and don't think I would do well if I had to take the GRE again. This is a distressing thought for me. Does this seem like an exercise in futility? Do I need to take post-bac classes and re-take the GRE and try and find an internship in order to be able to even think about this path?


I really appreciate any advice you all might have for me, including links for me to read up on things. I feel totally out of my depth even thinking about this path, everyone I know went into finance and I've already burned my contacts having quit and gone to a startup.

Along with travelling in general, I would like to work / study as much as possible. I will have just completed my a-levels so I'll be 18.

Is it possible to get like internships at tech companies before a degree? Most my friends are doing jobs like bar-tending but I'm curious if its possible to actually get work with something related to CS. I know this is a really broad question but I'm curious if anyone else took a gap year before university or have something you could recommend me?

The thing I'm worried at is that I don't have much physical experience with switches/routers/firewalls and all that, as my university mostly taught me 'networking' in a VM. I'm currently in an unpaid internship, but I haven't done much other than a minor PowerShell script. 

So, basically, where should I go from here? Do little personal projects such as setting up a firewall and servers at home? 

Much appreciated from a stressed out college senior. "

I currently have an interview for a cyber security position at a very reputable company, which I am hoping to be selected for.  However, I have been receiving a great deal of attention from a few recruiters for jr. development positions (C#, VB, asp.net or PL/SQL).

Could someone give some insight of some of the negative aspects of working within the security field?  I am aware of the disadvantages of going into development (saturated job market, outsourcing, etc.), however I never really considered the down side of security.

I absolutely love comp sci. I spend a lot of my free time programming, doing web design/development for a start up and on top of that I'm taking a pretty ambitious course load. This year I've taken both Java classes that my CC offers on top of the usual physics, calculus ect. I have good grades (3.8 gpa) and I'm out pacing most of my class mates in Java. Granted these are intro classes at a community college but I really do feel that I've got a knack for CS.

That being said, come summer I'd really love to advance my skill set but I'm afraid that the fact that I go to a community college will make me a less desirable candidate for internships. I live in the San Diego area and I'm sure most of the big companies look for UCSD students to fill their internships.

What can I do to find an internship that I can learn from? I could take on web development projects this summer but I don't find it as interesting as coding in say Java or C++ and I'd be willing to do it for free if it meant a better learn opportunity. Where should I be looking? What should I be doing to set my self apart from the students going to a big name university?

Due to working while going to school combined with being a single parent going through a custody battle through my junior year, I am going to have a 2.8 GPA with a similar major GPA (might be 3.0 major, but it's not certain yet.) 
I went to one job fair last year at school and received one job interview from it with a company that was very interested in me, but I did not meet their 3.5 GPA requirement. Honestly I don't know anyone in my major at this university who does. Past year graduates have a 100% job offer rate for my major according to the career office. We will have another job fair I think next month but not sure about that.

I am getting nervous that I dont have a job yet but I havent had the time to pursue one outside of the job fair and I dont know where to start. I need to update my resume from last year.

Here are the basics:
I had an internship with the IT dept at the university but I literally did nothing for them. I was supposed to do some network support and scripting but their priorities changed and between the 3 people working with me I never received any work. Nothing. This wasted my opportunity for a junior internship. The IT dept is willing to say that I did this networking work, but I dont think thats a good idea.

I won first place in a statewide video game programming competition last year and will be competing again this year. The games are programmed from scratch in Java, no engine. I have my projects for last year and this year on Git but no other projects of note.

I am working with a senior team to create an ipad application from scratch for a local school for disabled children and have done a large part of the gaming contributions for the app. This app is not and will not be on the App Store as it is the curriculum for the school. I cannot post the code on my git but have a copy of the app on my personal devices for development. Not sure how to include this on my resume.

I am interested in getting an averages to well paying programming job and think I have the ability. My gpa doesn't show that. My internship was bunk. I may be being an alarmist but I am beginning to worry whether I will get a job at all in the next few months. What should I do? I updated my LinkedIn but that website strikes me a backpatting worthlessness."

I'm just going to get it all off my chest, so I apologize fir any rambling.

I have never had a real job before, except a one-month internship at an art studio where I coached young children.  I'm very shy, and I didn't have confidence in my ability as an art teacher, because I wasn't really trained at all.  I also felt uncomfortable caring for young children, and I had to be very careful to make sure they didn't run off or leave with the wrong person.  It was really really stressful, so I'd rather not be a camp counselor or anything like that.

I don't have any savings for college, and I want to burden my parents as little as possible.  My dad has been telling me how he started working at 13 in the 50's, why didn't I have a job already, etc.  I agree with him.  I can't just laze about now, because real life will hit me next year and I want to be as prepared as I possibly can.

So I'm on my second week of Spring Break now, and I vowed to try and find a job for the summer during these to weeks.  But I'm totally out of my depth and have no idea what I'm doing.  

I timidly asked some clerks at chains like Michael's, CVS, etc., if there were any job openings for the summer.  It took me forever to work up the nerve to ask, and they all said no, but to send in an application online anyway.  I've been putting this off and I honestly don't know why.  

I'm in a town that has a lot of stores, but I have no real experience, I've never been a waitress or a clerk and feel so embarrassed to ask.  I'm terrified of seeming presumptuous.  I don't want them to think, ""Why is she sauntering in here and asking for a full-time summer job, she has no work experience, she's not even 18 (I turn 18 in mid-August)""

I'm just stuck and tearing my hair out because I NEED to get a summer job and it's already late and the positions will be filled.  

Please, can someone just tell me what to do.  I'm in the US, in New Jersey.

I'm torn between going to grad school for something I'm passionate about vs. taking a fat check at a job where I'm indifferent to the work.

Long story short, my ultimate career goal is to end up at NASA (though I'd settle for any aerospace company/organization, to be honest).  I've always had a passion for space systems, equipment, and missions.  I've applied to tons of jobs and internships in the industry but to no avail.  I have good grades (~3.7 GPA) and decent internship and work experience.  I've gotten job offers outside of the aerospace industry (mostly in the oil industry) and have also been accepted to an ME masters program at a top engineering school.  I never saw myself going to grad school and honestly want to be done with school so I can start working and living (and paying off debt...).

However, the jobs I've been offered hardly interest me aside from a nice paycheck (which would help with the huge student loans, i.e. my main motivation for going straight to work out of undergrad), and I feel that they wouldn't really give me nearly as much experience that could be put towards the aerospace industry as grad school would.  Conversely, I'm just really not in the mood or mindset for grad school (more loans, more stress, etc.), but I feel that I would be so much closer to an aerospace position with the masters.

Does anybody have any insight into my situation that they're willing to share?  Been through a similar decision?  I'll take any advice I can get. 

Thanks in advance.

I've been teaching myself for the past year, and I LOVE it, I get such fulfillment out of everything I learn and I'm pushing hard to get into the industry (tweaking my portfolio, applying for internships/entry level jobs). I graduated with a BS in Bio this past spring, but I can't get a job in it and I only finished it for the sake of having the paper.
My parents on the other hand, can't understand my passion at all, and seem pretty opposed to it. If I mention that I applied for a webdev internship, their response is usually a single line like ""Oh.... ok?"". They don't give a shit about any of the projects I show them. If I'm on my laptop in the kitchen watching a tutorial or coding, I can notice my mother getting agitated, like she tenses up and starts sighing heavily. My parents begged and pleaded with me to apply for this vineyard laborer position (pruning, weeding, putting up bird nets), and I gave in and applied because I want to support myself and move out of this house so badly. They were so happy when I applied for that, and they ask me every single day if they called me back yet. 
I can't convince them that this is where I see my future. They think that because I worked 4 years in a greenhouse that I'm destined to be in horticulture the rest of my life. My mother says things like ""This is just a phase, you've been interested in lots of other things before and then you stop."" She suggests I apply for town jobs like county bus driver, recycle center scale operator, or town permit clerk. She tells me she hates seeing me sitting at the computer. I do spend hours on the computer but that's because I'm furiously trying to learn faster and constantly checking job sites. I also audit comp sci classes at my University, and go to the gym 5 days/week so it's not like I don't get out. My dad is mostly silent, which is totally weird considering he was a computer science college dropout and is the one who put me in front of a laptop before I could write sentences.  

I just feel so utterly sore and full of hurt. I can't understand why they seem so disappointed in me. You would think that they would be so happy for me, that I'd found something I excel at, and that happens to be lucrative as well. I guess I should just not care, but it really sucks living in this house feeling the passive-aggressive atmosphere all the time. They've always been extremely supportive of everything else I did, why is this so different? Please please help me understand if there's something I'm missing here. 

**TLDR; Learning web development and trying to get a career in it, parents don't approve and it's making me depressed. Is there something I'm missing? Help me understand why they might feel this way.**"

They want me to start tomorrow.  Either way I'll probably have to continue looking for better paying work.

Is there anything specific I should be doing in this situation if I end up getting the internship?

Whenever I talk to my classmates about CS, it seems that everyone's lives revolve around programming. When they're not working on school assignments, they're working on side projects, apps, answering questions on Stack Overflow, or talking about coding and technology with their friends. 

As for myself, I really do enjoy programming. I find it satisfying and engaging and something I could do for a long time (given that I'm being paid for it). That being said, I don't really see myself programming outside of school/work. I pretty much consume my spare time with art and want to get into tattooing in the near future. I also lift regularly and try to keep up a social life. I can't imagine sitting down to work on a side project after I've been working on school coding assignments all day. 

I feel like this makes me get looked down upon a lot by my peers. Am I going about developing the wrong way? Do I need to drop everything else and code more? I'm not dumb - I got myself an internship with a Big 4 company for the summer. But am I setting myself up for a failed career in CS?"

The interviews for internships have went badly because they are always looking for ppl with experience, higher statistics knowledge, etc.

I know many other students have a plan and know exactly what they want to do in the future (grad school, finance, etc) but what about other students like me? Are we destined for unemployment?

I'll be going to the same school from which I received my first BS (civil engineering). I've been unemployed since I graduated last May, so as I was talking to my parents earlier today, we sort of hit upon this idea. I called up the admissions office and will be starting the application process shortly. I also have 3 years of education in web/interactive development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, a bit of Java and ActionScript, and graphic design).

So, clearly I have *some* programming skill. I also have all the math requirements save for linear algebra, though I could probably stand to brush up on my discrete math as well. My interest in CS is threefold. One: I think the job opportunities might be a bit better. Two: I want to finally learn how to build an entire, complex, OOP application because I've got some ideas. Third is probably the most involved, and the one that will hopefully make you established computer scientists sigh in relief and say, ""at least he gets it."" This is that as a civil engineer I was drawn to traffic engineering, and more specifically, microscopic traffic simulation, travel demand modeling, etc. I got a bit of computational methods in one grad-level class, but I want to get the theory so that I can work on these sorts of simulations, myself.

So guys, talk me up or down, your choice. I'm too old to screw around and I want to kick this degree's ass if I end up going for it. What should I read? What topics should I have some familiarity with in advance? What kind of work am I looking at in terms of academics and internship experience? How should I approach getting an internship?

Does your salary usually increase with 1 more internship? Is it worth it to miss a semester of full time pay?

So I'm a freshman at University and I've been trying to combat some of my people problems recently. Back when I was a little kid I used to have no problem just being chill and making people laugh without feeling shy or anything. As time went on, however, I started to be more shy and scared of activities that involved interaction with people. I have tried multiple times to step out of my comfort zone with sports and other outings but no matter what I do it does not seem to get any easier to talk to people.

I've been told I just need to work on my confidence, but honestly, I am pretty damn confident in my abilities and talents. I feel like if I became any more confident I would pretty much border on the boundary of arrogance if I'm not there already. I'm making pretty excellent progress on my degree in engineering with an internship lined up and I'm rolling in the dough, I have a pretty aesthetic form and have gotten comments from girls about it (don't know how to handle them though...), and things just seem to work out for me in general when I put my mind to them.

These things said, I'm pretty confident in my abilities. But when faced with social encounters, it seems like every notable positive feature that I have as a person flies out the window and I am the lamest person alive just trying to hold my own in the conversation. This is especially true when talking to the honeys, ha. I also tend to talk kind of quietly and mumble when I'm talking with someone I'm not comfortable with. When I AM comfortable with someone I talk in a completely different fashion, pretty loudly and clearly.

So what gives? What should I do to solve my social problems?"

First off I’ll give some rambling/background information before posing the question.
I have not yet found a job, though I have been working on improving things that I’ve read in /r/cscareerquestions as recommendations for getting hired. I have been interviewed and rejected a few times, and I have another interview at the end of the week. The job prospects seem to improve as my situation improves (having a personal website, blog, projects and experience that employers are actually looking for). 

I think that I can find a job within the next few months, but I am becoming worried for multiple reasons. I am not sure if it is simply cold feet/anxiety, but I am wondering if this industry is really what I have been looking forward to. I started off looking to get into the game development industry, but found late into my degree that I enjoyed playing games more than making them. Since I was already about to be in my senior year, I decided to power through and finish the degree.

I’ve always been intrigued by other topics, most notably electrical engineering and robotics kinds of things. I also breezed by my first degree, not taking internships or worrying about my GPA. I did very well in courses I enjoyed, and mediocre in others, leaving me with a 2.8 GPA. This hasn’t really been a barrier to getting an interview, so I am not worried about that. Another thing that I always wanted to do was the whole study abroad/traveling thing. I would have liked to have done all of these things, but for some stupid reason (many actually, and these three months have been enlightening as far as foresight goes) I didn’t do any of them.

I also graduated with very little debt, around $3K.

I am wondering, how feasible/recommendable would it be to get a second bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering, one where I work harder and do all of the things that I say above? My State University where I am considering applying is very cheap, the program is very good, and even with taking loans out to pay for this new degree, I would end up with $15-$20K more in debt.

As you can probably see, my mind is scattered and I am full of doubt still. I would like any advice and perspective that you guys can offer. On the one hand I feel I should just join the work force for a while and figure things out while earning money. On the other hand, I feel that I am in the position where I could easily go back to school and enjoy my time a little longer, get the previous out of my system, and THEN go into the workforce in 2-3 years.

21fqml,12,2014-03-26,My close friend told me today that she's decided she wants to commit suicide and asked me to respect and understand her wishes.,throwawaytoday9119,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/21fqml/my_close_friend_told_me_today_that_shes_decided/,"We'll call her A for this post. She has had an extremely troubled life - an abusive mother, a distant father who has started a new family a couple of hours away and nothing but emotional distress for all of her 22 years. Her and I were on the verge of entering a relationship before I left the country (Canada) for Greece on a three-month internship which concludes next week - I'll be home on April 6th. Things were proceeding well here until a few weeks ago when her and her ex-boyfriend had a massive falling-out and she was noticeably upset with herself and her life. I've done my best to support her from over here despite her telling me she no longer believes she can get into a relationship - we were close friends for years before this, and even if things didn't proceed romantically I would care a lot about her emotional well-being. She started seeing a counsellor on a weekly basis, but was put on a waiting list for a real treatment program (she basically keeps all of her counselling records and hopes to be able to meet with the same counsellor each time she goes to the clinic). 

Today she told me that she is done with all of the pain in her life and has decided she wants to end it. She doesn't seem to be in a stereotypically suicidal situation - she has an active and successful work life and many friends who love and respect her. She told me she simply cannot continue to bear the pain that her troubled upbringing (and all of the things that have happened to her as a result) have caused. I made a point of telling her that there are a lot of people who would be devastated if she took her own life, but she angrily asked why she should have to continue bearing her pain for the sake of preserving the feelings of others. Fearing that she would do something drastic immediately, I told my roommate (her best friend) that she was talking about committing suicide and that he needed to get over to her place right away, which he did. She was angry that I did this and it didn't seem to help - she asked him to be left alone, which he did, but we continued to talk after, with it being clear that nothing had changed.

I did my best to tell her I understood that she felt hopeless and like her situation could never improve, but that if she committed to professional help she could not only find a way to get past the pain but find happiness in life as well. Long story short, no matter what I said she would not agree to see it that way... I got her to promise that she wouldn't kill herself today, that we would talk tomorrow, and that she would tell her counsellor about these feelings tomorrow when they met. I'm hoping that suicidal thoughts are a major red flag with her counsellor and that this leads to immediate action.

I also asked her to promise me that she would talk to me before actually doing anything, but she said that after I called her friend today, she couldn't do that - basically that some day I will simply get the news that she's killed herself. She said she does not want my help, she only wants me to understand and respect her wish to no longer be alive... from my perspective, she has asked me to just let her die. She insists that this isn't the case - she only wants me to respect that she wants to kill herself even if I can't accept that and want it for her as well, to which I answered that I can respect that, but I cannot just sit back and let it happen.

I don't know what to do about this situation from here. I looked into changing my flight to go home early and it will cost thousands of dollars which I simply don't have - not that I can't spare it, but that I simply do not have the money required to jump on a plane tomorrow and fly home. My flight is booked for April 6th, but I don't know if she'll still be alive by then.

One of our friends (my roommate) now knows about this and I feel obligated to tell another one of my roommates who is also extremely close with her. I don't know what else I can do, especially being so far away with no way of getting home any time soon. It frightens me that she was not simply saying she's been considering it - but that she actually said that she hopes that when the day comes, that I will understand why she had to do what she did. Please, any advice will be greatly appreciated.

[Thanks for doing this. Do you think we will ever (in the foreseeable future\) ""escape"" from the giant bulky bubble spacesuits that have been the norm since the Apollo missions? A slimmer, more form-fitting one, like the ones the Mercury and Gemini astronauts wore, would certainly be easier to operate in, but is not technologically feasible for working in exposed space. Are there any designs that are aimed towards a thinner aesthetic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcj3yx?context=5)|Great question! This is a question we get a lot, and there are a couple answers.
 |First, the Mercury suits were not designed to be pressurized except in a contingency - they were ""get me down"" suits similar to the orange ACES suits we used for Shuttle.  The Gemini suits were used for EVA, but were sorely lacking in mobility. In comparison, the Apollo suit built just a few years later, which still has somewhat limited EVA mobility, appears much ""bulkier"".  As a general rule, the more mobile a pressurized suit, the bulkier it appears due to the use of more hard mobility elements such as bearings. The more hard components, the less change in volume of the suit through the range of motion, and the higher the mobility.
 |Also, an ""alternative"" to full pressure suits is mechanical counter pressure suits which have been theorized and worked on since the 1960s. Some of us think that this type of suit architecture has a place in the distant future once material technology enables it.  For now, we do actively fund material development in this area.  In the meantime, we are designing suits for the next 10-20 years, and those will likely be full pressure suits like you see with the EMU, Mark III, Z-1 and the upcoming Z-2! -SM.
[In case you've somehow missed my question specifically about MCP suits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcld5w?context=5)|Mechanical counterpressure (or MCP) suits are a concept that have been around for many decades. The concept carries with it many potential advantages to full pressure suits.  However, there are many technical limitations that need to be overcome before we see an MCP suit performing a spacewalk on Mars.  Advances in materials and construction techniques must be made and we view these as long-term issues.  We are very glad to see progress being made on MCP and in addition, we ourselves are actively funding development of these materials.  Many of us view MCP as having a place in the future of spacesuit design, although when advances in technology allow that future to occur is a big unknown. In the meantime, we are looking at developing flight capability to support missions in the next 5-15 years. - SM 
[Can one of these suits withstand a micrometeorite hit, say, in a moon or Mars atmo scenario? Or is that pretty much instant death for the wearer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcjhu0?context=5)|The risk of impact is higher on the Moon because there's no atmosphere to slow bits down or destroy them, and once they hit on the Moon, smaller secondary chunks can be ejected too.  However, at the end of the day, the damage done depends on the size of the particle.  The suits are designed to maintain pressure for at least 30min after getting a 0.25in diameter hole.  We try to mitigate the risk by designing multiple layers in the suit that reduce the size and energy of particles that hit to prevent them from actually penetrating the bladder layer.  We also use statistical models in EVA planning to pick times and locations for space walks that are lower risk for micrometeoroid impacts.

[A\) Are you developing/interested in exploring some sensing system - active or passive (thinking interferometric colour change, due to disruption in a diffraction grating like structure... a la iridescent butterfly wings\) - which informs the astronaut about a tear?

The engineers pay attention to peeling of the silicon outer layers and are looking for colors other than grey or white on the glove, which are signs of damage that goes beyond the thermal micrometeoroid garment (TMG).  Small tears and cuts may not be obvious to the crew on orbit, but the engineers on the ground tracking the oxygen usage in the suit can detect small leaks early and terminate the EVA for safety reasons.  Any hole that's big enough to activate the secondary oxygen system will be obvious to both the crew and ground teams.

Not realistic for the forseeable future. Form fitting suits (MPC) are decades away and there is a certain amount of pre-breathe time required before going EVA to allow your body to be purged of N2 because the suits operate at lower than earth atmospheric pressures.

 |Edit: I will add that in almost all science fiction films, the dead give away, even if the suits are not form-fitting, is that they don't move like a pressurized suit moves.  They move like normal clothes.  A suit at 8.3psid is as hard as a basketball. When they move, it is very characteristic and as a spacesuit engineer, that is always the thing for me that sticks out. -SM.

[Do you plan on distributing any suits to SpaceX or other privatized companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcnj55?context=5)|NASA’s commercial crew partners are solely contracted to develop a vehicle as a way to transport crew to the International Space Station.  As such, the suits they use will be “launch and entry” suits of the simplest kind.   Each company is responsible for their own suit, whether they build it in house, or subcontract it out. Launch and entry suits are designed for unpressurized comfort and mobility – they are only pressurized in an emergency and therefore, pressurized mobility is not a significant design driver.  The Z-series of suits and other suits in our Advanced Suit Laboratory are specifically EVA suits – that is, optimized for pressurized mobility. Therefore, while there are always lessons learned in any suit design and some technical overlap, we view these suits of limited applicability to the Z-series. That being said, there are others within our branch (Spacesuit and Crew Survival Systems Branch) as well as within NASA that are working closely on commercial crew partners and spacesuits are an important component of this.  And lastly, we just want to add that we are all super excited about the prospect of commercial access to space! -SM.
[With some clever implementation of the Peltier effect, I wouldn't think there would be any problems with thermal regulation. No need for an LCVG; or its weighty, and Luca-threatening extractor fans, pumps and pipes. (Yes, you could use simple Joule heating to increase the temperature, but I was thinking about active cooling as well. In fact, if this was weaved into the fabric, it could arguably provide more spatially uniform temperatures - if wires can be manufactured in smaller sizes than pipes which have to transport a fluid\)  Another advantage to all this is that the astronauts can breathe air at regular habitat pressure (since they don't need to reduce suit pressure as much as possible to avoid impeding mechanical motion\). This means no overnight airlock campout, or even ISLE for a blood Nitrogen purge prior to EVA. They may still choose to breathe air at lower pressure than the habitat pressure, if that facilitates longer EVAs with the same mass of Nitrox/O2 in a tank (Does it?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgcjygl?context=5)|1) You need to pressurize the breathing cavity to at least 3psia.  That means either some kind of breathing mask, which is not really ideal for regular full day EVAs, or some kind of neck seal that maintains a delta pressure of 3psid with minimal leakage.  I'm actually not familiar with much work done on this yet, and maybe it's doable, but it certainly sounds uncomfortable to me given how much motive force is behind 3psid in my experience working around suits.  3) It is very difficult to apply the required pressure to all parts of the body and to verify you are applying the pressures you need through test - including the crotch, armpit, etc.  It's not an unsolvable problem, mind you, and there are very smart people, some of which directly funded by NASA, working on it right now.  So, I would not agree that NASA and/or our team pay lip service to MCP.  We all *love* the idea and continue to support it. Our primary job is flight capable designs in the next 5-15 years.

We have over 62 different sizes of gloves with fine adjustments of finger lengths in each of those sizes, but we still see injury.  As part of our High Performance EVA Glove project we're developing sensor systems that can be worn inside of the gloves during suited events to help us understand what aspects of the design are creating the biggest problems.

 |Dude, how much time do you have? Seriously there are quite a few and this is one of my favorite topics. One because I'm stubborn and always need to correct people when they're wrong (ask my wife, and I'm working on that). But also because I find it interesting how science fiction plays such an influential role in how people view space suits versus other technologies. For cars, flying vehicles, weapons, architecture, these things are all common in science fiction and while futuristic, they usually take on a similar form to existing and functional versions thereof. For spacesuits in science fiction, there is a draw to eschew the realities that confine real spacesuit design for a much more appealing aesthetic. On top of that, the most attractive spacesuits in science fiction are conformal, sleek and sexy, usually mimicking the human form approaching that of a supermodel or athletic superhero. So, in general I find this topic to be of particular interest because it ties into what people find attractive in other people *as well as* technology. In any case...to your specific question. I'll pick my top three.
 |People are always surprised when they see the restraint layer of EVA suits. They are so used to seeing the outer layer only, whether in photos or movies or whatever that when they see the suits without the cover layer on, they are amazed by the level of detailed construction and engineering that goes into them. See my recent example above showing photos of the Apollo suit with and without the cover layer. And that is 50 year old suit technology!
 |By extension most people are of the impression that to design a less bulky, sleeker suit is a trivial exercise and real EVA suits look the way they do because of some predetermined design solution. The truth is that we would love smaller, lighter, more comfortable suits. But to make them mobile to do real work in space or on Mars, we use heavily-engineered mobility elements at the joints that allow for sufficient range of motion. Imagine taking a tubular balloon the size of your leg and inflated as hard as a basketball. Now imagine bending it. That's what we are dealing with. It's a solvable solution but with today's technology it leads us down the road to components that are considerably larger than the human joint.
 |One of the biggest is the simple reality that some spacesuits are designed to be pressurized only in a SHTF scenario. They afford very little pressurized mobility and instead are designed for unpressurized comfort, mobility and low thermal burden. Not unlike normal clothing except this clothing also saves you if your vehicle depressurizes. Suits we work on in our lab are designed to be worn and used only when pressurized. They allow things that are very difficult or impossible in launch and entry suits. The penalty you're paying for this mobility as I mentioned is mass and cost. It's an engineering trade and there are areas in between. The Apollo suit did both functions well enough and that was a great engineering feat. That works for a couple days but for our suits, and NASA's vision over the coming decades, we are talking about months or years on Mars. Very different.

[Do the new suits weigh any more or any less than the current suits? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21fjrf/we_are_nasa_engineers_building_nextgen_spacesuits/cgckhg2?context=5)|The short answer is Yes, the Z-2 suit will weigh less than the current space suits.
 |The Z-2 suit will weigh about 135lbs compared to the current EMU, which weighs over 300 lbs.  Keep in mind though that the Z-2 suit won’t include a thermal micrometeriod garment (TMG) or a portable life support system (PLSS), which adds significant weight to the EMU.  The weight of the EMU without the PLSS weighs ~195lbs, which is still much heavier than the Z-2. - AK.
 |The biggest factor that plays into the weight of the suit is the metal components such as bearings. Z-2 will have more bearings (like hip and leg bearings) than the EMU but we’re currently testing the compatibility of titanium in oxygen systems which provides significant weight reduction compared to stainless steel bearings used in the EMU. We’ve also tested composite bearings in the past but additional development is needed. DJV

I am currently an MSc student at Goldsmiths University, and am currently looking for an internship or junior role in a games company as a programmer.

Part of my course is that we all go off for internships at the end of the year, but this tends to be full time jobs that just continue after the supposed internship period ends, I was just wondering if anyone knows anywhere that are taking these types of people as the majority of things I find require a years experience!

I have had a couple of interviews with a few companies and waiting for responses but thought you guys might know something I don't!

I don't want to reject the offer I have in hopes of getting the other one, but I would like to know if it is okay to back out from an accepted offer before the internship starts for another offer that I am waiting for. I would prefer not to hurt my relations with A because I have had a good experience with them. All of my interview rounds with A have lasted longer than any of my friend's for the same position which, I believe, means they like what I have to offer.

21h9mh,5,2014-03-27,Former accountant going back to school for CS full-time. Turning 27 in less than 2 weeks. Excited... but also freaking out a bit. Advice?,mfunktastic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21h9mh/former_accountant_going_back_to_school_for_cs/,"Hey all,

So I started taking CS courses at a local community college last year (I took an intro to CS course and a Programming Tools course) and I'm currently enrolled in a Comp Sci 1 class. After this semester is over, I'm hoping that I will be admitted to my local university's CS program as a transfer student, pursuing a second bachelor's full-time. Coincidentally, I lost my job about two months ago, so I guess this decision couldn't come at a better/worse time, depending on how I look at it. I will be taking all the major core courses, but no gen. ed. courses since I already have a bachelor's. If everything works out right and I get good grades, I'd like to pursue a Master's, but I'm open to re-entering the workforce immediately upon graduation as well.

So I guess I'm looking for some advice on how to plan out the next two years, since I haven't set anything in stone yet. I would like to lay a good foundation for myself so that I can make better, more informed choices in two years, when I finish my CS degree.

If I pursue a Master's, what is the best way to go about preparing for it (beyond just good grades) so that I can be competitive at, say, a top 20 program? Research with professors? Academic publishing? How can I pursue / find these kinds of research opportunities with professors?

Or should I focus a lot more on gaining summer internships with local firms and join the workforce after finishing my degree? What would employers say when I apply to internships intended for undergrads, and they see on my resume that I have almost 6 years of professional experience (albeit in accounting, not CS)? Would focusing on internships hurt my chances at getting into a good Master's program if I don't focus as much on research?

For what it's worth, I am very interested in breaking into development for prop trading / high-frequency trading firms, or pentesting / network security. As you can see, these are two completely different areas, and it's basically because I don't know much about what I may like or may not like about them.

Sorry for blasting all these questions. I guess being almost 27 and virtually resetting my career is freaking me out a bit. I studied something I disliked as my first degree (accounting), and I want to get my career change right.

Thanks in advance for your much appreciated help!"
21hbpz,9,2014-03-27,How can I get back into my field after suffering some personal issues and basically being unemployed for 5 years?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/21hbpz/how_can_i_get_back_into_my_field_after_suffering/,"The good: I went to a decent college and got a bachelors degree in computer engineering.  I graduated in 2007 and worked for about 2 years afterwards in an entry-level job.  

The bad: In the past I had a lot of personal issues, depression, anxiety, etc.  I started hating going to work and got to the point where I just couldn't do it anymore, and I ended up quitting with nothing lined up.  I had a lot of savings, so I basically just took the next year off being immature, drinking a lot and playing video games.  

After that I had to move back in with my parents because I was running out of money, which made me even more depressed and I fell into a really bad stretch.  After a while I started doing some part-time work in unrelated jobs.. bar-tending, construction, etc... but nothing like an office job.  

I have come a long way since my dark days of the past and now feel like I'm ready to get back into a real job.  The only thing is it has been so long since I have worked in that field and I really don't even remember much from it.  I don't have any relevant experience in the last 5 years I can put on my resume and I'm pretty sure they'll just throw it out immediately.  And I think it's too late to try to do an internship or anything like that.  

Any advice on how I can get back into a real job starting basically from square one?   Thanks.

I have worked in firm A, small-moderate firm the past summer and loved it. I got to know several team members and co-workers and feel very in-place. The workloads there are challenging and fun. Furthermore I feel that I get the perfect balance of guidance and feedback. I feel that I have a presence here. I can easily have a conversation even with the executives! It takes around an hour to commute each way. Over an hour when there is traffic.

However, there is one offer I need to decide on going or not. Firm B is in the same industry firm A is in, but it's way larger. The pay is 33% higher and have a shorter commute. I will also be collaborating with other co-workers + 2 interns, but I don't feel that I would get the same 'fit' I had from firm A. 

tl;dr and conclusion:
I feel that this is a very tough decision for me...
Should I take firm A for the connection and camaraderie? Or Should I take B? "

Post-PRISM, it's time to serve their data from the UK too.
[What do you think the government needs to do to counteract that damage?  I work for a company in this space and I can say from my seat... it is causing some issues.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkm5x?context=5)|One thing I can say, is everyone probably needs to have a data center or instance or something in the EU now.  Being 100% US based, once you get past say $5m or so in revenues, isn't good enough anymore.
[Hi Jason.  23 year old tech professional here, and huge fan of Saastr.  I'm starting a new job on Monday as a business development rep at a 15 person startup.  Any advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdk8l9?context=5)|I think this is an amazing opportunity.  Biz Dev is where you will learn how sales actually works.  Just set up the calls, do the qualificaiton, whatever it takes.  But beyond that, learn.  Get to know the reps, try to get to know the VP Sales, and even better, since it's 15 people ... the CEO.

[Jason, love your blog. Thanks for sharing your experiences.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlnb6?context=5)|That's by design.  I'm not THAT smart.  I can't magically tell you if your pre-revenue product is going to rock.  And even if it's great, maybe you'll still never get anyone to use it.
[You don't write much about the very early stage - testing ideas and trying to get to product/market fit. Do you have any advice to share about that?

At least then, I can help ;)
[Hi Jason How important was Product leadership at EchoSign? Any thoughts on Product being part of Engineering/CTO or the other way around? Any advice how to structure that when you're around $3-4m ARR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdnfpr?context=5)|Oy.  I don't think there is any perfect answer, except one.  If your VP Product hasn't managed engineers, pass.  Maybe your VPE and CTO don't report to the VP Product.  Maybe they do.   Or maybe your VP Product reports to your VPE, sometimes. It's complicated.  What I do know is the model where the VP Product has never managed engineers, at least a small group, or at least indirectly, is a Fail.
[You've written a lot about sales and marketing. Are you planning to write about product management in SaaS companies, how to hire great product leadership? Any learning from your experience at EchoSign on the topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdqkoo?context=5)|Yes.  Not done with all the revenues stuff yet ;)  But thanks for the nudge and reminder.
[Biggest problem is churn -- we're at 5%+ monthly, average customer check size monthly is $25, so we're talking small businesses / startups mostly.  Customer feedback isn't too helpful--it's generally that people didn't find the product useful or couldn't get the team on board.  Some customers love us and have used us since 2012, others try us and churn pretty quickly.  Product development has never been fast or felt right--we built a simple tool that people liked, but we've perpetually had the problem of not knowing what to build next.  And we build stuff on top of what we have, people are typically lukewarm about it.  I know you can't tell me what to do, but what are the things that you think we should look at to decide whether to keep going, to give up, or where to double down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlx40?context=5)|First, Churn Is What It Is.  Don't worry about the absolute number.  Ignore the blogs and press here.  Instead, just try to drive it down.  That's the key.  Driving it down.  All web services have a natural churn rate.  Some have a far higher churn than you'd expect.  Especially, when they sell to individuals or very small businesses.  Many are at 5% at the lowest customer sizes.  Not just you.
[Why are so many SaaS companies (like Box, Salesforce, Workday, etc.\) not be profitable? Are the valuations real? Are they not too dependent on ""debt"" and VC's? And does that make it a bubble? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlmkd?context=5)|Look at cash flow, not profits.  If you close a 3 year deal and get the cash flow upfront, in SaaS, you still have to spread the revenue out over 3 years ;)
 |Salesforce went cash-flow positive far earlier than it went GAAP ""profitable"".
 |Same will happen with Box, etc.  (even though Box is hardly cash flow positive now!)
 |Box is spending now to grow &gt; 100% at $200m ARR which is Epic.  And exactly what I would do.
[Hi Jason, huge Saastr fan. We're just starting out, have 6 customers with 200k ACV, so doing ok, but we worry that our product might be too high end and our market limited. Generically speaking, would you suggest hitting it out of the park with our early customers and others like them, or testing the broader waters as soon as possible to see if we need to 'dumb down' the offering/price/etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlfhf?context=5)|I recommend NOT dumbing down the product for at least 1-2 years.
 |Here's the thing.  No one has heard of you.  You only have 6 customers.  You have no mini-brand, no nothing.
 |And yet ... you already have 200k ACV.  Awesome!
 |Just get another 6, and another 6.  Just get to 60, or 10x.  Then you'll really have something.  A $2m business and true Initial Traction.
 |Your market is almost always larger than it looks.  It has to be.  Because no one has ever heard of you at this stage.  There are always more customers.
[I'm building a SaaS platform for a female segment. I struggle with finding people of note, i.e. investors, that can relate to a platform that is targeted to females that ""get it"". How can I change my delivery to show them the opportunity and paint an accurate picture? Lead with the numbers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdl4zg?context=5)|Hmmm ...
 |Well, first let's ignore sexism and all that.  It's there, and it's real.  But I'm not sure that's really the issue (although it may be).
 |I think numbers are all that really matter.  SaaS is about recurring revenue.  If you don't have recurring revenue yet, then any revenue.  If no revenue, then any signs of traction in users, etc.
 |Most SaaS investors these days are NOT investing in concepts, or slides, or beta products with no users UNLESS the team is already proven.
 |I think the real answer is you may need to show more progress.
 |Personally, I don't care what anyone's product does .. not really ...as long as it's in an interesting space (with good multiples) and a great team.
[How do you explain huge sales &amp; marketing expenses of most SaaS companies? In particular, why Box has to spend so much on sales&amp;marketing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkveh?context=5)|Box is spending about $1.25 or $1.50 or so in sales and marketing expense to acquire a customer worth $1.00 per year.  And to grow even faster (&gt; 100% at $200m+ ARR), that ends up consuming a fair amount of capital, because while you get that cash over 5 years, the expense is incurred up front.

[Thanks for all the awesome content on SaaStr!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkoos?context=5)|Boy that's a broad question. My broad answer is that today -- we are blessed.  There is a probably a tool to do almost anything. Back in the day, we had to build our own billing services, our own email delivery services, our own imaging services, our own hosting, etc. etc.  Today everything is available as a service. But I would basically do anything that improves productivity.  Something to automate your lead funnel (Marketo, Hubspot, Eloqua, ACT On etc.)  For 100% sure, something like Intercom and Zendesk and others to automate interactions with your customers.  Tools like ToutApp so that you can see how your prospects interact with your team, and to manage the communications.  Use it all. And use something like EchoSign to get the deal signed on the spot! ;)
[Aside from Salesforce, what software (SaaS, maybe\) should SaaS companies leverage to help scale their business? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdkoos?context=5)| 
[Hi Jason, big fan of SaaStr. Your advice has been instrumental to my SaaS Thinking. Thank you!  I launched my company (single founder/1 man band\) just before Christmas. ACV per customer - $1,200. 37 customers. 0 churn. Practically all customers have been acquired through hustle, outbound email and referrals.  The thing is, it's kind of exhausting. It takes about 30 mins of webinar and 1hr of prep &amp; follow up to acquire a customer. I do about 3 webinars a day.  Question - How do you scale up with such a low ACV. I can't hand hold everyone who walks through the door. How have your companies like Pipedrive managed to do it? I feel like I am on a death march to 100+ customers. It's working but very inefficient. Do you even care about CAC at this stage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdni21?context=5)|Uh ... you have $40,000 in ACV already?  Dude, raise another $500k in seed money (maybe I can invest), and hire 2 sales reps with at least 18 months of experience.  They know what to do.  And your CAC is zero, if I understand right.  Don't sweat it.
[What are your thoughts on ""per seat"" software licensing model?

Salesforce, Workday, and pretty much most SaaS players charge that way.  Adobe has moved primarily to per-seat pricing now, as has Intuit.  Etc. etc.
[In regards to customer acquisition, what do you find are the most successful mechanisms for driving customers and sales in SaaS? Looking back at your initial launches which things have you replicated for future launches and which have you said let's not waste time on that tool?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlgge?context=5)|The best thing you can do is make your Existing Customers Successful.  Over invest in Customer Success.  Even if you only have 10, 20, 100 customers.  Word-of-mouth and brand ultimately are the source of all great cos. new customers.  It does take time though.  A long time.  But start today.
 |Always investing in sales reps as soon as there 30-50 leads a day, always works.  Always investing in customer success as soon as you have say $10k in MRR always works.  Always investing in your funnel, in demand management (if not generation) always works as soon as you are at $20k-$30k in MRR.
[What was the first company you invested in? How well did your investment pay off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdk9an?context=5)|So far, I have made absolutely no money as an investor -- except  investing in my own companies.  Everything I have done as an entrepreneur has made money.  My personal $$$ into EchoSign returned about 10x.

Not too long ago, Adobe closed a customer I had brought in as a prospect -- 7 years ago!  Obviously an extreme case.  But if you're going big, and going long ... try to chill.  If it closes next quarter, it doesn't really matter.  And you don't want to break it.  Really, I am not 100% sure this deal was as solid as you thought it was ...
[Can you elaborate more on your background in Nanotech? Seems like you were way ahead of the field at the time. What made you decide to get into SaaS? Do you do anything in Nanotech/invest or follow the field anymore at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlhxp?context=5)|I've often been way ahead.  That gives you a headstart when you aren't THAT smart.  E.g., SaaS entrepreneurs today are about 10x better than I was back in '05/'05 when starting EchoSign ;) The quick background is a prior company I was working at was going bankrupt.  I couldn't accept that or quit.  So I grabbed the lead engineer on this nanobattery project which was just a tiny lab experiment ... we bought the rights to that technology ... and built a company around it.  And sold it for $50 million 12.5 months later.  She knew the tech.  I just saw where the market was growing, got the customers on board, and built the rest of the team.
[Any advice for someone trying to do something in nanotech today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdmcrq?context=5)|That there's no such thing as nanotech per se.

 |The hardest part, compared to All the People That Try to Do Start-Ups, is to Get 10 Unaffiliated Customers.  10 that aren't your friends, family, ex-boss, ex-coworker, etc.
 |Because if you think about it, no one of us need any more paid web services for business.  More games are fun.  But do any of us really need another accounting system? ;)
 |Assuming you get 10 though, then the hard put is being strong enough, committed enough, to get to about $1.5m-$2m in revenue.  Because 10 is never enough to pay the rent.  That's the hardest time in the end, once you've done the Impossible.

If I were Keith Krach (who I am friends with and have only positive things to say about), I'd do just what he is doing.  I ran a more capital-efficient ship back in the day, that's for sure.  We were cash-flow positive once we hit $4m ARR.  But if I were running either EchoSign stand-alone today, or DocuSign today, given all the capital available for late-stage SaaS companies ...

[Hi Jason, I am a huge fan, we met briefly at the Pulse conference.  A. You wrote about vertical CRMs recently, we built one at Link to keyb.co with a kernel model, so that it can be rapidly customized and extended for a given vertical.  What are the most attractive vertical CRM segments for the future?  We are starting with international schools and SaaS companies, since there is nothing that combines CRM + Zuora + SaaS Optics + Quickbooks in one solution.  B. Using the SaaS universe as a market, what would you say is the addressable market size in terms of companies? And what pricing model would you recommend (% of ARR like Zuora or a flat subscription fee\)?  C. Do you expect SaaS growth in Europe and Asia to accelerate in the future? And do you believe that local incumbents that move early can build a sustainable business (i.e. the Rocket Internet model but for SaaS\)?  For example, in Asia e-signatures have not taken off because in many markets (HK, Taiwan, Mainland China\), there is a huge reliance on chops, which are not supported in any commercial SaaS e-signature product.  D. As you described in many prior answers, SaaS companies at-scale have become incredibly capital intensive in order to fund growth, but in the longer-term do you think there's a better way, where you would have just owned Echosign forever using the cashflows to fund future businesses and new products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdnyvv?context=5)|SaaS doesn't HAVE to be capital intensive.  We got cash-flow positive at EchoSign at $4m ARR and I could have grown the company stand-alone to day to say $40m-$50m ARR without any more venture capital.  But with more VC we could have gotten to $70-$80m in ARR today.  Compare and contrast ...
[We have a SaaS startup with 15 customers and an ASP of $10k ARR. Our customers include some of the most notable mid market ""growth"" companies in the world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdlkog?context=5)|Your product is a lot more valuable than you think.  Probably.  Or you wouldn't have those customers. It's OK if right now you aren't 100% sure it's mission critical.  Your product will get better, year after year, release after release. You may not have cured cancer.  But I think you've added real value to the enterprise. Get to 100 customers.  Whatever it takes.  You'll see. It's worth it. EchoSign was a pretty crappy (albeit cool) product in '06.  Today it's an an amazing Enterprise-grade product. Double down on what works and don't sweat the existential stuff today.

[Hi Jason Was there a time you considered pivoting your product and your business? Also, how important was Product to EchoSign's success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdmfbs?context=5)|Everyone pivots, at least soft pivots.  Buffer just wrote about how they soft-pivoted to businesses (over consumers) around $1m in ARR.  We basically did the same.  We started off as a freemium business (like Box).  It became clear that wasn't big enough, so we tilted upmarket.  We ended up with 40% of revenues enterprise, 40% medium sized businesses and groups in enterprises, and 20% freemium and very small businesses.  A lot of web services end up with somewhat similar ratios, e.g. WebEx and others. In terms of product, that was always our saving grace.  Our customers loved the product, even if it was feature poor for a long time.
[Hi Jason- What do you think of the companies that are selling to SaaS vendors to help them manage the unique business challenges that their subscription business' have?  Companies like Gainsight, Intercom, Zuora, etc. ARE ALL doing great and are on the bleeding edge of offering services for the subscription economy. Do you think there is room for more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdopge?context=5)|In general, I think there are room for a ton more vendors.  Yes, there are  only so many products SaaS vendors can buy from other SaaS vendors.  But overall, we are just in The Second Inning of the shift of CIO budgets to SaaS.  Every market is 5-10x bigger than it was just a few years ago. Salesforce is now doing $5 billion in revenue, on way to $10 billion.  Just a few years ago, they were convinced CRM was only a $1 billion market.  So there is room for far more vendors.  But -- the bar is much higher today.  The products are much better, the teams are much stronger.  So the days of cr*p SaaS products are kind of over.
[Would you say these are much more like solution sales where the ACV is $100k+ since Gainsight and others have gotten significant ARR with very few customers? And lastly do you think there is a path towards more integrated solutions vs. patching together Zuora + Salesforce + QB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdp0vv?context=5)|Well, it is easier to build an enterprise business with $50k and $100k customers than $5k ones.  Just plain math.  It's what I'd probably do if I did another SaaS start-up (because I can sell at this price point, I know how).  More integration?  hmmm ... I don't think so.  Because the individual vendors are getting richer and richer and stronger and stronger.  I think we will see less integration. Salesforce isn't adding much to CRM, instead it's adding to Marketing Cloud.  It's ""too late"" for Salesforce to build a Zuora.  Soon, it will be too late to build a Gainsight ... the products just get too feature rich and sophisticated ... 
[Why did you leave Adobe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21j9hp/im_jason_m_lemkin_aka_saastr_ceo_and_cofounder_of/cgdmpa8?context=5)|I needed to put EchoSign on the post-acquisition track it is on today, so it could thrive after the acquisition.  And not die like most acquisitions do.  If you compare EchoSign to most acquisitions like it, most died, at most SaaS acquirers.
 |I accomplished that, and feel good about it, and that that was my mission and job.  I stayed until EchoSign would clearly be the success inside of Adobe that it has become, as the fastest growing property in Adobe, and one of the 4 growth areas outlined for '14.  That was enough for me, and then I transitioned out. Of course, if they'd really wanted to keep me after that ... maybe a somewhat more logical retention plan would have helped ...

I see no positives for an MBA, except much later ($50-$100M+ ARR) when there's a lot of quant analysis going on.
 |I say get the MBA of life and go get a job at a SaaS company, learn more, get promoted, figure it out, and do you own ;)

There are many I am impressed by, but the thing is, I'm not sure I'm good enough or the proper fit to have founded them.  E.g., OpenDNS or New Relic are amazing companies.  But I don't have the skills there.
 |What I do wish is that I hadn't sold.  It's not because EchoSign hasn't thrived under Adobe.  It has.  Adobe has done an amazing job and the business has grown over 4x.
 |It's just I wish I was still running my own company.  Maybe today we'd be doing say $60m ARR standalone (we wouldn't have had the Adobe boost). Still pretty awesome.

[Occasionally, when looking at an existing market, you'll see products with abysmal user experiences.

You and I can build something 3% better than DropBox, maybe ... but no one will use it.
 |So what is 10x better?  10x cheaper, maybe.  Maybe the paradigm changes, and a Mobile CRM becomes 10x better than Salesforce.  But just making a slicker user experience usually -- usually -- isn't 10x better.  Unless the old UX is Siebel ...

Also, ServiceMax is on the IPO path on top of Force.  (Marketo is not built on Force, it just connects to Salesforce).  Beyond that, broadly defined, the Force.com platform is a $1 billion business for Salesforce now. Having said all that, if your app doesn't look and act like Salesforce, more or less, and there's no business reason to align with Salesforce the company ... it's not likely Force.com will be your #1 technology platform choice today.

Suggestions?,cssalarythrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21jp7g/anticipating_salary_negotiation_for_bostonarea/,"I'm interviewing with a company and it's looking like I may get an offer. I've tried to figure out what to expect in terms of base salary, but there isn't any salary information online for this particular company and I think general numbers for a software engineer are being inflated by the larger companies in the area. (IBM, Raytheon, Microsoft, etc.) This company is on the smaller side. (maybe 50-60 employees internationally?) 

I'm just graduating and my GPA isn't great, but I have two years of employment as a programmer, two internships (including one with this company), and all of my supervisors have given great reviews of my work. Additionally, I've been trained at the company I'm applying to, which is an expensive, time-consuming process.

Any suggestions on what would be a reasonable salary to expect for a software engineer with my stats?"

I've only received one phone technical interview with a big company, and I bombed that badly. Since then I've mostly gotten nothing or rejections. I've sent e-mail inquiries about my applications to several companies, and still no responses. This along with my several attempts at starting projects that end in utter failure has led me to realize I'm actually very bad at programming.

I did an unpaid internship last summer, and it turned out to be a rather bad internship with a manager who didn't know anything, and other frustrated co-workers. I felt I learned very little.

I don't want to entirely blame my professors because there are great programmers among my peers, and I know I really just lack self-discipline when it comes to self-learning and solo projects.

EDIT: Forgot to mention. A friend of mine is who has a paid internship doing Software QA wants to recommend me for a similar position in that company. Still waiting on news from him, but how do you guys feel about Software QA Internships? I know anything is good at this point, but I'm curious.

21kgos,316,2014-03-28,First web development internship.. one week in and I'm feeling like a fraud.,LalienX,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/21kgos/first_web_development_internship_one_week_in_and/,"Back in August, I made the decision to pursue the web development field and it has been one helluva ride. I've learned very basic PHP and MySQL (enough to put info in a database and pull it out) and intermediate HTML, CSS and JavaScript / jQuery. I have always tried to balance out my skills so I never really became good at anything. 

I put together a resume and a very lightweight flash card php application and I started applying to jobs while going to school and working my day job at a hotel. I finally got an interview, so I brought my laptop to the interview... The interviewer didn't even look at it and gave me a piece of paper. 

It was 6 small squares placed around a very large square on one half and there was a JSON call on the other half that I had to complete. 
I had to add jquery functionality to where if I clicked on a square, then the big square would change to the color of that square.

I passed the test, but I coded that thing so horribly that it wasn't even funny. The code was all over the place, but I still got the internship. The man who gave me the test said that I had a lot to learn and I was given an offer right on the spot. I agreed to a 3-month, full-time, $15 an hour internship with a possibility of becoming permanent. And I must say, I want that permanent spot almost as much as I want to breathe. 

They wanted me to be a HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery developer.

I came into the workplace excited and ready to learn a lot. It took 3 days to get me in the system and get my computer. I looked at the project that they are working on and the first thing that came out of my mouth was, ""You think I can actually help you guys with this?"". The code was insane. Everything was so abstracted to the point that it wasn't even jQuery anymore. The lead developer has made several libraries and whenever he describes something to me, he uses so many words that I cannot understand. 

I have never felt so stupid and inexperienced and I know that this is what an internship is all about--- learning from the best. But I run into the office everyday acting like fish food because I am frantically studying and trying to get up to their level thinking that I can close the gap between my 8 months of coding to their 10+. 

Do you guys have any resources for me to get better? Which blogs should I follow? What books should I read? How can I keep up with the trends? How can I get a better understanding of HTML5, CSS3 &amp; JavaScript/jQuery. I know that I need to master these, but I'm not sure what I should master about it. I'm hungry for this job.

This is my first time posting here, hopefully someone can shed some light. 

I've been working in a big company for a few years now as an outsourced resource. I'm also attending the university and will be graduating in two years. I got a little tired of my work situation and decided to look around for internships and trainee programs, and sent my CV to a couple.
I was contacted by a local bank regarding the internship and asked to do a skype interview. That happened and after that the manager responsible for the team contacted me and scheduled an interview on-site for next monday morning, which I accepted. 
The thing is that in the meantime (actually yesterday) I was offered a promotion at my current work and will be going through an insourcing process, along with a raise in pay. I was also asked to participate on the next round of the trainee program I applied for.
Therefore, I'm no longer considering the internship.
However, I would like to go to the interview for the experience of going through that in a large bank, especially since I do intend to go into that area in the future, and also due to the trainee processes I'll be going to participate in shortly.
Since they have laid out all the cards already (working hours, salary, etc) and I think the interview with the manager is the last step, I don't think they are expecting me to have to think about it in case they offer me the internship. 
How do I go about this without burning any bridges?
Should I mention something at the interview or just if someone actually contacts me to offer me the position? How should I put it?
Should I try to cancel the interview in such short notice?

Thank you very much!

Tl;dr: I have an interview for an internship I'll decline because I was offered a promotion in the meantime, but would like to go to gain experience and to know this company's hiring process. How should I go about saying no without burning any bridges?

**Edit:** Thank you everyone who took the time to comment and read this! I got some mixed responses about whether they thought I should cancel or not, and I was very torn, but then I got the news that my medical exam for my new position will be at the same time on monday, so that was that. I decided to call the manager and let him know I was very grateful but I had just been offered a new position at my current job and would be taking it. I said that I was still very interested in working at the bank in the future and would love to be considered for another position if they thought I had the right profile. He was very nice, congratulated me and asked me to send him my CV for him to keep for upcoming openings. :-)"

Apologies! 

**I attended Boston Reed College in 2011-12 and dropped before the course was completed. Was told via a monitored phone call that I would not be responsible for the remaining balance for my tuition. 2 years later get an email saying I have 5 days to begin payments on my remaining balance or it goes to third party collector and screws up my credit. Wasn't notified a single time in 2 years that I had been missing payments on an active account. Help?**

~~~~~~~

So, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit (I'm really sorry if it isn't, a point in the right direction will be helpful if this is the case), but I have a problem involving a past due amount that I would love any and all advice on.

Ok. So. In November 2011 I enrolled in Boston Reed College's Pharmacy Technician program offered through an adult education center in Lathrop, California. I ended up dropping the course right before the final as I had started my internship and basically just realized I wanted nothing to do with the pharmaceutical industry.

I had been making payments of$249.16 to my tuition up until this point. I believe I made 6 payments, out of a total of 10. I called Boston Reed (I sooo regret attending this ""school"" sigh) and spoke with a woman whose name I do not remember, and she told me three things, that my mother was able to verify as she has it written down in her calendar from 2012 on the day that I called. My mother was helping me with my payments which is why she has the info. 

Their phone calls are monitored, which may be my only saving grace in this whole situation.

The three things this woman told me that my mother was able to confirm were:

1. I would not be penalized for dropping the course

2. I was not eligible for a prorated refund for the remainder of the course as I had completed over 60% of the course, and 

3. I would not be responsible for the remainder of the payments. 

So, I considered it a closed case and moved on with my life. I don't have any documentation from this school, I have moved since then and I have literally zero anything from Boston Reed College, I'm currently digging in my digital files to see if I have anything at all from my time attending the school. 

2 days ago, I was contacted by a resolutions specialist and informed that I owe a past due balance of $979.22, and I am expected to begin payments by April 1st, a whopping 5 days after I received this email, otherwise it would be escalated to a third party collections company, damaging my credit. 

I was totally stunned. What? No, I was under the impression that I didn't owe any money. I wracked my brain for any recollection of information and all I could remember were those vague details from that phone call 2 years ago, and thankfully my mom was able to inform me that yes, I in fact did make that phone call (on May 21, 2012) and confirmed what was told to me.

I asked my ""resolutions specialist"" who is literally the least helpful person ever, if she could look into my account to see if maybe there was a mistake, and she informed me that no, she would not be doing that. I had 5 days to begin payments or it goes to collections. Fuck you, good day. I spoke to another, much more polite gentleman and he confirmed that it was very strange that I was told I wouldn't be responsible for the remainder of the payments, and it was even stranger that I was never notified once I stopped payments. He had no explanation, only an apology and a confirmation that yes, I do in fact have this giant remaining balance to pay off before September 1st (when the school closes, as it was a bullshit institution and likely went under).

So I'm pissed.

Even if I assume that the woman on the phone misspoke that day, and I was in fact responsible for the remainder of the tuition payments (which honestly makes sense), why then, wasn't I notified when I missed 7th payment (as I'd already made 6 payments, stated above)?

Why not immediately notify me upon me being late for the first payment that I'd missed. How is it possible that no one called or emailed me for **two years**, however now I'm expected to jump and throw my money at this ""school"" because someone screwed up and I was never notified about it?

I've emailed my old instructor to see if she can shine any light on the situation, and so far all I have is the notes my mom has in her calendar and the possibility that the call was recorded. I spoke with my resolution specialist's supervisor and was told that she'd put in a request for the call recordings from the day I called, and the 1-2 days afterward.

Can any of you kind souls think of anything I can do to cover my arse here? I am going to try and see if I can get my own phone records from that day 2 years ago, and maybe I can find the time that I called, so I can give them that info and help them narrow their search down. 

In California, does this constitute a verbal contract? Even if I was still responsible, would the fact that this woman told me this negate that, and get me off the hook? The only proof of that would be the recording that they may never find. 

I'm currently back in school working on getting a degree so I can move up in the job world and I work very part time. I only bring home about 180 a paycheck, and I get paid weekly. Payments are $163, basically one full check each month. It's not a lot to someone who's better off but for me, this is a significant amount. I'd like to confirm whether I actually have to or not before I just lube up my behind and let them ream me for this crap **two years after it happened**. 

Any information or advice would be extremely appreciated, I'm at a total loss as to what to do. I have until the end of next month to make my first payment, or it goes to collections, so I at least have some time to investigate this. 

Thank you for reading this whole schpeil, I'm sorry it turned into a bit of a novel.

21m9zy,1,2014-03-28,Internship Interview Next Week - What should I know?,phpthrowaway23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21m9zy/internship_interview_next_week_what_should_i_know/,"I'm a 17 year old high school student. I got ballsy and decided to submit my resume to the biggest/most prolific IT firm in my city. Surprisingly, they called me in for an interview with the President.  I went in to interview for a position as an entry level network technician(what my resume was geared toward), but when he found out my interests lay in software development he told me that he would consider giving me an internship with his dev team. Didn't sound too promising, wasn't expecting a call back. But, almost immediately after I arrived home from the interview they called me to schedule another one with a technical recruiter(this was yesterday).

I know they do a lot of work with HTML/CSS(I'm fine with both), jQuery(also fine with it), PHP(Ok, but have a lot of gaps to fill in) and Drupal and Joomla. I'm planning on spending this weekend brushing up my knowledge of those technologies. I've gone back over PHP and HTML/CSS syntax, and I intend to do some JavaScript and jQuery today. I was also planning on getting at least somewhat familiar with Drupal and Joomla. My question is, what are some absolutely essential things I should include in a web dev crash course? I have until Wednesday, and I'm a fairly fast learner. What are the most essential topics I should be covering? What should I expect in my interview?

Sometimes I wonder if I should be active in student organizations and/or research. Is that stuff important to employers given what goals are? I'm not interested in sports clubs or what the school's CS club is doing, so it seems like a waste of time doing those.

21mr6m,0,2014-03-28,I think I might be terminated from my internship next week,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/21mr6m/i_think_i_might_be_terminated_from_my_internship/,"Let me describe the details to you of this situation in the most mundane detail.

I am of college age. I am interning in a not very glamorous department of a not very glamorous company. But it's work experience in a business field so I am relatively happy to be there.

I work with about two dozen people, but the woman who sat next to me when I first started (let's call her Karen) is kind of my minder. I have been there for six months, she has been there for 13. She is pretty good at what she does so they hired her as a full time employee. I consider her as my superior but I do not report to her. She has a bit of an attitude and has no qualms about speaking down to people, particularly me if she is aggravated.

I am not working today but they are doing some significant renovation over the weekend. My old cube is an area that was being demolished and Facilities asked that we leave our keys, unlock docking stations, etc. I always carry my key on a chain but neglected to leave them; anyway, all of the drawers that I normally use are left unlocked anyway.

Karen calls me asking where my keys are. I tell her that I have them but the drawer is unlocked. She bluntly tells me that I need to go to the office and leave them before 5pm. Mind you, it's 4pm and I live about an hour away in current traffic conditions. It's a 2 hour roundtrip and I tell her that, she simply says the exact same thing to me again: ""You need to bring your keys here before 5pm."" Granted, it's my fault. I should have left my keys there but didn't, and I was prepared to bring them if it was going to impede them from doing work. It just didn't make sense to me why it mattered if they had the key to an unlocked drawer - I just wanted to make sure they needed it before I spent 2 hours driving and $15 on gas on a day that I wasn't working. If they did need it, I would certainly bring it.

She was very rude in talking me and kept repeating the same thing to be verbatim. I asked her if she was sure that they needed it if the drawer was already unlocked. She didn't want to get clarification, she wanted me to drive there immediately to leave the keys.

I took this as her telling me what Facilities wanted. Facilities put out a blanket request and I wanted clarification before I went there. So I called Facilities and explained that I was out of the office but had the keys to an unlocked drawer. The guy there, who I know, told me, ""Oh yeah, no problem. Just drop it off whenever next week.""

I texted the girl that I spoke to *Jack* in Facilities, and that I could drop it off either tonight or on Monday. This apparently upset her. She texted me, *Who do you report to? Facilities or our department? We're having a meeting tomorrow at 9am so be in the office by then.* I text back, ""Ok."" An hour later she texts me, ""*Boss* asked that you come in at 8:30am."" I text her, ""Ok I'll be there.""

My boss is very nice and I honestly can't imagine him getting that outraged if he fully understood the situation. He is very laidback and I've never seen him yell or discipline anyone. Knowing her I think she is attempting to scare me, but I'm not scared. I feel like I acted professionally and politely despite the tone she was taking with me. 

For those of you who lasted this long into the story, am I in the wrong here? We have an employee who is also out of the office that lives an hour away. If I were to ask her to come in from her vacation to drop of keys, I just believe it would be common courtesy to make damn certain that she needed to be there. This woman would not extend the same courtesy to me, and I went through the appropriate channels to get clarification.

Anyway, I am looking forward to this meeting on Monday. I feel like I did nothing wrong but I realize that I am only an intern and she is a full time employee; obviously her words hold a little more weight than my own. "

21mwdu,3,2014-03-28,Double Major with Math? How about Computer Engineering? How does it affect getting a job? Weird Master's VS getting a job question also.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21mwdu/double_major_with_math_how_about_computer/,"This is my first question here so I will attempt to be thorough. I am usually considered a weird case when talking to other people because I came into college as a ""junior"" (60 hours). Basically I went to college during my Junior and Senior year in High School taking STEM related classes, and this has put me ahead of schedule in my CS degree. I got a full ride to my big state school, therefore I have four years to take classes (with each semester bringing money into me also). I am currently doing research, which has lead to bigger things, as I accepted an internship downtown which could potentially last until I graduate, if all goes well this summer. 

I found out recently that after starting in Fall '13, (meaning I get to tke classes until Spring '17) that I could easily finish a BS in CS after Fall '15 graduating then also. This is strictly just CS. CS and a Math major I could graduate in just one semester more, Spring '16. What I am trying to decide, is how useful/good looking a Math major is, and whether it is worth the trouble. I am decent at math, but I really love CS only. 

I have looked a little into Computer Engineering, and I could most likely make it fit easily along side CS, and was curious about how it would look and how useful it would be to me in the future. Currently, I don't really enjoy the hardware side, and I am afraid that the more advanced stuff may just completely turn me away from it.

Lastly, my school offers a program where you can take 12 extra hours and add then to grad school for CS. There are also two options for CS grad school, one being a Masters that takes 24 total hours, but a thesis is required, the other is 30 hours, but a project is required. Theoretically I could get a Master's by Fall '16 doing only CS and Spring '17 doing CS and Math, and it has been hinted that it could be paid for via fellowship, other funds, but there is no guarantee. So...

Would it be best to just get a BS in CS and try to find a job straight away? Perhaps a BS in CS and Math/CompEng then the job. Should I stay for as long as possible just to wring out the amount of money and experience I could earn (getting paid by the internship, research if I do it, various scholarships a semester, and gaining the internship experience along with research)?

At a minimum I will major in CS and minor in Math, but other than that I have lost passion for Math, and Computer Engineering does not interest me. However, I could push through the pains and do one or the other, especially if it will be helpful later on in life, whether it is in doing work or getting a job. I can't really think of much else to ask or say, but I will answer questions asked if I need to. Thanks for any help!

**TLDR:**

Came in with 60 hours, have til **Spring '17 to graduate**. Potentially could graduate with/when:

* BS in CS Major, Math Minor / Fall '15
* BS in CS Major, Math Major / Spring '16
* MS CS along with point 1 / Fall '16
* MS CS along with point 2 / Spring '17

Get the MS? Get a job? Double Major and take the pain?

I'm a fourth year graduating in June with a B.A. in Psychology and minor in computer science from a top university. I started the minor sequence last year. Right now, I'm having difficulties finding any internships / job prospects after graduation. I live in Chicago if that helps. 


Skills:
1. Pretty good with C : bit manipulation, memory management, creating data structures, networking  
 
2. Worked with MIPs / x86 assembly for classes: translating to/from C, and small optimizations for architecture  

3. Learning some full stack web dev for my current job: Really light javascript / html / css front end and python backend  

4. Learning python / java for personal projects I plan on starting soon.    



Questions:
How *difficult* is it to find a job in my position?  
 
What should I be doing to increase my job prospects in the short term?  

Could I do anything now that will greatly increase my chances of finding a job in ~6 months?

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I am writing to inquire about any possible internship positions available this summer. I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at [redacted] in [redacted], but it looks like I'll be home in [redacted] this summer.
&gt;
&gt;I'm currently a first time in college freshman, though I have over 80 semester hours thanks to accelerated credit. For particular details on my academic history as well as relevant skills, you can find my resume attached and also at http://[redacted]/resume.pdf.
&gt;
&gt;I appreciate your time and hope to hear back soon!
  
  

Him:
&gt;Hi Andrew – if you have a clean driving record, no criminal record and can pass a pre-employment drug screen you are welcome to work with us for the summer.  We are a geotechnical engineering, environmental consulting, materials testing and inspection firm, so not much that we do may interest you as it relates to your current studies and life goals. But working with an engineering firm will certainly look better on your resume than the typical student summer jobs.  So in summary, if you are hardworking, don’t mind getting dirty, working on construction sites and being in general a “helper” to my current staff we can certainly accommodate your request.  Compensation is on the order of $8/hour for as many hours as you are willing to work (when we need you, but we stay pretty darn busy all the time).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your interest in our company.

Me:
&gt;That sounds great!
&gt;
&gt;I noticed in your signature you list locations besides [redacted], and after following up I see that indeed you are a listed contact for multiple locations on the [redacted] website. Just to clarify, I am seeking work in [redacted]. I noticed you copied in a few other people, and some googleing around seems to indicate they are based in [redacted], so I'm pretty sure I was understood correctly. Still, it can't hurt to double check.
&gt;
&gt;You are certainly right about the discrepancies between my field of study and the work that your firm does, but I'm generally interested in anything and everything technical. In fact I'm currently a candidate for a short term research gig here at [redacted] involving materials testing in conjunction with the Air Force! Plus, I'm not sure my duties as a first year student would be much different for your firm than at an electrical engineering firm, and it seems as if all the EE work in the [redacted] area is defense contracting with little interest in a first year student with no security clearance. In any case, I'd much rather work with technical professionals outside my prospective field than work another summer in food or retail.
&gt;
&gt;All this is to say I would be more than happy to work for [redacted] this summer, and the job description you provided is more or less what I envisioned it being (I have no fear of sweat, dirt, or fetching coffee).
&gt;
&gt;Should I continue to correspond with you about the specifics (such as start date) or should I contact someone at the [redacted] branch directly?
&gt;
&gt;Best regards,  
&gt;Andrew [redacted]
  
  
Him:
&gt;Good evening Andrew,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The fact that you did the research you did tells me all I need to know.  Please work with Ashlee [redacted] (copied herein) to get through your pre-employment process.  Once all that is done (usually takes about a week) get back with me and provide the date you’re available to start.  I imagine we’ll assign you to split time between Kevin [redacted] &amp; Richard [redacted] for the summer so as to expose you to a little bit of everything we do locally.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ashlee – Please get with Andrew directly and let me know when he has the background process complete.

&gt;William ""Will"" [redacted]
  
  
Me:
&gt;One last question before you go, Will, and I'm not entirely sure if it should be directed at you or at Ashlee: would my compensation ""on the order of $8/hr"" be at all negotiable? Based on my compensation at my last summer job, the substantial college credit I have accumulated, and my current skill set I think something closer to $10/hr would be commensurate. I truly hope this doesn't come off as rude or inappropriate, but one thing I know for certain is if I don't ask I'll never know.
&gt;
&gt;Best regards,
&gt;Andrew [redacted]
  
  
Him:
&gt;No doubt about it…If you don’t ask, it is a for certain NO, right?  I’ll do $9/hour, but not a penny more.  I don’t really NEED the help, because I like my folks to work hard and take care of their business.  You are going to be a luxury item for them.  I’m sure you are capable of being worth much more than that, but that is what I will do.  I usually allow for one summertime utility helper/staff assistant/intern and you have impressed me the most by far with your approach and diligence so it is your slot if you want it.  If not, I have a 50 others bugging the crap out of me wanting to do the same thing.  Just let me know what you want to do so I can get with Ashlee and stop the pre-employment process before it begins.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;William ""Will"" [redacted]
  
  
Me:
&gt;$9/hr is great, and yes, I absolutely want the slot. Thank you so much, and I'll make sure to get in touch again once the pre-employment process is complete. I'm glad to have impressed you, and I wont let you down.
&gt;

I'm a current Pharm.D. student in the United States, and I want to live in Australia long term after graduation (I may work a few years here after graduation if I go this route because pharmacists here are paid about double, and I'm going to have about ~150,000 in debt after graduation).  I have also applied and been accepted into the University of Queensland Ochsner program in Brisbane for medical school.  To be honest I can see myself being either a primary care physician or pharmacist, as long as I can live comfortably in Australia.

Normally going to UQ-Ochsner would be an obvious choice, but the program is only open to Americans, and does not allow students to do their internships in Australia.  Australia has a very big shortage of intern spots, and foreign students are last in the pecking order regardless of merit for those spots, and with the intern shortage as volatile as it is I have been severely cautioned about applying to Aussie medical schools because there is simply nothing out there for foreign graduates of those schools within Australia.  So If I ended up choosing that program I would move down there for 2 years, do residency in the States and have to get licensed in the United States afterwards, then after registration here I'd have to get licensed in Australia.  Either way I'd have to get licensed in Australia as either a pharmacist or physician.

To get licensed as a pharmacist I'd have to sit for a short test and then do 1000 hours of supervised practice.  This is easily doable, but the only problem is ""pharmacist"" has just this year been removed from Australia's ""skilled occupation list"" which is easier to get a visa for.  So my options as a pharmacist would require an employer sponsor.  A quick search online doesn't seem like it would be a HUGE issue to do that, but it's still a risk.

Licensing as a physician would require me to jump more hurdles (I won't get into the specifics but it would require both national and state licenses, as well as a written test followed by an internship which isn't easy to get for foreign people...see above).  But pretty much every kind of physician IS on the list of needed skilled occupations for Australia.  So that's the pro for that route.

Another issue with going the medical school route is that the debt would be MUCH higher.  If I stuck with pharmacy I would graduate with ~150,000 in debt, maybe up to about 10,000 less.  If I went to UQ I would graduate with between 400 and 500,000 dollars in debt.  The only saving grace to that would be that doctors make roughly 50,000 to 75000 more in the States, an a LOT more (90,000 or so AUD) per year more in Australia.

By my conservative calculations I would be realistically able to pay off my loans and save up to buy a new apartment in Australia about 7 years after graduation from the Pharm D program (apartments can go for as low as 300,000) if I lived extremely scantily, so I feel like that would get me there in a more expedited fashion, and it's more feasible in the long run.  I'd still need an employee sponsor, and with one I could get a pre-owned house for a little cheaper (Australia doesn't let foreigners buy pre-owned apartments or houses).

My question is essentially what would more realistically lead me to living in Australia long term, and hopefully lead to permanent residency?

Thanks to those who made it through my novel; if I'm unclear about anything please let me know."

 *Cons:* High throughput = high stress

*2. IT internship at USAA, potential hire at the end. 

 *Pros:* top 17 companies to work for in US, #1 IT company to work for. Awesome environment.

 *Cons:* Only an internship at the moment, potential job offer at end.

This is my first real ""jobs"" and I was wondering what to look for when choosing a company? What is most important in the long run?

Any advice is appreciated!


Just wanted to update you guys. Thank you for everyone's help. I ended up taking the USAA internship. Absolutely loved it. Did well and got a job offer! It is a fantastic company with strong character and they really do live their mission... serving the military community. Proud to be a USAA employee."

The other day I get an email from a company I applied for that I didn't realize was a full time Java position. After speaking with the employer he agreed he liked my resume and wanted to give me a technical interview. If I get the position we'd work out a work/class schedule in the fall. 

Getting to the point, I feel way over my head. I could easily pass fizz buzz, I feel fairly confident I could whiteboard a linked list and BST, and I'm fairly competent in big O notation. However, doing anything besides the basics without a computer is way out of my grasp. I don't like coding on paper at all, I've used a CVS before but certainly couldn't answer any questions on it, and I don't have the intricacies of the language memorized. 

If you managed to read all this I appreciate it. Any advice? Am I in way over my head?"
21odlr,1,2014-03-29,Need input on internship situation for this summer.,ArrestedDeveloper14,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21odlr/need_input_on_internship_situation_for_this_summer/,"To start, I am a computer science major at a small private liberal arts school in the Midwest. I applied to quite a few software development internships and made it to the technical interview with IBM Extreme Blue, Garmin, the Computer Science Intern Program with NSA, and a larger company in Omaha, NE called Farm Credit Services of America. I was turned down by IBM and Garmin and was offered the job in Omaha, and received a conditional offer from the NSA (if I am approved for security clearance). However, at the time I was offered the job in Omaha back in January I had nothing else on the table and didn't think I would get any other offers at that point so I accepted the position. The NSA then sent me the conditional offer at the beginning of February and flew me out to D.C. to do security clearance processing last week. I decided to go just for the experience and see if I would even make it past that stage. It however did not go very well and I failed two polygraph tests. All of the other interviews went well, but as I'm sure you know the polygraph is essential to working there and is the only thing holding me back from this position. They want to fly me out again in 2 weeks to do one last re-test however the day they have available doesn't work with my schedule at all. At this point I don't even know if I should keep going back for Polygraph tests if I can't figure out why I was so nervous on the first two, in addition to the fact that the only reason I'd intern with the NSA is for name recognition. I would also feel somewhat dishonorable if I reneged on the offer in Omaha. After looking at my options I was then thinking of reasons for Omaha and the NSA.

Reasons for Omaha: More friends interning in Omaha over summer with me and I really enjoyed living there last summer, more software engineering/agile development oriented working with a team of devs, C#, cheaper cost of living, and I think I would be happier there. 

Reasons for NSA: New experience in D.C. and name recognition of NSA

Along with that, based on what the NSA told me, their internship is a more a solo research oriented internship and I would rather get more experience with software engineering and agile and would like to work with a team of devs as well.

Obviously, there appears to be more pros to Omaha and most of my friends and family are telling me I would be happier there (a few friends want me to go to the NSA cause they think it would be good on my resume), but I wanted to get the opinion of Computer Science professionals who have more insight in this area. 

So, do you think it would be more beneficial to simply stick with the internship I have already accepted in Omaha or try and get the NSA internship? Is the NSA reputable in the CS world and worth it to renege on this other position? Will this drastically affect my job search after I graduate? Am I over thinking all of this?  

I apologize for the wall of text."

It happened when I was a teenager and I was finally released last year. I've learned a great deal over those years and I've finally matured as an adult. I'm trying to do everything I can to get my life in order and school is my biggest priority currently.

Initially, I was refused admission into a larger state school but after getting enough credits from community college, I was finally admitted. I am excelling in all subjects (math, computer science major) and can comfortably say I'm near the top of my class. I've seen many of my classmates land very lucrative internships but I've been reluctant to even try. 

I'm considering just staying in school, perhaps going into academia. I feel like I have no chance of getting hired at any company. Perhaps, I incorrectly assume that schools would admit me as a graduate student, but I feel that my chances are at least better. I intend on getting involved in undergraduate research as soon as I finish more core classes.

Has anyone any knowledge of someone in a situation like mine, or have any advice for me? "

I'll have an interview for an IT internship with a large tech company in a few weeks. The qualifications listed on the ad were very general, and only indicated that I needed to have basic knowledge of the different OS's, be fairly computer literate, and be a college student in good academic standing.

But according to the posts on Glassdoor, the interview questions seem to be pretty in-depth. Questions were on DHCP, DNS, IP stack, boot processes, BIOS, and the like.

Most of the courses I've taken in school have revolved around nuts-and-bolts programming, and not networking and such. I might not be qualified for the internship after all. What are some good resources for me to use for studying up on this kind of stuff? Do you have any other tips? Thanks."
21oxn9,2,2014-03-29,Masters Information Security,serefemme,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/21oxn9/masters_information_security/,"I had a very unsatisfactory undergraduate career performance. I struggled with substance abuse and pretty severe depression through and ended up with a 2.2. I worked my tail off to get it to that from a 1.3. That final year of school I got a job working as a student for the school help desk. That was for a solid year until graduation the next May. Ended up with a BA English, thinking that I might be able to get a desk job. After graduation with that degree, I was unable to find any sort of work except for slinging pizzas at Papa Johns, so I returned to school. I started out at a local private school with a special discount for adult students, but didn't do so awesome there. I had an experience outside my control happen that year and the PTSD from that (as well as substance abuse) led to me ""checking out,"" so to speak. I left that school, moved home to my parents', and I transferred to a local community college and earned a degree in Web Technologies, earning Honor/Dean/President lists almost every semester I was there. Mostly 3.5-4.0 semesters. I took full-loads (20+ hours), too, focusing in the programming aspect of web design. This was where I got my first taste of information security (required class).  

After that degree, I tried to take some classes at my original school, thinking that I would get my GPA up some. The primary reason for returning to this university was to take a full-time student job with the IT department at my university. Getting past the tuition, I was still getting more pay, hours and experience there than I was at my job at Papa Johns. I also gained some pretty awesome experience helping with campus computer migrations working for the department overseeing that process. Consider that job Project Management 101.  

First semester back, I bit off more than I could chew, taking calculus during a 5-week summer session. While I was earning a steady B average all semester in homework, I completely failed the final (I choked. Test anxiety, mind completely empty), so I turned in a very empty test and dropped that class immediately after that, getting a WF. This was very depressing for me, but I reasoned that WF would look less horrible than an F. The next year and a half I took an assortment of classes, including the first course in computer science (Java), and Information Systems classes (including information security). Any ISOM class I've taken I've earned an A. There are a couple of accounting and economics classes in there with C/B averages. The last semester there I earned a B in my international business class.  

Also during this time, I was working full-time for both the Command Center. Eventually, I transferred to the help desk after the project ended, eventually taking on a 2nd student gig at the university the final semester. That job involved helping the web design group with migrating departmental websites to the new look and feel, while maintaining the integrity of their original designs.  

Left school/student jobs, took a jr. developer job that turned out to be a sham (he stopped paying his employees, other shady things). Unemployed for 2 months. Job at a famous cable company doing tech support, until finally offered a full-time position with the help desk I'd worked at as a student. Been there ever since.  

Through my job, I get some free classes. Last summer, I made another attempt to take calculus, online through a harder engineering school in state, while sitting tests with a proctor at my school. That class ended in failure, too. Did fine on homework, studied my butt off, but couldn't get past my test anxiety on tests. I'm really disappointed about that and unsure if I should try to take one last time, through there or through my local university, but something needs to change with my test anxiety before even considering that waste of time/money again.  

Last semester, I took two graduate level courses at my local university in information technology. I currently have a graduate GPA of a 4.0.  

----  
So for the TL;DR crowd, I have a decent amount of work experience in IT, including experience in support, web applications, and migrations. For the most part, my undergraduate experience was somehow achieved, but barely. I was extremely immature to go to school when I did, all emotionally, psychologically. I drowned and didn't ask for help. It shows.  

Community college degree with 3.3 overall, 3.8 in major. I had gone to that CC before transferring to university 1 long ago, naturally not doing great as a kid. The last 2 years there were pretty solid though, including B's in math and programming courses.  

While my school experience hasn't been perfect since that degree, I feel that I've done pretty well maintaining some level of achievement despite working full-time as well. In the last 3-4 years, I've done a LOT of growing up and really just want to make things better enough to maybe stand a chance of pursuing information security as a career. I'm a teetotaler now and have a strong track-record in my workplace. I've expressed interest (several times over the last 4 years) in this field to a peer in the security group at my university, but I feel that I need some sort of formal education. My head is in a much better place. I figure a higher education experience might provide more delights than simply getting certifications, as college provides the opportunities for research and maybe even internships, to translate into the much coveted experience needed to get security jobs these days. I have shown a strong track-record that I can succeed in Information Systems, as well as at the graduate level.  

Assuming I can get a slam-dunk on the GRE, do you all think I stand a chance at getting into a reputable program anywhere, or is this just a pipe dream at this point? Any pointers, tips, things I should try to make myself look more pleasing on paper? I consider myself very intelligent, I've just kind of failed at life for a while, which unfortunately affected my academic career, too. "
21pcvt,10,2014-03-29,Oh shit...,[deleted],buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/21pcvt/oh_shit/,"After years of shitty computers, I've been oogling and dreaming using PCParts picker, Mythlogic, and many other computer websites to dream up wacky builds. And for years I've resisted.

I don't know why but today I just splurged. A 420 dollar splurge. I randomly was looking at my PCParts picker build like usual; just dreaming. But this time, I bought it. I don't know if it's a good think or bad since I'm sort of excited and think it's a long time coming but when I think of the money I just spend I get nervous. I just wanted to share with you this moment since it's partly your fault. All these darn posts! Anyways, thank you. I probably wouldn't have done it without you. Also Linus from Linustechtips who I've been a long time fan.

I think part of the reason I bough it is I'm in college and have an interview for an internship; I guess I'm rewarding myself. Normal people would reward themselves once they got the internship which is what I planned on. I'm justifying the early buy because I never ever ever saw myself in a position where I would be interviewed by a VP of tax at a multi-billion dollar company; I nearly flunked out of high school and never believed in myself. So after years of saving, I think I deserve a little something.

21plux,11,2014-03-29,I'm a college senior who doesn't know what he's going to do when he graduates and is feeling kind of depressed.,ofom,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/21plux/im_a_college_senior_who_doesnt_know_what_hes/,"So basically, I'm making this post because I feel like I am in an odd place right now and I really want some people to hear me out.  

I'm a senior in college and a biology major.

**1)** I don't know what I'm doing in a month when this semester ends.  I can't graduate because I need two more classes but I don't know whether to take classes over the summer or apply for another semester.  If I did apply for another semester, I don't know what I would do over the summer.  Last summer, I applied to ten places in my hometown and I literally *could not* find work.

**2)** Also, I'm worried about finding a job.  I have a 3.0 GPA and I have had an internship but I don't know if that is good enough.

**3)**  I'm having trouble with work ethic.  When I was a freshman, I once studied 40+ hours in one week for a test in freshman biology, which I aced.  But between then and now, a lot of things happened.  I had this huge extential crisis with religion which really shook me up.  I don't want to go into details but let's just say I thought a lot about suicide sophmore year.  I've never really been the same since then.  

For example, I spend at least a few hours procrastinating every day, mostly on reddit.  But even when I'm not on reddit or the internet, I just can't seem to sit down and focus.  Last week, I had a test in a class, I basically had to set aside a week for it.  I probably studied about 10 hours for it but spent 2x-3x as much time procrastinating.  I got an 82, which seems OK but given the amount of time I set aside to study for it and actual difficulty of the test, I think this is inexcusable.

**4)** I've also been procrastinating in applying for internships, which, as ridiculous as it sounds, is one reason why I don't know what I'm doing in a month.

**5)**  I have a horrible sleep schedule, I literally stay up till 3 or 4 every night.  I'll be on the computer or doing homework.  I can't seem to go to sleep at normal hours anymore.  As you can imagine, I'm tired during the day.

**6)**  All of this was far worse Sophmore and Junior year.  I got Ds in multiple classes.  I still feel so haunted by that.  I was a conscientious student when I went to college, I felt like I had a future and my life had meaning.  Looking back, I feel like I turned my back on everything I believed in and valued.  I think about my grades, all the opportunities I missed, the money my parents spent on college.  I'll never get it back and I know it and I just feel so disappointed and disgusted in myself.

**7)**  I'm not even sure I want to be in the sciences any more.  I wanted to get into research which is why I majored in biology.  Since then, I've had an internship and more lab classes and I have realized that I suck at lab work.  I'm careless, conceptually I have a difficult time understanding the experiments and nothing I do in lab seems to work.  I'm bad compared to my classmates and I know it.  

Really, the only reason I have a 3.0 is because I took a ton of poli sci and philosophy courses each year and I did very well in those.  In biology, I have a few B minuses, Cs, and Ds.  My major GPA is certaintly much lower than a 3.0.  And this is cause for more guilt, my resume looks OK on paper but none of my supposed achievements are as great as they look and I can't help but think about that every time I think about applying for a job.  

I don't know where I'm going, I'm undermotivated, and I feel overwhelmed and defeated.  And I feel like I have no time to figure myself out.  I could use some advice, perspective, encouragement, something thrown at me, ect.  

Any takers?"

I'm a second year highschool student from Estonia and I have a few questions about summer internships. I consider myself a fairly good programmer (at least for my age), for example I was placed 5th in a national programming competition for highschool students. I've also had a chance to attend a algorithms and data structures lecture at my local university, which gave me a big boost in confidence, as I already know most of what was told in the lecture.

Now, I'm looking for an internship for summer. I'm mainly interested in writing Java. I'm mostly interested in gaining experience, but I'd also like the chance to make some money doing that.

I've selected a few companies I have in mind (some of which are very well known, like Skype or ZeroTurnAround). My current idea is basicly send each of the companies an email, which would go something like  ""Hey, I'm this-and-that, can you offer me an internship"" and include my resume. I also have the problem of not having much to include in my resume (a few webdev jobs for relatives and one with trying to understand unknown binary format).

When I switched positions my salary did not increase. I had been self-teaching myself (taking data structures, algorithms, and various other online courses) and just wanted to make the transition to SW asap so I didn't complain. When I accepted the transfer I assumed my salary would increase by a few thousand at least, but the director of my group said ""I can't do that right now"".

Now that I've been at the position awhile and got up to speed very quickly, I'm starting to get very unhappy with low salary I'm making. I make in the low 50s. 

I have received many compliments from my fellow engineers. A few weeks ago, one of the senior sw engineers said to me ""You are going to be a director one day.""

I'm currently working with C# for Windows CE on a project that is pushing boundaries at the company. It's an exciting project and I kind want to see it to the ""end"" which will be the end of 2014, but I don't know if I can 'make' it that long making such a horrible salary. I graduated with a 3.8 gpa in electrical engineering and thought I'd be making at least $70k my first year out.... And no I'm not socially inept, I didn't have any internship experience.

I have been with the company for almost 2 years BTW.

My question is what should I do?

1. Wait till the yearly review, and ask for a much higher salary. I will not be happy with less than $65k, and I have a feeling they will try give me the typical 3-4% they usually give...

2. Start applying for a new job now

3. Ask for a raise now

4. Stop being a bitch and be happy I have a job. Keep in mind, I actually enjoy going to work."

[Now, that's interesting.  However, when you summarize the results, you don't say ""now we know that people who describe themselves as creative are more willing to cheat and lie"".  Instead, you say ""now we know that people who are creative are more willing to cheat and lie"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft93j?context=5)|Best.
[I guess none of that was a question, so I guess my question is: What do you have to say about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft93j?context=5)|This is my first day in Reddit -- so I am not sure how this works, so ia m sorry if I am posting this twice.
[Anyway, once again, I enjoyed the book, generally speaking.  Thanks for writing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft93j?context=5)|Sorry if this was not clear. In one experiment we measured creativity with the standard scales for creativity. In another experiment we mandated creativity -- which means that we primed people in a way that make them more creative for a few min and we measured their dishonesty during that time. In yet another experiment we measured the type of job that people had and the creativity requirements of that job. So -- non of these experiments is perfect, and it is hard to measure dishonesty, but across all the experiments the pattern is the same and I feel confidence in the results. I hope this is more clear now. Best Dan.
[What is the most common irrational human act that you come across? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfud1z?context=5)|Having kids.
[If you had the opportunity to ask the government to change or institute a public policy based on your research, and they had to comply, what would you ask for?  What would do the most for social welfare?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft9wl?context=5)|I would make taxes simple and more equitable. I also think that the complexity of the tax system makes it hard for people to remember what taxes are for, and not just see taxes as an adversarial relationship with the government.
[You have the most painfully awkward jokes in your coursera lecture videos.  What's your comedic inspiration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfu0k4?context=5)|I'm terribly hurt by this. My kids think I'm hilarious.
[What was the one thing that surprised you the most in your studies? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft25w?context=5)|The ability of people to rationalize. In one study, we gave people a chance to cheat -- which they took, and very quickly afterwards, they believed their own lies. 
[What has been your favorite social experiment to try on a college campus and which experiment has changed your opinion on a certain topic the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftg76?context=5)|Probably the vaccination experiment -- they took a group of students and gave half of them information about the importance of vaccination, but also gave the other half directions to the health center and asked them to indicate a time in their calendars that they would show up. Amazingly, the information did very little but the map and schedule was very effective at getting people to show up and get vaccinated. For me, this is an important building block -- providing people with information is not very useful, and we need to change the environment to facilitate better decision-making.
[I am a professional at procrastinating. Any tips on how to make sure I'm productive when I'm studying? Is procrastination in any way good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft9h8?context=5)|Yes, I have written an article on this topic: [Link to www.linkedin.com](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140121115438-23667182-productivity-hacks-setting-priorities-straight)
 |More seriously -- the right approach is to create strong habits, eliminate temptation, and build an environment that would reduce your ability to act on your temptations.  
[Knowing what you know about irrational behavior, do you still find yourself behaving irrationally (in some context\) despite your better instincts/judgement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftf1p?context=5)|Often.
[Do your studies about dishonesty make it hard for you to trust people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft2e6?context=5)|More generally, my studies on irrational behavior make me worry about people. In terms of dishonesty, I don't think I worry more than others. But now that you've pointed this out, maybe I should be concerned that people think I am more dishonest because I study dishonesty!
[Hey Dan, do you believe people are selfish rather than altruistic? (not sure how to ask this as not to suggest an answer\).  Is it meaningful to ask this question and to what extent do you believe this has to do with the threat of punishment rather than trying to act in accordance with moral principle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftneb?context=5)|I believe that people are deeply altruistic, and selfishness comes later. One piece of evidence for this is that we have some data showing that when people are drunk, they react more extremely to injustice -- even at a cost to themselves.
[What is the best marketing strategy you ever seen? The cleverest one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfu07b?context=5)|There's a company that sends a very large letter. Not just kind of big, but HUGE. It's so out of the ordinary that people are much more likely to open it rather than toss it into their pile of spam letters.
[Hey Dan, what other topics are you interested in studying beyond of dishonesty and irrationality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftbn5?context=5)|Right now we have a new study on bribery, we are also looking at how physicians break bad news to patients, we are trying to get poor people in Kenya to save a bit of money for rainy days, and if I tell you the rest I might have to kill you.
[Are you going to lie in this thread?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft72t?context=5)|Not sure yet. I'm new to reddit.
[What would happen if the whole world behaved rationally? What would have existed that we dont have today?  Please, please, please answer and make my day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfthyl?context=5)|I would hate to live in this world. A world without irrationality would have no help, altruism, caring, love. Count me out.
[Not to any public personalities on the spot, but there is a slew of self-help books/speakers/retreats - in other words, a multi-billion dollar industry out there that operates on making people believe that they can profoundly change themselves. In my own case, personal shortcomings like procrastination for example, how likely is it that someone in her 50s can still successfully tackle these types of personal problems? In other words, is the self-help industry a hoax? Is is irrational to expect change on a deep level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftwin?context=5)|There is clearly a demand for self-help, and it is a very interesting industry. To look into this, I went to a 3-day event with Tony Robbins and one with the Landmark Forum. In each, there was some grain of scientific evidence but they were building giant castles from these grains of sand. I also saw lots of pain in these meetings, and people who were dealing with very complex problems. And it upsets me that these organizations are selling them the ""answers"" at such a high cost.
[Some people tend to have an imaginary world where they escape that sometimes makes them completely uninterested in their own lives (see how popular TV &amp; movies world is\). Is this behavior considered socially acceptable or have there been some studies regarding the general profile of an individual that has this sort of inner fantasy world? Is this how humans lie to their conscience to cope better with day to day life or is it just a form of the Peter Pan syndrome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft82i?context=5)|I would not give up my own fantasy world.
[Dan, Enjoying taking your coursera course! What, in your opinion are some of the best applications of behavioral economics to health and supporting people making changes around their health? thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftg1o?context=5)|Preventative care is all about people doing the right thing way in advance, before the medical system can catch what's going on. This is the place where behavioral interventions are most likely to have the highest impact.
[Hi Dan. Do you think it's ok for parents lie to their kids about the existence of Santa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftel1?context=5)|Santa, no, but God, absolutely.
 |As a parent to two young kids, I'm also debating whether to tell them that after 12 years of elementary education, there's also four more years of college and even more years of grad school. So far I've avoided pointing this out to them.
[Hi Dan, big fan of your books and courses.  Here are my questions: 1\) Do you know that in the gaming industry your book is the handbook regarding microtransaction (""free to play""\) monetization models?  2\) ... and how do you feel about that?  Edit: I am speaking about Predictably Irrational!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftsiu?context=5)|I did not know about this, and because I am not familiar with the handbook, I'm also not sure how I feel about it.
[Which conclusion(s\) from your studies do you find people have the most difficult time accepting?  (also thanks so much for your books – they've literally changed my life\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftyql?context=5)|That they too might be irrational. I think that people have an easy time seeing others as irrational, but have a very hard time accepting that they would make the same mistakes.
[Dan, have you heard about the phrase ""Don't ask what you dont want to know the answer to"", how can we explain the sudden urge we feel about knowing everything and then feeling bad because of having ""asked""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftdjq?context=5)|Some time ago I had a friend who smelled very badly. And every time we were together, I promised myself not to breathe from my nose. But every time I failed. I was so tempted that I would take a small whiff and it was awful every time, no surprise. What am I trying to say? Sometimes curiosity is too strong and we do things to calm our curiosity that are not necessarily in our long-term interest.
[Hey Dan, on your experiment on sexual arousal and decision making, you gave your test subjects laptops in order to get sexually aroused. So my questions are, naturally- in what condition did you get the laptops back What did you do with them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft9fj?context=5)|We thought about this in advance and covered them in saran wrap before giving them to participants. I should point out that it was still a bit difficult to work on these laptops knowing their history..
[Can animals or other living creatures lie too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfuc7u?context=5)|Yes they can and they do -- only in different ways from us.  They are actually more rational, and they don't feel any guilt.  
[Hi Dan, Im wondering what you think of a lot of these referral based programs online.  Since they reward people monetarily for sharing/referring friends, do you think the monetary incentive takes away from the the intrinsic motivation to share/refer someone to a product or service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftrng?context=5)|For sure these programs are anti-social and I think they are likely to hurt relationships.  
[Do you hire interns to work with you in your research? If yes, what is the best way to approach you? What qualities do you look for before hiring the intern? Do you accept undergraduate students as well? What about students not having major in Psychology or Economics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftym8?context=5)|Yes, I will have an internship this summer: [Link to advanced-hindsight.com](http://advanced-hindsight.com/about/research-opportunities/)
[Dan, you are a tremendous inspiration to me and was one of the people that got me interested in economics. Any future book plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftmte?context=5)|I do have a movie coming out...

[What do you love the most about being at Duke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftd3k?context=5)|The relationships with different departments are very open, and I get to interact a lot with people in other departments -- Duke is an incredibly interdisciplinary place and allows for a lot of conversation between disciplines.
[Why are lies, myths and conspiracy theories so persistent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftq2l?context=5)|The conspiracy theories, at least, must be true.
[How do you think the world cup in Brazil is going to turn out? People here are pretty concern it will be the worst organized event ever in all time! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftg1g?context=5)|Just on Friday, someone offered me tickets to the world cup. And I happily took them! So I'm looking forward to examining the chaos firsthand. I've been to Brazil many times, and I mostly worry about the transportation -- but given that nothing will probably start on time and the relaxed approach that Brazilians have to schedules, it will certainly be an interesting experience.
[If man are, as you said, superb creatures are rationalizing our own irrational behaviors, then where do you think we stand on topic of morality?  Are we then moral creatures who have occasional lapses or immoral creatures with an occasional shimmer of brilliance? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftljb?context=5)|We are often moral. And in fact we lie much less than economic theory would predict.
[Hi Dan, I'm currently taking your Beginner's Guide to Irrational Behavior MOOC on Coursera. I have a couple of questions about it. 1. What has been your biggest surprise based on your MOOC experiences? 2. Have you used any of the data you collect from the MOOC in any of your papers or articles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft7k0?context=5)|We haven't used the data in any papers yet, but we are doing a few studies and we will see. In terms of what has surprised me the most, I'd say it has been the incredible feeling of an international community with the students. 
[Does the irrationality of the human mind undermine the argument for democracy? If the public is irrational, easily manipulated and can't accept the future benefits of current sacrifice, then should they be in charge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft7ox?context=5)|I think it definitely shows some of the problems with democracy and some of the needs for regulation. I'm hopeful that people could make reasonable decisions from time to time when given the right structure. On top of that, if we have people who are experts they might (sometimes) be in a better position to make better decisions for the rest of us. So I believe in representative democracy that is based on professional and scientific examination of evidence, and using this evidence to make policy decisions.
[It seems as if your class at times encourages cheating, or rationalized. What would you do if you caught a student cheating in your class?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftg8t?context=5)|No way!! The punishment for cheating would probably be some form of public acknowledgement such as standing in front of the class and asking the class for forgiveness. This might be followed up with their favorite a cappella Barry Manilow tune.
[Have you ever thought of setting up a perfectly designed company or city which accommodates human nature while shooting for the optimal outcomes? I think that you could easily get a book out of it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftb2k?context=5)|I've thought about it, but I'm not sure who would want to put me in charge...
[Is it true that people who like big butts can not lie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgfzwnd?context=5)|Obviously, this was one of the first questions we tested -- and the answer is no!.  They can lie.   
[So what happened to your cookbook?  Big fan by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftaum?context=5)|Working on it! I need a few months with no new projects, but sadly life is interesting, many projects are exciting, and I have a hard time saying no.
[How did you figure out, why we lie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgft8oz?context=5)|Experiments!
[Also, do you think MOOCs will disrupt higher education? If so, what are the implications for higher ed administrators to either embrace or evolve to accommodate MOOCs - or put simply, what should universities be doing now that MOOCs are becoming more mainstream (and seem to be on a path to continue to do so\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/21ri9r/im_social_scientist_and_author_dan_ariely_i_study/cgftqp9?context=5)|I think there will always be a place for higher education. It will evolve, of course, and universities and professors have to figure out how to deal with the complexities that MOOCs bring. I do worry that for the sake of cheaper education we will get more homogenous, less nuanced, less thoughtful education.

21smbh,9,2014-03-30,Home Automation,Sappin,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/21smbh/home_automation/,"Hey guys, so I've been desperately applying for co-ops for a while now and I found out my school has a program for students who have a difficult time finding their first internship.  The basic idea behind the program is a team of 3 students get together, come up with an idea for a start-up and start working on it.  This program isn't limited to just engineers.  I'm finishing my third year of classes and I'm considering trying this program out.  I enjoy working with embedded systems and feel confident in my basic EE skills (circuit analysis, math, all that jazz).

The purpose of this post is to ask if anyone here could provide me with some more insight into the home automation ""industry"" (quotes because I'm not sure if industry is the right word here).  I'm very interested in this for two reasons: 

1) being able to control various things in your home in an easy and convienent way just seems like it would be fun to develop because it gives me a little creative flexibility (as opposed to getting a co-op somewhere and not being in control of what I am making or testing or whatever).

2) As I said, I enjoy working with embedded systems.  I like getting different electronics to work together and home automation seems like it would be a lot of that.

Would proposing a start-up in this area be a smart idea? Would doing this as opposed to finding a co-op be a bad idea?  What companies should I look at for guidance?  Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated :)"
21spez,15,2014-03-30,Unsure of my next step towards a career in Software Development.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21spez/unsure_of_my_next_step_towards_a_career_in/,"Evening all,

(Some background)

I went to school that has a semi bad reputation (Tech School) and got a degree in Networking even through I wanted one in Software Development. It was okay, graduated with good grades and a big debt. I even worked part time in tech service while I went there to build up some job experience.


Well, fast forward 6 months after graduation, in eternal limbo with a online school and no luck, student debt dues needing to be collected by money or blood.


I've searched around locally for jobs involving 'Junior' or hell, even unpaid Internships and they all require Bachelors in CS or Software. I'm starting to get why no one wants to go to college any more since so many problems plague around it.


(My question)

What am I supposed to do at this point? I've always been tech savy, just with a few problems (Anxiety with driving), and by all means, I can do tech support its just not something I have my heart in. I've always loved computer programming, I do it out of entertainment and almost daily at this point.





My goal is to get a career in Software Engineering. 

My degree is limited to an Associates in Networking.

I have a few laughable projects on Github that shrivel in the mere presence of other's projects.

Is advance schooling really my only hope? Whether by earning a bachelors in Computer Science or Software Development (Along with student debt)


Greatly appreciate any advice,

On a side note: I've read a lot of the of [f.a.q](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index), found some help there.

(tl;dr) Debt, lack of experience, depression, just wanna code for someone.

Edit: I've gotten a private message they helped me greatly, but I will still continue to respond to anyone else. I really do appreciate any and all advice."

I'm in my first semester in the CS program at my school and I'm not sure how experienced the people I am competing with will be.

Now, as I am about to finish my degree landed a job offer with amazing pay based on my work during the internship.However, the owner who previously(on multiple occasions) agreed to provide me with a reference is now dodging my calls.I did my due diligence and checked with them before including their name and contact details as a reference.

It has been almost a week and they are unavailable and my new hiring manager though has been very patient with me is visibly irritated. I have presented another set of reference however, their refusal or rather avoidance is making me look bad more so, because they are my most recent employer.

I have no idea how to handle this and how to salvage the situation in front of my new company.What is the right course of action in this situation? How can I still get a reference from them? And if possible how to manage the situation from getting any worse?"

Does anyone know if the exam is difficult? Thanks."
21szkl,2,2014-03-31,Worried but optimistic,throwaway77219,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/21szkl/worried_but_optimistic/,"So I am finishing my junior year of my undergraduate ChemE degree at a decent engineering school and have no complaints about my choice of major. ChemE is the bees knees and I really like it but I am not the best ""out-of-classroom"" student. I am fine in the classroom (3.25 gpa but expect it to go down to 3.2 after this semester) but I am terrible at being active. I work ~12 hours a week (coupled with school) I barely have free time for myself let alone extracurricular stuff. I also didn't get any type of internship/coop either (I applied to a ton of places, had a few interviews but no offers.) I am getting anxious. I see my fellow classmates passing me by and I am getting anxiety problems because I feel like I'm getting left behind. It also leaves me with an uncomfortable sense of embarrassment..  Is there anyone out there that can give me some non-generic advice about the next step? I am applying for a research job over the summer that I think I can get at my university and I also want to volunteer my time outside the school during summer. I heard those two things look good on a resume but will it help me get full-time employment? I feel like it is to late to try and save it. I was also thinking about using a semester to retake a couple classes to boost my gpa a bit more and to extend my time at school to hopefully get an extra chance for an internship next year. are these good ideas? am i on the right track now? Sorry if this sounds whinny but I am really clueless where I stand. I am the first kid in my family to go to college so my family isn't much help besides being supportive. I also am the only engineer i know. No uncles or aunts, friends or co-workers that I know to help me network. 

TL;DR: going to be a senior with moderate gpa for industry and no work experience. Want to try to do research and volunteer this summer but dont know if its the right decision. any type of input good, bad, constructive, or comedic will be much appreciated!

p.s. my advisor is not helpful and your guys always leave great advice on other threads so I figured you guys could help"
21t1yh,6,2014-03-31,CS majors: 400 levels dilemma.,mhero18,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/21t1yh/cs_majors_400_levels_dilemma/,"So, I'm currently a rising senior and got two more semesters left since I'm trying to graduate in the four years. I think a few people are/have been in this situation. So for CS majors, we have to take a total of 7 400-level CS courses. I'm currently taking 2, and I need to take 5 more to complete my major requirements. This means I have to take 3 one semester, and 2 another semester. We are only allowed a maximum of 3 400-levels per semester anyway.

My dilemma is whether or not I should just take 1 this summer, and then 2 for my remaining two semesters. So far, these 400 levels have taken quite a bit of time and effort, so it's not a breeze in the park for me. I know for sure I will struggle if I take 3, but not necessarily fail. I would just have to put in a lot of effort. This is also assuming I can even get all the 400-levels that I actually want to take. I'm considering the summer option, but I'm not sure if paying $1300 is worth it. It's a pretty big chunk of money. I don't have a job or internship right now, and my parents have already been paying so much for both me and brother's college, so I would feel bad asking them.

So, should I just go ahead and pay $1300 for the summer, or should I suck it up and attempt to do 3 400-levels? Or other options/advice?
Thanks!

Side Question: Is ENGL393 beneficial/worth it to me as a CS major, or should I take another one of the 39X classes that I may find more interesting? Thanks!"

I was planning on applying for internships after finals last semester but then I got really sick and have not been healthy until now. All the deadlines have obviously passed for what I had in mind and I don't know what to do. Is it too late. I'm a junior but didn't get an internship last year so this is really important. Anyone know of any opportunities I can shoot for?"

  I hope I'm in the right subreddit, if not let me know. I have been dealing with some mental health issues for a long time now and I just wanted to write everything down and possibly even get some useful advice. I am really in a need of an uplifting comment from you guys. I apologize for the long wall of text in advance and to compensate I would like to buy someone gold or pay them if their comment genuinely helps me or uplifts me and gives me advice on how to sort my life out.  
  
  Let me first give some background about myself, I have always been a shy person (I hate to admit this) and never was able to just make friends. I used to be painfully shy as a child but I have been getting more 'open' as I have aged. I am still very shy around girls, especially in an informal environment. I don't know if I have ever been truly happy, maybe before my teens but I have never been satisfied with myself as a person. I was never very close to my parents, or anyone for that matter. I have never had a girlfriend until a month ago, although not really sure what that relationship was.  

  I moved to Canada in 2011 as an international student for higher education, and things have been a downfall mentally ever since I got here. 2012 was the worst year of my life, I went through something I cannot even explain in words. I didn't feel alive, I was in a very high state of anxiety. It was a sort of turning point in my life, and ever since that year I have questioned my mental health. This thought of whether Im feeling ok or not has consumed me, I worry everyday about it. The last two years have been a mix of some good days and bad days, and I have tried to make changes in my life since I realized how important people and relationships are in life. I try to exercise and eat healthy and have limited my consumption of caffeine and alcohol.  

  Fortunately, in 2013 I got my internship as a IT support analyst where I got to speak to a lot of people everyday. This helped me a lot with my social skills and confidence. This period of 4 months was a relatively ok period. For the first time in 2 years I had money of my own to spend. Things were looking a little brighter. There was this girl who I liked who used to be in the library everyday (the place where I worked), to my surprise she added me on facebook and we started talking. I asked to meet (which was something I never thought myself capable of) and we went out like 4-5 times over a period of two months. She wasn't ""the one"" but I just wanted to have someone in my life, and she seemed to like me very much. A month back she broke up with me saying that we are very different people (which I agree with) and that she wasn't ready for a relationship. I guess she lied whenever she said that she had a good time, but I genuinely had a good time with her. This whole episode has shook me mentally and I have gotten myself in a downward spiral. Although I have a lot of study related stress too so that might also be a factor. This past week as been especially disturbing. I'll try to explain what exactly I go through now.  

  I have these ""attacks"" or ""periods"" of anxiety and/or depression in which I cannot concentrate on anything, I have to force myself to do everything and I feel very weird. I have no physiological symptoms like rapid heart rate so I don't think its a panic attack. I also feel anxiety when I'm around a lot of artificial light, which I think is a possible trigger for these episodes sometimes. These ""episodes"" don't last a whole day and so I swing between optimism and pessimism, feeling abnormal and normal. When I feel relatively normal, it doesn't feel like mania. I have no trouble sleeping most nights and neither do I get especially interfering racing thoughts during those periods of normalcy. I feel so angry when I think about the reason behind this as I don't have any real problems in my life that aren't fixable. I also have become very sensitive to criticism or anything negative being said about me. I just dont know why things affect me so much now. These episodes of depression and anxiety are the only real problem I have and it troubles me very deeply and I cant stop thinking about them. I don't know what to do anymore, I just want a fair chance at improving my life like everyone else and my share of happiness from this world.  

  Sorry if I my english sounds a bit weird or if I made some mistakes. English isnt my first language. If someone can give me actual advice on what I could do that'd be great. And thanks for reading."

With the help of my internships, I make enough money to be able to save some and I am wondering what should I do with it.  
I'll have between $9 000 and $10 000 to invest in some kind of saving account. I wish to be able to make some money off the interest with minimum risk.  I also have three internships remaining so I will be adding between 10 and 15 000 dollars to the account.
I am currently 21, my degree should be over by the end of 2016 and after that I would use the money for a big purchase like a house or a condo, and maybe a car.  
tl;dr: I am 21, I have ~$10k to put somewhere to make money off interest, I will be adding between 10 and 15k $ in the next 30 months. What are my options?"

A few weeks ago I was offered a position at a company in New York City which I accepted since it was a good position and I had not received any other offers. 

Today I received another offer from a company which is very close to my University where I already have an apartment over the summer. Both positions are about the same when it comes to experience and pay, but I would save a lot more money taking the position at the second company since getting another apartment in New York City over the summer would be very expensive. I didn't sign a contract with my first company, and they even specified that both parties can decide to break the agreement at any time.  Still I feel bad taking another offer after I already accept the first one. Is it bad form to take a better offer if it comes along after accepting with another company?

Ultimately I would be fine working for either company, it would just be much more convenient and cost effective to take the second offer. I realize that this is a far better problem to have than not getting any offers at all. I just wanted to get some outside opinions."

To make a long story short, I have been an automotive mechanic since high school but I decided to go to college in 2007.  I graduated back in 2011 with my B.S. in Aerospace Administration and minor in Business Management.  I have been trying to get a decent job in the aerospace industry since I graduated but it is proving futile and my heart just isn't in it anymore.

I am very technically and mechanically inclined and have always enjoyed working on and with computers but I failed to realized that when I decided to go to college.  I have been doing the occasional computer repair side job through friends and family over the years but I don't hold any certifications right now.  I want to get into the IT field but I don’t know how to go about doing it since I work full time and most IT positions require experience and most of them are on the north side of Atlanta.  I’m willing to relocate for work since I’m not married and have no kids but I want to make sure I’ll be satisfied wherever I go because I have moved quite a few times since I graduated trying to chase different jobs.  The other question is I’m not sure what concentration I want to get into since I am a very hands-on person.  Also, should I pursue certifications or go back to college for another degree?  I’m considering more schooling because I have a really hard time studying on my own without having some sort of deadline to follow plus I will have the opportunity to do an internship while in school.

**TL;DR:  I'm 30 and I have my B.S. in Aerospace Admin but I can't get a job in the field without experience (common problem).  I'm passionate about computers and technology in general and I want to break into the IT industry.  How do I get experience without going broke (i.e. $15/hr. desktop support)?  Should I pursue more schooling, just concentrate on certifications, or what?**"

My question is about how to change locations after you graduate. I live in the NYC area and I feel like I'd like to get a job and live in Austin tx. Should I be sending out for summer internships in Austin, which would cost quite a bit, or should I intern here in NYC and wait until I graduate to looking for a job there?

I really do not want to get a job in NYC for a few years then move. I'm kind of antsy I guess and I have been for a few years now.

Another question I have is after I graduate should I just move and get something to pay the bills until I find what I'm looking for or should I wait in NY until I get an interview. 

Thank you for any advice."
