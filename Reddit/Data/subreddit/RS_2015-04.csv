30zpao,4,2015-03-31,I've hit a wall and could really use some help.,lolmycat,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/30zpao/ive_hit_a_wall_and_could_really_use_some_help/,"Before making you read a long wall of text, I’ll start by explaining exactly what my post is about.

I am a 2nd year Computer Science major at a local community college in Southern California looking for some advice on landing an internship or part-time job.  I have applied to several companies, but have yet to get my foot in the door.  I’ve searched high and low but seem to be unable to find many realistic job openings.  I have hit a wall, and honestly, it has begun to wear on me.  More than anything, I want to begin using my programming knowledge in a real-world environment, and get a taste of what it is like to work with a team of professionals.  I can only imagine how much it would allow me to grow as a programmer and individual. 


If any of you have gone through the same difficulties, or have any advice that could help, I would be incredibly thankful.
So now a little background on myself.  I am 21 years old, live in Orange County, CA, have been programming since my freshman year of high school, have been studying Computer Science for the past 2 years at a local community college, and will be transferring to a 4 year CS/UC school in the fall.   However, I have found little to no help at my community college with finding an internship.  I really enjoy programming and feel that it comes naturally to me.
  
I took my first CS class junior year of high school (AP Computer Science A), and received a 4 on the AP exam.  As of today, I am fluent in C++ and Java.  Instead of writing a huge wall of text I’ll just detail the specifics of my CS background.  Anything I list below I have a great understanding of and can code from scratch.


* 	**Object Oriented programming (C++ and Java)**

*      Methods, Objects, Polymorphism, Inheritance, etc.   

* 	**Data Structures**

*     - Queues, Stacks, Lists (single,  double, circular)
        - Binary Trees (ADT, Red-Black) 
        - Maps, Hash Maps, and Dictionaries
        - Graphs (Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd–Warshall algorithm, MST, etc)
        - Hashing
        - Search / Sort algorithms
* 	**UI design**
*     - JavaFX, AWT

This list goes on. Like I had mentioned, my understanding of Java and C++ is fairly in-depth.  

I have no problem with things like pointers, iterators, input/ output, method and operator overloading; the little things I see many of my classmates skim over and never really learn the ins and outs of.  Aside from school I have made a huge effort to push myself to learn as much as I can on my own: constantly trying to find more advanced ways of completing assignments, and spending way too much time on sites like Stack Overflow.  I have no issue following previously determined style guides and code documentation standards, and have some experience with HTML, PHP, SQL, and JavaScript.  As for program development, I have done several team projects using AGILE, specifically JIRA.

I’m sure there are a dozen things I haven’t listed that I know as well, but you get the idea.  With this information, any tips or advice on finding internships, building a better resume, etc. would mean *a lot*.  I know I can code well, but not being able to use all these skills I have spent hundreds of hours learning and practicing has got me in a slump.  It’s somewhat exhausting to spend so much time with something and have little to show others for it.   It would just be nice to get a foot in the door, and have some sort of tangible reward for all the hard ward I have put in thus far.


For those of you that spent to time to read this, *I really appreciate it*."

It seemed like a great experience and with me getting married this year, it was time for me to get a big boy job. 

I mentioned that I have some moderate Drupal experience. You know, the works. Setting up the site, configuring modules, setting up views, basic theming and all of that stuff.

So on my 4th day, a project comes up where we have to insert a new form into this ajax loaded pop-up. Stupid me says that I can handle it (nobody else in the company had even touched Drupal so it would have been me anyways) and so I was given a deadline and I began getting to work. 

First off, the client gave us a broken version of the local site, we had to use a database from 6 months ago in order to get it to work. The ajax pop-up form wasn't a block being loaded dynamically, it was a custom module. Over 2000 lines of PHP code I have to go through. 

However, I didn't complain. It was going to be a learning experience so I just met it head on. But in the meantime, I was having the whip cracked at me by two project managers. And today it got so bad that I got dragged into the CEO's office for a talk... The two project managers, the Director of IT and the CFO were there as well. He kept telling me that I need to ask for help, but how can I ask for help when I'm the only one who knows Drupal? The only person who was able to help me at all was the director of technology who wore many hats and was tangled up in his own business.

This is a 1-month contact-to-hire job and I'm not sure if I'm going to take it. Today was utterly embarrassing. The fact that a co-worker of my  ""disappeared"" doesn't help my morale either.

Do you think it's going to get any better?"

I recently received an offer from a large somewhat well known internet company (900-1000 alexa global ranking ~300 US only ranking, ~500M - ~1Bn yearly revenue).

The position is for a Release Engineering Internship where I believe I would be working mostly with C# and the .NET stack.

The salary offered is 30$/hr (already confirmed in offer letter).

My main goal for a future internship would be to work at Google/Amazon/Microsoft.

Should I hold out for a better offer or is this about as good an offer that I am going to get as a freshman CS student? This would be my first ""industry experience"", as my previous experience comes from working in 2 research labs (Robotics + Bioinformatics) during my freshman year. 

I have not heard back from Microsoft even though I applied several months ago and applied to Lockheed Martin as well with no response either. I was already rejected from the Google Engineering Practicum this year as well. At this point should I just consider this a rejection and accept my existing offer?"

UIUC - top 5 CE program, but lower ranked overall, cold and harsh weather, perhaps unappealing location. UCLA - top 15 CE program, high overall university ranking, high brand value, great weather, urban campus.

311y4f,4,2015-04-01,"New here, Hi. Could use some advise, or just words of encouragement. Also, here's my entire life story…",wheredidallmymoneygo,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/311y4f/new_here_hi_could_use_some_advise_or_just_words/,"**TL;DR - Workaholic buried in debt, succeeding in career, but neglecting life. Ready to dig myself out of the hole. What can I do to start taking control of my life?**

Diagnosed in middle school (16 years ago), on &amp; off different meds thru the years, currently taking generic Strattera. Despite the constant struggle of paying attention, I did very well in school. Graduated, broke into the music industry, worked my way up from intern to errand boy to professional, now freelance. This year I feel like I've finally broke through the stagnant plateau in my career. I'm finally earning much more money than I was previous years, basically just got a raise. January I made more than I ever had in a single month, and my work future looks bright. 

...But I've been so focused on my career and burying myself in work (often working 12 hour days), I have been **severely** neglecting every day life stuff. So bad that I've dug a huge hole for myself that I don't really know how to get out of. 

Made a throwaway, so I'm just gonna lay out everything in a depressing list of failure…

* Don't have health insurance. 

* Need to go to the dentist. 

* Don't have car insurance either. 

* Crashed my car several years ago while I was an intern, Couldn't afford to fix it, so I've been driving around with a busted door/window for years. Then missed the registration, couldn't afford the repairs to pass the smog check  so I never renewed them. Years went by on expired tags, got several tickets, a few turned into failure to appear in court, never settled that. A few weeks ago it got impounded by the police, and the back fines were more than the car was worth, so I gave the title to the tow-yard (they agreed to wave the fines) and now I'm car-less. Still haven't got a new one, just taking Uber to work. 

* This will be the second year not paying taxes. I'm sure there are extra fines piling up. 

* I have past due outstanding invoices amounting to several thousand dollars that I could collect on if only I were good on the phone… :-/ Most of them are in the process of paying, but sometimes I just lose track. Made a detailed Excel sheet to organize which ones are outstanding, but I still have to follow through and get payment. 

* With this new increase in cashflow I bought a new laptop with the intention of selling my old one for close to the same price, still haven't even made the eBay page yet. So I could get an extra $800 for that thing if only I got off my ass and listed it.

* Been paying 20 bucks a month (for maybe 2 years?) on some porn site I rarely visit, but don't know how to cancel because I forgot my password.

* Almost always buy expensive take out food cause I hate buying groceries.

* Holes in my shoes &amp; nothing good to wear cause I fucking hate shopping for clothes. 

* Bought a new pair of shoes on eBay, but wasn't home when they were delivered. I never got my ass to the post office so they've been sitting there for maybe 3 months now. Got returned to sender, then got lost in the mail. Whatever, they were stupid shoes anyway. 

* I'd like to go to the gym, but I'm too lazy and I hate people I don't know. Not overweight, but I would like to get into shape. Never been before, sounds like a scary endeavor. :-/

* Student loans are several months past due (give or take $800/month). Even though I now actually have the money to pay them, my credit is ruined. I've kind of lost track of how many there are and how long they've been late.

* 2 grand in 18% interest credit card debt, plus who knows how much is past due on my student loans, plus taxes, past due traffic tickets, plus I need a new car. 

...But I've got 5 grand sitting in my bank account, with another 4k coming next week (provided some of those those past due accounts go thru), and solid good-paying work coming in the months ahead, more than I've ever made. This is the first time I've ever had this much cash, I'm not sure what to do first. I've been living soooo poor during my first few years in the industry that I just adopted a lifestyle of neglecting everything related to money. 

There's also the booze habit, though now it's craft beer and aged whiskey instead of 40's and high life.

I'm kind of working what some might call a high-stress job, usually 12 hour days. Sometimes I'm so exhausted that whenever I get a day off, I just sleep in, drink, watch netflix or play video games. All those other things are just too much stress to deal with on my only fucking day off. The past two days I worked 15 hour shifts, and all I wanna do is have a glass of whiskey before heading to sleep &amp; prepare for another 12 hour shift tomorrow. Not much time to do much else. 

But that's my job, I'm either working or I'm not working. I'm freelance, so I can choose my days off or my days on. I just keep thinking that the more hours I work, the more money I'll make to dig myself out of this hole and come back to normal society. But I never actually take the time or effort to pick up the shovel. I'm so far deep at this point, that being successful is my only option. 

So lately I've been taking as much work as possible, and I've finally come into enough money to start digging myself out of this ridiculous life-neglecting pit of failure, but I don't know where to start. :-/

Anyway, this annoyingly detailed list has been super cathartic for me. I've never told anyone this pile of bullshit that's been on my back, and I seriously thank you if you have actually read this far. 

Any advice on where to start? "

It's alcohol and ent friendly, and all the other roommates are students (juniors) as well, like videogames (we have wii + wiiU + ps3 + TV set up right in the living room), and are really friendly.

I've been very actively reading the sub since last September, and after many dozens of rejections, I found myself in this last week with 5 offers to choose from for the summer of my Sophomore year. Woooo!   

My most competitive offer expired yesterday at business close, and in the final hour of things (2:00pm yesterday really) I received an even more competitive offer from a medium sized company in NYC as a Full-Stack developer. I ended up going with this option because it paid better, because I would work with more unfamiliar technologies as a learning experience, and because I wanted to work in NYC. 

Here's my question: the second best offer, the one that got knocked out late in the game, was a .NET position in Charlottesville, VA. The winning offer is web development in AngularJS and Ruby on Rails.  I'm familiar with desktop development in several languages already, and a newbie to web-dev, and I saw NYC as an opportunity to expand my skillset, but I am somewhat worried that I may be labelled as a 'web-dev' guy after this. Does such a label exist? Or am I just being unnecessarily fretful over the decision that I just made?

For context, I'm aiming for an SDE Internship with one of the Big 4 for next summer, and I'm wondering if my choice will have much of an impact on my suitability for those roles."

(I apologize in advance for the blabs and details)

Here's my story:

I graduated with a BA from an average university in Canada; launched a small business and later moved overseas to my original home country to also launch it and set it up there. As I was doing so I took on a full time job working at a multinational PR firm. I was working both and things were looking good but income was tight and the business was an unstable income as I was doing it part time at this point.

5 Months later, I received a too good to be true job offer at a major corporation in Dubai. However due to conflict of interest of my business and this corp. I had to shut my business down. With a  very impressive salary and tremendous benefits, I couldn't have asked for more. I said I would get corporate experience and then later relaunch the business at a more professional level.

I quit my full time job, shut down my business, broke up with my girlfriend and moved to Dubai. Unfortunately, at this time due to personal relationships and agressive changes moves from continent to continent I had fell into acute depression. I hated the city as I believed it was just too fake and not for me. I also realized that I was too inexperienced for the position I had took on. The company was also a dog eat dog kinda vibe especially in Dubai since 80% of the population are expats who can only reside there if they work.  (I was also not provided any training whatsoever)

In addition to my depression, within my 3 months probation I lost all confidence of myself and developed bad work ethic. Soon enough out of anxiety, I found myself expressing to my boss that I am unhappy. I was let go a few weeks later.

1 business down &amp; 2 jobs down (1 quit/1 fired)

Gladly I was able to get back on my feet and found another job yet with half the salary at a boutique firm. The nature of the job I did not like at all however I took whatever became available to be able to remain in the city until i find something more relevant. 

The depression has not left me, and trying to cop with the opportunity of a life time that I just blew, plus not even liking what I would be doing, I lasted 8 months and then it was just a point of wasting my time and the company wasting its money. both management and I noticed that it was not working out yet we had friendly relationship so we agreed that I will begin looking for another job and will remain working with them until I find one. (My performance was not so bad)

I eventually left the company and noticed that Dubai was possibly a wrong move and moved back to Canada where I started over again working at a retail store while looking for a 4th job. 

I got an opportunity to do an unpaid internship at a pretty decent agency. I then willingly impressed all those of the company from juniors to COO's. I was promised a position if an opportunity arises. My internship period ended and there were no vacancies. Yet upper management willingly found a need in the company and created a totally new position to the company so I could stay. 

However it was a role that I had absolutely no academic or professional experience in, and since it's new it had no structure or guidance and again no training provided., let alone the salary was relatively low.

I managed to hustle my way through projects the best I can, yet none of my coworkers really understood what my role was. 

Eventually my responsibilities started to decrease and getting delegated to those older in the company with more experience.

No one has time to hand hold or teach which I totally understand. 
However, being neglected and overlooked all the time began noticeable and I began to complain and again developed bad work ethic thinking they clearly don't care about my development and what I do and I am already getting really shit pay. So I decided to take  10 day unpaid vacation to see my family at this point as I had 0 paid vacation for the first year of my employment. 

Every time I get home after work I reflect on my performance and realize or the stupid things I've done. I.e:

-Texting
-Yawning
-Lateness
-Joking often with other coworkers
-Complaining and bad mouthing 
-Frequent smoke breaks

These are all things that are not strange to many other coworkers yet with my circumstances I am really worried and not sure what to do. I feel like I am going to get fired from this job sometime soon too due to this bad work ethic. I am 25 If this happens then I feel like I have truly fucked my career at this point.

1 business down  &amp; 4 jobs down (1 quit/ 1 mutual/2 terminated) within only 5 years.

Is my career over?

I know that Data Science is where I want to specialize and I've taken Databases, Data Science (and a continuation research class in the area), Data Mining, Intro to Probability/Stats, Applied Stats, and Mathematical Stats so far and I'm pretty positive I want to apply to graduate school.

I'm wondering 2 things,

1) How do I know where to apply? Do I search for MS in Data Science or is it MS in CS, Stats, or Analytics or something? Or do I look for professors instead? Do I have a choice of whether it's actually applying methods to data or research into different ""data scientific""  techniques?

2) More immediately, I don't have anything planned for this summer (my last summer in college) but I've done an REU research program my freshman summer and did nothing my sophomore summer. I'm a finalist for a software dev (probably) internship right now but probably won't get it. Do I **need** an internship like that or should I just find a professor here to do research with this summer/next semesters?

They spend all day at work programming. They put up with shit conditions and work extra hours because they love the job. They go home and work code on side projects.

I also know a lot of companies seem to be looking for this kind of person.

I am not this person. Nothing against those who are. But I already sacrifice enough of my life to the god of RSI at the altar of the desk and keyboard. I genuinely do enjoy programming. But at 5 PM I want to turn off my computer and not think about code at all until I come in the next day. I want to spend that time doing and thinking about other shit.

I'm not fussed about getting a big salary, but I do want good work conditions. Don't get me wrong - I'm not looking to slack off all day. I will work hard during work hours, and go home happy with no need to think about work when I'm not at work.

I have a First (top degree classification in the UK) in computer science from one of the best unis in the country. I'm currently most of the way through a master's. I have done a couple of good internships (and got a job offer from one of the companies but turned it down to do my master's).

3181vn,0,2015-04-02,"I love my CS education, but I hate the software industry...",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3181vn/i_love_my_cs_education_but_i_hate_the_software/,"Hi everyone, I have some opinions/observations and I was hoping to maybe start a discussion about them.


Like the title says, I love my CS education. The classes I'm taking/ have taken (Data structures, Algorithm design, Combinatorics, Operating Systems, Computer Vision, Bioinformatics, Automata Theory, and much more) have been tremendously interesting and extremely fun to take. It seems that everyday in my Combinatorics class I have an 'aha' moment and learn something rad.


Now looking ahead, I'll have to secure a full-time job in June 2016 since I have no interest in going to graduate school or being unemployed. Problem is, I've grown to greatly dislike the current software industry and it's associated culture. It seems that everyone is money-obssesed, pushing out shitty little apps that do worthless things, trying to come up with the next big whatever-the-fuck. And then, to get interviews at these shitty little web startups, you have to have 5 prior internships, a GPA of 3.999, be the former president of the CS club (how many presidents could there be?), have countless open source contributions, and have 10+ substantial github projects. I'm exaggerating of course, but you get the idea. Once you get this interview at a shitty little web startup for a web dev. position, you get to field questions like, 'write a turing machine', 'write a binary search tree and every possible traversal algorithm', 'implement a fully associative CPU cache', and similar. Who do they think they are, asking these kinds of questions? You're making a fucking website, you don't need that kind of knowledge to make a fucking website!


So here's the punchline: I'm not interested in working in a beer-chugging, frat bro startup pushing a shitty ass tinder-esque app to maximize profits and 'get rich as fuck brah'. I don't want to work in the web development industry with the associated 'culture fit is important and we have yoga on Thursdays'. I don't feel that these things do justice to my education that I've worked so hard for, and I feel that I'm not reaching my full potential if I end up getting tickets asking me to move a button 2 pixels to the left all day or whatever. So what are my options?


I want to work with the stuff I learned in my CS education, I don't want to get a higher degree, there must be something for me?"

I'm currently in the process of interviewing with a huge IT company (think HP, IBM size) and I think I have a really good chance of getting the position. The problem is, we were working out times to interview, and we were shooting for Friday so I'd have enough time to get responses and make my final decision, but because it's Good Friday, they told me they'll need to conduct the interview on Monday.

I guess I'm just wondering what the best thing to tell my current internship would be? The position I was already accepted for would be a really good opportunity (Intern to hire) and it's paid, but the Job at the big IT company would be amazing, I'd be able to learn a lot, it pays double the other internship and I feel like I have a really good chance to get it, but I don't want to turn down the offer I already have based on a good feeling.

I hope my ramblings weren't too hard to understand, I'm sort of trying to come up with a solution ASAP and I hope I'm coming off coherently. I'd really appreciate any help, thank everyone."

I'm a 19 year old college kid that has always been socially awkward. I can't ever remember a time not being like this, even as a child.

Recently I've been having job interviews for internships. I've been turned down at 4 places. This was a massive wake up call for me. I've been able to limp through life hating myself and wishing I had the guts to speak to people (as a side note I will not and cannot blame others for my issues... I've ran into so many kind and supportive people along with spiteful people that there is no way that wholly blame others). Now I know that I can't continue like this.

I don't think I'm a sociopath; I think I truly do care about others to an extent. But if there's someone who drops their phone and I'm within reach I feel too scared to help out. In situations like this I end up hating myself because by doing nothing I end up doing the wrong thing. 

Right now I'm at the pits. I really don't know what to do since the ""real world"" clearly will not tolerate my level of social anxiety. I apologize if I sounded insincere or if this seems like a self-gratifying rant, but I really have no idea how to go on with my life. I don't know where to go from here. If you've read through this thanks for putting up with this crap. 

EDIT: I realized I left out a ton of stuff I could have put up about myself. I don't really have any friends... Going back to the issue of blaming others, I just can't bring myself to return the favor of kindness to others. There have been a few that have persisted but I never really feel close to them. 

Another thing is that I think I appear cold or uncaring to others. Some more talkative and bolder people as well as my family have mentioned this to me. I'm not even consciously thinking negatively towards others most of the time. 

Yet another thing I remembered is that I usually feel pretty pessimistic and strung out. I feel very stressed and unhappy the days before an exam or if I failed an exam. I also dislike hearing people talk to much about themselves... I guess in a way I don't care for people that feel sorry for themselves. But that also makes me a hypocrite. :( The more I think about it the more complicated it seems and the less innocent I realize I am. 

I'm probably leaving out a ton of details but I can't think of any at this point. "

It will be my Junior year, and I have already finished all of the core CS classes (281, 370, 376). I still have to take Math 214 (or 417, someone told me one of the professors was easier) and 4 credits of intellectual breadth.

So I have a lot of freedom to choose my schedule, but it's also fairly difficult to balance interest with difficulty/courseload. It's also a big semester for getting internships, and what classes I take could make a decent impact (I'm sure companies would rather see 482 or 381 on a resume than something like Machine Learning). I'm looking at the following EECS courses:

* **381: Object Oriented Programming**   Looks great to companies and supposedly makes you a much better programmer in general, helpful for future classes. Also a ton of work

* **388: Intro to Computer Security** Heard it's a great and useful class, and apparently a light workload so easier to fit in with other EECS classes

* **482: Operating Systems** Very essential and useful for landing internships, but also very difficult

* **485: Web Database and Information Systems** Also useful in industry, doesn't seem too interesting but probably a good class to have under my belt

Any advice on which I should take? One possibility I thought of was 388, 381, and each the intellectual breadth class or Math 214. It's only 12 credits, but I've heard that's recommended when taking 381 since it's such a massive workload. Another possibility was taking two (or maybe all) classes out of 388, 482, 485, in addition to an intellectual breadth course and Math 214 (or no math if I took the 3 EECS).

I'd really appreciate any help. If it makes a difference, I'm currently taking 281, 370, and 376 and am not having any problems with time management (despite being told I ""would die""), and I've done very well on the 281 projects so far."

A little background: I have two internships under my belt. The first one was just a three month summer long one and the second one is the one I am still working at to this day, (about 2.5 years now). Which I believe is a lot of experience compared to most students. 

The reason I am unsure if I should accept is I am not sure if my current job will accept me back after I return in August. My current part time internship helps me pay for my schooling and I would very much like to have a place to return to in order to help pay for my schooling and some other minor bills. By the way, I am guaranteed a job right out of school by my current company.

So in conclusion, would having this *Fortune 25's* name on my resume be almost like future ""job security"" that will help me land interviews and jobs quicker or should I not worry about that seeing as I have a lot of internship experience already -- and worry more about maintaining my current internship/job in order to cover my schooling and some minor bills?

31a7mt,1,2015-04-03,A Question to those in Industry from an Indecisive High School student,Battlefront228,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31a7mt/a_question_to_those_in_industry_from_an/,"I'll cut right to the point. At the moment I am trying to choose between UIUC and Purdue for Computer Science. Students on both sides vouch for their program, as is to be expected, but now I want a third source: those who work/hire in the Computer Science field.

Purdue I've been accepted into Vanilla Computer Science. UIUC is a bit weirder.

Officially the major is called CS+Astronomy, a branch of the new CS+X program, created in 2013. Since it's so new, there really isn't any data on industry reception. There is data on the schools CS+Math and CS+Stats programs, and ive heard nothing but positive feedback from professors, grads and students about those two. Other branch programs I could potentially switch two are +Chemistry, +Lingustics, +Stats and +Math. All the +X majors are located in the college of arts and sciences (LAS) while vanilla Computer Science is located in the college of engineering (CoE).

The gist of the +X programs is this: approx 64 hrs of 100-300 CS classes and 24 hrs of 200-400 X classes. I've been told I could enroll in 400 lvl CS classes, but the adviser later contradicted himself. When asked how hard a transfer into Vanilla would be, he stated difficult as the university was having trouble getting CS students in ""advanced CS courses"". 

Honestly, like most CS students my eye is on the lucrative Silicon Valley internships and jobs. while work as a computational scientist sounds interesting, I'm not convinced that's for me. 

Transfer to CoE is possible, albeit difficult. I feel that Purdue would offer more security in my major, yet UIUCs program keeps drawing me back. UIUC is a top 5 CS program up there with Stanford and Berkely. Purdue ranks in the low 20s. UIUC also has a nicer CS building, imo, and of the 3000 applicants to CS, I was one of only 300 to be accepted, so that has to count for something (that's a 10% admit rate). 

I apologize for the wall of text. I'm only 18 and here I am making the biggest decision of my life. My questions go as follows:

-What is industry perception of both schools
-What is industry opinion of the UIUC branch programs
-if I attended UIUC, which branch would be the best in the event I could not achieve transfer to CoE
-If there are any Computational Scientists on here, I'd be interested to hear about your job 
-Grads from either school, tell me about your experience

Costs don't matter to me at this point. I do find myself attracted to UIUC at the moment, but Purdue offers more security. Any help is appreciated."
31an9i,3,2015-04-03,Undergraduate seeking some advice,goggthegrunt,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/31an9i/undergraduate_seeking_some_advice/,"I know there's probably been a million of threads like these (in fact I saw another one earlier today), but I'd like some advice more specific to my situation from people that have experience in the field of bioinformatics. I tend to write a lot, so I'd like to thank you advance for reading about my situation.

I'm currently in my third year of my undergraduate career with a major in biochemistry. At the end of my second year, I took a class on the 'modern' era of biology. That class changed my perspective of how I view biology. One of the topics in the class was bioinformatics, and the capabilities of the field blew my mind. From, there I decided that I wanted to pursue bioinformatics.

Currently, I've decided to keep with my biochemistry major. I'm declaring a computing specialization for my major and a bioinformatics minor to supplement my major. The computing specialization actually isn't much. It's pretty much a watered down version of the bioinformatics minor, and it's entirely contained within the minor. I figure since it's no extra work, I might as well declare a computing specialization.

In terms of coursework and knowledge from the program I have set up for myself, I will have a good background in the biology aspect of bioinformatics, but I am not entirely sure of how strong my computer science will be for bioinformatics. The bioinformatics program at my school is still very primitive, and there's no formal department yet. Due to this, the coursework is rather loose. Following the coursework set-up by the minor, I will have taken C++ (three classes), three 'bioinformatics classes' (computational genetics, algorithms, and genomics), and four math/statistics classes (linear algebra, algorithms, probability, and data analysis). I'm still completing some of the preparation work for the more core classes such as the bioinformatics courses, so I cannot give a very detailed explanation of what each class will cover. **I was wondering if this is really enough in terms of preparing myself academically for a career in bioinformatics.** From what I've gathered, I will be needed more experience in coding (learning more languages like Python and R) and more mathematics (discrete structures?).

**Secondly, I would like to know what the advantages and disadvantages of getting a PhD vs. Masters are.** I guess this also extends into the whole industry vs. academia conversation as well. From what I understand, bioinformatics is not the best field for academia. I was told that bioinformaticians are often not lead authors on papers because while bioinformatics can be used as an excellent analytical tool, people want findings to be experimentally proved. Essentially, I was told that experiments/wet-lab researchers are better suited in academia than dry-lab researchers such as bioinformaticians. I tend to see more people go for Masters in bioinformatics than PhD's, and I'm guessing this is because the industry is better suited for bioinformaticians. I'm still quite fuzzy on this whole area, so any elucidation on this would be helpful.

**The last couple of things I would like to ask are in terms of research experience.** Since my freshman year, I have been working in a wet-lab studying breast cancer. While I enjoy this lab very much, I feel like it's not progressing towards my desired career path of becoming a bioinformatician. For a while now, I have been thinking of looking into some of the bioinformatics labs at my school, but I have a couple of concerns. The lab I am currently in is going to be publishing a paper fairly soon, and while I am not completely necessary to finish up the work for this paper, I would like to leave with my project resolved rather than left hanging. Secondly, I feel like I do not have enough computer science knowledge to truly contribute to a dry-lab. The only coding languages I know are C++ and JavaScript, and my math background is not quite strong yet (I have only taken multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and some basic statistics...I haven't yet completed all the math in the minor I stated above). **I'm not quite sure whether I should stay in my current wet-lab or look for a bioinformatics lab.** I would appreciate any thoughts.

**My final question is about internships and getting experience in the industry.** Since working in the industry is a very common route for bioinformaticians, I think it would be wise to get a feel for how the industry is. So far, all my experience with science has been in an academic setting through classes or university research labs. That being said, I've been having difficulty finding internships/opportunities for undergrads in bioinformatics. Most of the internships for bioinformatics that I've found asked that a Bachelors degree was already obtained. I'm looking around at the bigger companies, but I was wondering if there are any companies that might offer opportunities for undergrads specifically interested in bioinformatics like myself.

I know that was a lot of text! Thank you for bearing with me, and I really appreciate any comments and thoughts!"

I, and a lot of people on this sub, would say:

- work hard in school, understand the material
- get internship experience
- practice common interview questions

and from what my own experience and what I can see. If people follow this advice, they will actually land a job out of school that pays (way) more than the median family income for wherever they go.

Now, my question is: is there similar advice for how I can become a great senior developer? I guess what I'm asking is, what kind of people get hired at 30-35 for $300k to be a staff/senior developer? 

Did they work with the right technology? Have great people skills? Have a masters?

Should I be afraid of ""job hopping"" in my internships? To give some background, the summer after my freshman year I had a distance internship with a company in San Jose. In my sophomore year I worked as an RA. My sophomore summer I am interning at a large investment firm. Throughout my junior year I will be working at a local IT company as a part time developer (mostly DBA work). My junior summer I will likely be working at a different large firm (where I hope to work after school). My senior year will be more relaxed including studying abroad and enjoying my last days in college (i.e., no job).

I'm excited about this plan, but I'm afraid that it will be interpreted as job hopping by prospective employers. Should I cut my first internship off my resume come senior year to combat this? Or should I rethink my plan altogether?"

[Do you think Marijuana should be legalized recreationally and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzyzso?context=5)|I didn't really have any opinion about it, then we visited a medical marijuana clinic for my PBS doc. We were sniggering and laughing at all the people lining up for their ""medicine."" I then asked a woman, on camera, what her ""illness"" was that she needed her ""medicine"" for. She said, ""Cancer.""  And it occurred to me -- whether it works as medicine or not, if this woman believes that smoking this plant makes her feel better, who the hell are we to stop her?  
[What is the most memorable response someone on the show has said and immediately regretted? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzq88?context=5)|Brian Williams once came on the show and made a joke -- can't quite remember it -- that sounded as if he was making a gay joke about Anderson Cooper. Since Anderson at that time wasn't out publicly, it got a HUGE laugh, and Brian called us up, and said he understood that we had every right to broadcast it, but if we were going to, he needed to warn Anderson.  We didn't broadcast it. It was a slip of the tongue, and sounded meaner on tape than it did in the room. 
[Also, can you explain how you were in a room with Yo Yo Ma on the floor with a wombat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzsb6?context=5)|As for Yo Yo... well, we were doing an event for the Chicago Community Trust, which funds both the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (so: Yo Yo) and the Brookfield Zoo (so: Wombat.) And Yo Yo comes to meet the wombat, because why not, and the Wombat is down on the ground, and Yo Yo is a nice guy, so he gets down there too and I snapped a pic. Happens all the time. 
[Hi, Peter! Is it different to record the show in front of a much larger audience (e.g. Tanglewood\) as opposed to an intimate theater? Do you have a favorite venue on the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzfd6?context=5)|It is. I actually prefer our home theater for all its (lack of) charm. It's just the right size -- big enough so we have a nice crowd (about 500), small enough so that it feels intimate and the feedback is immediate. We've played venues so big, like Red Rocks, that sometimes I hallucinate a delay as our voices reach the back of the hall. Small is better, in general, for spoken word.  
[How is it decided which panelist will relate the true news story and which panelists will give the decoy fakes? Is it random, or is there some process by which the stories are given out according to the person's ability/inclination to really sell that story in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzj2g?context=5)|When we select the real story, we talk about who would sound most natural while telling it. ""Is that a story that [say] Mo might write?"" We also think about things about who's had the real one recently. Sometimes we intentionally DON'T give the true one to a panelist because we really want to hear their fakes on the topic.

We owe him so much. (We've already had Presidents Clinton and Obama, although then it was Sen. Obama)
[When a celebrity guest isn't able to win for the listener at home, have they ever offered up something for that person in place of Carl Kasell's voice on their answering machine/voice mail? (Not that anything could replace that.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzj2g?context=5)|3) It's happened from time to time. David Simon, for example, offered the voice of Michael Williams, who played Omar on the Wire. I don't know if that happened, but I hope it did. 
[I listen all the time and love the show. Do you and your writers have multiple jokes written for you to choose from depending on where the panelists go with a story and then you choose them as needed? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzz057?context=5)|Sort of. We work very hard on writing jokes, and I've always got more than I need. What we use depends, as you suggest, on what the panelists choose to do. Sometimes they go in a different direction and I use none of them. Sometimes they set me up beautifully, so i can lead in with a ""Yeah, and as a matter of a fact..."" Sometimes the panelists don't say anything and I just read all the jokes. We hate that.

I've been lucky enough to talk to people who played a huge role in my life, from Leonard Nimoy to Elvis Costello (at different ages, natch.)  Maybe, in the end, it was Norton Juster, who wrote The Phantom Tollbooth, my very favorite book as as child, and perhaps now. A great unforgettable thrill to talk to him.  
[Do you have a favorite city and/or venue (outside of your home base in Chicago\) you've been able to host 'Wait Wait' in/at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzz9u4?context=5)|We've played some amazing places, so amazing I can't quite believe they let us in there. Short, but not complete list would include: Red Rocks, Tanglewood, SF War Memorial Opera House, Nokia Theater in LA (!), and of course Carnegie Hall. Probably my favorite single night was playing to 10,000 Chicagoans at Millennium Park. We'll be back there next summer.

I had to put my dear Coney down a year ago tomorrow, and I guess part of the mourning process was not downloading and listening regularly. It just hurt too much. I know a lot has changed since last April -- Carl retiring, Bill being a regular. I think it's time I came back. What can I expect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzvgy?context=5)|First of all, I'm really sorry about the loss of your dog. Time was, I'd roll my eyes at you, but I became a dog person myself these last few years and so I know what it's like. All my condolences.
 |I do hope you come back to us, though. We're still doing the same combination of mocking our betters and toilet humor. Bill Kurtis is no Carl, but then Carl is no Bill. And a lot of people tell us that listening to our show helps them get through hard times. I hope that is the case with you. 
[Peter, I remember you reporting over the phone after the bombings at the Boston Marathon a few years ago. How did that experience change the way you think about the news?

I think I handled myself well, but I simply didn't know anything. I was probably the least informed person in the country, and I was only two hundred yards away from the crime scene. That said, it did in fact increase my already considerable respect for my colleagues at NPR News. The truth is a solemn burden. 
[I just recently read ""The Book of Vice"" (nice job, very entertaining\) and was wondering: 1\) What part of the research you did for that made you the most uncomfortable? 2\) What part of the research were you most surprised to find that you enjoyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzptk?context=5)|It's been a while, but I wasn't really happy wandering around The Power Exchange, not so much because of the sex -- there wasn't that much -- but because of the desperation and the general sense of scamminess.  As for enjoyment, hm. Probably my meal at Alinea. If you offered me another meal there, or an invitation to a swinger's party, I'd take Alinea. 
[What is your bucket list marathon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzyyhn?context=5)|Hi! I've never really thought about it that way. There are a bunch I'd love to do before I'm done... the big European capitols, Big Sur, the Loire (the one with wine at the rest stops). Now that I think I'm done trying to win them, so leisurely marathon tourist sounds fun. 
[Your interview questions always demonstrate a lot of knowledge about a ""Not My Job"" guest and their work, and you often get the guest to reveal more about themselves than they do on other programs. What's the process like when you're preparing to interview a guest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzz5dz?context=5)|Well, we have producers and interns who research. I try (I do!) to read the book or watch the film they're promoting. But one of the most important things I do is talk to them off air beforehand. I assure them we're not interested in anything but having a good time with them; the quiz doesn't matter at all, we just want them to enjoy themselves. I think this helps. 
[Hi Peter - Is there a ""Not my job"" participant who had a legitimately bad time? If so, who and why? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzw1d?context=5)|I don't know if they've had a bad time -- if so, we didn't hear about it. I've sometimes gotten the sense from guests that they didn't quite get into it, sometimes surprisingly so. (that is, based on their personality, I thought they would enjoy it.) 
[When I went to WWDTM a couple weeks ago (with Richard Price\), I had *so* much fun - some the ""cut"" moments (from the 2h taping\) were pure gold. Have you ever considered releasing an ""uncut"" version of the podcast as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzz3nh?context=5)|No, we never have, although a lot of people suggest it. For one thing, we really like editing. For another, if people could hear the whole thing without paying for a ticket, why would they buy a ticket? That said, we're experimenting with releasing some ""unaired"" material every week as a podcast extra. People seem to like it!
[Hi Peter - I remember hearing your program back in the very early days of the show, thinking ""this seems entertaining, I hope they 'make it'"". I didn't listen to NPR a while (I did the whole prodigal son thing\) then when I came back to it, I realized you guys had moved to a live studio audience. Can you talk about that transition and some of the challenges that came along with it? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31b9sf/i_am_peter_sagal_host_of_nprs_wait_wait_dont_tell/cpzzza2?context=5)|The transition to a live audience both made and saved our show. We started as a studio show because it was logistically much easier and also much easier to edit. But it became obvious that we had to do our comedy in front of people who might, say, laugh. So we turned the aircraft carrier around and started doing it every week live. I date our real success from that moment, exactly 10 years ago this month.

I am a finance major who is looking to break into consulting. I am currently a junior, but will need to take an extra semester of classes to graduate. This essentially puts me in the ""junior year"" category for recruiting purposes next fall. I come from a semi-target school, and know my GPA is on the lowish side for consulting (3.6). 

I  will be doing a corporate finance internship for a Fortune 50 media company over the summer, and am looking for the best books and guides to help me learn more about case interviews and the consulting recruiting process. What resources would you recommend? 

Here is a little background about me and some things that will hopefully help me stand out during recruiting:

1. Will be interning with Google next Fall and Winter, while going to school, for their ""Community Leaders Program."" I will be helping local small business owners improve sales and profitability through online marketing. 

2. Corporate finance internship this summer at a well-known media/telecommunications company

3. I launched a very successful service business here in my hometown. Company is an official sponsor of our state's Miss America pageant. 

4. Volunteered in Mexico for two years for a non-profit organization, am fluent in Spanish. Served as a leader for a non-profit organization in China for 6 months. 

Thanks for any books/guides/resources that would be helpful to start branding myself for recruiting season!"

I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub, but the people that post here are the kind of people I need to talk to. 
I created a throw away because of how ashamed I am of everthing I am about to say. I am currently a sophmore at a university majoring in CS. I have been programming for about 4 years, 2 years at a vocational school while I was in highschool, and two years here at uni. I have always struggled as a programmer, the concepts and OOP didnt come naturally to me. I have worked very hard to get to the point I am at now in my CS ""career"". I spent hours longer than my peers trying to grasp concepts that they can code in minutes. Looking at algorithms are hit and miss, either I can see them and how they work fairly easy, or it takes hours of analysis to make any sense of what I am looking at. I have always scraped by my CS classes and seemed to have fallen through the cracks in a sense of my placements. I don't feel like I belong with my peers in terms of the programming capabilities that they have.

 I am currently taking data structures, a ""weed-out"" class, and I'm the one thats being weeded-out. I spend upwards of 6 hours a day on my projects on top of my 4 other classes. Its stressful. Its straining my relationship and I am in a constant state of anxiety when it comes to programming. When it comes to programming itself, I have gotten better gradually over time (as does anything if you practice enough) but its a much slower graduation than everyone around me. I strive to be the best I can be, I don't anticipate ever being the best, but my best quality is my drive. I will never quit. I know that this is what I love to do, and want to do. I will do anything to get it, but I have no confidence in myself or my abilities. I dont have time currently to practice my skills outside of school. My in-school projects take up all of my time, and even then I usually dont finish them. I visit my professor reguarly and always have a hundred questions. I'm just slow. I'll get there, but you have to force it down my head.

This anxiety, and overall lack of confidence has reached its apex this week. I have an interview for a company as a Java programming intern this summer. My projects are in C++ now, and I would have to spend much time re-learning syntax and the quirks of java before my interview and I'm on a time squeeze. The interview conflicts with a project deadline, and although I have requested (and recieved) more time on my project, I feel it wont be enough to allow me to accomplish both the project, and the knowledge that I need going into my interview. I have a constant feeling that I need to throw up because of the amount of pressure I have going forward in my career. I refuse to quit.

My main question: Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? What do you do when you have no confidence in your programming abilities? What should I do?"

I heard CompTIA has become useless now. I'm planning on working torwards a CISSP cert as that seems to be what many people in /r/sysadmin have now.

But my main question. I am currently take a 2 year diploma at a College (Community College if you're in the US) and it is called ""Computer Networking and Technical Support"". It's a two year program but I feel like I'll probably need more experience then 2 years will give me. We have to take on an internship last semester but it's a bit useless as it's twice a week for a total of 4 hours a week (imo thats not enough real world experience). I was thinking of either going for Computer Science as I've taken the required courses in HS or taking this [Bachelor of Technology in Security from Seneca College](http://www.senecacollege.ca/fulltime/IFS.html) which I was accepted to last year. Should I continue with my studies or will the program I'm taking now be enough?

I've set a personal goal to get a summer internship at Google in 2016. I know that some people may look down on me for setting a goal like this, but it's been a goal of mine for some time, and I think I would learn a lot from the experience.

My marks at school are high, I have a GPA of 3.8 and a CS GPA of 4.0. I understand the concepts that are being taught in my classes and am currently TAing a CS course. Academically, I'm doing really well, however I feel academics and grades don't play too big of a role in the mind of a recruiter at Google.

I've worked on a few personal projects, made a couple of games, a few mobile applications and a couple of web applications. I have strong experience in C++, C, Ruby on Rails, Java and Javascript. But still, I don't think I've done anything special that separates me from every other student that wants to work at a big company.

A lot of people on this subreddit, and in many other places, say that doing personal projects is extremely important to getting a good job and improving. But every project that I've worked on, has been fighting with tools and meshing APIs together. Repeatedly working on projects like this doesn't seem like it's helping me in any way, sure I now know how to use the Google Places API to write an autosuggestion menu on Android, but does something like that really matter in the long run?

I personally believe that I'm a good problem solver, I've excelled at interviews (although I have yet to interview with a company that is known to give ""hard interviews"") and have aced algorithm courses. And I feel that if I get an interview with a company like Google, I can succeed.

But I haven't done anything substantial enough that would get me to the interview. My projects all seem like anybody could do them with enough time investment, which makes me think that they're not the type of thing that Google will look for.

So what should I do to guarantee getting an interview? What can I do to make myself stand out? How can I make my projects more than just mindless integration of different tools?

Any help would be appreciated."

31czc5,6,2015-04-03,Has anybody ever in their college career experienced burn-out and taken time off for mental health? How did it help?,thefinestsomething,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/31czc5/has_anybody_ever_in_their_college_career/,"First off, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this inquiry in. I'm currently not in graduate school but graduated from a combined undergrad/grad program (but considering graduate school again for another program) so since there isn't really a subreddit for that weird limbo area, I figured this might be a relevant place to post it in.

Here's my story (warning: it's long! If you're on here procrastinating, maybe save it for another day :) )

It's taken a long time to articulate this, because I've been afraid to talk about it or even post it on online forums for the fear of people telling me ""you're doing so great in life"" and ""most people would wish they were in your situation"". The guilt coupled with my depression made my mental health even worse, but I'm at a stage where I am a little more confident about myself to talk about it now.

I was a very ambitious high school student who loved learning and loved being a part of activities where people make real changes or have conversation that lead to action. I didn't have a stable high school life (kept moving, had to make new friends, get used to new schools and their course offerings), so I was very driven to get into a good college eager to actually learn and find meaningful lifelong friendships. I worked hard (maybe way too hard) and got pretty good (but could have done better) grades with average test scores. I had a very wide variety of interests, but to water it down to two main things, I loved listening to experiences and writing them down (hence why I wrote for the school newspaper and enjoyed journalism) and also loved science, especially chemistry and biology. I wanted to be a medical doctor to combine my love for human experiences and science, but also knew medicine was kind of a default choice for many, so I was open to figuring out my path in college rather than being fully decided. My vague game plan was to be a pre-med while majoring in some kind of an ethnic studies major. After not being accepted to my top school choices, I moved to another state to stay with family, which would still offer me in-state tuition. The only thing was, I planned to either go to the local community college or just stay at the school for two years to transfer. The majors I applied at other schools weren't offered and there wasn't much diversity, which was a bit of a priority for me as a minority. 

Anyway, I actually found out on summer orientation that I got into this health program at my school which was well known in the local area and considered prestigious and selective. I was nervous because this major is a pretty specific path and I didn't know if I was ready to decide by the age of 17 what I want to do for the rest of my life. But seeing my parents eager (although they usually don't pressure) and having doubts about my mental capacity and intelligence in being a medical doctor along with the fear of not having a viable plan B, I decided to stick to the program. Another thing that helped was after a year and a half of not making friends, I finally met some laid back, seemingly fun folks from my major who formed a little study group with me. and was starting to feel like I was belonging at school.

But by the 3rd year when my official graduate level studies began, things started to change. My ""friends"" were becoming increasingly cold and aggressive. They'd put their own frustrations on me and when I'd try to help them with problems, they'd get angry when they weren't getting the right answers. They knew I liked being helpful, so when they needed notes or something when they had another appointment to go to, I'd give them mine. Eventually ""one appointment"" became 3-4 days of not showing up to class for weeks in a row and asking me for notes and homework became routine. In fact, one of my friends kept ""forgetting"" to do her homework and when I started turning it in early to have her not copy it, she'd say ""next time, don't turn it in early"". 

I started to become depressed since these graduate studies began. My grades went from a 4.0 in my first years to an increasingly dramatic fall after getting many B's and C's. I started to see a therapist, but I had no idea what to explain. I had mild depression and anxiety since I was young and other issues going on at home (family illnesses), that I focused on as well as telling her I was upset that my friendships weren't working out and that I was feeling lonely and isolated as a minority when what was a bigger thing here that I didn't articulate at the time was that, for the once very passionate and ambitious person I used to be, I wasn't feeling passionate at all and I was even considering taking a semester off, but couldn't bring myself to not graduate on time. I was trying to convince myself that passion isn't important and that I have to be realistic that every job gets boring, so my main priority should be on stability and money, based on what kind of an attitude I collected from my peers. I felt simultaneously bored but guilty, because I had a shining opportunity in front of me but I wasn't into what I was studying. Despite everything, I did go through all the motions of studying: pulling all-nighters, taking notes, trying to look for an internship. To note, an internship in my program is students working in the same environment, doing the same thing. The only pre-requisite employers were looking for was that you were an enrolled student at an accredited program. I had gone through e-mails, direct visits, manager calls and mock interview practice; 10x more than what other peers who got internships were doing. For my peers struggling alongside me, I volunteered to mention their names alongside mine in e-mails to managers, which I realize now is something nobody would have most likely done for me. Eventually, those peers got jobs, probably through their own efforts of contacting, while I struggled until my very last year trying to find one. 

I was burning out and losing sight of what I was doing. I was unable to answer ""what made you want to do your major?"" when people asked. In the beginning, it was something about my own experience with an autoimmune disease and my love biological sciences and passion to understand people's experiences, but with the lack of empathy from my friends and the insinuation that we were the smartest kids in school, I felt that what I was supposed to do wasn't to understand people viscerally but know that I have authority. Most people didn't even ask why I chose what I did because when they'd hear what I was doing; they'd just say things like ""you don't even have to worry about grad school like we all have to!"" or ""you'll be making money when you graduate while we'll be out here broke"". I'd pretend to laugh, but inside I'd get so much anxiety being reminded of my troubles finding an internship, my grades dropping and being with friends who weren't interested nor passionate about anything except one-upping each other on exams or graduating and showing off their degree to people. I started to join groups outside of my college to distract myself, volunteered a little or attended after class lectures, which made things more bearable. 

However, unfortunately, by just going to class/distracting myself, I wasn't seriously preparing for the reality of the real-world. I could find an internship, which was the biggest factor next to getting my degree for getting job prospects, and what I was also realizing was that my major was undergoing a shift where there were far too many graduates than there were jobs. Before, anybody could find a job and jobs were considered relatively ""cozy"", doable work schedules and good pay. But later, I was learning that this was no longer true and my classes and the classes to come are sort of the first ""guinea pig"" classes to experience the consequences of the shift. I enrolled in a dual-degree program, assuming it would widen my prospects, but after two classes, I realized it wasn't for me and that it probably wouldn't do much unless I really found an internship with some managerial role. 

It wasn't until my last year, which was a full year of practical experience in six different settings, that I kind of got a glimpse of the real world. I started working closer with faculty after one experience, and in fact had opportunities to give presentations related to my interests and was able to present them to the entire department. I started to gain a feeling that I was finally doing things meaningful to me and was excited about this more than ever. One of my professors even used one of my presentations (with my permission) in one of her own presentations as a visiting faculty member at another school. I expressed my enthusiasm to my main supervising professor and made initiatives to make some of his classes better. When the time came to ask for a letter of recommendation for a program I wanted to apply to my main professor flat out refused. I was shocked beyond belief and upset. When I asked him why, he said ""I didn't do anything special to deserve a letter of recommendation"". I take constructive criticism and my capabilities/weaknesses seriously, but he didn't give concrete evidence as to why he rejected to write me a letter. The other professor who used my presentation for her own said to me ""I would write you one, but I would have to mention several weaknesses, one being multi-tasking"". She cited a time I turned down to help her with something because I told her it coincided with a main activity my main supervising professor had me do. 

I tried to see what other kids in my class who seemed to get along better with professors were doing, to see what I was doing wrong, and many seemed to develop a rapport with professors that seemed like friendships: happy hours, helping them move in/out of stuff from their houses...you know, like friends do. I don't have a problem with that, I guess I never thought to do it because I never got along with my professors like that. But I guess that also illustrated that maybe I was stand-offish or not friendly? I don't know.I found another professor to write me an LOR from another science department who I had experience teaching with who really seemed to encourage me and make me feel like I'm good at what I'm doing, but since he was not directly associated with the practice areas of my major, his word didn't have much weight as much as the others.

Ultimately, with the job ordeal going on in my major, the lack of faculty support, the lack of friends support (there's far more to my friend's advantage taking that would make this post longer than it already i) plus a family illness at home, I graduated with major depression and anxiety. My family was initially upset with me telling me I was being ungrateful, but when they would see the physical impact of my mental health plus watching me apply to a ton of jobs with no interview responses, and after confirming with family friends who were in the same field, they started advising me to take it easy. I've taken a long time off (maybe time I should have taken off during a semester at school) and in between done some remote volunteering, cared for my family member who is luckily recovering, applied to jobs, had my resume revised, gotten in touch with other faculty and old supervisors and have started to look at alternative pathways and while I'm still struggling to find a job, I think my health is improving now that I have some idea of an alternative game plan for me. 

However, I can't say my depression/anxiety is completely gone and still have trouble finding motivation. I'm taking a path that is different and sort of unprecedented than what my peers are doing and I'm filled with anxiety somedays thinking I will fail and uncertainty as I 100% don't know what I'm doing.  I still have occasional trouble sleeping, difficulty being focused and organized, but everyday, I am trying to do a little something to get back into a routine with exercise, household chores, etc. 

After my long spiel here, I appreciate everybody who has taken the time to read this and was also wondering if any of you here have experienced burn-out or a situation similar to mine. How did you identify it was burn-out, or a mental health issue and did you take time off? How did it help? Any other methods or self-help books for this kind of a situation would also be useful."

In 2012, I graduated from a private college with a Bachelor of Science and majors in Computer Science and Philosophy. Prior to graduating, I had worked as a medical transcriptionist, technology support specialist, college tutor, software quality assurance intern, and business intelligence design intern. After graduating, I started my first full-time position at an energy company as an SAP developer, specializing in SAP CRM after a year. I have designed, developed, and supported a number of enhancements and new solutions, including interfaces with and processes within other systems including Oracle databases and a billing/enrollment/EDI application.

I love what I do and the people I work with. I have enjoyed the opportunity to learn SAP and my business area deeply. However, I feel that I may be becoming too comfortable and running out of room to grow at the pace that I prefer. While I still love designing large and complex SAP solutions, the task of developing them feels less creative and more like routine. I miss feeling like a beginner. Also, I fear that I’m becoming too specialized with my technology and business area. I may want to move in a few years and would like to have skills and experience that support multiple career options. And so, I think that it may be time for a new challenge.

A data modeler from my company recently retired. Having worked with him when I was a BI design intern, I remember respecting him and being interested in his work. Rather than focus on one business area, he worked with many business areas and translated their requirements into technical implementations that supported their decision-making. He did so utilizing a wide array of technologies including Oracle, SAP, and BI applications. At my company, compared to my position, data modeler is at the next, and top, proficiency/compensation level.

I expressed interest in filling his position and it sounds like it may be a possibility. Within my company, it would definitely increase my current and potential compensation, but does it seem that it would be a good fit for me? Provide the creative technical challenges and rapid growth that I like? Offer me the skills and experience to have a flexible career path? I discussed this with another data modeler at my company and he seems to think so. Long-term, I could see myself becoming less technical in a solutions architect position, becoming more technical in a DBA position, or staying along the same path of a software developer should it continue to challenge me creatively. I need more experience to know, but I would appreciate input from anyone who may have more experience or insight already.

Thank you."

I already have my heart set on a major, Computer Science, which I have a very strong background in, having started from a very early age.

Now I'm faced with a massive decision. There are two colleges that I wouldn't mind attending: College A, which is about an hour and 20 minutes away, has very nice facilities, and has an (allegedly) accredited game development track for the CS majors. It runs at $40k yearly, after scholarships and housing and whatnot; and College B, a state school that's within commuting distance from home, is known for its CS program, and is considerably cheaper to attend than College A, at $5k a year.

Now, both colleges seem to be very good, but my problem is twofold: first and foremost is the financial issue. For College A, even if I were to get a job, I would still need to take out a sizable loan each year. I have an internship at a power plant next year, and that has the potential to be quite high-paying if it evolves into a job, but I still would have the debt hanging over my head for several years after I graduated. The next portion of the problem is the social aspect: I think living away from home would be a healthy start to the transition of actually moving out, when the time comes. If I were able to commute each day, it would be cheaper than living on-campus. Also, two of some of my closest friends wish to attend College A; one seems to have his heart set, the other is still deciding, but likes the school a lot. I know I could easily live without them, what with Skype and all.

My current mindset is that if I were to attend College A, I would need to seriously haul ass about securing/working a job to start paying off my student loans, both before and after graduation. I REALLY don't want to put those off longer than I need to. However, if I were to attend College B, I would only need to worry about student loans for a few months, assuming I am working even a mid-low paying job, but I would lose out on the facilities and the focus-specific courses.

Any and all advice would be appreciated, I've been wracking my brain to try and find which is the right path to take between idealism and reality.

Edit: Didn't downplay some issues quite right."

31elvc,2,2015-04-04,My internship/co-op is making me miserable and I don't know what to do,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31elvc/my_internshipcoop_is_making_me_miserable_and_i/,"Hey guys. I'm getting into a huge dilemma right now with my career. 

Currently I am a junior in college. I'm going for a Computer Engineering degree. Last semester, I co-oped (I always just say internship because for some reason I feel like some people don't know what it is, so I apologize) at a company that was my dream job. However, the experience quickly became miserable. I did not get along with my boss at all. He constantly degrades me, badgers me, discourages me, and just has the absolute worst attitude with every aspect of life. Some examples are: 

1) FIRST conversation I had with him on the job was him telling me how absolutely horrendous my thank you letter was. He held nothing back, and continued to tell me that it hurt my application instead of helping. Okay... strange, but whatever.

2) He told me that he thought I only had ""a 10% chance of succeeding in my co-op rotation"" and that he had absolutely no faith in me doing well. Well, why would a manager risk his job to hire someone incompetent? It's the real world - he didn't need to hire me if this was the case.

3) Everyone at the company is required to use Google Hangouts, so the team I'm in communicates through this. My boss will message me on Hangouts, and there are times where - kid you not - if I do not answer within 30 seconds, my boss will send me 6 more messages freaking out that I do not respond.

4) Attitude. I'm so grateful to co-op where I do, and am very happy every day (unless said person wants to bring my mood down) at work. There have been countless times where I will pass my boss and say ""Good morning, how are you?"" and get a ""Fucking awful, thanks for asking."" response. Obviously as an adult, I don't let emotions get in the way of work, but I'm sure everyone else can agree that misery loves company. 

This being said, my boss pushes me -- what I feel to be an insane amount... Especially relative to the other people co-ops I worked with. My co-worker say its because my boss sees potential in me and wants to get me to my full potential. I enjoy this sometimes, but other times, I get absolutely insane deadlines that my boss knows that I cannot meet, and everyone in my group even knows aren't realistic. I'd give examples, but I'm trying to keep the wall of text here to a minimum. If examples would help, just ask and I'll obviously deliver.

----

Now to school. This semester is a disaster. I had financial issues in my family, so I had to find somewhere very far off campus to live by myself, which I hate. It's just completely throwing me out of my routine, and my grades are awful this semester. I totaled my car the other week, which makes commuting to school even harder. I had health issues earlier this semester which threw me off with my studies... which brings me to what is driving me up a wall: my boss hounds me non stop about my GPA, which I'll be the first to admit, is not good. However, to be fair, my first two semesters of college, I got a 2.02 and 1.92 GPA. The fact that I have not made up any classes and am at a 2.6 with only 3 courses outside of engineering/math/etc makes me confident. I mean, I have a co-op at a respectable (imo) company.

It probably sounds silly that I do not care to take ""blow off"" courses in order to boost my GPA. Each person that attends college either pays for it with their own money or obviously someone in their family. Considering I am paying a decent amount of it, I'd much rather gather as much information in science/math/etc courses instead of some blow off elective. I don't see how this will help me in the long run. It may make it harder for me right now, but I am too eager a learner to really care. I've tried to take a 'blow off' course and found myself literally doing nothing for it and getting a bad grade in it, since I found it to be a waste of my already expensive tuition. 

This being said, ever since my co-op, I've become a lot better at programming and do a *lot* of it in my spare time. I'm finding that I loathe my actual programming courses.. I cannot bring myself to put effort into them. Compounding the fact that my boss is going to ""have an aneurysm"" because of my grades (he always makes this cruel joke), I'm just becoming so discouraged. I know that I am more than competent at this point in school to succeed in an internship/co-op. It's really sad that I'm considering looking for another co-op because I am just becoming so depressed thinking about going back to working for my miserable boss. I am very lucky in the fact that someone that I work with told me that I don't ever need to hesitate to use him as a referral for any job(s) in the future -- he is higher up in the company than my boss, which makes me feel somewhat content. 

I just don't get why I'm getting such the ass end of the stick. I have many friends/acquaintances who have co-oped/interned and said that they never had to go through so much torture. I know it may be difficult for myself to be credible here since no one knows me obviously, but I at least have been praised by all of my co-workers many times for my work. They are all decently blunt, so they would tell me if I was doing a poor job. 

All of this put together, I have no idea what to do. I'm beginning to hate my degree because of the programming assignments boring me. Because of this, I'm switching to Electrical Engineering (which is pretty similar to COE at my university, just more physics courses, which will help boost my GPA). However, in the eyes of my boss, my GPA is perpetual garbage, and my boss makes my days as miserable as possible. I don't think that it's fair that I'm receiving B's and A's in my math/physics courses (I'm a math major as well &amp; my math GPA is decent -- I'm also one of those people who get programming insight through math) but I know I will be torn apart for getting C's in my programming courses, even though I will be switching from COE to EE. I know that my boss will, as usual, find a way to spin the tables on me and tell me that regardless if I hated it or not, regardless of the mayhem of this semester, etc etc, that I should have gotten an A in all of my courses.

What should I do? It's literally eating me alive thinking about going back for another co-op rotation...

Now it's been a few months since I've done any programming and I'm starting an IT support internship in the summer.  There won't be any programming involved in the internship, but I'd like to learn concurrently and possibly use what I know to automate tasks. 

I guess my questions are:

* How do I keep learning?

* Is there anything specific I should learn for an IT support role?

* What did you do to get out of a rut of learning and keep going?

Personal Issues:

I know some people say to include ""personal matters"" on your application, but I'm not sure how to do that or what to include. 

From the time I was 8 until I was 15, my mother took care of my grandparents 24/7. My grandmother had cancer, and my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease. They lived with us for nearly 4 years, and after my grandmother passed away, my grandfather moved into a nursing home and we spent probably 40-50 hours a week there with him. This was very, very, very, mentally challenging watching someone you love gradually forget who you are and pass away barely remembering you.

My parents are extremely strict, no phone, no hanging out with friends, no talking to anyone, etc. This past year someone called CPS on them for emotional abuse. 

8th - 10th grade I was extremely depressed, and felt neglected from always being pushed to the side so my parents could take care of my grandparents. I had anorexia for 3 years and self harmed for 1. This is all in the past now, but it definitely impacted my school.

Are any of these things I should include? None of them were current, and I have changed a great deal, but I'm clueless about this process...so any advice would be great!

I don't know where to look for college. I'm interested in viola performance and something STEM related...possibly Physics or Comp Sci. 

I don't know what I'm qualified for....or what type of schools to look at.

My parents don't want me to go to college, and unless I move out this summer (which I'm planning to do, as I have saved money, and a job + paid internship scheduled for this summer and this fall respectively), they will never let me apply to college or even leave the house for anything. (Does moving out impact anything?)

Because of this I'm probably going to have to rely on scholarships and financial aid. 

I don't know where to look or what to look for....or anything in fact.

I'm sorry if this is pretty convoluted...but I really have no idea what to do or where to start.

Thank you for making it this far, and any advice you guys can give - I've been lurking for a long time, and this is a really helpful sub. 

Sorry again for the length. "
31fxxf,23,2015-04-04,TIFU by getting a kidney transplant,Radtastified,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/31fxxf/tifu_by_getting_a_kidney_transplant/,"So this happened in July of last year, but I told /r/transplant that I would post this.  Name's have been changed.

Backstory:

In March of 2013, I found out that my kidneys were operating at 20% AKA I had borderline renal failure.  I was 21 at the time and asymptomatic, so it was a shock to everyone.  My main symptom was high creatinine and protein in my urine but I didn't have high blood pressure or fatigue.   On April 10th, the day before my 22nd birthday, I found out that a transplant would be my best bet.  My doctors also wanted to get it done before I needed dialysis, so we had about 2 years to work with.  This was all happening in my last semester of college.  I was job hunting, taking exams, getting ready for graduation and that sort of stuff.

One of the best companies to work for (according to Fortune) was in my area and since it was a software company and that I was about to get my Bachelors of Science in IT, it made it my dream job.  I sent many, many, many applications to this place and didn't hear anything back.

I ended up having to go back to school for the fall semester due to my last class being canceled in the summer because of low enrollment.  My lease on my apartment ended, so I ended up driving about 4 hours two days a week to get that class done while living at my Mom's.

In March of 2014, I found out my cousin was a match to donate his kidney to me.  I just really want to note that this guy is absolutely amazing.  He's in his 40's and trains prison guards for a living.  I'd only seen him maybe 3 or 4 times in my entire life before he decided to get tested.  His reason being that he wants his life to be like the ending of ""Saving Private Ryan"" where he could look back and know he made a difference in someone's life.  He doesn't have anything to do with the FU, but he needs to be recognized for the gift he gave me.

My transplant was in late June because my cousin wanted to wait until two of his sons were done with school.  One was graduating high school and the other was graduating college.  I was still looking for jobs, but I hadn't tried the dream company in awhile.  I completed an internship in the later half of 2013, so I looked at dream company's website and saw an opening for an entry QA job and applied.

The transplant went great for me!  I stayed in the hospital 6 days with very little pain.  I got extremely nauseous from my medicine at first but that was over after 3 days.  My cousin had a rougher time because he had a fluid packet that needed to be drained, so he had to be opened up again in late July (on his 25th wedding anniversary).  My parents and I stayed in the waiting room the entire time that happened.  He's all good now though.

The FU:

2 weeks after the surgery, it was time to take my bandage off my incision.  My transplant coordinator told me to call if anything looked unusual.  So I went in the bathroom, took my bandage off, and it looked pretty disgusting at the bottom because it hadn't completely healed and there was this white stuff covering part of the opening.  I thought it was infected, but I got a shower just to make sure it wasn't part of the bandage.  I got out and it still looked bad.  So I called the hospital and my transplant coordinator was on vacation.  They took my number and said that the on-call coordinator would call me right back.

Not even a minute later, my phone rings and a guy with a heavy foreign accent is asking for me.  A good number of the doctor's that saw me had foreign accents when I was in the hospital, so thinking that this is the coordinator, I start telling him that I had a kidney transplant and described my nasty incision with the pus looking substance on part of it.

He then says, ""Uh....This is Juan from Radtastified's Dream Company"".

I died.  I had no idea what to do, so I just start hysterically laughing like a hyena!  He was calling because he wanted to schedule a phone interview.  I explained everything to him and we  were both laughing by the end of the call.  I hung up and rolled all over my bed because I was so embarrassed.  I thought I had absolutely no chance of getting a job there now.

The coordinator did actually call while I was on the phone with Juan though.  My incision wasn't infected, the white stuff was healing tissue.

Anyway, the phone interview was later that day and I didn't say crap about my transplant even though I was looking for a place to talk about it.  I was way too nervous because not only was Juan on the phone, but also JUAN'S MANAGER, Angela.  I ended up making my entire ""Thanks for the interview"" email about my last year dealing with kidney disease while I was graduating, doing an internship, and dealing with an extra semester of school.

I got a call to schedule a face to face interview the next morning.  I've been working at my Dream Company since August 18th of last year and have had a very productive 7 months.  I'm currently the QA Lead on two projects and Juan says I am most likely going to be promoted next year if I keep it up.

TL;DR:  Told someone I thought was my transplant coordinator about my nasty looking incision.  Turns out it was a manager wanting to setup an interview at my dream company.  Nailed it!

31g3ic,1,2015-04-04,From SAP developer to data modeler? Looking for career advice.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31g3ic/from_sap_developer_to_data_modeler_looking_for/,"Hello. I am looking for career path advice.

In May 2012, I graduated from a private college with a Bachelor of Science and majors in Computer Science and Philosophy. Prior to graduating, I had worked as a medical transcriptionist, technology support specialist, college tutor, software quality assurance intern, and business intelligence design intern. After graduating, I started my first full-time position at an energy company as an SAP developer, specializing in SAP CRM after a year. I have designed, developed, and supported a number of enhancements and new solutions, including interfaces with and processes within other systems including Oracle databases and a billing/enrollment/EDI application.

I love what I do and the people I work with. I have enjoyed the opportunity to learn SAP and my business area deeply. However, I feel that I may be becoming too comfortable and running out of room to grow at the pace that I prefer. While I still love designing large and complex SAP solutions, the task of developing them feels less creative and more like routine. I miss feeling like a beginner. Also, I fear that I’m becoming too specialized with my technology and business area. I may want to move in a few years and would like to have skills and experience that support multiple career options. And so, I think that it may be time for a new challenge.

A data modeler from my company recently retired. Having worked with him when I was a BI design intern, I remember respecting him and being interested in his work. Rather than focus on one business area, he worked with many business areas and translated their requirements into technical implementations that supported their decision-making and actions. He did so utilizing a wide array of technologies including Oracle, SAP, and BI applications. At my company, compared to my position, data modeler is at the next, and top, technical proficiency/compensation level.

I expressed interest in filling his position and it sounds like it may be a possibility. Within my company, it would definitely increase my current and potential compensation, but does it seem that it would be a good fit for me? Provide the creative technical challenges and rapid growth that I like? Offer me the skills and experience to have a flexible career path? I discussed this with another data modeler at my company and he seems to think so. Long-term, I could see myself becoming less technical in a solution architect type position, becoming more technical in a DBA type position, or staying along the same path of a software developer should it continue to challenge me creatively. I will need more experience to know, but I would appreciate input from anyone who may have more experience or insight already.

Thank you."
31gb1x,13,2015-04-04,TIFU by snapchatting my friend from a bathroom (NSFW),[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/31gb1x/tifu_by_snapchatting_my_friend_from_a_bathroom/,"Happened on Tuesday, have actually lost sleep over how awkward this is.


Background #1: I'm a college student and I've spent a few weeks applying for internships. This is the story of my first interview.


Background #2: My long-time best friend sends me a variety of funny snapchats throughout the week, but every now and then he'll slip something positively vulgar by me, like his crinkled, sweaty face while taking a shit. That horrible image is exactly what I received the night before my interview.  


Background #3: I basically live on a diet of rice, beans and veggies. I put a little more corn in my last batch than usual.


You may have a vague idea of where this is going. 


Tuesday morning. I arrived at a fairly large accounting firm in downtown Boston for my first interview. It went very well; I appeared confident, knowledgeable about the job and even made a couple off-the-cuff remarks that my interviewer laughed at. I felt really good about it. We shook hands and I tried to make my way back to the entrance of the building. The building is huge though, and in my euphoria, I actually forgot the exact route from his office to the front. I decided I didn’t really care if I was “lost” or not and simply decided to walk around and the observe the company I may soon be working at. 


Nature struck my bowels shortly thereafter. Hard. Like “I can’t wait to get home, this thing is going to be birthed right now” hard. I was in a random hallway by this point and found my way into a small bathroom. And I gave birth. In accordance to my background info #3, this baby was delivered a bit more… corny than usual. A combination of displaced joy from the interview and a desire to get back at my friend led to the worst decision I’ve made this year.


I whipped out my phone and went into snapchat. I framed my masterpiece, even pressing the focus button to ensure the contrast of brown/yellow was as shocking as possible. But it still didn’t seem raunchy enough. I decided to make it into a video, and shouted the following phrase in narration:


“UGH! Talk about a corn-ucopia! *WOW!!!*”


By this point, I thought my creation was hysterical. I was proud of it. It made me giggle. Not just the video, but the dump itself. Well-formed, healthy looking, a nice float, and the best part - virtually no cleanup required after. So… I just left it there. No TP in the bowl, just pure log. I wanted the next person to marvel at my peak performance. I reasoned that they would be so impressed, they wouldn’t even be offended. With no need to wash my hands, I went to push open the bathroom door. But you know that weird burst of shock you feel when you try to push a door open at the same time as someone else on the other side?


It was obviously my interviewer, because there is no justice for a good poop. I was startled, as was he. I hadn’t even closed snapchat yet. It was on the contact selection screen, in my left hand.


“Oh!- Heh, hello...”

“...”


I couldn’t speak. There was absolutely no reason for me to be in such a random part of the building 20 minutes after my interview. In one flash moment, I realized everything wrong I had just done. Never in my life have I attempted to send a snap like that. Shit actually grosses me out... so I'm not really sure why I got so into it. I threw my hand into my pocket and walked past without saying anything, almost brushing up against his chest. 


""Why did I do that, why did I do that..."" on a loop in my mind. I realized he was going to find my log, that I couldn’t go back and flush it, and he probably saw snapchat open on my phone as well. I ran as fast as I could back down the hallway until someone saw me. Then I stopped running instantly and tried to transition back into a cool walk. Awkward feels 11/10 at this point and I still don’t know where I am in this clusterfuck of a building. I eventually found a stairwell and exited via the parking garage.


0-1. 2 more interviews next week. 


**TL;DR** nailed an interview, used company bathroom to take a massive dump, snapchatted it to a friend, left it in the bowl and bumped into my interviewer walking in on the way out. "

Usually I am very good with this stuff, so initially he doesn't really belive me and I show him on my computer. He tries it, and it doesn't work. Changes some code and it doesnt work. He calls a colleague and they both try for a solid half hour to integrate the freaking ad. Both slowly start loosing their minds, hacking angrily on the keyboard. Then it dawns on me.

We ""rewarded"" their effort with despicable and terrible behavior.

We should not have to be reminded that death threats are unacceptable, always serious, and never a ""joke"". Threatening to publicly release private/individual information (doxxing) is not tolerated. Threatening to take action against someone and causing them to lose their job simply because one has a difference of opinion with them is unprofessional.

We had a great opportunity to ask relevant questions and gain some insight into the hiring process but we failed miserably. Not only that, other recruiters and managers that observed today's horrible behavior may be less likely to participate.

The goal or r/cscareerquestions is to provide accurate information to prospective college CS/CpE/SE/IT students and future tech professionals. To achieve those goals we, the community, must behave in a polite, prudent, and professional manner. 

Moving forward, we will moderate our behavior accordingly with the aim of restoring the goodwill of those whose guidance and information we seek and need. Thank you for your attention and patience."

I'm a senior CS student who is graduating next month. I've been searching since about January. I just want to break down my job search so far and see what you guys think and get some feedback about what I can do to improve my chances because I really want to get a full-time job.

Here's some things about me:

* [Resume](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=8d5162a7bb7e8c0!41788&amp;authkey=!AM4CwmajnjaR7lo&amp;ithint=file%2cpdf)
* Senior CS student (graduate next month)
* One internship that lasted one year. Currently have part-time developer job on campus (official title: web developer assistant)

So far here's been the breakdowns of some the interviews I've had:

* One ""Big 4"": Two phone interviews. Rejected (I did pretty poorly on technical questions)
* ""Big"" gaming company: Did programming test, then skype interview. Rejected after skype interview (Said they wanted someone that fitted their needs more)
* One in person interview (Felt interview went well, but didn't get a call back)

Other than that I've had plenty of those first time talks with recruiters from local companies but all of them seemed like they wanted some one immediately and told me they'd call me back closer to my graduation.


As far as my job search goes I've mainly been trying to use my school resources and some job boards (mainly indeed. some times github jobs, stackoverflow careers).

I think my job search is may be too focused on out of state companies that I probably have a lower chance of getting interviewed. A lot of times when I'm looking on indeed I'm looking for out of state companies with recognizable names.

When I'm applying to jobs I almost use the same resume. I some times add a few things if I feel like it would help me with a particular posting but that's it. I always submit a custom cover letter. 


So, with all that being said, what's your critique on my resume? What do you think of how I am job searching? What things can I do improve my job search? Please let me know if you need more info or are confused about something I've said."

I got the cswa certification because it was free for a month. Would it be work the money to get some more of those? Cswa-s for fea stuff or cswp or any others? They aren't super expensive individually but there seem to be quite a few so I can't afford them all. 

I saw the MATLAB certification is super expensive but signed up for a programming in MATLAB course through coursera. Do engineers generally find that coursera or edx stuff is beneficial on a resume? Is it worth the small fee to get the official certificate for the course? Any other recommended  courses similar to those?

Any other suggestions or information would be really appreciated as well. I'm married and hoping to have a kid when I graduate so I'd like to do everything possible that will help me land a good job in addition to the more ""obvious"" get good grades and do internships.

Thanks in advance!"

Recently, she's been causing some trouble for my family to the point where most people are fed up with her. 

She regularly bullies my other sister (11) by saying things like, ""Dad doesn't even want you here; I hope Mom gets custody of you.""  

Though she has a job, she continuously tries to manipulate our Aunts and parents into giving her money and everyone in the family is working hard to save money to help our sick grandparents and has little money to spend on anything else.

Lately, she's been going through a phase where she believes that she's mature for her age. This has led to her ceasing all socialization in her high school and hanging out with an older crowd. She has begun to see a 21 year old (she *just* turned 17) and though they've known each other for less than a week, she invited him over to our mom's house tonight, where she's supposed to be dog-sitting. 

Our mom is out of town for the week, and my sister is on spring break, so she has the house all to herself until our mom gets back. This guy she invited us over has already lied to her (though she doesn't believe us) by saying that he's an intern for one of the Marvel offices in the area (there are none). He's also be sending her lewd messages and like I said, they've known each other for less than a week and he's at my mom's house with her.

I want to help her be more considerate of other people and let her know that this person she's seeing seems sleazy but I don't know where to start. Her behavior has made her difficult to tolerate within the family and around her school and she's had a history of sleazy boyfriends. My parents don't know how to communicate with her, my Aunts don't want to make it seem like we're questioning her maturity (in fear of her doing bolder things to try to prove herself), and she just thinks I'm her loser brother in community college (don't argue this. I promise you, she thinks very little of me).

**tl;dr My little sister is treating our family poorly and is in what seems like a sketchy relationship.**

How can we help her? Am I overreacting? "

In spring 2017 I'll have to complete an internship, after which I'll graduate and obtain my degree. I'd like to do this internship in the US, specifically in the Dallas/ft.worth/Austin area.

I have studied visas, organizations, scholarships etc. extensively, and contacted my college's international department, though going outside the EU isn't very common. I've also started scanning internship sites regularly.

Is it feasible at all to obtain an internship in the USA as a student? Especially if I'll have to do most of the work myself, since most organizations here focus on college education and not internships in the USA or focus on PhD students for research etc.

I also have questions concerning the timing: a lot of internships sites list internships (those that don't exclude international applicants) that take place a couple of months later. But as an international student obtaining a visa, arranging the trip and housing takes time. So I wonder if it is a good idea to contact them directly as well, since the time-frame when applying via internship sites is not very workable. Will my email/letter (including resume and stating my ambition) just get binned?

edit.: if there are subreddits more suitable for this question please let me know

I'm in the second last year of my undergrad studying comp sci and stats. Now I know that the usual advice is that one needs at least a masters to be a data scientist however I've somehow managed to secure two internship offers: one at Microsoft the other at an established startup (around 100 employees, a lot of exposure you've probably heard of them). In the past I've had a couple of software engineering internships at big tech companies.

So my questions are as follows:

* Do you think this is going to be enough to be considered for most entry level data science positions or will my lack of masters be held against me?
* As I acquire more industry experience, will my lack of graduate education still seen as a negative or eventually be ignored?
* I also have the option of graduating with a 1 year masters in comp sci (with a specialization in data science) with a single undergrad degree in comp sci. Would this be preferable over a double undergrad degree in comp sci and stats career wise?"

I am a grad student from a top school, got an internship offer from LinkedIn, and I liked the people and the project, I was happy and accepted it. 

It is 3 months long, They gave me accommodation, which would be shared ( 2 bed 2 bathroom apartment), which I thought was fine I am happy to share an apartment, I would get to know my colleagues, mix and mingle with other people in the complex, it would be good. 

Now, it turns out, we get a 2 bed 2 bathroom apartment for 4 people.... That means I have to sleep with someone in the same room. It may even be bunk beds. I don't want to sound like a brat, but I started phd in grad school after working for a while and I am 31 years old.  I have not shared a room with someone in 10 years, and this seems pretty ridiculous to me. It is also 'no overnight guests allowed', which is understandable if I am literally gonna be sleeping next to a colleague, I am not gonna bring a girl home. 

Isn't this ridiculous? I talked to people with internship at other places in SF, no one has ever heard of sharing rooms. Although I signed a contract already, I had offers from other top places and have pretty good relationships with the recruiters, I think I can get an offer back. 

I was excited for this opportunity, at the end of the day housing does not matter one's career, but I am thinking a bit bigger picture and now I am wondering if LinkedIn does not take their interns seriously...

Any thoughts?

31jcu5,2,2015-04-05,I struggle to live with my brother???,stevespringer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/31jcu5/i_struggle_to_live_with_my_brother/,"Alright people of reddit, I need your advice on how to handle this matter. I'm a 19 year old male, and my brother is a 17 year old male. I'm a good student in a great business program, and I am also super involved with every club at university, have a large friends group, etc. I think of myself as a good kid. My brother is currently in online high school, because he essentially skipped every class in the first year and a half of traditional high school. The reason for this is because of severe social anxiety, and he has seen a counsellor a few times in the past 3 months or so. The counsellor said that he has extremely low self confidence, and he was prescribed anti-depressants. He has had these types of behaviour all his life, for example, even now he wakes up around 11 every day and then takes a nap at 3. 

Despite his apparent issues, he destroys my quality of life in ways that don't even seem to be linked to his condition. Here are just some of the things he has done to me in just the past few weeks:
-I got home and told him I have a job interview for my DREAM summer internship. He didn't even once say good job, he just said ""well, you're not going to get it.""
-I have cooked every single meal since my parents left on vacation, yet he criticizes it EVERY time. The worst part is he thinks he's being tactful ""hey buddy, you should use a little less sausage next time""
-He absolutely berated me for spending $80 of the money my parents left us on a few meals for myself and two nights out. Yet I mentioned how he refused to go on a trip with my grandpa who already booked a $700 flight for him, and he just flipped out. Or how he bought 4 $60 ps4 games on my parents credit card.
-When I almost started crying during Furious7 (paul walker was my hero growing up) he said ""ugggh don't do this, shut up""
-Literally scolds me for everything I do. I was leaning forward in the BACK ROW of the movie theatre and he tells me to lean back.
-my dad, me, and my brother went out for a nice dinner before they left. There was a fucking piece of wood or plastic in our dessert, and the waitress claimed it was a ""pit"" and didn't comp us the dessert or anything, despite the fact that we were paying $35 a plate for dinner. This was a chocolate cake, which obviously doesn't have pits. When me and my dad were complaining about the poor service to each other in the car ride home, my brother flipped out on both of us.

My dad literally said ""your brother doesn't like you, you have to realize that and stop sucking in to it."" The hard part is that even though he doesn't show it, my brother NEEDS me. I'm basically his only contact with the real world outside of my parents and his one friend. He literally leaves the house about once a week. The weird part is he is crazy hard on me and my family, yet everyone else can literally step on his shoes and he wouldn't even say a word. Frankly, I usually try to get out of the house a lot because he just bothers me. The sad part is that he is actually hyperathletic and very smart. "

By the time I go off to college, I will have two internships, both involving developing software for two different companies. Unfortunately, I can not publicize this code as it belongs to the companies, not me. 

Ideally, I'd like to have my github looking good by the end of 1st semester (December/January) Which kind of projects should I go for? 

Just to give a background on my experiences, last summer, I developed an Android app that had to do with image display and manipulation, so I was mostly coding in Java for the app while formatting using xml. This summer I will be primarily using C# (which I've had experience with before) to develop a web app and communicate with a GPS module, in order to add some data to a database(SQL). I'm also hoping to start self teaching Ruby on Rails, but I'd love to do something that combines all of my abilities.

I was a fresh faced law student back then and I had been offered a pretty great internship in the government sector that would basically be magic dust to my CV. 
Needless to say I wanted to prove that I really really belonged there. 
So my daily work consisted of researching and a great big amount of  inputting new cases and their respective legal arguments etc into the database. Two months go by and I'm really looking like a model employee and the epitome of efficiency until this one day I go to my cubicle,  enter my password and the pc doesn't log in. I had a lot of stuff to do that day so I try twice, thrice and no luck. 
Now I'm pretty pissed that HR has changed the password on my pc already.(I was due to end my internship that week). So I tell my supervisor and she sends me to HR to sort it out. I go to HR and basically I just insult them on their ineptness. They follow me to my cubicle and tell me to log in. Again I can't log in. This happens about two times in front of them. So they send me to tech support. Again, I'm pretty curt and snarky and tech support is unable to help me. They say that they didn't change the password and that maybe I should try it with CAPS off. Again, I talk down to them for thinking I hadn't thought of that already.
This happens for the rest of the day and when I get home I'm effing pissed.
Fast forward to the next day. I type in my password and I'm signed in. That is when I realized I was using my personal laptop's password on the pc.
Now everyone from tech support to the office clerk happens to know about the whole fiasco and they are naturally curious about my ability to miraculously get the pc to work. I think they all probably figyred it out and were too kind to say anything. 
That was the last day I went to work. I took four paid leaves and never returned to the place.
TL;DR I screwed up. Was a bitch about it. Avoided the place like the plague afterwards.

31jxed,2,2015-04-05,"CS Junior Questioning Coding Skills, Internship, Life",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31jxed/cs_junior_questioning_coding_skills_internship/,"I am a CS Junior with an internship/part-time job near my school. I've worked there part-time during the semester so far (2/3 months or so) and all I've written are a few unit-test methods. Although there is an office with hardware engineers, other interns, some admin staff, etc, the office is really new, so all of our software mentors/managers are off in a different state. This sucks. Although we communicate frequently, (often we'll have multiple hour skype sessions with our manager) it still makes it hard to develop code, especially when we end up with unclear assignments working in unfamiliar frameworks. 

Anyway, I'm a little dissatisfied. I took the job because I need to make a lot of money to pay for college, and it's near my college and pays really well. Additionally, working there during the school year is very helpful financially as well.

So here's my quandry: I'm worried that, although this internship is helpful financially, it's setting me back by not giving me appropriate experience.


I'm worried about my abilities as a programmer. I frequently worry that I've ""slipped through the cracks"" and should have been weeded out freshman year. I do okay in school. My GPA is something like a 3.3 and my CS GPA is similar (it would be higher, but I failed a Data Abstraction class soph. year due to clinical Major Depression and my own dumbassery) but I just don't feel like I'm good enough at programming. I want to work on a side project, but I have almost no free time in which to do so. I haven't written a full application end-to-end by myself since freshman year, when I wrote a MUD.


I'm worried that I'll graduate, find myself unable to get, or satisfactorily perform at, a software engineering gig, and then...well, who knows?

I came in to college as a potential English major. I've always rocked literature, and I still have professors who try to get me to switch over to English. But, even money aside, I don't want to do English. I want to write code. But I'm worried that I'm falling behind and lack some intrinsic quality that's going to prevent me from doing what I really want to.


So: how can I make the most of my situation? Should I try to find a new software internship? What should I know and be able to do at this point in my education? What can I do to get better? Should I just jump ship and go in to...advertising, or some shit?"

 I am currently a CS student at the University of Washington. I have only finished my intro computer science courses, which involved only java. I feel pretty strong in java though. I have knowledge in JavaScript, psql, and html from self study, and basic linux sys admin stuff through one job I had in high school. I have applied for about 20 internships in Seattle, CA and NC. I have gotten denied by Google (not surprised there), and I was denied by Blizzard Entertainment. I am not restricting myself to only big named companies. I have applied to several start ups too. I have solved entry level java interview questions at home without much struggle. It would be nice if these places would email me back with at least a polite rejection. A family friend (who is a senior software engineer) even passed my resume over to a manager at a well known company who is looking for an intern, it's been over a week and he  nor a recruiter has emailed me, not holding my breath on that one. I just don't understand why I am not even getting one interview. Maybe my resume is rubbing these people the wrong way? Lacking experience? Should I be calling these companies as a follow up or showing up to the corporations like I'm trying to get some high school job, I don't know? When is the best time to apply for internships? It looks like I will find some part time job and work on my personal web application this summer and try again next summer after I have more classes under my belt. Also, does going to career/internship fairs help? Haven't bothered going to any of those yet.

He's got a big boy job making decent money and can afford to move out. But he says just doesn't want to live paycheck to paycheck. And I guess he doesn't understand that's how this kind of works when you're starting out.

I have a month and a half left before I have to move out there and we haven't even started looking at places. And now I'm freaking out because I might have to live with some craigslist strangers just to be able to do the internship. He breaks this whole thing on me four days after my grandma dies and I feel like I can't say anything because it will start a fight and I need a ride to the airport Thursday so I can go to my grandmother's funeral.

I'm trying to deal with all of this while also going to internship interviews which are so competitive and high pressure, finishing my research proposal, and getting ready for final exams and final projects. 

I feel like I'm about to lose it. It feels like this whole plan I had for our future is falling apart and all I can do is just watch because it's totally out of my control."
31l3wl,0,2015-04-05,NY I am having second thoughts about moving in with my roommates. What are my rights when it comes to moving out ?,BestMagikarpTatooine,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/31l3wl/ny_i_am_having_second_thoughts_about_moving_in/,"Hi there !
I am a foreign student doing a 5+ months internship in NYC. A couple weeks ago I moved in an house. A couple lives upstairs that I don't know. I live in a separate room downstairs and I share the kitchen and bathroom with a married couple who are only tenants, they do not own the place.

I have paid (and have receipts) for the ending of March, April, and a one month deposit. We haven't signed any agreement yet because the girl wanted time to draft it. She has drafted an agreement  ""from March 21st to August 31st"". I told her that in case one of us wanted me to move out, she should add a part stating that we would have to give a 2 months notice (to give me time to find another place and give them time to find a new roommate). She agreed to this but said she would have the agreement on Monday.

Now I'm having doubt about all this for several reasons : the couple are not very nice, they fight a lot (they're probably separating from what I understand), there is an unfixed dog that is not really easygoing (constantly tries to jump me, or bite my feet even if it's in a playful manner), etc. My question is, if I want to move out, what happens if :

* we still don't have an agreement (can they kick me out ? even if I already paid April + deposit ?)
* we have an agreement ""from March 21st to August 31st"" (can I even move out ? In which case how much of a notice do I need to give ? Will I have to pay for the whole ~6 months ?)
* we have an agreement stating that I have to give 2 months notice (can they kick me out vefore 2 months ? even if I already paid April + deposit ?)

Thanks in advance for your help :)"

I'm a current senior in undergrad (graduating Dec. 2015), and I'm starting to think about pursuing a graduate degree. 

I'm studying at a good school, not T1 but pretty good and we'll respected, and I've been doing quite well. I have a lot of teaching assistant positions as well as industry internships. 

I have a few concerns with going straight into industry. The first is that I do not know what subset of computer science is what makes me tick. And the second is that I'm worried that I would be bored with my work. 
My cousin works at one of the top tech companies in the world, and when I moat recently asked him about if he's working on anything interesting, he basically said that his work was quite boring. 

My professors have told me that if I get a graduate degree, when I move into industry I would work on more interesting projects and be challenged a lot more. Have people found this to be the case? 

On the other hand, I  won't have the chance to get any research experience while in undergrad. Thus, I am worried that I might not enjoy research once I am exposed to it. 

I guess my main question is this, would lacking a graduate degree block me out of upward mobility and/or interesting projects?

Today I noticed that my computer is reporting 12gb of ram, even though I've only upgraded to 8gb in the last 6 months or so. [Speccy](https://imgur.com/JtQ41r4) however reports 8gb. I also had what I believe to be a sata port gone bad, as one of my hard drives shit the bed until I moved it to a new port (and does an almost perfect smart test.) Then again this is a 4 year old HDD we're talking about so it could be dying too.


In addition, the audio port on the back of my motherboard stopped working, and occasionally (rarely) I get ""kernel power errors"", as said by event manager. That is, my computer just freezes. Mouse stops working, keyboard doesn't work, everything frozen in place. The only way to remedy it is by hard restarting the computer.


The thing is a trusty steed otherwise. Last summer I put in an R9 270x and new ram, and have no issue playing the games I want to play on mid-high settings. I'm just a little worried about this motherboard. 790x is pretty ancient as it is, and I'm stuck on old sata which means I don't get full speed on my SSD. Would you say these signs are signs of a motherboard soon to die? Are there any tests that I should run to affirm this?

The challenge was to parse urls into their protocol, host, and uri manually without using any modules like urlparse or urllib that did this for you.

31n295,27,2015-04-06,10 Questions you should ask every recruiter you speak with.,Pippen1984,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/31n295/10_questions_you_should_ask_every_recruiter_you/,"As a bit of background, I used to work in the university system as a teaching assistant, recruiter and administrator. I frequently had face-to-face interaction with prospective students. Invariably, I'd get questions about the required G.P.A., what test scores they were looking for, etc. Fair enough. I do think, though, prospective students need more information, and they're not getting it. Here are 10 questions I think you should be asking: 


*1: ""When was the curriculum last overhauled/updated?"" 


This should be priority #1. Most people think that universities are on the vanguard of their field. Truth is, except for a few programs, they are usually really out-of-date. Even top-tier schools. Since most of the non-professional schools have no need to keep-up with market trends, or employment statistics, they rely on a curriculum designed decades ago. Some were re-designed in the 1970s and 80s, some in the 1990s and some a recent as this year. Just because they have a course on andriod app development, or social media marketing doesn't mean the program is all that up to date. Find out. If they don't know, get them to find-out. 


*2: ""Who primarily teaches required courses?"" 


Increasingly, required courses (or ""core modules"") are being taught by graduate students and adjunct faculty. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, schools who are overly reliant on them as a source of instruction are often doing so because their full-time, tenured faculty are teaching at a reduced frequency. This can mean that valuable classes in a teacher's area of expertise are being taught by someone else. This can reduce the quality of your over-all education. 


*3: ""What kind of additional services do you offer your students? I'm thinking of counseling (academic), career planning, engagement/involvement.""


Many schools post banners for student politics, but are they engaged? Governments (State, Federal, Provincial, etc) often have throngs of summer internships, as do major corporations, NGOs, health care organizations, etc. Most people don't know how to access these resources. Your school should be actively involved in this. Most aren't heavily involved and students can go for 3 or even 4 years before finding-out about these options and how you can benefit!


*4: ""What are your meals plans like and what do they cost?"" 


Who cares about meal plans?! Well, many (if not most) university cafeterias are out-sourced to companies like Sodexo and Aramark. They can charge anywhere from $2,500 to $10,000 a semester for a meal plan. Now, what they term ""meal"" is a combination of food items priced at restaurant levels. The issue is that they usually don't offer comprehensive, well-balanced meals and focus rather on quick-prep items like burgers, fries and pre-made salads. Its often hard to find food that isn't extremely unhealthy, and since the cafeterias usually have reduced operating hours during holidays and weekends, people usually end-up eating garbage. The ""Freshman 15"" is often a direct consequence of a very rapid, and very poor, dietary change. If your school is offering an expensive meal plan, I recommend ensuring that you have alternative options. What's near the campus that you can use to augment your diet?


*5: ""Can I design my own major?"" 

Many, if not most colleges and universities, have that option. Often called ""Self-designed major"" or ""Special Individualized Program,"" students (usually outside of STEM) can elect to design a major of their own. It requires you maintain a specific GPA and meet very regularly with academic counselors, but can be an excellent option for those motivated enough. If you have a specific interest or goal, this may be the way for you to go. 


*6: ""What kind of campus medical services do you offer? Are they 24 hours?"" 


A big problem, not just for women, or for freshman, or people in very intense programs, or at-risk LGBT-Q students is mental health. Often, universities offer very rudimentary services. If you're very anxious, depressed or not feeling well, you need to see someone. What services do they offer? Is it referral-based? Do campus health insurance schemes cover their costs? Schools that offer an M.A. candidate from their clinical psych program often use this to cut costs and frequently don't run the gamut of (what I would call) necessary services.  Additionally, most students begin to regularly engage in sex, including oral, vaginal and anal. While it's tempting to push fate, a lot of people need more than just luck. Condoms, the pill, lubricant and some advice. Make sure the sexual health department isn't a bunch of students manning an office trying to tell you about sex (which, they've usually never engaged in.). Either an RN or an MD! Make sure they have decent services. 


*7: ""How are accommodations decided upon?""

People often ask what the accommodations are like, but not usually how they have a roommate decided for them. One of the single most stressful problems is a bad roommate. Often, people don't mesh, or they haven't lived on their own long enough to know how to be a functional individual. What you should do is find-out if you can move mid-semester and how they decide upon roommates. If it's a random draw, be leery. That's usually code for an accommodations team that isn't very active/engaged. 


*8: ""Who patrols the campus and how do you report campus-related crime?"" 

Even with the Clinton-signed amendment in the US and crime reporting in Canada, campus crime reporting varies widely and is not necessarily a great barometer of the campus environment. Often, the campus security is loathe to deal with petty crime, or aggressive students. A recruiter is giving you a song-and-dance about their ""community"", but read their crime statistics. If they seem incredibly low, be dubious. Many of these universities (often with 15,000 to 20,000 students plus faculty and staff) and have a crime rate that's 1/100th of a city of its size? Always get those statistics. If they seem too good to be true: they are.


*9: ""What kind of learning support do you offer?"" 


This is important for more people than we may think. As an example, I had a student who had a common learning disability. Her mother was getting stone-walled wherever she called and so I ended-up getting her. She didn't know what services existed, because no one had told them. Even if you don't have a learning disability, why not know? Many times people have to take classes like calculus or advanced chemistry and it may require getting some help. Yes, there can be student tutors, or there may be more comprehensive help. It's better to know how to access the resources *before* you need the help. I would also recommend if there are professional services, that they should be your first stop. 


*10: ""I want to be a (fill in goals here) and want to study (program). Is this a good idea?"" 

Ask. Ask. Ask. Many career counselors at the school can guide you. So, you want to be a doctor. Pre-med, right? WRONG. Lawyer. Pre-Law? WRONG. Much of what people think are great tracks to their goals are a mistake. Do you think that universities haven't seen ten thousand other political science graduates with a minor in Latin applying to law school? Don't do something because it may get you where you want to go. Figure-out where you want to go and how you can make it there. A great option for medicine may be Anthropology with a minor in health sciences (for instance). Maybe Russian &amp; Economics for law. There are lots of options. You have to figure-out what interests you and how you can best do it. Don't do something you may dislike because you think it's the best option. Because, it's usually the worst. "
31n4a7,7,2015-04-06,[Advice] I feel like I have the opportunity to do amazing things in life but I have no idea how to accomplish them,Sheehan7,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/31n4a7/advice_i_feel_like_i_have_the_opportunity_to_do/,"Right now I am 18 years old in the US and attending community college for Information Technology and plan to transfer soon and get a 4 year degree. However I just feel like I have the potential to do so much more. 

I feel like I got a late start in education and life in general. I was pretty bad at school starting in catholic middle school and throughout high school. I wasn't a bad kid never getting in trouble but I got abysmal grades (hence why I am in CC). Around senior year of HS I realized how stupid I was and how we only get one shot at life and I was wasting it. I have started to exercise more, read more books (Chris Hadfield's An Astronauts Guide to Life On Earth kind of inspired this post), and trying to be better at school. 

I have a lot of things I want to or could do. Part of me wants to join the Navy or Air Force and fly planes and then work for NASA because I have a huge passion for space, health is great, etc. Then the other part of me wants to work toward becoming a police officer like my dad. And then the sensible part of me wants to work in the IT field. Engineering was a thought but I am in pre-college math (because I fucked up in HS and didnt pass the placement test for math). My professors tell me I am doing great, I'm ahead of schedule by more than a month, and after next semester I will go into regular college math classes. I enjoy math and can understand it to an extent but stuff like physics and calculus scare me out of engineering because I have never taken anything close to that level of math. Will I be good at it? Will I enjoy it?

Another big factor in all of this is finances and timing. I have only done a year at CC which is about $5,000 but If I change majors to engineering this whole year, and that 5 grand, would be for nothing. I also am in a decent enough spot financially family wise where I don't get a lot of aid but I don't make enough to pay out of pocket so I am just barely passing by with the money I get from loans. 

I just really don't know where to turn. One part of me thinks I will be good at IT work and I can do it easily. The other part says well why not do something fun and take a chance at being a pilot or astronaut or in the police force? I just don't want to look back on my time here and think I should have done something else. However all of these things; NASA, military, IT, police, are so far apart and I am running out of time I just need some help here. 

On top of all that I am feeling really down because I just can't find a job right now and I really want to get an IT internship to test the waters but I can't find any wherever and who ever I talk to. I'm up the creek without a paddle here and I have no idea what to do. On top of that too today is the day where class signups start for the fall semester and I basically am out of time to decide what to do with life or at least it feels that way."

Last year I decided to take a semester off and transfer from an expensive private uni to a cheaper one. In doing so, I have had to live with my mother. Hate is a strong word, but I feel like I severely cannot stand her. She is ghetto, negative, reacts rather than thinks rationally, financially incompetent, and just overall a fucking idiot. Growing up with her was a living hell. Every day she came home from work, I was yelled at or hit. Everyday. among other things. Going away to college was the best thing that could've happened but I wasted away my first two years by having a shitty negative attitude, which I realized was inherited from her.

Since figuring this out I have tried my hardest to be a positive happy person and changes the things about myself I didn't like. Everything was going fine until I started to live with her again, after two years of freedom living in dorms. Even after transferring, I have spent my first semester at my new school being a commuter. I was talked into it by my sister who said the refund check I got could be used to buy a car, and with a car I'd have more freedom and job prospects and then after that I could live on campus and work, or work and have an apt with a roommate. 

I listened to her and used my refund check for a car, but I honestly regret everything. I wish I just lived on campus, got a shitty job, and just saved up over maybe a year or so to buy a car. Not only do I have more in student loans, but my car is an absolute piece of shit. It is a salvage title, and they sold it to me without telling me all of the REAL problems it had. I've paid 2.3k on the car and have spent another 2k on repairs, and will have to spend another 1.6k on repairs that may or may not fix the problem that needs to be solved so I can pass a special inspection and get a refurbished title and license plates. I have been illegally driving to and from school with a car I'm technically not supposed to be driving. If I get pulled over from the cops, my car will get impounded and I will be fucked. 

Not only has this been looming over my head, but I am sleeping on the floor of my mom's apartment on a shitty blowup bed in her ""office"" space. My mom acts old and helpless and makes messes and doesn't clean up after herself, and gets mad at me and expects me to clean up after her. I buy my own groceries and clean up when I cook. I never make messes, and keep to myself. She can be home for days and not clean the kitty litter or take out the trash while I'm at school all day. I am not financially dependent on her in anyway, except that she keeps a roof over my head for me to sleep, poop, shower, and eat. I paid her almost 800 dollars for the last few months her her letting me stay here, which I admit isn't much but its something. I'm in fucking college.

She now wants me to buy a bunch if things for the apartment and give her rmore money because she didn't go to a job fair and is working as a substitute teacher and may not afford rent anymore because her unemployment ran out. Yet she buys wine and chick fil a and lottery tickets and I don't see her applying for jobs or cold calling people, just waiting for teacher job fairs to show up. She woke me up very early yesterday yelling and freaking out at me that we need to clean the apartment because it smells. This reminded me of when I was younger, she'd basically beat me out of bed and yell at me and force me to church EVERY Sunday because I am an atheist (which is basically social suicide for black people). If I use the oven, she freaks out about the bill. I started staying out more because I have a car, and damn it if I'm gonna stay home with her ass if I didn't have to. I'm also a STEM major taking hard classes, so there's no way I'm studying at home. Well after a while if this, she tells me she needs me home more often to help out. Well what the hell is she gonna do when I go back to living on campus? Also, whenever I'm sick she jokingly asks if I'm pregnant, but I don't think she's joking. I have a nagging feeling in the back of my head that she wants me to fuck up like she did, and like my sister did midway through her time in college. I don't think she takes me seriously when I talk about grad school or my career plans. I'm sure she doesn't even know what they are because I usually have to tell her things 59 million times. I just found out that until two weeks ago, she thought I was fluent in Japanese. Because my grandpa bought me a book as a kid and I used to speak words and watch anime. Like, she has told dozens of fucking people that I am fluent in Japanese. How the fuck do you not know your daughter doesn't speak japanese until she is 20 years old and has to tell you. 

I have a month left of this semester, and I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. Between the car and living with her again, I feel like something's going to make me snap. I can go years without seeing her and be the happiest little snowflake. I have no emotional attachment to her. I just want to leave. I've even considering living in my car and just showering and stuff at the school gym.  I'm afraid she's going to ask me to commute again next year to help her out. Would I be a horrible person to tell her to fuck off? 

I want to live my life, and I'm fucking sick of dealing with her. I want to cut her out completely. Actually my whole entire family. It's like no one has motivation. When I told my sister (who I love more than anything) about part time job ideas that I had that were related to my intended field (allied health) she suggested I take the easy route and just go back to my shitty management job at a food chain that paid 7.75/hr because the manager said he'd take me back anytime. Why the fuck would I do that and not challenge myself? 

I'm sick of being around my mom. I don't want to stay with her during breaks, I don't want to be physically near her ever again after this semester is over. 

Next year I'm going to have to do STEM full time, internships for grad school exp, two extracurricular activities (one sports and one an organization), and part time work all at the same time, and I don't think this will be possible livi.g with her. So that's more student loans to live on campus. 

I don't know what I'm asking, I'm just fucking mad. I've been getting increasing depressed. I haven't made many friends at my new school to hang out with, and my friends at my old one transferred and went back to their home states (old college has a high transfer rate unless you're rich and white). For obvious reasons, I can't have boys over, and anyway I've only recently realized this past few years that I'm a fucking awesome, gorgeous person who could get a boyfriend because guess who never taught their daughter how to look pretty and groom and do her eyebrows and makeup and hair? And guess who told her daughter all throughout her life the ""truth"" that men are bad and only want one thing? 

I have 2,000 dollars left of my refund check. Every month, I pay a little over 300 for my bills and groceries. After my last final in may, I have two weeks before summer classes and work. I plan to take a vacation out of the country by myself and tell no one until I am on the plane halfway there. Why? Because someone will convince me not to, that it's a waste of money, dangerous, what if I don't get financial aid for the summer, blahblahblah. And they might be right. But I could die in summer school. I could die next year. I'm sick of taking advice from family and not doing what I want in my heart. I'm sick of bad things happening and being around negative people. I'm sick of just existing and blaming my mom and living a boring life. I could use that 2k to fix my car. But then I'd only be able to pay my bills for a month, if I'm lucky. So fuck the car, I'll fix it later. And if I get pulled over, fuck it. 

Tldr: 20-something incoherently rants about life. Depression so bad she's beginning to yolo. Sage advice needed."

I'm a college junior in computer science and will be in the Bay Area this summer as a software engineering intern. I am really excited about machine learning and data science, but I didn't have very many significant projects for me to land a data science internship this summer. I am currently working on some Kaggle competitions and going through some tutorials on machine learning algorithms on the web.

This is my first semester here and I have six left before graduation (transfer student). I just recently applied for and obtained a position as a Content Developer for the digital signs around campus. I will be using python, php, vbbasic, MySQL, among others for the duties in my job. I hope to have this position for the next 1.5-2 years that I am going to be attending here. 

The problem is, is that before I had accepted this position after I had already started talking to my professor about being a TA for our schools Data Structures and Algorithm course. I want to do that, however I feel like it would be quite a bit to work as a developer, TA, go to school full time, as well as try and work on some side projects that I've been planning. I need the money and the developer position is $15 an hour and extremely flexible schedule wise. However, I recently spoke to the Google Rep for my school, a current student who has interned and been offered a position following their graduation, and they stated that almost 70% of hires by Google are former TAs for various CS classes. 

So my question is, does anyone know which would be better? Should I try and go for both or would have 2+ years of experience as a developer be a huge bonus already when I apply for my first full time position. I'm hoping to get internships with some big name companies in the distant future. "
31odw3,1,2015-04-06,A rather annoying situation,strugglefordayz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/31odw3/a_rather_annoying_situation/,"Last summer, I interned for a company but the internship was primarily industrial engineering based (I'm an electrical engineering major, junior). At the time it was the only internship offer I had, and they offered me another internship for this summer. I asked the HR department before I left if they could try and place me in a more  electrical engineering based department and they said they would do the best they could to try and make this happen. So they sent me an offer letter a few weeks after my internship ended and I signed it and returned it by late August. 


Around early January during Winter break, they called and told me that I would be placed in the same department I was in last summer. As a result, I applied for a couple other internships, one of them within my university in a research lab because the research seemed very interesting.


Now, I'm currently researching with a different professor but the lab I applied to is giving a paid internship. Both labs/professors want me to continue research into my senior year, and ideally I would love to do research for both. The only problems with the lab I am in now is that the PhD students I am working with have a difficult time explaining things to me because their english is limited, but I feel like this is a common issue since many PhD students are international. I've somewhat lost interest because of this since I feel I am doing things but not understanding why I'm doing them, but I am more than willing to give it another try in my senior year. The lab I would be working in for the internship would be better in this regard because I know the PhD students since they were the TA in a few of my previous courses and I feel I can gain a lot from spending a summer with them.


I just don't know how I would be able to continue volunteering as an undergrad research assistant for both labs, and I feel like the professors would want me to devote time to just one lab. I don't want to ditch my current lab because they really do try and help me and I feel it is very wrong to leave a lab after just one semester, but at the same time, I do want to join the lab with the internship since I really want some relevant internship experience (relevant as in, electrical engineering) and I feel I can gain a lot from that labs since I know a few undergrad students who have publications because of that lab. The internship I have from last year with the company would once again be industrial engineering based, and while I would rather work elsewhere, I did sign the letter...

So, what would you do in this situation? Am I just overthinking everything? Sorry for the very long post, and thanks for reading.


TL;DR - had industrial eng internship last summer, (i'm EE) and got offered internship by same company for this summer. Asked HR department for EE internship (and signed offer letter in August) but got same internship (found out in January). Applied for research internship with a professor and got it, but currently doing research with another prof. Don't think I can do research for both at same time during next school yr, and don't know if I should say no to company since I signed the offer letter."

And other general advice, please!",seanthelonghorn,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/31ogm3/what_is_some_general_advice_for_undergraduates/,"I'm a second-year undergrad at UT-Austin, and my goal has been to publish a paper before I apply to grad schools. I've been in a machine learning and data mining lab since last fall. 

I spent most of the fall semester learning what I needed to learn to be somewhat competent in understanding what was being talked about in the group meetings. This spring semester, I've been doing a lot of the same, but I've been hoping to work on a project that might eventually get published too. We have two projects coming in, but we're still waiting on funding from the grants. 

But so far, I've mostly done stuff like manage the group website, and playing around with different libraries on my own: things that don't directly lead to helping out on a paper. I mean if these projects end up coming through soon, that would be great, because I could at least work on it before this semester ends. But I wouldn't be able to work on the project long, because I have an internship at Google this summer, and I won't be able to do much research until I come back.

I really want to try and publish before I apply to grad schools, because I think it will be really helpful on my application. I'm looking at schools like Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech, MIT, Cornell, CMU, and Princeton. 

I still have all of my junior year to try and do that. And maybe instead of returning as an intern, I could maybe do an REU? But it'd be pretty hard turning down a return offer from Google if I get one. But since I want to go to the grad school, it might be a smarter option to do an REU. Maybe if I publish before next summer, I'll still have the edge of a publication and I can still do the internship after my junior year.

Can I get some general advice? I've been thinking about this a lot, and I could really use some advice from someone who's gone through the process. How can I work toward being maybe second or third author or something on a paper as an undergrad? Should I do an REU instead of the industry internship after my junior year if I haven't published by then?"

I was really bummed out, but I did have an offer from another company (not as prestigious but still a very big company on the opposite coast) for the summer anyway. Unlike Company A where I had 5 - 7 rounds of interviews, I only had 1 interview with Company B before receiving an offer... they're not super picky about hiring, I guess.

I accepted the other offer after my rejection from the Company A. Set up housing, flights, met my summer roommates. But I just got a call from my manager at Company A today telling me his department was ""looking to hire an intern for this summer again and he wanted to see if I was interested, and to let him know so they can consider me for the position.""

I did not let LastPass save my master password because I figure its the only one I really need to remember anymore. I also enabled google auth. Now every password I is LastPass generated to 10 - 25 char's and unique. Of course I don't know any of my passwords but I can view them on my browser, phone, tablet so its not much of an inconvenience. 2. Does this sound secure? Any tips to improve security?
As far as my Mac goes it also has a unique 10+ char password from my iCloud account and is encrypted. My security questions are very personal so I don't think social engineering or good research could leave me vulnerable. 3. If I have a strong password what are the chances of someone with physical access to my laptop and a lot of time seeing my data?

I am also using a VPN that keeps no records as well as SSL whenever possible and I encrypt and many emails, attachments, etc. Any suggestions to my current setup?

I've recently won a pretty big award at a hackathon, and had a huge web application go live I proposed, developed, and tested for the company. I do good work for them, and they pay me quite well. 61k a year, a 6k annual bonus, and they sent me to a 5k conference this year. No benefits other than vacation and flex time. The work they have me doing when I'm not doing application development is VERY boring and kind of beneath my skill level, I'm doing that maybe 30-40% of my day. 

So I get through an interview with a bank downtown, and they are very interested. They give me a number at the end of the interview. Start me off at 70k a year, plus health, fitness allowance, rrsp matching, employee shares (dollar for dollar), and bonuses (5-10% of salary) when projects finish. He estimated I could easily be making over 80k with those bonuses. This would also be working in a software dev environment, which I haven't experienced yet other than a short uni internship, and this was the main reason I was looking elsewhere for work. The cons are it adds about 40 minutes to my commute (have to take the train instead of my vehicle, unless I want to pay 500/mo for parking). 

I could really use some second opinions. Love the people I work with here, some of the best bosses I've ever had, short commute, relaxed environment. But I'm leaning towards what seems best for me, and go with the bank, which is clearly offering me a better deal.

If I do decide to go with the bank, what is the most professional way to bring the offer up to my boss to see if he'd counter it? I really don't want to burn any bridges here.

Basically, they hired me while trusting that I’d stick around and I feel like that’s the only reason I was ultimately hired (I work for an insurance company and they’re having a hard time finding developers).
  
Here’s the thing, I’m gay and live in a not so tolerant state and have landed a job in a much more LGBT friendly city in another state. Is it appropriate to mention that this was my biggest motivator for finding another job when I put in my two-weeks to my boss? I’d like to be open and honest with him because I don’t want him to think I’ve been lying to his face for the past 6 months about sticking around. I feel grateful that they afforded me the opportunity to work while I’m in school; they’ve been very flexible with me and I didn’t have any internship experience before this job.
  
Edit: I want to add that harassment hasn't been an issue in the workplace but none of my coworkers know I'm gay in the first place. Telling my boss my motivation for leaving would be mostly to ease my conscience as well as give him a little PSA about the fact that discriminatory laws do in fact chase away much needed talent. "

Not sure if this is going to be too specific for this sub,, but I figured it was most related to this sub, but here I go. I have an interview coming up tomorrow for a ""Distributed Systems"" internship. I was trying to figure out which skills I would need to brush up on before the interview. The position is with a regional insurance company in NYS. Unfortunatley the intership posting has been removed since I applied so I can't link it. 

When I originally applied for the position, they only listed that I needed at least a 3.0 GPA and be enrolled as a junior or senior in a related degree program. I fulfill all of those requirements.

I also had to answer whether or not I had a working knowledge of the OSI model, which I do, but I will be sure to study it in depth before I go in tomorrow. It also asked me if I knew what ping and trace route were, which I do.

As a final note, I looked up my interviewer on linkedin, and it says he is the distributed systems team lead and the only skills he has listed is Windows Administration, VMware and Citrix.

Based off of this, can you guys give me some ideas of the types of questions I should be prepared for?

Thank You!"

EDIT: To be more precise, I would like advice on good ways of coming off the the interviewer. In essence what would someone asking behavioral questions like to see in the applicant. What would someone asking technical questions like to see in the applicant?
I usually come off as an excited and eager to learn type of person, who may be too apologetic at times and I sometimes interrupt people.

I completed one internship successfully, but this was in high school almost 9 years ago.  So I have 7+ years of history of having a job, but none of it is directly relevant to the positions I've been applying for (lab technician/research assistant, etc).

I applied for a position as a QA Packing Inspector just shy of a week ago, and received a call back from the recruiter that posted it (didn't realize it was him at the time).  The position offered an hourly rate starting at $17/hr.  However, instead of discussing the position that was listed, he asked if I might be interested in an entry level job as an environ. lab tech.  I told him yes, and he said he'd contact me next week regarding an interview.  Problem is, the position he offered me is one starting at $10/hr.

I completely understand that I'm new in terms of entering the laboratory sector and don't have as much bargaining power as a result, but I'm coming from sales and serving jobs where I was able to consistently net ~$14-$15/hr when averaged out.  The area that apparently is known for offering lower wages, but is it worth it to take a pay cut that drastic just to work in what I studied in school?  Mind you, they prefer candidates with a BS degree.

It sucks that despite the debt I've taken on attending school to try and ensure some modicum of success in life - in a scientific field no less - is being rewarded with what feels like more debt and less pay.  I've also heard that I might be limiting myself for pay in the future - essentially my next employer might not be willing to bump my pay up to something closer to market rate if they view my salary history and see that I was willing to work for something much lower.

Here's a C/P of the listing from the recruiter:


We are currently seeking an Environmental Lab Technician:

BA/BS degrees preferred (Chemistry, Biology, Microbiology)

AS Degree or HS Diploma with 2+ years of experience will be accepted

*Any experience with water testing or working in an environmental lab is a major plus.

*This is a long term contract position

Position Requirements:
pH
Turbidity
Titrations
HPLC
Wet Chemisty
Water Sampling/Testing




tl;dr
new grad sans recent experience has potential job offer in scientific field.  Job pay is considerably less than pay in non-scientific/retail field, despite requesting B. Sci. degree in posting.  Worth it to take job just to start gaining experience in field?"

31t3yo,2,2015-04-07,I'm having a really hard time convincing myself to keep going.,hcats,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/31t3yo/im_having_a_really_hard_time_convincing_myself_to/,"I'll try to keep this brief. About 10 years ago I decided to try and turn my life around. I went back to school and moved to another state to return to school. While there I lost 100 lbs, decided to pursue a professional degree (i.e. like an MD), made some wonderful friends and had a couple of very meaningful relationships.


Fast-forward to the end of my time there and I had been accepted into the top schools in the country and was just finishing up my studies. I decided to end my relationship of ~4 years with a girl for both good and bad reasons, but ultimately I've come to regret that decision. Without going into details I have a hard time forming connections with others so being able to get that close with someone is something very special. I decided to go to the school closest to my home because I was feeling homesick at the time due to being away for nearly 7 years. 


When I arrived I was lonely and a little out of shape, but excited to start school. Things were going well until midway through the first year a classmate of mine nearly attempted suicide himself (he had brought a gun into his dorm and was going to shoot himself). I convinced him no to do it and went with him to the counselor the next day. For whatever reason this had a profound impact on me and sent me into a depression. I started seeing a therapist myself and hired a private trainer at the school gym to try and get myself back in shape and address my feelings.


Things were going OK for the most part going into the second year of my schooling. I was very lonely and somewhat disappointed with my choice in school, but otherwise I was looking forward to the future because I was cultivating some interesting hobbies (I was enjoying working out, rock climbing, guitar, drawing and kayaking). During the Christmas break of that year I fell and injured both of my wrists snowboarding for the first time. I didn't think much of it at the time, but after a month they still hurt and felt unstable. I got diagnosed with a torn ligament in my wrist and a couple other complications. I was unable to workout like I normally would due to this injury. I refocused on school and spent my time there. I also got a highly coveted internship at a local hospital. When I wasn't focused on my studies my mind dwelled on my wrist. I decided to try and rehab my knee (I had slightly injured it the summer before I started professional school) but I ended up injuring my wrist further doing an exercise the PT had me do. Frustrated, I gave up trying to rehab my knee.

At the start of the third year in pharmacy school I had worked during the summer and also done research on the side. My health had deteriorated due to not working out and some stress eating. The school I chose proved to be a massive disappointment with a disconnected administration, filler classes and a seemingly glaring neglect of fundamental concepts. I slogged through the year, my health concerns continuing to to weigh heavily on me; my TMJ became particularly worse and I injured my other wrist. I decided in December to leave my internship which was upsetting me and to try pilates as an alternative workout. Now I've found that due to a defect in my hip I have torn cartilage there as well (in addition to knee and ankle problems). The surgical outcomes for my hip seem more optimistic than my wrist, but I'm scared of surgery because of past experiences and I'm losing a lot of faith in modern medicine. I've tried pursuing relationships during school, but as I said earlier I have trouble with trust and I also feel myself pulling back because my health concerns might limit me. It also depresses me that the person I end up with will see me as this broken thing, and not the driven, hard working, capable person I was and was trying hard to improve.

In addition to my health problems I am having difficulty finding more interests to pursue. Writing/drawing hurts my wrist, as does playing guitar. I had wanted to hike and backpack more, maybe even run, but my hip is making that unlikely. I also developed a condition known as slipping rib syndrome which makes certain actions very painful/difficult. I feel like I tried so hard to change who I was 10 years ago and that it's all going to be for nothing. I cultivated new interests that I can't do, I'm stuck at a school I hate taking on debt for something I've lost the passion in, and I am having difficulty romantically because I feel like I can't form a relationship with someone that I'd want to because I don't think my health will allow a future with them.

In a nut shell, I feel like I've lost my identity and died. I've tried several alternatives to try and pick myself up but I seem to keep hitting roadblocks. I went from an active person to nearly completely sedentary and my health seems to be deteriorating at a rapid rate with no definitive answers. I think of killing myself multiple times a day, but what stops me is that I keep hoping I'll get better. It has been over a year since I've injured my wrist and no doctor has given me a definitive treatment answer that I am satisfied with (they just seem to go through treatment algorithms rather than think of mine case as unique). Now with my hip/knee/ankle injury I'm rapidly losing hope that I'll ever be able to enjoy my life when I'm done with schooling.

Thank you for reading this. I'm sorry it was so long. I just feel like I need someone to understand how hard I have tried and how desperate I'm starting to feel. I feel so lost and overwhelmed that I can't pull myself out of this, I wish someone was there just to feel close to."

The company develops ERP and CMS software using Microsoft dynamics and SAP. The owner is my uncle therefore he has accepted me as an intern in the company. 

First of all, I do not have any experience in this field so I am not sure how much it is worth learning Microsoft dynamics and other related technologies as a software engineer (I will be applying for full time in July, as I am graduating this december, hence desperate to get any type of experience). This will cost me tickets to India (1K) and but I will stay at my parents in the summer, which is better than living alone here for three months. (No one in USA)

The other option is that I stay here in US and work with any professor at my university in Android or Data mining related research. 

Which option should I go for? Is experience in software dev. using ERP/CMS is considered useful for a software engg.?



**TL;DR** My dilemma -
Either I get an experience in ERP/CMS software Development in India (Small company, no payment, I stay with my parents for three months)

Or

Stay here in USA alone, work with any professor in Android/ Data Mining related research for the whole summer.

Prepare for a wall of text.

____

So am a high school senior hoping to study Mechanical or Civil engineering (although Mechanical seems more than likely) and work in the aerospace industry. I have narrowed down my choices for college to two schools. Here it goes.

First is Rutgers University... or so it may be it.

I was accepted to the pre-engineering program at Newark. I will have to study there for a year or two and then transfer to New Brunswick. I got rejected from SOE and SAS in New Brunswick. I lose the connections I will make the first year in SOE and will have to make up many classes once I get into SOE. I will be commuting all four years too. This year, most of my expenses will be paid so I will not have debt, but I am not sure if that will happen after my second year at Rutgers, especially since I will be going to New Brunswick. I hope that not being in an engineering school will drastically affect my chances at an internship, as I hope to get as many as possible and keep a high GPA (aiming for a 3.5 so that I have a good chance at transferring, although that will be very hard).

Oddly enough, the University of Delaware was MORE than glad to accept me (Civil) and with a decent $4,500/year merit scholarship. I feel that this school best fits my needs, however I can't afford it at the moment. My parents have an unpredictable source of income so it might go from 60k one year to 28k. This year, they got an EFC of 0 which means that we will get a max amount of aid. I am one of two kids in my family that will start college next year, with another sibling who will enter university in two years time. 

My parents fear about the income affecting my FAFSA. I tell them about tax credits, scholarships (got one for $1k already) internships, co-ops, and work-study that can help levy the costs of the price to study. Also, I intend to work in the public sector as an engineer for NASA, which will allow me to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Being first gen and Latino, it is difficult for us to take out a loan as we have many fears about what we will gain from this.

I've discussed this matter with my principal, who has been along the ride with me since he came into my school sophomore year. After further reviewing the matter and possible reasons for why I wasn't admitted to the School of Engineering at Rutgers University, he believed that taking out the loan and going to UDel would be the best option. I have also talked with many people, some saying to go where the money is, but others saying the loan is worth the hassle of not transferring.

I have also been told to consider community college, however there is simply no use in this as my options **will** stay the same and I will be able to afford in state universities next year as well. I was also accepted to NJIT, however I have felt that it was not a good option whatsoever that didn't met my needs and offers less aid than Rutgers, while being slightly expensive.

I am stuck in this loophole where my parents don't understand any of the options and are going where it is cheap. While the cheapest route looks good, it might hold a large mess of problems. If I were admitted to SOE, I would have accepted the offer over UD immediately, however I was put in this awful position and must face the consequences. Being 17 until September, my parents can still do whatever they want, but I still need to help them understand what is going on and guide them to a good solution. I hope to bring my principal and parents together for a chat about this, but I need more information to tell my parents about what these choices involve. Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR** Is it worth taking out the loans and going to UD to start engineering from day 1 or go to Rutgers, deal with a crazy transfer, and go out with less than 30-40k in debt?"

I am currently a senior Neuroscience major that will graduate this May 2015.

I already have experience in sales and neuroscience research, and I do not like both of those fields.

I have always had an interest in working with computers and obtaining an advanced skillset in an area of information technology or computer science, but I have not taken any courses or work experience related to that. How feasible would it be for me to get an information technology internship or entry job without having any direct skills that apply to them? I have seen alot of information technology internships on indeed.com, but they all seem to require previous coursework experience or job experience, which is hard for me to get at the moment. How can I market my skills to obtain an opportunity in this field?"

My boyfriend got into a pretty serious car accident about four years ago. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but ever since then he has dreaded driving and hates it with a passion. 

We're both in college now and go to school several hours away from home, and him not wanting to drive is kind of affecting my life negatively now. He will still drive to the store or to class but he will be anxious the whole time and I can't touch him or talk too loud. He won't drive if it's raining or rush hour or if it's too dark or he just doesn't feel safe. It's gotten to the point to where he has actually forbidden me from driving and visiting him this summer (he will be at an internship 12 hours away) because he doesn't want me driving either. Even if I had my own car, it wouldn't make things any better because even in high school he wouldn't let me drive us 20 minutes to the movies, and we live in a very small town with no traffic. 

I never ask him to go on dates anymore because he hates driving so much. Sometimes he'll ask me to hang out and then take back the offer because he doesn't want to come pick me up. I don't really know what to do at this point because I don't know if I should say something. Am I being crazy? I'd really appreciate some advice. Thanks guys. "

They said they don't really do interns because a lot of training is required but would hire me instead. I was late in doing my internship and couldn't find another place in time so I just agreed to their contract (typical NDA, NCA, etc.). I also had to sign a 2 year contract saying that if I left before then I'd have to pay tens of thousands of dollars (all my savings) to compensate for expensive training to happen (hasn't happened yet).

I've been at the job for 6 months and don't really like it. My friend said there was a decent amount of coding but it's probably only like 10% of the time and they're 5-10 line long Javascript files. It's mostly just documentation, meetings, a lot of nothing/idling, flow charts, learning very specific technologies that will be outdated in 5 years, etc.

I just feel like I'm wasting my potential. I was a bit of a nerd and I've read 50+ books on programming, know all kinds of algorithms, prefer statically typed languages, etc. I know all of this programming and I don't get to use any of it. Also I'm paid decently (between $20 and $30 an hour) but I know I'm worth more and can do more.

I could get out of the contract by just getting fired but that just seems wrong. They're a good company and it'd be good to have it on my résumé, I just find that type of work doesn't really suit me, although I'm likely being naive. I should probably just stick it out for another 1.5 years but that's still 3,000 hours of work and I feel like that kind of commitment so early on in my career could waste a lot of time, considering this job has so much IT stuff and doesn't really help build my career in any way.

What should I do?"

We live in a small room, so very intimate and basically sleeping next to each other.
He has previously been very depressed and is on medication (some SSRI) for it. I was working on a volunteer project with him for about a year ago when he was feeling very depressed but he has been feeling good and very active for what I think has been a long period after that. I am no expert here, but I get the notion that it's some kind of mano-depressive cycle. I met his parents once efter the previous episode and his dad took me aside to tell me how much they had appreciated me and one other guy being there for him - and I don't even feel we're *that* close.

He worked hard to get an internship at a big company recently. He got it, and will start in some months. When he got accepted, things took a 180 turn and he's now feeling very bad about pretty much everything.

So he recently got a higher dose of his medication just a week or two ago.
He keeps bringing up how bad he feels. A lot of regret about life-choices, which was also the theme last year. Things like if he really should have moved to the city he lives in city, started the education he's taking, tuned down some job offer, signed up for this internship, even coming to Tokyo to visit right now, etc. Lots of guilt for things that he can't change.

He talks about this, and other extremely negative feelings, a lot. I can tell that he's really suffering and sometimes he looks like he's just about to cry. He never mentioned suicide, but I wouldn't be super-surprised if he comes to the point of thinking or talking about that in the future.

On one hand, I guess it's good that he's talking about things. On the other hand, it kind of feels like a record stuck on negativity-repeat with the same thoughts and thought-patterns just reinforcing themselves, so keeping talking about the exact same thing day after day (and several times a day) feels like it's leading nowhere but down.

The thing is, I am feeling pretty stressed in school and life in general and don't feel like I can commit to him as much as he might need me to. And I am not in a super-stable point in my life myself, so his constant talk about how all these negativities are making me concerned, stressed and kind of feeling like I have to push him away to keep myself sane, which I obviously don't want to do since I care about him. I told him before he got here (and before I knew about his current state) that I will be pretty busy and not have much time for hanging out, which is true.  He's mentioned a couple of times what a shame it is that we can't hang out so much, which also adds to my own feelings of stress and responsibility for him.

He has his cheerful moments too, here, even if they feel a bit.. manic. We have been partying a little bit, and I have tried to introduce him to friends and have been encouraging him when he talks about trying to hook up with people to hang out with on Tindr.

I can see that he's trying to be nice and appear happy. He's brought small gifts back to the house when he's been out, etc. But it's a very crumbling facade.

I guess my **main question** is how I should respond when he starts talking about these negative thoughts he has? I know that it's important to just listen, which I feel I am not very good at. I kind of feel like these two weeks might turn out to be a sudden part-time job as a therapist whenevrer I am not in school, which I am not by any means prepared for. I feel that if I follow up with questions and respond openly when he brings it up, it will be constant talk about negativity and regret and how bad everything feels, which I fear will make not only him but also myself even more depressed. At the same time I don't want to make things worse for him by making him shut himself in.

Like the title says, as the summer gets closer, I am starting to feel very nervous about my internship. I feel like I am nowhere near good enough to work there, and that I will get fired right away. Also, a lot of their code-base is in Java, and lo and behold, I have never learned Java (I'm more of a C and Python kind of girl!). 

I got the offer in the fall semester, and I had planned to learn Java over winter break, but was unable to, and now I feel like I am running out of time. 

I really feel like I won't be any good. Is there a way I can prepare in the next month or so to be better equipped at working there, and perhaps feel a bit more confident in myself? Is it even possible to get confident in your abilities in such a high stress environment?

Thanks!"
31una1,4,2015-04-08,Second Bachelor's Degree or a Master's in Computer Science? Looking for advice on how to move forward.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31una1/second_bachelors_degree_or_a_masters_in_computer/,"Hello everyone, I'm in the midst of figuring out how I want to move forward and the mix of responses that I have received over the past year has influenced me to write this.  I graduated with a BA in Economics from an Ivy League school in 2013 and started a job at a decently well-known/venture-backed startup in Silicon Valley, albeit in a support role.  I enjoyed working at the company, but I definitely aspired to do engineering or development work.

I spent the greater part of my free time outside of my day job mastering Android development and eventually working on preparing for technical interviews.  I came across a great community in San Francisco that helped armed me with the skills necessary to begin building great mobile applications.  After one of my apps gained a lot of traction and I became comfortable with my own abilities, I began applying to junior-level Android developer jobs.  

I was able to land on-site interviews with Facebook and LinkedIn, among others, but could not earn an offer from either of those places.  Two particular interviews at other companies struck me in particular.  I was internally referred by fellow Android bootcamp participants to a company in Seattle they were working at (I had heard through their manager that they put in a good word for me noting that I was one of the strongest students at the particular bootcamp).  

The interview with their VP was particularly revealing.  ""So, you have a degree in Economics?""  I said, yes.  ""Well, I guess that's better than Sociology or Art.""  I said something to the effect of, ""Well some people with those degrees are quite good.""  I didn't get an offer after getting flown out for a full day of stuff on the whiteboard, among other things, but that could have been due to various reasons.  Needless to say, that exchange was an eye-opener.  

I was also internally referred by a friend to a well-known ebook startup in SF that was looking for at least an Android developer.  Couldn't even make it past the initial conversation because the CTO made some assumptions regarding my background (he had thought that I had recently begun programming and that my efforts were admirable for an Economics major), even though about a year ago they were happily willing to take on people who didn't know Android development who were willing to learn it on the job.

I eventually landed a job as an Android developer in a pretty sweet shop out of state.  Coincidentally it offered the most positive interview experience, a development team in which most of the employees held long tenures (4+ years - I find that to be pretty nice because it's an indication of job stability), and perhaps the most skilled and knowledgeable Android people that I had interviewed with outside of the folks that I met at LinkedIn.  For comparison's sake, the people at Facebook that I interviewed with seemed to have had a very shaky knowledge of the platform, but Facebook's interview process was pretty pleasant so definitely no complaints from me.

A part of me thinks that my own background is holding me back.  I know that this subreddit promotes the idea that your degree doesn't matter, but everyone that I know who has a gig at the much talked about Big 4 or trendy startups has ""Computer"" in their Bachelor's degrees.  I know an individual who helps out with a different Android bootcamp in SF who went back to school for a second Bachelor's in CS in his 30's, and that seemed to have worked well for him, resulting in an internship with Amazon to jumpstart his career pivot.  

I actually applied to the OMSCS program with Georgia Tech primarily because there will be quite a few classes that I want to dive deep into.  However, from a career perspective, I'm wondering if a second bachelor's might prove more robust as insurance against...people who might be quick to judge.  There was a thread from a recruiter a few days ago indicating that people can and do throw out resumes that do not list a Bachelor's degree in CS.  I am very happy with the job that I have now, but this is just incase I find myself in one of those job search situations again.  I found [this](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/7686/does-having-masters-degree-in-computer-science-help-your-career) post to help a bit with my decision making going forward, but I would like to hear everyone's thoughts here as well.  A bachelor's seems to be more robust, but a master's is far less time consuming."

I'm a freshman computer science and statistics major at a fairly highly ranked public university in the US, hoping to build my skills to prepare for an internship next (between sophomore and junior year). I am a bit ahead as far as my university goes in terms of courses (if I wanted to, I could complete the CS core requirements by next spring), but know this does not compare to many individuals at top tier schools like Stanford, UC-Berkley, or MIT. I am wondering what I can do to improve both my marketability as well as my actual skills and knowledge in things particularly relevant to a career at Palantir, because though I am not sure I want to end up there, and am fairly certain that whatever I do, it will still be rather unlikely, striving for that goal would put me in a far better position to get a good internship or job at a different company. 

If there are any resources or particular topics that you would recommend studying to make myself more competitive, that would be greatly appreciated. I have taken calc 1-3, diff eq, lin alg, discrete math, data structures, and a few random stat classes to give you an idea of where I'm at. Other than that I have very little experience with real-world, non-academic programming and problem solving."

31vr7n,1,2015-04-08,Should I aim for a more theoretical degree or a more practical one (with work experience) ?,dysoco,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/31vr7n/should_i_aim_for_a_more_theoretical_degree_or_a/,"**Wall of text incoming,questions at the bottom**

I realize this question might seem like it has been asked hundreds of times, but it does have some peculiarities in my case, and given how much of a decision is to do a degree, I'd rather be really sure.

**I'm currently a Senior High School living in Argentina, almost 18 years old; been programming since I was 9-10 and always wanted to study Computer Science or something similar.**

**First, I have two options, either I graduate with 18 years old with a High School diploma, or I stay one more year in High School, graduate with 19 and get some sort of ""Software Technician"" degree** (basically it's like a sub-bachelors degree on software engineering).

I have this option because I've been going to school for about 10 hours a day every day, which basically allows me to graduate with a double degree, the usual High School diploma and a Technical degree.

This degree is no big deal, but at least it allows me to show employers that I have at least 5 years of experience programming and studying software development practices.

First, let's clarify: **College here is completely free, however I'd have to move to another city (possibly Buenos Aires) so I'd need to pay rent, food and the usual stuff.**

Anyways, back to college, here the usual consensus is: ""If you want to study computers, go with** Information Engineering**"". Everyone assumes this is some sort of the CS of the United States (working with computers and programming), where, in reality, it's much more of an Economics degree. Sure, it has software development, but it also has a lot of subjects on** time management, cost analysis and such, which sounds utterly boring to me.**

Now, we also have a **Computer Science degree, which isn't really well known**; it's **much more theoretical and math-based than the usual CS program in the US** (Although it depends on which college). But I've heard it creates much better engineers and programmers than those in the Information Engineering degree, which is more intended for management positions.

However, as I said, it's also less known, and here ""Engineer"" carries an important connotation, I'm worried that employers will be looking down at me for not being an Engineer and being a ""scientist"".

I must say though, that **I want to get out of here as soon as possible, hopefully US/Canada or Europe**. I guess the CS degree has much more renown over there than the Information one.

Getting to the bad news,** the usual degree here is 5 years**, given that I'd be graduating with 19 from High School; I'll be 24/25 by the time I finish my Bachelors. However, **the CS degree is 6 years**, and I've heard it's actually pretty demanding and it's not unusual to finish it in 7 or even 8 years. Which means **I'd be graduating with 26/27 if I'm lucky**.

That sounds incredibly old for getting into the real world, I know people from IRC who are 19 and already had 4 or 5 internships.

I also heard that **the CS degree is so demanding (about 8 hours of class a day, morning/noon) that it doesn't really let you work part time; whereas the Engineering degree is a bit more soft, and you can easily work while you finish it**. This would allow me to get some work experience by the time I've finished my degree, and also would mean that I don't have to have my parents pay me everything, which I guess feels bad by the time you're 20+.

**I've always wanted to work on complex stuff**, i.e. Compilers, Operating Systems, Computer Graphics... any area that is remotely interesting and it's not just writing Java for a big enterprise. Given my preferences, CS seems like the obvious choice, but maybe it isn't given the cons I've listed before.

Also **I don't dislike the idea of going into Academia** (which would be much easier from CS than from Engineering), but I'm worried about wages, at least in Argentina, I guess that's a completely different question to ask in another moment, and I still have a lot of time to decide, but keep that in mind.

**So my questions are:**

1. Should I finish my Technician degree? (even if it means losing one more year)
1. Given my case, would you rather study CS or Information Engineering?
1. Do you think 25-28 is too old to get in the industry?
1. Would you rather have a better degree or work experience by the time you graduate?

**Also I might be wrong about some stuff, so if anyone's from Argentina and wants to clarify, be free to do so.**

Thanks."

Just a little background about myself, I'm an Junior student studying Computer Science in the USA since last Fall in an exchange program to study here for two semesters. One of the requirements of this exchange student program is to find an internship (paid or unpaid) or work in a research project with a professor in the summer. In this program they pay me for my housing + meal plan + $300 to any other expenses we may have (this will be relevant later).

Knowing of the amazing opportunities to CS students here in the USA, I started working on my resume and applying to summer internships online. So I found this company on the career fair of my university that was interested in exchange students from this exchange program. Last week I had an interview with this company and they presented what the interns would be working on the summer and also asked a few technical questions about Java and programming in general, but nothing difficult.

A day later I received an e-mail from the company with an offer to work for them during the summer, but the recruiter didn't say anything about payment in the e-mail, and that's when I realized the offer was for an unpaid position, not for a paid position as I was expecting.

When I sent an e-mail to the recruiter, he said that by his understanding I'm already being paid via my exchange program for an internship (the $300 that the program pays me, but the company isn't going to pay me any cent).

I understand that this is an opportunity to get experience in the software development industry and maybe get a letter of recommendation in the future. But I can't deny I got a little disappointed after his response, after all, they are a big e-commerce company, and I'm pretty sure they could pay at least $15 per hour for their interns. 

I would be working with Java and doing unit-tests to test the code produced by the programmers of the company and working 40 hours a week. 

I know it's April and it's really late to keep searching for internships, but my plan in case I declined the offer would be to keep sending resumes everyday, and try to talk to professors from different universities about research since doing something in the summer is a requirement of the program.

I know how much people criticize unpaid internships (that they're illegal, bad for your career, etc), but that was the only opportunity that I've gotten so far. I have experience with web development JS/HTML/CSS and also comfortable dealing with data structures in Java and C. I though that would be enough to hear back from companies, but this offer was all that I got so far. 

Any suggestions or advice of what should I do? Is this a good opportunity for my career or working in a research project in a university would be better? Any advice is welcome, thanks.

31xflk,3,2015-04-08,Intern in final semester...TIFU,[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/31xflk/intern_in_final_semestertifu/,"I apologize in advance, I'm an emotional wreck and im exhausted so hopefully this makes sense. I'm an intern in my final semester with two weeks left until I graduate. I work 5 nights a week and I intern during the day fro. 7:30 - 4:00ish. Lately I've been feeling like I'm not doing so well and I've become very frustrated. Well everything came to a head today when my collaborating teacher basically aired any frustration she has had with me to my supervisor. She had never told me the things she told my supervisor and told him I said a bunch of things that I have never said. For example, she told him that I said I have 3 allowed sick days during my final. What I told her was I had 3 days where I was either completely absent from being sick or I came in late (drove across a few states 20 hours for a wedding, got in at 3 am on Sunday and slept through my alarm Monday. Got into my internship at 9:50). 

Another issue we discussed was the time I showed up in the mornings. My contract says I have to be there by 7:30. From January until now, there are probably three or four days where I signed in at 7:35. My collaborating teacher told my supervisor that she shows up at 7:15 (not all the time) and that she didn't know if I'm considered tardy if I show up later than that.  Well long story short, my supervisor told me that if he had know I was showing up after 7:15 (but before my contracted 7:30) we would have gone to the board of standards. I didn't feel like showing up by my contracted hours called for such drastic action so of course I started crying, feeling like a failure and that I wasn't going to graduate. He told me that he believes I am capable and that he won't fail me but that I need to give 110% for these last two weeks. He said he knows I am great at what I do and that he believes I am one of his top interns, but now this is a sort of set back. 

I guess I'm feeling like this was blown way out of proportion and that I wasn't given a fair chance to explain my reasoning and thinking. There were some other issues brought up to me by my supervisor in which my collaborating teacher took something I said and misconstrued it completely. I tried my best to explain what I actually said to my supervisor but my teacher wouldn't really let me try to explain so I ate shit and apologized. There were some actual issues my teacher talked to me about that I did agree that I should work on but I wish she sould have told me when she had those issues instead of waiting two weeks before my graduation. I'm feeling frustrated, overwhelmed and like I'm failing. I also feel like this internship had turned sour as I am my teacher's first intern ever and she tries not to be confrontational, which has helped lead to this blow up. She tries to play my side and my supervisor's side so that she doesn't have to be the bad guy. I'm feeling like I'm not going to get good letters of recommendation because of this which is stressing me out.  I'm really wondering if this is a large threat to my ability to get a job or if this is more of a ""get it together"" kind of talk. 

TL;DR: there has been a lot of miscommunication between me, my Collaborating Teacher, and my internship supervisor. Feeling like I'm a failure and that I was bombarded by issues I didn't know existed. Is this a threat to my ability to get a job or should I not take this personally?"

I've been a lurker here for awhile now, and now that my new job situation has pushed me to my highest levels of social incompetence yet, I decided I'd post here for some of your insight.

The Obstacles:
1. I am an introverted person. I am content socially interacting with people a couple of times a month, and more or less interact with people outside of my immediate circle (fiancée, roommate and fiancée's parents) at this rate. 

2. I also am painfully shy. I'm 99% sure this is genetic, as my birth mother and birth sister (I'm adopted) are painfully shy as well while my adoptive family is completely comprised of social extroverts barring me. 

3. I know everyone says you're supposed to ask questions and get people to talk about themselves, but I never can think of any appropriate questions to ask. My palms and underarms hardcore sweat and I get so nervous that everything in my mind goes blank or in a loop. I'm so worried about what I'm going to say next that I have a really hard time focusing on what people say to me, and consequently have a hard time responding to them and carrying on the conversation. It's full-on panic mode, people. 

4. I am extremely uncomfortable in a group setting and never can figure out how people can all contribute and get their voices heard as if in some well-orchestrated symphony. I'm sitting over in my corner occasionally tinging my little triangle without the sheet music and getting completely drowned out by all of the other instruments. 

The Assets:

1. I'm actually really good at conversing with people one-on-one once I've gotten over the first meeting. If I can get someone alone and social pressure is off, I'm relaxed enough for my mind to not freeze up. 

2. I do really well in ""business mode."" I can act and sound like a competent, professional adult if we are expected to talk only about work (in a meeting, for instance). 

All that said: 
I'm in a really prestigious internship for 10 weeks. I need to make the best impression possible so that I can get good reccomendations and *hopefully* a job offer down the road. I need to network and, three weeks in, I have made a decent impression on only three employees (and one is a fellow intern who started with me). 

What can I do to better my internship connections and make more of them? 
Do you guys have any tips to help me break out of panic mode?
Group situations?  "
31xyo0,3,2015-04-08,How to best use one extra quarter of undergrad classes?,TheDudeFrom94,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/31xyo0/how_to_best_use_one_extra_quarter_of_undergrad/,"Hello!

I'm currently a junior-year finance and economics double major with a 3.45 GPA, shooting to graduate with honors when I hit 3.50. I have had one internship, non-finance related at a F500 and have an internship in the trading department of an asset management company with $250B AUM. I've worked the entire time I've been in college at internships or on-campus job.

 I currently have three classes available for electives or that I can take whatever I like.

My best options are:

* Add Entrepreneurship Minor - easy classes
* Add more math - I've only taken calc, trig, 2 stats classes, and econometrics - this will likely hurt my GPA, potentially not being able to reach 3.50, but I've been thinking of Econ grad school and this would be needed for that
* Take electives that can be related to business (eg: comm, management)
* Take more finance/economics 
* Take whatever I feel like - easy
*  Take the quarter off and hopefully do full time at the asset management internship
* Take the quarter off and work 2 jobs



What would be the best option? I'm open to anything else as well. Please let me know if I can clarify anything, thanks!

I'm going to try and give you guys as much detail as possible while remaining clear.

So my issue is I recently accepted a position with a smaller company. However, when I applied for this position, I also applied for a much more well known and larger company that aligns with my career goals much better. I have an interview with this company on Friday, go through the weekend and then begin work on Monday with my job.

So what I'm asking is, do I mention in my interview that I recently got hired? At the time of my application, my resume stated I was still interning. So I plan on giving them an updated resume which will state that I left my internship. I figure my two options explaining why I left my internship are ""I have accepted a full time position with another company and I begin Monday"" or ""I am no longer eligible to intern because I am no longer a full time student."" (this part is true as I graduated in December, however the internship would only allow me to stay 6 months after graduation).

I really want to emphasize that the institution I am interviewing for is an ideal place for me. They posted the position back in January and I did not meet the requirement because I was missing one certificate. I went out and got the missing certification specifically because of the job posting, and with luck on my side, the position reopened (hence why I got an interview this time).

Sorry again for the giant amount of text, but what would be the best course of action (refer back to paragraph 2 for my original question)?

I also recently had an interview at another company for a full time entry-level position which I'm fairly certain I will receive an offer based on the feedback I received from the interviewers.

Assuming I get an offer from both companies, I would have a hard time deciding between the two.

I think the full-time position at a large international company would look \*much\* better on my resume, but reading reviews online I saw there is not much opportunity for growth/advancement in the company. 

The internship on the other hand interests me more based on the company culture, employees seem friendlier and I would be doing a more variety of work which sounds slightly more enjoyable than the work I would be doing at the full-time position at the larger company.

I'm currently leaning towards the internship for a more enjoyable job and company culture, but I feel that the full-time position would look much better on my resume so it might be worthwhile to stick with the full-time position.

Any thoughts or recommendations on this?

31ytvg,2,2015-04-09,Advice About College Major,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/31ytvg/advice_about_college_major/,"I am currently in my junior year pursuing a BS in computer science. My entire college experience has been me trying to find a career path. This is my third major. I started as a freshman in engineering. I wasn’t really liking what I was doing and I decided I wanted to do something with medicine, so at the end of the year I changed my major to biology. I spent at year in biology and after a year struggling through intro biology, and organic chemistry, I decided maybe I wasn’t cut out for the subject. I have always really liked Psychology and I started working on a minor, that I will finish this semester. I thought about a major in psych, but couldn’t decide on a career within the field that interested me, nor was I prepared for the amount of graduate school. I ultimately chose to change to computer science based on my interest in using computers, the little bit of coding I had already learned, and the high job prospects.

During the summer I took the first computer science class, it went well and I was excited, but the past semester I started to think I made the wrong choice. The stuff wasn’t clicking, and still isn’t. My grades aren’t bad, but I don’t feel like I am understanding the material, and my programming skills are not good at all. I toyed around once again with changing my major to psychology, and even saw a career counselor about it. I took a career test and my number one match was Health Information Specialist, followed by multiple computer professions, and a few medical professions such as radiologic tech, pharmacist, and medical technologist. From the results, he also seemed to be lobbying for accountant or the military. I thought about enlisting for about a week, but decided that might be a little brash. After some thought, and knowing this was try number three, I decided to stay in CS.

I went to the career fair a little while back to try to find an internship to gain some experience this summer and maybe a little insight into what I would actually do with a CS degree. After talking to multiple companies, with questions like ""what are some of your personal projects?”, and “why did you choose this major?”, I realized I had no personal projects, and no interest in pursing them, and I didn’t know why I was in the major anymore. I never had a deep passion for the subject, and now it’s starting to show. After the career fair, and some online applications, I had a couple of interviews but have been turned down.

I am about 21 credits shy of a psych degree. I have been going back and forth on doing it for about 2 years now, but I've been too afraid to do it, because of the lack of jobs. I really like psych, and it has always come easy to me, but I wonder if I like it because it's easy or it's easy because I like it. I currently work in a library and I have spent time in libraries my whole life. Both of my parents have masters degrees in library science and I've considered that route too, after finishing a psych degree, but it's job prospects aren't that much better. I’ve always been torn between picking a career because it’s something I love, or picking it because it is practical and will put food on the table. I’ve never really had a passion, so I thought I would go with the latter, but I am not sure I made the right choice. However, with 3 years into school, I’m wondering if I should stick it out with CS, because after 3 tries not finding what I love, maybe I’m not going to find it in college.

Tldr: 3 majors in 3 years, want to change again due to lack of passion, but I'm not sure if I'll ever find it."

I'm employed by a close friend and mentor and work full time (part time during college semesters).  He owns a small business and we do a lot of machine shop work and engineering work.  I've been here for two years and while the pay and hours are great, I'm worried that I'm not ""branching out"" like my peers are to other companies.  I'm becoming pretty good at what we do within in our company, but recently we haven't had much new work and I'm starting to feel like a burden to the company even though I try my best to be productive.  Also the possibilities for moving up are good but somewhat limited, and there are no benefits or anything like that (just hourly salary and flexible vacation/sick days).

I've been recently offered two interviews at two different companies that have found me through the grape vine (references from other places I've worked/ school job fairs) and I'm beginning to think that finding a new internship for this summer is well within my capabilities.  

However I have a moral dilemma.  I don't want my boss to think I don't like working for him, and I don't want to leave him without any replacement if a lot of work starts coming in (we only have a few employees but I work the most hours).  On the other hand I don't want to be permanently constrained to this job if I have the possibility of finding a higher paying one, or one with different opportunities.

Do you guys think it would be better to just stick with my current job or should I try to ""branch out""?  Should I talk to my boss about this?  

What's the professional, moral thing to do here?

What should I be doing?,stressedoutcsgrad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/320l9b/graduating_in_less_than_a_month_from_a_highly/,"I'm currently a senior who is about to graduate next month. I just feel that everything is hopeless right now. The stress of trying to find a job has been mounting on me ever since the start of the year. I have been able to get a steady stream of interviews, but I haven't gotten past the initial technical phone screen for most of them. 

There have been two rare cases where I have actually been asked to come onsite for the final round. I completely bombed the first one. It was probably the most embarrassing experience I have had in my life. I was given a few programming problems to complete, of which I partially completed only one. Even the one that I answered did not give a completely correct solution. I take full responsibility for being totally unprepared and unqualified. That was a waste of time and effort for the company.

The onsite interview with the second company went much better, but I definitely do not think I aced the technical portions of the interview. I feel like I made a decent impression on the hiring managers, and I am still waiting on a decision. I feel like this opportunity might be the best chance that I have of landing a job. If I don't get the offer, I am not sure what I am going to do.

To give a bit more background, I had no prior experience with programming before I got to college. During my freshman year, I took an intro to programming course that kinda sparked my interest. After taking that class, I decided to declare as a CS major. However, as I continued to take the upper level CS courses, I didn't really do anything to help nurture and grow my initial interest. I have done no side projects, and I have basically done no programming outside of the classes that I have taken. I did do a summer internship last summer with a small startup. It was supposed to be a developer role, but I did little to no coding. Additionally, although I have done well in most of my classes, I feel like I came away with a superficial understanding of what was taught. There have definitely been some project-based classes where my team members have carried me. Furthermore, as I started taking upper level classes, I started to get the feeling that my peers knew a lot more than me. 

Technical interviews? I am absolutely terrible. Like I said before, I have done no programming outside of my classes, so I think that definitely has attributed to my inability to do well on technical interviews. Whenever I am given a question, it feels as if my brain just turns off. I have tried going through CtCI problems, but I feel like I struggle through even the easy problems. I took my data structures and algorithms course 2 years ago, so I think I have a high level understanding of most of the concepts. But when it comes down to applying those concepts to a particular question and spitting out some code, I fail miserably.

I am just at a loss right now. At this point, I feel like it's all or nothing with the company I am waiting on. Obviously I'll keep applying to places, but my confidence is at an all time low as I keep struggling with technical interviews. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What have you done to improve your interviewing skills other than ""doing as many practice problems as you could""?

I have had lingering thoughts that I might have chosen the wrong major, but at this point, it is much too late. I am also an out-of-state student, so once I graduate, I will have a considerable amount of student debt to pay off. I am sorry for the wall of text, but I just felt like I needed to get some things off my chest. Hoping I can get some advice from people who have been in a similar situation. Thank you for reading!"

I have started to save up for a move to get out of Kansas. I want to know, well, which would be a better option, and what the possibility of being able to support myself on minimum wage. Until I can get a job to start my career. Any information about either area or any suggestions would be appreciated. **TL;DR at bottom**

Currently I am working PT as a delivery driver at the local Dominos in town. This makes my pay variable between 600-1000 a month. I'm thinking a BARE minimum of 3000 is needed to move out (let me know if I'm off). I am going to my best friends wedding in the middle of May. Most of my money up till then will be towards that. Afterward I am going to save back every penny towards moving out. It should be around the end of the year when I have enough.

&amp;nbsp;

As a background I have a BS in Computer Science for KU, no internship, an in major GPA of 2.88, and some small projects on codewars and github. The only experience I have is on my own and in class. I would like to do some openGL, DirectX, general game developing, but I'm currently working on a eMachine E725 laptop. I can do webGL and sprite-base rendering, but the graphics card can't handle much more than that. I have run Blender, Unity, and Unreal3, but they tend to run too slow for usefulness. It also cannot handle VMs. That means, much to my dismay, I cannot test applications for android or apple devices. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sidebar: I am volunteering as a tutor for Adult Basic Education(ABE) GED students and self-studying Japanese(still very beginner). I think I'm going to quit tutoring pretty soon due to the apparent lack of organization and guidance. They pretty much threw me to the wolves with no training, and the person in charge has barely any communication with the people that are actually administering/teaching the GED. On top of that I want to spend more time on developing and self-studying.

She leaves, and I think about the situation. The timesheet is no longer operated by the company, so it's a completely separate system and therefore a separate password from the domain logins. The ""real"" helpdesk probably wouldn't be able to help out in this situation if Intern2 is unable to reset his password himself.

I walk over and see him sitting at his desk, IE open to the timesheet - the parent company seems to love IE - and Intern4 and GeoChem standing around his desk. I have him try to log in, and it fails of course.

&gt; Me: Okay, let's just make sure you've got the right UserID typed in. Go to the intranet and search for yourself in the directory.  
&gt; Intern2: Well, it saved the UserID from before.  
&gt; Me: It did? Okay, so it's probably good. But let's just double check.  
&gt; Intern2: *types last name and first name in respective fields*  
&gt; Company Directory: *no user found*  
&gt; Me: Uh... Huh. Try just your last name.  
&gt; Intern2: *types last name in field*  
&gt; Company Directory: *no user found*  
&gt; Me: Well, I guess the company just doesn't like you. Okay, we'll assume it's right, for the time being. Go back to the timesheet. What happens when you go through the ""forgot password"" link?  
&gt; GeoChem: It brings up his security questions, which he answers correctly.  
&gt; Intern2: And then it brings me back to the login screen.  
&gt; Me: Okay, well, let's just go through it anyway so I can see the process.  
&gt; Intern2: *goes through password reset process*  
&gt; Me: Okay, go ahead and type in the default password. *watches keyboard to make sure he capitalizes properly*

After hitting the Enter key, the timesheet site loads properly, with the expected prompt to reset his password.

&gt; Intern2: What the heck?  
&gt; Me: It's PC Technician Aura. It's related to Auto Technician Aura. Simply being in the tech's presence fixes the problem.

As I walk off, I glance over at GeoChem.

&gt; Me: It's a scientifically documented phenomenon.  \^_~  
&gt; GeoChem: Oh, yeah, like **I'm** going to believe **that**.

321hgb,1,2015-04-09,Just accepted an internship- employer has changed what department I would work under twice already...,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/321hgb/just_accepted_an_internship_employer_has_changed/,"Hi guys I need some advice on what to do in regards to my internship. 


I went through three rounds on interviews, where I originally applied for a position working with a division in the company that creates small business tools (Lets call this A) in VB.net that use their databases to manipulate/view information. HR told me I would be better suited for a position that was a little more hardware related (POS systems, lets call this B) and less software based on my experience. I agreed, but during the last interview I was told I was being considered for another position that was even less software and pretty much no hardware (pretty much running SQL queries and sending the data to whoever requests it, lets call this C).


I was given an offer on the spot for the internship and I accepted. After we started talking more I was told that I will find out what position I will be in next week.


My issue is that the position has changed so much and I feel like this new position (C) is pretty much a waste of my time. I would rather do A but B is a solid backup and I feel like I could contribute and learn a lot in it.


What should I do if I am called back next week and told I will be starting in position C. I am pretty busy so I have no qualms rejecting the internship all together, but I really would like the experience to put on my resume.


Should I take whats available or discuss my concerns with HR when I get the call?


**TLDR:** Applied for position A which was mostly coding and dealing with SQL tables, was told I would be better for B which is little coding mostly hardware. I was ok with this, during last interview was told I was also being considered for C, which was pretty much running SQL queries and sending them to whoever wants them (waste of my time IMO). What should I say to HR when they call me back and I am given C instead of B?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Any new releases coming up that you could tell us about? Also, how did you get your foot in the door in this business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6vqlq?context=5)|I'm really excited about Tyler's new album. He's actually literally asleep in front of me right now in my office (he didn't sleep since he announced it and launched his app and did his only interview on Dash Radio this morn with Shane). He's been working his ass off and it is going to be sick and put a lot of people who were sleeping onto him. Love his app too (check it now- Golf Media).
 |I got my foot in the door through a couple people; my father introduced me to someone who wrote at Hits magazine (the it magazine back in the music biz heyday) who connected me with people, stretch armstrong who kind of took me under his wing, and steve rifkind who gave me a job when i was a 16 year old kid in MN.
[Why is your audio watermark so loud on your free mixtapes? And often in the middle of a song. I can understand putting it at the beginning, but halfway through the chorus, I'm not a huge fan of the loud, stuttering ""d-d-d-d-DJ SKEE"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6v50z?context=5)|GREAT question! Back in the day, we did that so other dj's couldn't steal songs. Today it's a lot less prominent (and I always tried to do it less than others) but has 2 reasons;  1) to promote the dj/brand/station breaking it (if it isn't there, everyone will take credit for it) 2) to encourage people to buy/stream the real version instead of bootlegging the free one for artists.
[No offense intended, of course. I love your music, I just want to be able to hear it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6v50z?context=5)|When I do, most of the time, i try to make it add energy and make as least annoying as possible. But when I get that new Kanye song or whatever first, I have to do to promote our station and brand or everyone else in the world will take. I worked hard to get the opportunity and to the point where I can break these records (not to mention everything behind the scenes to get it) and that's the only compensation I get.
[I figured it was to avoid stealing music, but never understood how prominent / effective it is.  Since you've been doing music with the likes of all sorts of different artists, (Kanye, Game, etc.\), I just wonder what the difference is between working with huge, mainstream artists like them and working with independent artists (like Tech N9ne's Bad Season\)?  And, in regards to Bad Season, what did you think about all of the controversy surrounding that mixtape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6wm79?context=5)|I don't really look at the difference- i think a dope artist is a dope artist no matter if they are huge or underground. As for Tech, in general, he is amazing. Strange Music has a bigger &amp; better infrastructure than any record label I've ever seen and those guys are smart and have done it on their own the unconventional way. [plug= they also have a station on Dash Radio]
[Had to step out for a few hours, but thanks for the replies! I really enjoyed hearing your work combined with Tech's. You two go together real well. I'd love to hear your unnecessarily loud watermark on more Tech songs ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq780ff?context=5)|Me too- stay tuned!
[What up Skee, big fan of Dash Radio and was into the whole BlackWallStreet movement Game had going, my question is, what was the energy like working with Game on that 300 Bars Mixtape? That is probably one of the top 10 best disses of all time in my opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6uyyb?context=5)|Man it was incredible... and one of those rare moments in life where you just know everything is about to change. I actually ran into Game on the street before we did it and he told me he wanted to diss 50 and had 5 mins already recorded and gave me the CD to hear. It was cool, but all over one beat. I went straight to the studio and did a 'jackin for beats' type mix and sent it to him to say you should try it like this as listening to one beat- especially the one he had- for 15 min would have been brutal and his message wouldn't have come across. He loved it, called me, and came straight to the studio. 3 days later we had an entire mixtape done &amp; my life changed forever.
[What made you disillusioned with mainstream radio ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6upa5?context=5)|The same things that I think frustrate a lot of people. Beyond almost every station being controlled by a few companies that force profits over anything, it just isn't good. Lack of variety, repetitive playlists, too many commercials, and the shady side of it from payola to radio promoters and so on. The final turning point for me honestly was one day when I was speaking to kids at a high school- when I said I was on radio they looked at me like I was so uncool. More knew me from my sneaker videos and they all said radio was corny and sucked. I knew I had to step out.
[Do you like the direction the sneaker collecting game has moved in the last decade?  Also do you like the direction the Nike has taken with its basketball line the last few years focusing more on technology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6v0d5?context=5)|I can't knock it as I made a living as a teen as a reseller back in the day... even though it sucks not being able to get something you really want because everyone is buying to sell. at least back then you could still get something if you got their early, now with bots etc its insane! I have a network of connects I have to tap into to get stuff now and I only get that because of who I am. As for the direction, i love the tech side. That's what it should be all about for basketball shoes, let lifestyle kicks be for off the court.
[What's your favorite pair of shoes? How do you think that all of the celebrity endorsements that Adidas has been gaining recently is affecting the sneaker atmosphere in general? Can you shoot me a pair of yeezys? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6usw8?context=5)|I had saying it and being cliche but concord XI's... they are the shoes that started my addiction off as a kid and still classic. I never was a huge Adidas guy but i LOVE what they have been doing recently; beyond Ye's (and sorry i only have one so can't send you some), the Tubular's are awesome and I love the boost+ stuff. They are killing it now and offering some much needed competition to the swoosh.
[What's the best/cheapest area to live/visit in LA; can you survive in LA without a car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6w0jc?context=5)|Not sure on cheapest area but I love Hollywood right now since its central and under a major rejuvination, but LA has so many great places from east to west. And yes you can survive without a car if you don't need to be all over and work close to where you live, and live in a district with a lot of stuff in walking distance... but it wouldn't be easy.
[Why are you on fuse and not on Axis TV anymore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6ynxm?context=5)|Just made sense business and goal wise- better offer &amp; bigger network with more of our focus. Had a great time over there and am still close with Mark Cuban. I reached out to him before I made the move and he encouraged me to do it and has always had my back- i'll forever be grateful for him for the opportunity.
[Top 3 blogs you check every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6urnc?context=5)|I usually do aggregator sites first to see what the top news stuff is (including reddit) but also Techmeme, Mediagazer, ProductHunt, and so on... for music I have a network of people I trust and accounts I follow on Soundcloud but also check in with 2DopeBoyz, NahRight, Pigeons&amp;Planes, HypeM, etc.
[I myself am vegetarian! I've also never had a drink or done drugs! My question is: What influenced you to be vegetarian, not do drugs, and not drink?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq70son?context=5)|Stopped eating red meat &amp; pork when i was 16 and haven't gone back (never really liked), rarely ate seafood (didn't like), and only ate chicken but cut that out a while ago after watching documentaries and reading stuff. Never was interested by drugs- the real world is crazy enough for me. For alcohol, I grew up with an alcoholic so it scared me away.
[What's your favorite Cam'Ron CD?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6uv2u?context=5)|Early one that had ""That's Me"" and ""What Means The World To You"" on it (i forgot name). More for sentimental reasons... I remember being in studio at Hot 97 as a teenager when Stretch Armstrong  (who helped introduce me in the biz) broke those records first.
[SDE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6vexr?context=5)|Yup!
[Where should I send you to pay my student loans?? J/K.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6w8ew?context=5)|I think they suck and swallow people whole! luckily i never had any.
[Serious question: Favorite Kendrick track?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6w8ew?context=5)|Favorite kendrick track would prob be some old freestyle we did on one of his first mixtapes when he went by K Dot. So happy to see him grow, i remember when he was 16 and could just flat out rap.
[Are you going to be doing another internship opportunity this summer? More info on that if so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6v6c5?context=5)|We did a cool contest last year and actually hired one of the people we brought on full time. We def have programs on both the Skee TV &amp; Dash Radio side, just email us on the website- be warned though, we get a lot of entries so you have to stand out!
[What are your top 3 favorite albums of all time and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6uuhi?context=5)|Tough question. Jay Z ""Blueprint"" (yes over RD- i love both but BP did more for me), Snoop ""Doggystyle"" (duh), and tough for 3rd... hmm (EDIT- Outkast: Aquemini!)
[The artists you think are most underrated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6uuhi?context=5)|So many artists underrated. Quik is def one of them.
[Who is your biggest inspiration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6uuhi?context=5)|Biggest inspiration: the people around me.
[One more question: if you hadn't become a DJ, what would you be doing  for a living? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6xmq3?context=5)|Pro baseball player, pants and all.
[Good question! I  once worked at a venue too and always wonder the the requests the acts have.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6wfjv?context=5)|I try to keep it easy. I'm a weirdo eater and stuff and try to be low maintenance so all i really want is a private space i can relax at and some water and snacks and fruit and juices. Ill sometimes put meals on or have them order if im in a rush or dont have time to eat that day.
[What gear do you use to make your mixtapes? Do you use pro tools, serato, ableton?  Do you rock on turntables, CDJs or controllers?  Are you open to the latest and future technology that the likes of NI Stems and SeratoDJ are bringing to the table?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3213uc/im_dj_skee_i_moved_to_la_at_17_to_pursue_my/cq6z7xp?context=5)|It depends. I use whatever is best for situation. I grew up &amp; started on Pro Tools and usually use Serato to DJ. Currently i'm all over Logic and sometimes will use Ableton and Traktor as well. I love technology and get everything to just test and experiment with if nothing else.

321r17,2,2015-04-09,Interning at very small startups?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/321r17/interning_at_very_small_startups/,"I'm a sophomore cs student who hasn't had much luck with internships this year. However I have managed to get to final round interviews with a very small startup that right now is just the cofounders. They said they are hoping to hire a bunch of interns for the summer as well as several full time employees, but I'm kind of concerned about this. The founders have tons of industry experience and come from top schools, but I'm still worried about how my experience interning in such a small company may be. I don't want to end up in a situation where they expect the interns to be as capable as full time employees, especially considering I don't have too much experience of my own and really just want to learn.

So, has anyone had experience interning at very small startups like this? I'm certainly interested in what they're doing, but I'm concerned that I may not have a good experience considering they don't have many full time developers"

I have an Associate degree in Networking, but after working in IT for 2-3 years I've realized that I want to move into software development. A couple of months ago, I left a position because of the way I (and my coworkers) were being treated.

To make a long story short, I didn't have another job lined up because I needed the break and was planning on going back to school for a BSc in CS. I applied and was accepted into a state university's CS program and will be starting in August.

I'm living on savings right now, so I thought short-term contracts or part-time gigs (server install/decom, system deployments, etc) would be perfect to support me not only over the summer but throughout school until I can apply for internships.

I had been talking with a couple of recruiters at contracting companies, but it seems like they stopped contacting me after I mentioned that I'll be going back to school in the fall.

What gives? Did I show my hand too early? Do I have bad breath over the phone/e-mail?

Beyond that, are short-term contracts/part-time IT gigs even an option at this point?"

[Hi, Lauren! I absolutely love the show. Do you have any particularly memorable stories from working on the set? Also, do you have any former classmates from the UCB who are doing anything cool now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/321oxs/im_lauren_adams_im_also_gretchen_an_indiana_mole/cq72bdd?context=5)|When we're in the airshaft, trying to re-break out of the bunker, it's two separate shots. So one shot is each individual with a stunt person wearing the appropriate Mole Woman's pants pretending to step on their shoulders, and the wide-shot is Sarah Chase (aka Cyndee) up in a rig (like on a crane) standing on Sol Miranda's (aka Donna Maria's) shoulders, and Ellie (aka Kimmy) sitting underneath her feet. So they could get a wide crane-shot of the stack of women. Sarah was up there in that harness for... quite some time.
 |She was an awesome sport about it.
 |I came up in the UCB with TONS of people who are doing great stuff. In my UCB Generation, it's Sasheer Zamata, Kate McKinnon, Alison Rich, and Natasha Rothwell, who all work on SNL... Abbie Jacobson and Alana Glazer came up in UBC at the same time that I did and they're the geniuses behind BROAD CITY... I was actually an intern at UBC when Ellie was on Harold Night, which makes me sound much younger than I am! 
[Maryland represent!  Montgomery County here. Any fun MD stories/memories? Congrats on all the success!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/321oxs/im_lauren_adams_im_also_gretchen_an_indiana_mole/cq72m0n?context=5)|MOCO!!!
 |That's Montgomery County guys. That's where I'm from.
 |How do you know I'm from Montgomery County?*Who is this?*
 |OOOH! This is a good Maryland story!
 |My best friend &amp; roommate from college had her graduation party on the Clipper City, which is a sailboat that was in Baltimore Harbor.
 |All I remember is - I was driving, drove us back to wherever we were staying, and somebody threw up in a Giant bag in my car (**Giant is a local supermarket chain in Maryland).**
 |SO that's about as Maryland as it gets. And the Clipper City is now in New York Harbor, they moved it.
 |I think we call it New York Harbor, right? Down by the seaport?  
[I'm from MoCo was what I was trying to say... :\) That's wonderful that you are too!  We're taking over!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/321oxs/im_lauren_adams_im_also_gretchen_an_indiana_mole/cq731wp?context=5)|YEAHHH!!! I mean, we got *the best* state flag. We DEFINITELY do. So fun and colorful! Lord Baltimore fo-eva!

 |Tough question.
 |I would try to get her out of the cult, for sure. That's step one.
 |Step two: I'm going to try to get her to update her 'do.
 |And step three; I think this is really the source of all the problems, and just doing this might solve problems 1 and 2, but just getting her some good self-esteem.
 |Trying to get her to enjoy any sort of fun pop culture would maybe do it. So a RuPaul's Drag Race, or maybe a Real Housewives, or trying to get her to love a Beyonce video... also just giving her over to Titus (the character) might be a good thing.
[Oh my god, I'd love to see Gretchen spend a day in New York with Titus.

I really like both campuses but I'm slightly leaning towards UCI since I like their dorms way more and they also have all you can eat dining commons whereas UCSD has their dining dollar system. I chose Revelle based on a teacher's recommendation and deeply regret it after visiting the campus. The GE's are bearable. I'd feel more at home with Warren though. I don't know how much weight this has though since I will most likely only be living on campus and using the meal plan for my first year. I like the campus at SD slightly better because it has in my opinion, more beautiful architecture so it kind of offsets the dorm situation. I'd like to note that I feel a bit more at home at UCI's campus though. For that reason, I am also at a loss there. So I guess my decision comes down to:

1) Which CS program is better in terms of preparing you for a career after college? Most of you are probably Irvine students so maybe give me the likes and dislikes that you guys have experienced? The only thing I know that differentiates the two schools is that SD begins with Java and Irvine now has a Python core. Does this matter much? One of my friends told me that Python is not really marketable in internships and that businesses are looking for students with more Java experience. During my visit at Triton Day, almost all of the student panel had received internships freshmen year. I don't know if that is the case with UCI because their ICS presentation is on the 18th. I assume that these students were handpicked though.

2) Continuing with that, which gives the better internship/job opportunities? From the websites, I've gathered that major companies go to both schools such as Google, Apple, etc. but I'd like to get some student insight because I can only assume schools tend to generalize those things for marketing purposes.

3) I noticed there were several nice restaurants across the street at UCI. Is there anything else to do at UCI? For example, something along the lines of hiking at the trails near UCSD or any other cool dining/hanging out areas.

I'm a 19 year old male who is in his second year of university. I have an amazing family (who is also very $$$), my university career is going great, I am headed to my dream destination very soon to take a summer course, and I am very close to landing my dream internship. Many other good things are happening too. Plus, I'm a good looking guy who has a great sense of style, and I seem to have a general charisma with people.

That being said, I have never had a girlfriend. I won't count high school because I didn't want that. In first year I met (well, actually introduced myself) to this cute girl, and we dated for a bit. Never my girlfriend though, because she has a crazy family (I stopped talking to her). I met some other girls along the way, they were interested but they just don't really have anything in common with me or SEVERAL OF THE GOOD ONES HAVE BOYFRIENDS. UGHH.

Of course, I do have some female friends who would be willing to date me, but I am not remotely interested in them so it would never work out. It seems like 70% of the girls I am interested in are in relationships. Or just other unfortunate stuff.

So yeah, the truth is I hate being single. It's not even about sex, I just want someone who I can be with romantically and basically be my best friend. I met this girl who I am crazy into last week, but it turns out she has a god damned boyfriend. People say that these things work themselves out naturally. But I'm afraid I'll live like that and find myself 7 years from now no further ahead and lonely.

I would love to hear any recommendations for how I can prepare - I'm currently in a Financial Management class where we're doing a lot of modeling, valuation, and NPV problems, so that's a start, but I need to be doing more - especially with Excel.

Does that mean anyone with webdev skills (or any skill that shows up regularly in job requirements) can just apply online and something to the order of 1/10 companies will be all over him? ""All over"" meaning: ""Please work for us, I'll pay for a flight for an interview and maybe a H1-B too."" (Can't currently pay for those things myself, so that's important to me).


Is this something worth trying? For reference, here's my personal resume tl;dr: CS sophomore thinking about his final 2016 internship (hoping it'll be in the states), has several side projects including android apps and rails apps, and has one upcoming big 4 2015 internship (would favour **any** american offer vs even an optimistic return to this big4, that's how bad the pay disparity is)"

I am stuck between these two majors. Right now, I have no real career plan. I just know I love physics, chemistry, math, tech stuff. Both of these majors seem perfect for me. I would love some insight into either of these. For the rest of this post, I will be discussing what the school actually offers.

ChemEng has a couple of focuses that can drastically what type of classes I take.

-Material Science and Engineering

-Process and Energy

-Environmental Engineering

-Biomedical Engineering

Now, the school I am going to actually combines Computer Science and Computer Engineering into a single major.

Opportunities:

-Competitions

--Mars Rover Design and Build

--Chem-E Car

--MicroMouse

--Hackathon

--Water Treatment

-Clubs

--Association fpr Computing Machinery

--American Institute of Chemical Engineers

--Technical Engineering Club

-Internships

--Both majors seem to have a decent amount of internship opportunities at my school. CompSciEng seems to have maybe one or two more.

I acknowledge that now, but obviously I cant go back and right those wrongs.

I have a personal website made, a project from school, and a personal web application I made after graduating. What more do I need to do, or perhaps, what is the best application of my time so that I can actually get a job, and where are the best places to look for them? I'm located in NYC if that matters.

Getting incredibly desperate here. If I need to post my resume then let me know ill edit out my personal details and stuff. Basically  know Java, some C/C++, HTML,CSS,JS and JS libraries. Looking to do something related to web development.

I'm in college, living in a stable home with a good family. I'll be moving out soon. I'm doing well academically and I'm currently on an internship.

Despite all that, my outlook on life has been getting increasingly negative. I feel like I'm pretty ineffective at my job because I get so anxious about social situations. I dread having to initiate even the simplest social interactions. I'm always uncomfortable unless I'm alone. I don't see how I can support myself financially after graduation or have any professional future when I'm this inadequate.  

I haven't made a single new friend since I moved from my home state three years ago. I'm continuing to withdraw from my old social circles and old bonds are becoming frayed and distant.

I don't see how I can live my entire life like this. What's the point of living if I'm always uncomfortable and I don't enjoy doing anything anymore? I've been thinking about suicide a lot for a while now. Really the only thing holding me back is my family. Every time I seriously think about killing myself I imagine the grief it would cause my parents and siblings and then I realize I couldn't really do it.

However, I can be very impulsive and I struggle with self-control. I worry that I would probably make a rash decision to commit suicide if I was given the chance.

I want to talk to my parents about these thoughts but I don't know what good that would do. I don't want to go to therapy and take a bunch of meds or whatever. And I think my mother would be incredibly nervous if I told her, especially since they're going to move to a different state soon and I'll be on my own.

I've always been the type of person to solve problems on my own. I think I do so much better in a college environment as opposed to a work environment because college is something I can do totally on my own, just me and a book.

So I'm wondering if it's possible for me to just pull myself out of this by my own. Are there any other introverts on here that have overcome their suicidal thoughts on their own? Has any kind of philosophy like Buddhism or stoicism worked for you to achieve mental peace? Am I thinking to much inside the box in terms of the trajectory of my life? Can you live an outsider lifestyle comfortably?"
327ca4,0,2015-04-11,Is this harassment? I'm not sure what to do.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/327ca4/is_this_harassment_im_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Hey I really need help here. Throwaway account. Sorry for being ambiguous; I am not sure what to do in this situation but I don't want to give away too much information.

So I've interned at a very highly renowned and well known research center for the last three summers (I'm in college) and last summer I worked with a group at this lab that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun with. As usual each summer, I ended up making what I thought were good friends within my group that added to the set of friends I had made when I was at this place before, and since last summer I've (as usual) kept in touch with them.

One of these friends of mine also happened to be my mentor over the summer, and again it's really normal for me to make friends with my mentors. I feel more comfortable and work better in a friendly environment so that's something that natrually seems to happen. This mentor is married and has heard me go on and on about my very serious boyfriend (seriously waiting for him to pop the question any day now kind of serious) literally every day so it honestly never even crossed my mind of this being anything more than a friendship. I always treated this person in my mind the way I treat all of my friends and that's that.

So a couple days ago this mentor starts sending me these weird texts asking if I want to talk about ""it"" and I have no idea what they are referring to. So here I am like ""shoot!"" because this person knows I really want to work at this place after I graduate soon and am currently trying to get hired there, so I was thinking they meant like a project proposal that I somehow forgot about, or something work related. They kept playing this weird game but would never ever say anything more in text (a huge red flag I've now realized).

Well today I get a call from this person and come to find out that they thought I was coming on to them all last summer (?????) and that they are interested in me in that way and are pretty sure I am too. I was in so much shock that I couldn't say anything at first and then was like no...? what??? wait what?? and the convo ended with them being apparently surprised at this (?!).

Of course after the call once things sunk in I really wish I had been like ""WHAT THE FUCK YOU HAVE A WIFE CREEP"" and all sorts of other things, but maybe being speechless is for the better because they work where I want to work and are VERY well connected around this research center and I'm afraid pissing them off could ruin my reputation and budding career I've worked so hard for right at the start.

WHAT DO I DO???? I laughed it off with my boyfriend because wtf... but seriously is this harassment? I'm VERY uncomfortable in this situation and I'm pretty sure they know it yet they even tried to call me again after the fact. They won't say anything in writing which makes me so mad because I feel like if I do anything and this ever comes back to bite me I will have literally no evidence other than my word, which could end really really badly for me.

I don't think it's my place to send a message their wife. At the same time, if my husband was hitting on the young intern in the office, I'd sure as hell want to know so I can kick his ass to the curb. Rude.

Also take me and the fact that I am really likely to be engaged soon (AND THEY KNOW IT) and how insanely unprofessional and twisted this all is out of the equation here... how could they think this would be a good way to start a relationship? My dad cheated on my mom. I know you NEVER EVER trust a cheater because they will only turn around and cheat on you. How dumb. This person is so not who I thought and I don't think it's appropriate to be friends anymore but I'm not sure how to say that either because I'm so afraid of pissing them off and burning bridges. Sorry I'm just in shock about this whole thing and I don't know who to go to. Please help."

327nyv,13,2015-04-11,Feeling Overwhelmed and Underprepared for the Job I Want. Graduating In a Month!,SaberCrunch,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/327nyv/feeling_overwhelmed_and_underprepared_for_the_job/,"So, let me start out by saying I'm fortunate enough to have a pretty good network and I'm not in a terrible position career-wise (at least yet).

 I'm graduating from a fairly small school with a BS in CS (3.67 GPA 3.9 in-major GPA).  I had a web development internship with a local company last summer and accepted a job offer for after I graduate.  I applied to many other companies and was fortunate enough to make it through 2 technical interviews with Google for a Mountain View position but my application was dropped after a 3rd.  I received several job offers but none compelling enough to go over the company I already work for (Either the money wasn't enough or I didn't care about what they did.)

 The full time position is as a Java developer and pitching in on some web development from time to time.  They were also very generous in offering to pay for Grad school if I want it, so I'll be starting my Masters in 6 months when i'm eligible for tuition coverage.

Now my dilemma.  I don't want to be at this company forever.  Ideally, I'd stick around for a year or 2 to get my masters and I'd love to work for a company like Twitch or similar companies in the Bay Area.  The only problem is, I don't feel like I'm good enough at what I do to compete and earn a spot out there.  It just feels like the competition is a lot tougher on the west coast.  


 I don't have that Stanford or Washington caliber education.  I'm the top of the CS students in my class where I go to school, but I feel like that isn't saying much.  I have a great understanding of Java (in my opinion) and solid experience with JS, HTML/CSS, Python, C++, and Objective C.  I also have done numerous self-projects with the previous languages but with graduating so close I just feel unprepared.  My biggest fear is being stuck at a company where I'm doing a job I don't care about, regardless of how great the people and company itself are.

Am I in trouble for the future or just freaking out for no reason?  I just have this sinking feeling in my mind that I'm just not cut out to work for an awesome company with my current technical skill set.

**TL;DR** - I feel underprepared with my coursework from school and my current technical skills, even though my resume and GPA would suggest otherwise.  I'm afraid this will lead to me to a dead end job I hate when I want a job I love out west."

327y8x,2,2015-04-11,Is it worth it to postpone my CS degree to get it from a better university?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/327y8x/is_it_worth_it_to_postpone_my_cs_degree_to_get_it/,"I'm currently attending a public college in New York, about to finish my BA (they do not offer a BS) in computer science in one year.

I didn't qualify for financial aid grants and so I went here for its low tuition costs ($6600/year). In the New York public college system (CUNY), this college was one of the best among them when I picked it. Though, that is not saying much as New York public colleges really lack prestige.

So I'm thinking of postponing my CS degree by moving to California, where there are dozens of top-ranked CS programs. I've always planned to move there. I like it more and the tech opportunities are much more plentiful. I would have to discontinue school for about 2-3 years. After which, I would have established myself as a California resident and qualify for in-state tuition for their public universities.

There are numerous reasons why I rather get a degree from a better university.

- Personal achievement. I want my alma mater to be a respectable one.

- Statistically, graduates from top tier CS programs make significantly more money in their early careers.

- From what I've read, post-grad degrees are worth very little in this field. If I want a prestigious degree, it should be earned in undergrad.

- I may spend some time working abroad in the future and I've been told these employers highly prefer graduates from top schools.

- A top tier university would provide me much greater means of networking. My current college is a commuter school with no campus life or active computer science interest groups.

- My current college only hands out BAs, even for Computer Science. Many job postings require a BS. Though, many would agree that this is semantics and won't matter much.

So if I go on with this plan, I would spend 2-3 years doing self-learning, internships and getting myself involved in the industry in any way. I already have some offered opportunities I could pursue in California.

But I'm 21 right now. And people tell me that this plan (which they view was throwing away 2-3 years) will be wasting my prime years.

I know Redditors tend to place very little value on CS degrees, but if it's going to represent me for the rest of my life, I want it done right."
3287yo,17,2015-04-11,Should I take a year off?,Grapedrank47,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3287yo/should_i_take_a_year_off/,"Last May, I herniated two discs in the gym. I spent all summer in serious pain and by the time university began last September nothing had improved and I was on all kinds of medication. Although the pain remains today, I have gotten through almost all of first year (finals left) and my grades are actually very good. This year, however, was nothing like I had hoped it would be. I had no motivation to get involved in any extracurriculars, I couldn't play sports and I was in pain 24/7. I was hoping to push myself to do one of volunteering abroad with a program at my school, taking extra courses or finding an internship, all this summer. However, my plans were shattered when my surgeon said that I will probably need surgery this summer. The MRI which determines that is two weeks away, and I'm left with no clue as to how my summer is going to go. I haven't even applied to extra-curricular positions for next year because I am finding myself scrambling for finals as I really lost motivation in the last month and have started to let things slip. Despite all of this, the worst part is that I have steadily been slipping into depression as the pain is not pretty and I have isolated myself from almost everyone.

If I take a year off I hope to:
- Recover fully from the surgery or seek proper pain management if it ends up not happening. Maybe even learnt to exercise with the condition.
- Travel and visit my family if my health permits.
- Apply for that volunteer abroad opportunity.
- Apply for extra curricular teams and positions for upcoming year.
- Prep for LSAT (I wish to attend law school after my BCom).
- Learn to code and pick up reading again
- Perhaps find work if I'm healthy again.

Some issues I have identified:
- I am on a full ride scholarship and taking a year off may get that revoked.
- I will fall behind my peers and graduate a year later.
- It may affect law school admissions (not sure about this).
- It could turn out to be a complete waste of time and I could return with diminished study skills.

I talked to an academic adviser and she liked the idea so I am really considering it. Does anyone have experience with a gap year? What would you recommend if you were in my position."

I am currently studying an I/O psych masters in London and very torn between doing it or not.

My main concern is not being able to find work in the states related to my masters. From what I gather many I/O courses in the states require students to undertake an internship as part of their course. However I have no such experience and therefore assume I would lose out to those graduates in most job opportunities. 

Ideally I would like to get my foot in the door in an I/O psych company or get work in some form of HR, but with pretty much no work experience in the area (I will have training in administering psychometric personality tests) would moving to the states be too much of a gamble for me?

This visa opportunity seems too good to pass up, as I may not get a chance to work in the states as easily again, so I feel like I should take it, but I still have that uneasy feeling that it could be a big mistake.

I know it's unlikely anyone here has been in the exact same situation as me but I'm wondering has anyone any experience of entering the states as a graduate with little experience and looking for work other than bar or cafe work? or if anyone has any idea of entry level job market for I/O psych or HR?

They are calling it a research/internship opportunity, but from what I have gathered, it's basically going to be me doing all of the programming work that they have neither the time nor, I suspect, the skill to do themselves.

My ultimate goal is to start a company pertaining to artificial intelligence. In the likely event that this doesn't happen, I want to at least wind up with a job related to the field. If THAT doesn't happen, I want to be prepared to be a software engineer indefinitely. This internship will have me dealing with climate data and climate models and possibly even machine learning stuff.


Here are a few details:

- I told them I would work 40hrs/week if they get the research grant they submitted and paid me. If they don't get it, I told them I'd consider working 20hrs/week for free.
- Currently, they have written a lot of the code in matlab. They told me that they might want to enhance the code, however, and that I might be able to use a different programming language. I am worried, however, that I will get stuck using matlab.
- The professors did not come off as seasoned programmers and gave me the impression they did not have that good of an idea about what they were doing code wise. I feel that I could really get down and dirty with things and demonstrate my skills.
- They're going to put my name on the paper related to the project.
- If I do well, I can probably ask these professors for letters of recommendation.


How do you guys think a job like this will look on a resume as opposed to a run-of-the-mill internship at a software company? My perception is that this job will differentiate me from a lot of other students, but I do not have a good idea of what employers want."

32a2tv,6,2015-04-11,TIFU by eating an edible on my birthday and scaring my parents into thinking I was having a seizure,blueseattle_19,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/32a2tv/tifu_by_eating_an_edible_on_my_birthday_and/,"First, a little back-story before the shit show. In October my boyfriend and I made about twenty pumpkin square edibles that were about the size of your average brownie. The first time I ate one, I only consumed half of the square. It had been a while since I had eaten an edible, so I wanted to be cautious since my first edible experience ended with me thinking I was puking up my rib cage. After waiting about 45 minutes it started to kick in and I was high af and freaking myself out. It took us some time to figure out a good portion size, and in the end we cut the original squares down to sixteenths. These slivers were a good size to achieve a comfortable high.

Alright, so fast forward to December 19th—the day of my birthday. I’m home for winter break, and I decided to bring some of the edibles with me. Now, for the past seven or eight years it’s tradition that my family and I go to this teppanyaki restaurant for my birthday.  You know, the kind where they dress you up as a samurai and take a Polaroid of you as you blow out the candle on your mochi ice cream. It’s great food and a lot of fun, so I decided to continue the tradition. My mom made a reservation for seven o’clock that evening, which would give my sister and her fiancée enough time to meet us there. 

Now I had stopped smoking and eating edibles for a short period of time because I just interviewed for a job, and wanted to pass the drug test in case they decided to hire me. Well a few days before, I found out that I didn’t make it to the second round of interviews, so I thought why not celebrate by having an edible on my birthday and eating large amounts of fried rice, salmon and grilled vegetables. Sounds great right? So I eat an edible around six, an hour before our reservation.

We get there a little after seven, but had to wait because my sister and her fiancée were still on their way. At this point the edible starts to kick in and I’m feeling pretty hungry. Perfect timing. About ten minutes later my sister and her fiancée arrive and we get our table, where I’m seated in the middle. We place our order, and the chef comes out and does the whole show of flipping the eggshells into his hat and turning the stack of grilled onions into a volcano. It’s pretty awesome being high seeing all this fire and hearing all the clanking of the knives, but at this point I’ve reached a comfortable high, and hope that it doesn’t go any further. 

Since I’m home for the break, my family is conversing with me, and asking how school is going, how my internship is etc., but me being extremely high I really don’t want to talk much, so keep my answers short and my mouth full of food. After eating all my meal, I sit back in my chair and look around the restaurant. I’m feeling overwhelmed by all the conversation and kind of freaked out by all the noise and the fires going on at the other tables around us. I must have closed my eyes to try and calm myself, because there was a pause in whatever conversation was going on, and my dad asks “Hey u/blueseattle_19 is everything okay?” I put my hands on my stomach and reply saying, “I don’t think the fish is really settling well.” My dad responds with, “Do you need to use the restroom?” I nod my head yes. There was a problem though. I couldn’t get up. At all. It felt like the lower half of my body was glued to the stool. There was another pause in conversation and my dad asks “Ummm. Do you want me to help you up?” I nodded my head again and he came over. I threw my arm around his shoulder as he directed my semi-limp body towards the restroom, and I whisper in his ear, “Can we just go home? I’m really not feeling well.” He nods yes.

We get to the restroom where there’s a line. Really?! A line to the men’s restroom? My dad leaves me there alone to wait in line, while he goes back to tell my mom to ask for the check, so that we could leave. Next thing I know I’m rolling around in the middle of the hallway with my eyes closed, which clearly caused some commotion, cause my dad rushes over to see what was going on. Not knowing what is happening he shouts out loud, “Someone call 911! He’s having a seizure!” At this point I realize that shit just got real. I open my eyes and take control of my body and whisper, “You don’t have to do that. Don’t call 911.” My dad asks, “What’s wrong? Is everything okay?” Hearing the concern in his voice and seeing everyone standing around me I feel bad, and spill the beans telling him about the edible I ate before dinner and apologize profusely. 

As my dad is helping me up off the ground, I feel some warmth on the back of my leg. I touch the back of my pants and realized that, yes, I had peed my pants. I put my sweater around my waist in an attempt to cover the obvious dark spot as I completed my walk of shame out the restaurant.

No samurai outfit. No ice cream. No Polaroid for our collection.


TL;DR Ate an edible before my birthday dinner, had a bad trip at the restaurant, peed my pants, parents thought I was having a seizure."
32a5pm,3,2015-04-11,What was your hourly wage each year you interned? And which offer should I take?,justcuriousthough,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32a5pm/what_was_your_hourly_wage_each_year_you_interned/,"I'm mostly curious, because I got paid around $17 per hour at my first internship, and now I'm being offered a really wide range of wages from the companies that have given me offers so far. I'm a sophomore at a top 20 public university. I don't have a whole lot of experience, and my GPA isn't really standout, either. I have a fair amount of leadership activities, and I have a couple small projects I did freshman year that went over well with recruiters.

I'm just curious (I like data and comparing things), so I'm gonna ask: what were your wages for each year you had an internship?

**Internship 1**: fairly small but extremely well-known and pretty prestigious software company (~3,000 employees). Interned the summer after my freshman year. Paid $17 an hour. I absolutely loved working there; everyone was super friendly, I absolutely loved the project I was working on (it's my pride and joy) and there were cool random perks like a super casual dress code, CEO hiring ice cream trucks to drive around and hand out free ice cream to employees, getting to work with unreleased software and apps, I got my own office as an intern, I got a giant box of Legos + an Arduino microcontroller kit + a Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone to play around with, there were outdoor barbecue lunches for employees, and monthly social events, among other things. An amazing first internship experience.

**Internship 2**: I have 3 offers so far.

* First one is a return offer from the company from Internship 1, with a salary of $20/hr, and I'd be working on similar stuff from last summer, just more complex. It's near where I live, so I don't need relocation.

* The second offer is from a large energy company in a large city on the west coast (~20,000 employees). They're offering to pay for my flights and 1/2 of my housing expenses; my offered hourly wage is $22 per hour, and $33 per hour for overtime. I'd be working on data analytics.

* The third offer is from a large job search site company (~5,000 employees). It's near where I live, so no relocation needed. They're offering me $30 per hour, and I'd be working on database engineering.

Thoughts and comments? :)"
32a8oa,3,2015-04-11,Should I renege an internship offer?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/32a8oa/should_i_renege_an_internship_offer/,"Hi,

So I am sort of at a dilemma.
Currently I have a few choices but I've narrowed it down to 2: 

* 1. To work at a big national retail company where I've just accepted the offer to 3 days ago
* 2. Renege the offer and work for the big international tech company that just accepted me

Option 1:

 Pros:

* No Reneging
* Like the job
* No relocation
* Great name recognition (fortune 1xx)

Cons:

* Far away from home (30+ min)
* Low pay (only 10 to 20$)

As the the 2nd option:

Pro:

* Big Company (fortune 1xx)
* Known for awesome internship program
* Free relocation/housing assistance
* High pay (23 to 33)


Con:

* Relocation
* Reneging other offer
* Not the job I want, but I can switch to the one I want next year.


The first company is 100% not a company I would want to work for full time, (or ever go back to for that matter) and I really do like the 2nd company, but I don't know if it is the right place for me to start my career. But anyway, I guess my main problem is I don't want to screw up my relationship with the first company just because they recruit heavily at my school so it may make networking events a little awkward and I am afraid that other recruiters at my school will find out that I reneged an offer thus barring me from working for anyone else. I also feel bad for reneging because then they will have to look for a new intern in 2 months. I guess the good news is I've never actually met the recruiter so as long as I never mention my name, things won't be awkward.


Both companies carries high chances of them inviting me back next year for internship and eventually full time.

32b3g6,3,2015-04-12,I'd like some help before things really go bad.,as1kennel,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/32b3g6/id_like_some_help_before_things_really_go_bad/,"Hi. I'm 25. I have a Master's degree and I currently make just under $60,000 a year. I make more than my parents even though they're twice my age. My coworkers are friendly and helpful. My bosses are considerate and they have my back when other parts of the organization come knocking. My finances are in good shape, too. In the past year I've bought a car; I've built my own computer; I've built myself a $6,000 emergency fund; and, thanks to my habit of putting half of my salary toward my student loans, I'll be debt free in two years!

Yet, despite all of these positive external things, I'm not doing well internally. Thoughts of suicide plague me constantly. At first they were a trickle, but now they're a raging torrent. Here, in as succinct a manner as I'm capable of right now, is why.

* As I went through high school, college, and graduate school, I tried very hard to stay on the straight and narrow. I wanted to succeed and I'd been taught that in order to succeed I had to make smart decisions. So I went through school actively avoiding a lot of things. I never tried any drugs. I didn't drink. I didn't party. I didn't sleep around. I avoided those things because I believed it was the right thing to do. I believed that not doing those things made me a better person and set me up for success. But it didn't. When I went through graduate school my classmates had done all those things. When I entered the workforce my peers and coworkers had all done those things too! They did all those things that I avoided and they were and are in exactly the same position I am. They're climbing the same mountains and accomplishing the same goals! That's been hard to swallow. What exactly did I accomplish by being responsible? What was the point if the people that did those things are right here with me? More and more it seems like I wasted the opportunities of my youth for nothing.

* I chose to major in economics in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years in college. I chose economics because it spoke to my desire to know what's going on ""behind the curtain."" I chose economics because it gave me a framework with which to understand the world around me. I loved it. But there was something about economics that I didn't anticipate: the politics. As I went through school, people would ask me about economics and I would do my best to explain. But they weren't interested in what I had to say. They had already decided their position and either ignored what I had to say or threw it back in my face. That stung, but I managed to rationalize it. ""These people are idiots,"" I told myself. ""They're not my intellectual peers. They're stupid. People as smart as I am wouldn't be so dismissive."" So I stuck the course.

      I eventually had the chance to test my hypothesis. I was admitted into an internship program in Washington, DC, that would put me in classes with other handpicked students from around the country. I was thrilled. I was excited. ""I will finally be surrounded by peers,"" I thought to myself. ""I'll finally have real discussions."" What a joke. My classmates in DC were more obstinate and intractable than the people I'd run into before. Even factual statements like ""the Federal Reserve manages the money supply by buying and selling Treasury securities"" were met with condescension and derision. Class discussions weren't discussions. They were shouting matches where people simply parroted their pre-determined ideologies instead of listening to each other. 

     My experience in DC taught me that my education and opinions don't matter. No one gives a shit what I think. No one gives a shit what I've learned. Even with a Ph.D. the things I have to say won't be worth the dirt we walk on. After DC I shut down a lot of the things I used to enjoy. I stopped watching documentaries; I stopped watching the news; I stopped contributing to conversations. Why think about things if those thoughts aren't worth jack shit? I also came up with a new rationalization to keep me going. ""Okay, people don't give a shit what you say, but that's because they don't know you. The people that know you, the people that are close to you - those people care about you and what you have to say."" As a result I became intensely loyal to my friends. And I kept studying economics.

* While I was in graduate school I met, dated, and fell in love with another Master's student. She fell in love with me too. We had a wonderful time together. Five months later that girl broke up with me. It was sudden; it was unexpected; and it left me heartbroken. I asked, maybe even begged, her to talk it out with me before ending the relationship. She refused. Heartbroken, I turned to my friends for support and consolation. But my friends weren't up to the task. Instead of helping me, they took this girl's side! They called me an asshole for wanting to talk about things before breaking up! Breaking up with my girlfriend was heartbreaking, but having my friends side against me was positively devastating. After that I went into an emotional free fall. Attempts to repair the friendships went nowhere because I was never able to get them to see my side of the coin. The best I got was that we had a ""miscommunication"" and we eventually just stopped talking to each other. Losing my love and my friends simultaneously was too much to bear, and for the first time in my life I began to consider suicide as a viable alternative. How else was I going to stop the bleeding?

That was last year. Back then I would think, ""What about suicide? There's no joy in death, but there's no pain either. Maybe you'll find peace in death."" Things have accelerated since then. Today, suicidal thoughts occupy every free moment of my life. And I no longer think that suicide might be an option. Now suicide IS the option. Now I think, ""I want to die."" And it's not just about my friends anymore. Now it's more than that. Now it's about the fact that I can't trust anybody. Stupid people didn't give a shit about me and what I had to say. Smart students like me didn't give a shit about me and what I had to say. And, finally, the people I trusted and confided in didn't give a shit about me and what I had to say. 

Now it's also about the fact that I can't make good decisions for myself. I should have chosen a less political major, one where others would respect my expertise, but I didn't. I should have seen the writing on the wall when my classmates in Washington spit on what I had to say, but I didn't. I should have done crazy, stupid shit when I was in high school, but I didn't. I should have slept around in college when I had the chance, but I didn't. In the former cases, I ignored the warnings. In the latter cases, I denied myself all kinds of things for reasons that turned out to be total bullshit. What other erroneous beliefs are lurking inside my mind? Can I really trust myself to make good decisions about my life anymore? This track record says otherwise.

So now I'm here, sitting at my desk while suicidal thoughts run riot through my mind. I'm thankful that I haven't yet made an earnest suicide attempt, but that attempt is coming. I spent this afternoon (and my afternoon last Saturday) dri...oh, it says not to talk about methods. Never mind!

Well, I guess that's it. What now?"
32bg8q,1,2015-04-12,What Internship suits my career path?,ProfessorTaavi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32bg8q/what_internship_suits_my_career_path/,"I currently have offers for two sandwich year internships A + B and I am a bit stuck at which one would benefit me the most in terms of career path. My intention once I finish my Computer Science degree is to move into software development but aim towards client facing and project management roles. I would consider myself an average programmer I have more exposure to industry practices than someone straight out of university with no experience as I have a part time role as an Application Developer. But my strengths lie more in my grasp of business + technical fundamentals so I am looking to work towards a role where I can exploit these the best. My question is which of the two roles is likely to be more of benefit to me in my career aims. Both of the internships are at a similar company with a similar rate of pay and both have follow on graduate programs.

Internship A 
Internship A was offered to me a while ago, on advice of the University I have accepted the offer but not signed the contract thus I would have to back down on my word which may hurt my reputation with the company. The role is a straight Software Development Role working on a large Java project in a Agile Environment, here I will significantly expand my own understanding of the technical process of development and will expand on my development skills + practices. But there is very little opportunity to experience management training or any form of client facing interaction.

Internship B 
Internship B was offered recently and is a more Architectural/Management role which will involve me working directly with a senior architect at the company I will be less exposed to coding practices + techniques but will be involved more with interacting directly with teams producing road maps and designs and general project management tasks over a number of varying projects. This role is also very likely to give me the opportunity to network with some potentially influential clients and use some of my existing skills and knowledge. This internship would be likely to lead into a Software Development role after graduation assuming I was to continue with the companies scheme.

I should add that it is my intention to retain the part time role throughout my internship as it can be performed remotely in my spare time. However whilst keeping my skills current, I feel it's unlikely to introduce any new key aspects.

Is it as important to initially have a strong experience of software development within companies as it would be to spend time with a senior architect designing potential solutions to clients problems and effectively managing projects right off the bat and focusing more on the development practices later?"

At high school teachers regularly come to me to fix their tech and I'm set to be an intern at the tech department next year.  As expected, I'm also the ""computer guy"" for my entire family.

My Mom (M) tends to get angry pretty easily.  She had just gotten a new Dell laptop and wanted a regular mouse to use rather than the trackpad.  I had one lying around so I hooked it up for her and she was happy for at least month.  Then one day I get a call from her that went something like this:

&gt;Me: Hi Mom

&gt;M: Why would you give me a mouse that doesn't work!

&gt;Me: What? That mouse worked fine.  There's no way it just doesn't work now.

&gt;M: Well you gave me a broken mouse!  You better get me a new one!

&gt;Me: I'm on my way

I end the call and head down to her office.  She's sitting at her laptop with a frustrated expression on her face.

&gt;M: It won't move or anything!

So I jiggle the mouse a bit and sure enough nothing happens.  I wiggle my finger across the trackpad just to make sure it isn't frozen or anything and it works fine.  So I decide to simply unplug the mouse and plug it back in, thinking maybe Windows didn't recognize it or something.  I turn the laptop to unhook the USB cable, and that's where the problem is.  She had managed to jam the USB plug into the Ethernet port.

&gt;Me: Why is it hooked in to the Ethernet port?

&gt;M: The what?

I just hook it into the right port and tell her to never put it anywhere but there.

TL;DR USB Connectors don't go in the Ethernet port. *facepalm*"

I applied to a large company that a lot of people might like to work for just as a summer internship to complement my MS information systems type degree (I graduate next year). I got two interviews, one a week before the other.

For the first, I interviewed and was told I'd hear back in at most a week. I didn't hear back after a week. In the meantime, I got interviewed by another manager in their IT department for a different position.
I was offered that one right away, and I asked for a little time to think about it, to see if the other offer would come through. When it didn't, I accepted the second position.

This morning, (two days after I accepted the other, and more than a week after the first interview) I got an email offering me the first position. Either one is an honor, but the first position is much more in line with my career goals and training thus far.

My question is, in your opinion, should I stick with the second position that I've already accepted, or try to call and ask if I can switch to the first? The etiquette sounds kind of dicey here and I'd rather not create a bunch of ill will before I even step in the door.

I can provide more info if needed, but I'm trying to stay as low profile about this as possible (this is a throwaway account). They are both paid the same. They are both in the same building of the same company in the same (large) IT department. It's just that one is a better fit than the other, but its not the one I've accepted.

And I did not put in for these separately. The company has all IT interns put in on one application, and then different managers call who they like.

Please let me know what you think! Thank you for your time and perusal. :)"

I had the initiative to post today because I'm at the end of my rope and feel I should reach out. I've been a pretty neurotic person my entire life, but these last 2-3 years have gradually been sending me spiraling out of control. Long story short, I've been treated like shit by a partner's family for a few years, have had no control over my life (don't even have my own room), no money to move out, and yet I have been working 40+ hours/wk (part time jobs and an unpaid internship hopefully for graduate work).

I'm at the point where I've had no will to live for the last year and the only thing that's kept me from killing myself is the fear of being found (and hospitalized, leading to way worse problems) and not being successful in my attempt. I am also very conscientious, so the idea of letting down my supervisor(s) at my internship really bothers me as well.

I have tried cheap methods like fish oil and exercise, but they can only do so much in a really toxic environment. I don't have a feasible way of moving out until next Fall at the soonest, and if I do this I will be ending a 5 year relationship with no support from anyone.

The only thing that keeps me going is the work I'm passionate in (which is why I have been doing the unpaid internship - which I love)  but until I reach a point where I can afford alternative places to live/new options in my life I am wondering if there are any resources I can consult for therapy and anti-depressant prescriptions. I have been forced to function quite high despite a lot of toxic people I'm surrounded with and having to save absolutely every penny from part-time jobs. 

My insurance is awful and I'd have an expensive co-pay, which is why I haven't been able to do this by myself. I know some places work on a sliding scale, but transportation is also difficult so I would only be able to go to the doctor once every two weeks or so. It's mostly the anti-depressants I need help with since a lot of the problems with my environment are completely out of my control (until the next few months, anyway) so talking about them doesn't help at all.

Thanks for listening, and any suggestions."

I'm now a junior CS major.

So anyway, all my previous internships over the summer have been closer to the EE side of the spectrum, but I got two pretty good offers this summer than stood out to me more than the other three offers I got (the other three were not very competitive in salary and were not very well known companies):

* First offer is for a well known telecom company in the bay area. Position title is RF &amp; Network engineer intern. Pay is competitive at &gt;$30/hr. Company is well known but from reading GlassDoor apparently lay off a good amount of people every year. I have absolutely no idea what my internship would consist of over the summer since they haven't told me what project I'd be working on.

* Second offer is a medium sized software company in the bay area that mostly deals with enterprise databases. Pay is also &gt;$30/hr, and $5 more per hour than the above offer. Job title is simply software engineer intern. My project will be mostly working on getting around data transfer bottlenecks that currently exist in their software in order to increase productivity. The interview was pretty damn difficult and the manager that I would have if I accepted this one said they use a ton of stuff from algorithm analysis and data structures classes so I should come prepared.

I honestly have no idea which of the two would be better in the long run, since I switched to CS so recently. Which of the two do you guys think would look best on my resume in the long run and would help me secure a good job when I graduate next year?

Thanks so much for the help guys!"

My GPA, at around 3.4, isn't terrible or anything but I feel like I retain absolutely nothing from past classes. I can't even begin to think about solving basic problems regarding op-amps, RLC circuits, transistors, etc. My concentration was embedded systems so I feel like I know how to read data sheets, put different digital components together, and do basic coding, but that's about it really.

To make the matter a bit more confusing, I'd had a web development phase and spent a lot of time working on my personal web application projects. My only internship was in this field as well so most EE companies would probably look at my resume and think of me as someone who wants to do web/software development.

I'm not sure what to do. When I look up most jobs I qualify for (EE/hardware), I feel like I have no chance of passing technical interviews. I royally suck at data structures &amp; algorithms so the software side is out of the picture as well.

I'm just blindly applying to general engineering positions but haven't had any luck so far. Was anyone in similar positions? What should I aim for?"

I've accepted the fact I will likely meet the same fate as many other Pre-CSE students. This isn't particularly upsetting, and I have faith I'll find another, potentially unconventional, way to end up in a CS related career. Plus I like core curriculum of both EE and HCDE. However, the difficulty of getting into a CS related career without the CS major is what worries me. That leads me into my questions.


 I've seen UW EE/Informatics/HCDE graduates end up with computer science related careers on this subreddit , but  realistically, how frequently does that happen? 

What's the job market like for these graduates? 

Would a EE/Informatics/HCDE undergrad be incapable of getting an internship either blending their discipline with CS or an internship that's largely CS due to competition with actual CS undergrads? 

Would a EE/Informatics/HCDE undergrad be able to take higher level CS courses in order to build their portfolio/skills? 

Any help you can offer me is greatly appreciated! I'm weighing University of San Diego and UW , so any sort of detailed answer I would likely find really insightful into this decision.

I would suggest reading the whole post even tl;dr - there's essentially three aspects: debt, social life, and starting salary that I cover in detail below.

**tl;dr** Univ of Illinois = 75k debt, but superior CS edu. Illinois Institute of Tech (IIT) (decent CS) = 15-20k debt. I will be commuting at IIT and feel like I will lose networking and social life as I will commute = less of the college experience. Also, there's less career fairs at IIT and Im afraid I wont get internships, where as Univ Illinois has all companies. Is going to Univ of Illinois really worth the debt? Will the salary be that much different? Would I be foolish to go with a Univ Illinois?
-----

I am a senior in high school that has been accepted into the CS program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). To put it short, it's one of the best CS schools for undergrad/grad just ranking below CMU, Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley. Bottom line is: people get jobs. The problem: it will incur some big debt.

On the other hand, I've been accepted at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) which will put me in much less debt. It's not superior in CS, though.

*University of Illinois*
I have done the math, and I will end up with **$114,000*** in debt. However, my parents can definitely afford to put down $10,000 a year (total 40k), cutting it down to about **75,000** in debt. Recruiters from top companies like Google, FB, etc.

*IIT*
I will only be around **$15-20k** in debt. I will commute, and perhaps lose on networking. There are also less companies recruiting, but it's in Chicago - which apparently may be a location benefit. No big recruiters, but many grads get jobs at the big companies (google, fb, etc.)

*The issue*
I want to go to Univ. of Illinois simply because I have the chance to get the best CS education and social life. IIT will give me a really good education, and my parents say that, in reality, there's not going to be a difference in salary. Are they right about this? Does a top 5 CS grad really make that much more than one from another decently reputable school? Also, I will be commuting when going to IIT so I believe I will lose out on the whole networking aspect of things. Social life at IIT will be down low too, so I will lose out on the whole college experience IMO.

**Is University of Illinois worth it?**

NOTE: This decision has been bothering me to the fact that I cannot even think about anything else. **I want the cold-hard truth: is 3/4 of 100k debt *really worth* it for just compromising four years of a better social life and CS education that may just give me the same job?** Many IIT grads end up at big companies too, but not nearly as frequent as UIUC. Am I being silly by sticking with UIUC just for a college experience and maybe a bit more salary? I love this school (UIUC), but money and social life (staying vs commuting, networking, etc.) are the only things holding me back."

1. Junior CS major with 2 QA and 1 SE internship
2. Slightly above average interview test taking skills
3. Below average social/soft skills
4. My resume: https://i.imgur.com/15Xho6Q.png
5. No other prospects at the moment

The job:

1. Test automation internship at a big data Hadoop startup company that was acquired by a huge company 
2. Will be doing performance testing/building in-house tools to monitor testing 
3. I got tested a lot on SQL statements, so this might be a bit of database work, although they are a database software company
4. Parent company is decently reputable (not a top company but a known name in the industry)

Questions:

1. Do you think I will be able to get a SE internship if I skip out on this one?
2. Would working on my own projects or taking this internship be better for me next year to get into the search engines/NLP/data analytics field?

My thoughts:

I've gotten cat fished for QA positions like 50 times already when sending out SDE intern applications. This position was actually one that I got catfished into lol. I feel like another QA internship, even though it's automation QA instead of manual QA won't help at all. 



Money isn't an issue for me. I have enough money to pay rent for the entire summer to work on my personal projects (which will be relevant to the field that I want to get into after college) and study up on algorithms. 

All I care about is getting into a search engine/e-commerce company like Zillow/Red Fin/Kayak/Trip Advisor/Google/Amazon after graduation.

What do you guys think?

32fhic,15,2015-04-13,Should I keep being a unpaid intern for a indie game studio or start on my own?,Instinctx,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/32fhic/should_i_keep_being_a_unpaid_intern_for_a_indie/,"Hello everyone!  
I am currently an unpaid intern for a small indie studio, and I am having a blast and learning A LOT being here. This is the place where I learned intermediate programming techniques and how to create a game from start to finish.  
  
This internship has been a fulltime thing for the past 9 months, and now I am getting short on cash... And the harsh reality is: I need to get another job to not starve to death.  
  
I was prepared for this to happen, so it is no shock for me. I basically wanted to be a unpaid intern for as long as I could, so I could get as much game dev experience as possible before the money ran out.  
  
 
But now I need to chose between staying with the Game Dev studio,  OR start up on my own (small).  
-  
  
My plan is to get a part time job to get some income and still continue developing games. But I can't continue working for the Game Studio if I want to work my own games (because lack of energy and time). And I really want to create games on my own!  
  
Basically, I feel that I have the expertise to create+finish small mobile games on my own. And I think it would be a great experience for me. And if I can make some money out of it great, if not, it's fine. And I can go back to being an intern again.   
  
So should I leave the internship, create 1-2 mobile games on my own (my dream), see if I get any success. Or should I just stay with the internship to gain more experience?  
  
I have one mobile game in the works that I believe could be quite big (it might flop, but that would be an important experience on its own). And I've done quite some research, so I know what I need to do to make it successful.  
And I really want to finish it (and another project that I am also developing), but I don't have the energy and time to work on my personal project after sitting 8 hours each day programming on the game for the studio I am working for.  
  
EDIT: I am going to finish the current game project we are working on in any case. So if I am going solo, then I am doing it AFTER our current project is finished.  
  
EDIT 2: Wow, I left out a vital bit of information:
I got this internship straight out of college (hard to get Game dev work where I live).  
It was me who asked them for a position, they said they don't have the money to pay me, and they need to get the first game out to get the cash to pay me. So I accepted the terms to work for free.  
I did this, as it is crucial for me to get some experience right after school, and to get a foot inside the industry.
We are working on our big project that might be the game that actually gives the business some big revenue, and if that happens I will be the first guy to get a PAID fulltime job at that studio! :) So I am kinda helping the studio to get on their feet, and in return get a paid position.  
  
Also, I've read every comment, will respond when I get home (currently working)

After the last semester I feel awfully guilty about staying at home everyday and not doing anything with my life, so I applied for multiple jobs and internships.  

Very few got back to me, almost none called me up for an interview. 

Until my current company, which straight after the day I applied, they gave me a call and ask me to go down for an interview the day after.  

I was delighted, but didn't realise these all might be too good to be true.  

During the interview they asked very basic simple questions, and didn't even ask to see my portfolio, and they asked me to start on the day itself.(Which I couldn't, so I told them I could start next week)  

After the interview they told me the internship contract would be for a year, which should have raised a red flag for me, but I was dazed and excited with the idea of doing something productive and related to my field of studies, so I ignored it.  

The red flag was raised today on my first day at work.  

I messaged the HR lady the day before and found out that the office hour is 9.30AM to 6PM.  

I reached at 9.15AM, sat down because most of the people have not reached the office yet.  

The company is a small scaled, with about 10 to 20 workers at most.  

The person who is the boss of the company noticed me sitting there and asked who I was(he wasn't there during the interview), I introduced myself and he called me to his desk and started explaining the expectations and told me to be keen to learn.  

At this point I was still pretty convinced that this was a good idea, until the details for the contract were presented to me.  

The HR lady came and explained the contract, which states that the working hours is 10AM to 7PM, however the boss insist that I need to come to the office at 9AM.  

After that I was assigned a few videos to edit, I did one versions of editing, but it was immediately rejected by the boss when he saw it. Which I found acceptable and that was what I expected at the work place.  

Then at 7PM, after I've finished editing the boss came in to the editing studio and rejected it again.  

Then he asked whether do I want to go home first and come back tomorrow to continue the editing, which later my friend explained to me could be a trick question to see my enthusiasm.  

But I'm an intern, I don't get overtime pay, and these videos was supposed to be a 'test' to see my style of editing(which he barely watched till the end for both times), he gave me very little notes on what is to be expected of the final product.  

Then before I was on my way, he asked another worker to give his copy of the office key to me, and told me from now on I have to open the office up at 9AM everyday.  

A lady who was sitting nearby overheard and told me to not worry about it because she will be here too, which I found extremely comforting but also made me realise that it is quite a unreasonable request.  

After I got home I had a chat about my day with a friend who is older and had more work experiences, and immediately told me that I am being exploited, and that one year for an internship is way too long.  

However in the contract they did mention after 1 year if they're happy with my performance they would offer a 3 year contract as a full timer of the company.  

There is also no consequences of breaking the contract any time, except a clause to not work for the rival companies or other companies in the same industry.(Which when I asked for my mom's advice, she said it's just to scare people and that very rarely do they go to the extend of checking these things)  

I need some advice, am I really being exploited? Is it too early to tell? Should I back out of this as soon as possible to save time? Thanks in advance!  "

On the third day of the job, after a long phone call with a friend who is much older and more experienced in life than me, I've decided not to wait till the end of the week and instead tell them I'll be ending the internship on that day.  
I didn't know how to start the conversation with the HR/finance lady of the company, but she and the boss of the company came to me before lunch time wanting to brief me for a big project they wanted me to help in.  
So I panicked and told them right away that I want to quit, which they didn't receive very well, and kept pressing me on the reasons and on one point questioned me whether did I talk to the full timer who had quit yesterday.(I didn't want to get her in trouble, so I pretended not to recognize her name)  
I didn't want the resignation to get ugly, so I made up a family emergency, which I have to travel overseas for an indefinite amount of time to visit a close family member who is in dire conditions.  
I thought this wouldn't be so hard because after all I'm just an intern, it's very easy to replace me, and I don't have any big project on my hand.  
However the boss of the company said, ""Show me your plane ticket and I will let you go.""  
In the end, as embarrassing as it sounds, I had to ask my mother to come down to the company to negotiate on my behalf with them.  
During the discussion with my mother, they offered me a new contract, which has really desirable salary for someone who is a fresh grad with no experience.  
But I realised it was kinda suspicious for them to do that, and for them to tell my mother that they wanted to keep me because they thought my work was good, when none of them had actually properly sat down and checked the work I've done thoroughly.  
Which I am guessing was mainly because they needed to fill in for the local to foreigner employee quota, before the government realises that this company is breaking the law.  
The discussion I had with them lasted for a good 30 minutes to 1 hour, with me speaking nicely telling them I cannot continue this internship because of several reasons(The whole, it's not you it's me).  
But all my mother had to say was a simple ""No"" and ""For personal reasons."" and they let me go.  
During the discussion the HR/finance lady had mentioned that before I came in, quite a number of interns did the same thing, applied for internship, got in, came for a few days, and quit soon after.  
And that they didn't understand why this was happening, something I'm actually surprised because I thought they are aware of their business model and how shady it was.  
So in the end I manage to get out safely with no consequences.  
I felt terrible for the foreign workers in the company because they are fully dependent on this company for a working pass, and cannot simply leave it like locals do.  
During lunch after I called for my mother to come down to the company, another worker was sitting by the side step, I guess he had heard from the other people in the company about the situation, and told me that I could walk out of it very easily and shouldn't care about how much they're stopping me because it doesn't matter since I am a local.  
I asked him does he like working for this company, to which he gave me a sad smile, and walked away.  
I'm keeping this post here for those fellow fresh grads who are also on an eager job hunt, and might face similar situations.  
I've definitely learnt a lot about the world from these 3 days, so I guess my 3 days in the company wasn't in vain.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
UPDATE 1:   
Second day of work and as it turns out there is something very wrong with the management of the company.  
A full timer I met yesterday asked me to have a walk with her in the middle of the day to warn me about this company, and told me she is going to resign later today.  
She told me about the company delaying her pay and sometimes even not pay freelancers at all.  
While we were out having lunch during break time, the boss of the company called her and questioned if I'm with her.  
Which the full timer later told me the boss doesn't approve of workers having lunch together in fear of his workers bad mouthing him behind his back.  
One additional thing is I've realised that the company is breaking several laws, one of which is to have less numbers of locals in the company than foreigners.  
I've decided to resign after this week after I'm done with whatever project they've given me and forfeit my payment so I could get out of this easier.  
I think long hours of work and minimum pay would not be an issue if I can really learn something, but a company that breaks the law might get me into trouble too so I guess it's best I just let this job go.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

I'm a recent fresh grad with a diploma in a media related course, those familiar with media would know it's very difficult to land a job in the industry when you're new.  

After the last semester I feel awfully guilty about staying at home everyday and not doing anything with my life, so I applied for multiple jobs and internships.  

Very few got back to me, almost none called me up for an interview. 

Until my current company, which straight after the day I applied, they gave me a call and ask me to go down for an interview the day after.  

I was delighted, but didn't realise these all might be too good to be true.  

During the interview they asked very basic simple questions, and didn't even ask to see my portfolio, and they asked me to start on the day itself.(Which I couldn't, so I told them I could start next week)  

After the interview they told me the internship contract would be for a year, which should have raised a red flag for me, but I was dazed and excited with the idea of doing something productive and related to my field of studies, so I ignored it.  

The red flag was raised today on my first day at work.  

I messaged the HR lady the day before and found out that the office hour is 9.30AM to 6PM.  

I reached at 9.15AM, sat down because most of the people have not reached the office yet.  

The company is a small scaled, with about 10 to 20 workers at most.  

The person who is the boss of the company noticed me sitting there and asked who I was(he wasn't there during the interview), I introduced myself and he called me to his desk and started explaining the expectations and told me to be keen to learn.  

At this point I was still pretty convinced that this was a good idea, until the details for the contract were presented to me.  

The HR lady came and explained the contract, which states that the working hours is 10AM to 7PM, however the boss insist that I need to come to the office at 9AM.  

After that I was assigned a few videos to edit, I did one versions of editing, but it was immediately rejected by the boss when he saw it. Which I found acceptable and that was what I expected at the work place.  

Then at 7PM, after I've finished editing the boss came in to the editing studio and rejected it again.  

Then he asked whether do I want to go home first and come back tomorrow to continue the editing, which later my friend explained to me could be a trick question to see my enthusiasm.  

But I'm an intern, I don't get overtime pay, and these videos was supposed to be a 'test' to see my style of editing(which he barely watched till the end for both times), he gave me very little notes on what is to be expected of the final product.  

Then before I was on my way, he asked another worker to give his copy of the office key to me, and told me from now on I have to open the office up at 9AM everyday.  

A lady who was sitting nearby overheard and told me to not worry about it because she will be here too, which I found extremely comforting but also made me realise that it is quite a unreasonable request.  

After I got home I had a chat about my day with a friend who is older and had more work experiences, and immediately told me that I am being exploited, and that one year for an internship is way too long.  

However in the contract they did mention after 1 year if they're happy with my performance they would offer a 3 year contract as a full timer of the company.  

There is also no consequences of breaking the contract any time, except a clause to not work for the rival companies or other companies in the same industry.(Which when I asked for my mom's advice, she said it's just to scare people and that very rarely do they go to the extend of checking these things)  

I need some advice, am I really being exploited? Is it too early to tell? Should I back out of this as soon as possible to save time? What are your experiences in internship and how did they go? Thanks in advance!  "
32gkno,3,2015-04-13,I've received two internship offers - one as a Tech Analyst and one as a Quant. Can someone please advise me on what my plan should be?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/32gkno/ive_received_two_internship_offers_one_as_a_tech/,"To preface, I'm a third year undergraduate student studying Physics with Theoretical Physics. It is the penultimate year of my degree and so I am hoping that my internship this summer will set me on course for a graduate position.

My first offer is from a huge US bank as a Tech Analyst. I would be working on enhancing the function of some pre-existing projects and if I am lucky I will be given my own project to allow me to work in accordance with traders and quants to devise strategies and write to code to implement said strategies.

**Pros**

* Very good salary
* If I don't enjoy it I will still have a good position on my CV to allow me to go for another tech application when graduating.

**Cons**

* I won't be able to have much of an effect within the company as it is so large.
* Big chance that I won't get a personal project.
* Highly likely that most of my job will be fixing bugs in code and other boring tasks.

My second offer is from a French bank as an FX Quant. As a physicist I am quite drawn towards this one as I will directly be using a lot of the maths/programming skills that I have picked up as a part of my degree. However, I am worried about what my prospects after graduation would be if I took this position.

**Pros**

* My skills are much more relevant for this job than the other one.
* I would definitely be working on my own side project alongside helping to develop new models with the team.
* It would lend itself well to a potential career as a quant in the future.

**Cons**

* Much lower salary than the other job. Less than half the salary of the other and also a longer internship.
* Even if I complete this internship, most full-time quants have completed PhDs whereas I will only have a Masters degree.
*Does not lend itself well to jobs in other fields.

Sorry for the wall of text. I would love some help in solving this problem because it is quite a tough choice. To make things a bit trickier. I got the offer from the US bank in November and accepted it which means that I would have to go back on my contract and then accept the French bank.
I can also reveal the names but I'd rather do that over PM. Thanks in advance!"
32gnej,1,2015-04-13,Third year civil student looking for some internship advice.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/32gnej/third_year_civil_student_looking_for_some/,"In brief... its April and I still haven't landed an internship, so naturally I am getting desperate and am coming to you for advice! I don't want to sound whiny and I understand landing that first internship is a difficult process for everyone but I will provide you with what I have done so far.

I joined the co-op program when I first started my degree here at Carleton University in Ottawa, as I planned from the beginning on getting some internship experience. Since finishing my first year I have applied everywhere and anywhere. I have sent emails, made cold calls and even done a few informational interviews with places in Ottawa and in my hometown. 

This year was the first time I had someone bite and it was exciting. I had 3 interviews for summer positions, two with the government and one with a large private firm. Unfortunately, I got beat out on each one and still am without a co-op. I realize it is really late in the game, but I refuse to give up and want to fix this as I am eager to get a start in the industry. I also understand finding that first job after school is much harder without an internship. I have applied out west, in BC and Alberta and this year probably about 40 positions around Ontario. 

I have had the co-op office and my Uncle who works in HR look over my resumes and cover letters, so it seems my lack of experience has been my biggest setback. So far I have worked as a carpenter's helper in my summer breaks but none of my interviewers found this very impressive despite the fact that it is at least a bit of experience in construction. 

That being said, if any of you know somewhere that is hiring or that might be willing to create a position for me please let me know! My main interest is structural but I am interested in just about anything construction wise. Am I screwed if I don't get an internship, is there hope? "

They want interns to be returning to school, so I honestly don't mind doing that by taking some extra credits for a semester at school after the internship.

Has anyone had any experience with this? Because I'm thinking of only going back to school if they give me a full time returning offer, otherwise I won't return.

32gok9,2,2015-04-13,I rewrote an existing tutorial for crosscompiling Qt4 applications to the Beaglebone Black (crosspost from /r/BeagleBone),poehalcho,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/32gok9/i_rewrote_an_existing_tutorial_for_crosscompiling/,"During my internship I was using Qt4 to write an application for the Beaglebone Black. 

It doesn't seem to be the most common thing to do, so I had a lot of trouble getting it done. Most tutorials either still used Angstrom, straight-up didn't work or were far far too vague. After about 3 weeks of hassle I finally managed to get it to work thanks to a tutorial by Marcel von Kannen. 

When it was over I decided to write an updated version of his tutorial, with solutions to all the specific problems I ran into and more detailed instructions so hopefully even the biggest noobs can get it done, I don't want to see anybody suffering through the same thing... 

Frankly I'm a bit late with this, I was supposed to get this out there about 3 months ago. The updated version would even appear on his blog. But I ended up forgetting about it, due to school. 

In the PDF I refer to his blog a few times, but when I checked just now, it turns out the specific site is offline now. He still has a personal website at http://www.its-von-kannen.de/

With that said, here's the download link to my updated tutorial.

I hope it helps whomever needs this. May it reach the top google search results.

Since his blog is offline now, I guess questions go here. I can't really promise to answer everything since I don't really know all that much in the first place, but I'll try to do what I can. I hope other redditors will help as well.

32hpw2,76,2015-04-13,What is expected from new grads?,sockduffman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32hpw2/what_is_expected_from_new_grads/,"I will be graduating this June, but I don't have any outside of school CS/coding experience. I'm not an incompetent coder, but I wanted to take advantage of my summer and winter breaks by  following my second passion to become a chess master, playing in as many tournaments as I could.

I keep hearing two seemingly contradictory opinions, one which motivates me and makes me feel optimistic, and the other which...doesn't.

1-) It's fine. Nobody expects new grads to come in and blow everyone away by their ultra competence. Just apply to entry-level jobs, study for interviews, and you'll be in good shape. (Me: ""Okay if I keep working hard in my classes and keep improving, everything will be okay."" )

2-) HOLY SHIT YOU NEED TO DO SOME SIDE PROJECTS/CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS! HOW DID YOU NOT GET AN INTERNSHIP? NOW YOU ARE DOOMED TO ONLY QUALIFY FOR THE LOWEST PAYING, CRUDDEST OF CRUDS. (Me: ""Fuck, man. I've wasted my whole college life! What the hell am I going to do?"")

I mean, I know that the more experience you have the more desirable you are to potential employers. If I had spent those thousands of hours of studying/playing chess on working on side projects or doing internships I would have a better resume. I don't regret attempting to have a life outside school for the first time in my life.

I took all these courses in college, but none of them felt very applicable in the real world. The courses I took such as Operating Systems, Networks, Compilers, and Parallel Programming were rewarding, but they felt like they were just scratching the surface of giant topics. So now while I can ""code"", if someone comes and asks me ""What the hell do you want to work on? What do you know? What is your dream job?"" I can only shrug and say ""I want to start doing *something* so I can figure out what I like doing.""

That doesn't mean that if I get a job I won't go and learn my stuff inside out and try to produce as much value as I can.

I don't know if anyone else is in the same boat as I am. Maybe people in my campus seem to prefer not to talk about stuff like this, or maybe it's not that common."

GPA is above a 3.5, I have had 2 internships, both of which were good but didn't give me much experience in GIS. I wanted to minor in comp sci but couldn't, and unfortunately will not be able to. 

I've been working with arcGIS for about a year but mostly I've made really basic maps of income data of census tracts. 

Programming knowledge:
matLAB
Python - basic python. I've created models in Python of the Earth - don't know if that counts for anything?

Basically, I have a really basic understanding of arcGIS but I've never used Python and GIS together. I've made maps from census data, but nothing too complex. 

Other: I have no student loan debt (and I am so, so grateful). My parents occasionally help me out with rent and could help me pay for a graduate program so long as it is meaningful and not a waste of money/time.

My name is Eli, I was a second semester medical student at the university of Toronto. You see, my dad was a fire-fighter, and I always respected and admired that, ever since I was really young. The idea of running head-first into danger in order to save other people was absolutely incredible to me, and so I wanted to follow in his footsteps. I know what you're thinking ""Every boy wants to be a fire-fighter when he's little, I'm sure you grew out of it"" but I didn't. Even well into high school, it was an obsession of mine. I was determined to do it one day, and to work with my dad. I studied all the time, reading up on different emergency medical procedures, and what to do in case of a fire. I even did something like a summer internship at a fire station, a program that allowed teenagers to help around the station, and even go to fires every now and then. I loved every bit of it. I knew I wanted to help people, and this was how I was going to do it. My parents had always encouraged me to follow my heart, although they weren't too keen on me running into burning buildings, they supported my choices no matter what. My life was great, I had a group of close friends at school, I was sure I was going to get my dream job, and my parents were wonderful. It was perfect, but not forever. 

One weekend in my senior year, I was coming home from my friend Matt's house. I had spent the night since a new game had come out, and he wanted me to stay over and play it with him, since it was a horror game, and he had an ""active"" imagination and he got scared pretty easily. When I got home, I yelled for my mom to let her know that I'd gotten home safe. I walked upstairs to my room, since I'd been watching a movie when Matt had texted me the evening before, and I didn't get a chance to finish it. Before I actually started the movie, my mom walked in the room. Tears were streaming down her face, and my mind kicked into panic mode, wondering what was wrong. My mom sat down on the bed next to me, and gave me a hug, her hot tears dampening my t-shirt. I choked out the words ""What's wrong mom? Why are you crying?"" As tears began to well up in my own eyes. I was old enough to understand that I probably already knew why she was crying, but I didn't want to believe it. 

""Your father... He..."" 

Her sobs had started to get more powerful once she started speaking, and she couldn't finish. She didn't have to. I knew what was wrong. I'd been trying to mentally prepare myself for this situation for years, since I knew that the chances of it happening were fairly high, but you're never actually prepared for the death of a parent, especially at that age. I had to get out of my house for a while at that point, so I left the house and just walked well into the night, just thinking. When someone close to you dies, the idea of never seeing them again is the hardest part. The best way to describe the feeling is surreal. My mind tried rejecting the thought that my dad was dead, instead replacing it with ideas of conversations that we would have in the future, and things I wanted to tell him. For a little while, it felt like I would get to see him again, but I knew that as soon as I went home, realty would come crushing back down on top of me. For a split second, I pondered running away, in an attempt to rebel against the world and to indulge my imagination. I quickly discarded this idea however, as I knew I couldn't do that to my mom. I headed home, and without a word to my mom, went to my room.

I stayed there for almost a week, only coming out late at night to get a drink of water from the kitchen sink. I didn't really eat anything, only the occasional meal that my mom would leave just outside my door. Usually a sandwich, or something of the sort, and I typically would leave it there until she went to sleep. I mostly spent my time just laying in bed, looking at the ceiling. I tried to keep myself in the delusion that my father was still alive by only leaving my room at times I wouldn't have seen him before he died. I lost almost 25 pounds that week, since I was hardly eating at all.

After I finally accepted that the world had bested me, and I felt like leaving my room, I had a hard time with almost every activity I enjoyed previously. Since my muscles had been used so little, they were stiff and sore all the time, and I found it difficult to move without feeling intense pain course throughout my body. I was forced to accept defeat, because I had to face the truth of the matter. I was going to go to my father's funeral, and there wouldn't be any way I could deny the world its victory there. I realized that I had never found out exactly how he'd died until that point. Him and most of his squad had been trapped inside a building downtown when it blew up, killing them all instantly. I would later find out that the police discovered signs of arson in the area.

It was a short service, since the time was split between all of the men trapped inside. My mom and the wife of another one of the men from my dad's squad paid their respects, and we left. The last of the three men had no family.

When we got home, my mom finally broke down at the doorstep. She held me, looked me in the eyes and said that she was sorry, and I couldn't understand what else she was trying to tell me, so I helped her over to the couch, and sat with her for almost an hour. When she started to calm down, she tried telling me again. 

""I'm sorry, but I can't lose you too. I can't do it.""

I realized what she was saying, and my heart dropped. She was asking me not to become a fire-fighter, and I couldn't say no. Despite the fact that it was my dream, I couldn't do that to her. I knew that it would be selfish. But, I knew there were other ways of helping people. I'd always been good with my hands, I could be a doctor, or even a surgeon. I couldn't be a fire-fighter though. I decided that, for my mother's sake, I would have to find something else.

About a month and a half after that, I went back to school, and got a part time job at a grocery store in order to support my mom. Between my depression, and my job, I cut off contact with my friends. I felt horrible about not explaining anything to them, but I just didn't know what to do, and so I decided not to do anything. My mother and I spoke less and less as well, and I think it was because of two reasons. I think that she felt like she had turned me against her by asking me to not follow my childhood dream, and I now realize that, maybe she had. 

Thankfully, once I actually got into college my depression began to fade, whereas my excitement to help people was reinvigorated. I had decided that I was going to be a surgeon. It became clear to me that my drive to help people had never truly faded, and that it was merely suppressed. After the first year, things were doing great, and I was still driven towards my goals. Since I had always done well in high school, I had managed to make in into a fairly nice college, and I didn't have to worry about tuition. I wasn't going to let the world take this one from me. This time I had won.

That summer, I didn't really do much. I didn't go home, I just hung around and watched movies, and studied for the next semester. I didn't make many friends around campus, since I'd become fairly introverted. I began to slip back into my depression, and that's when I began wondering why I wanted to help people in the first place. I made no attempt to be friends with anyone, and I mostly shut myself off from the world, so why was I driving myself so hard to help the people around me? I quickly pushed these thoughts out of my head, and just thought that, maybe I'd be become interested in the matter once again after I began working, the same way it had happened when I started college. 

As the second semester rolled around, something strange started happening. I started to get homesick. Really homesick. It was like a physical ailment, and I could hardly go to my classes. I had realized that, all summer long I wasted time rather than going back to see my mother. I was having a hard time focusing anyway, and so I decided to leave for about a week to see my mom.

I called her, but she didn't pick up, so I decided to just drive there and surprise her. When I got home, I knocked on the door, and a woman answered it. 

""Mom! It's so good to see you!""

I spoke too soon. The dark lighting made it hard to see who was inside, and I thought that it was my mom for a moment. A short African American woman standing in the doorway said ""Do I know you?"" I could tell by her face that she was surprised, and I'm sure that she could tell the same from mine.

""No, I'm sorry. I must have the wrong address."" 

She agreed with me, and she turned around and walked back inside, closing the door. 

My head was spinning, filled with thoughts and questions. Had mom moved without telling me? Why would she do that? Did she think I'd hated her? Why would she think that? But, I made a guilty realization. Thinking back, I couldn't remember a single time that I'd called her since I left for college. I just, dropped out of existence after telling her goodbye. She might think I was dead. Again, my feeling of homesickness washed over me, and I realized that the only person I felt like turning to felt like I had abandoned them. I decided that it was probably best to head back to school, and just try to forget, rather than reopen old wounds between me and my mother.

I found myself able to focus on studies a bit more once I got back, so I decided to focus on the good rather than the bad. I started to get poor grades in my main classes, but I opted to ignore it rather than attempt to improve. I felt like things were falling apart, but I just wanted to stay optimistic about my life. 

I finished the year with mostly C's and D's, but I failed any of the classes I didn't care about. I began to slip back into my depression that summer. I stayed inside, watching videos on my laptop every now and then, but mostly just laying around doing nothing of any value. One day, while I was browsing the internet aimlessly, I clicked on my email. To my surprise, and genuine amazement, I'd received a message from Matt, my best friend from high school. He told me that in a couple weeks him, Tom, and James, three of my closest friends, were going camping. I decided that, I probably wouldn't go. I still felt horrible about abandoning them in high school, and I felt more comfortable sitting here at home, without worrying about how I conducted myself around people. I was always afraid of the connections I made with people, since I felt like each time I would hit another rough patch, I would probably just hurt them. I decided that I'd be perfectly happy staying here in my dorm, letting myself waste away while waiting to continue my work towards my dream of helping people. 

A week later, I was beginning to warm up to the idea of going camping. It was something me and my friends had always loved doing when we were little, and in his email, Matt had described a patch of forest that a friend from college told him about, where we'd be surrounded by Giant Sequoias. It sounded beautiful. While I still wasn't sure if I was going to go, the idea got stuck in my head. 

Three days after that, I decided. My heart was pounding as I got out my laptop, and sent Matt a reply. I told him that I wanted to go, and I asked him what I needed to bring. Two hours later, he emailed me back. He said that I'd need a sleeping bag, and maybe a flashlight if I wanted one. They'd bring food and drinks. I immediately responded, asking how long they were expecting to be gone. Another hour passed, and he said they thought maybe three days or so, but they were bringing enough food for about a week and a half, just in case they decided to stay longer. He told me that they'd pick me up that weekend, since my college was on the way. At that point, I realized that I really wanted to go. For the first time in almost 3 years, I had something to genuinely be happy about. I was finally going to make up for abandoning my best friends, and I was actually excited about it. I couldn't wait for the weekend.

Sorry to cut this off here, but I don't have time to write more now. Despite my current situation, I still have some stuff to do. Don't worry though, I'll finish this up and post the rest of my story later, since I haven't had time to tell you the strange parts of my life.

I'm in a bit of a weird situation. I was informed today that I passed the interviews for ""Company A"" and was going to get an internship offer sometime later this week. I asked how long the turn-around time was for me to make a decision, and the HR lady said was only 24 hours. I had previously heard that they pay software interns a fair amount below what I have made in my last 3 internships, so I was already planning on negotiating salary. 

I have another confirmed offer from ""Company B"", but that won't come in by time I get the one from ""Company A"". Also, ""Company B"" will probably pay significantly higher than ""Company A"". Aside from that, I have my university career fair tomorrow. There are several interesting companies there too!

Still, I really, really like the work opportunity at ""Company A"". I'll get to work on cool projects, and have a short commute. The problem is I have no idea how they'll compare to other internship offers I get. How do I successfully navigate this situation? Do I have less leeway for negotiations since it is so late already (with regards to summer internships)?

I also recently took and passed my A+ and Network+. I am currently looking for a job in entry level IT. I currently am only getting offers for internships and due to my financial situation, I cannot not afford to take the 8k/year paycut. 

I'm thinking about going for another certification but am unsure about what to get. I have a free voucher for Security+ and am contemplating getting my MCSA for server 2012. However I have also taken my CISCO courses and am also prepping for my CCENT and CCNA. However, I am worried that I will take the test and pass and still be stuck in an entry level position.

I started as an intern almost two years ago and things have rapidly changed since then. Now, my former boss who was one of the greatest supervisors I've ever had the opportunity of working for, is at another company as he found another opportunity after his position of director of managed services was eliminated. He worked with a guy he's known for years, and they're both great to work with. Now, me, someone hired about 6 months ago, and my co worker who has been at the company for almost 8 years work for someone who has no faith in his IT staff and doesn't communicate at all, basically trying to set us up to fail.

Today, my co worker, the last one from when I started, let me know that he was putting in his two weeks and found another job. I really can't blame him for moving on, they way our new supervisor wanted it was he was doing miscellaneous stuff while I'm trying to defend while I still get paid on a daily basis with no communication back. It hit hard because the two main people I worked for and with for the past few years are now gone and leaving respectively. It's left me in kind of a weird spot from my perspective. I graduate community college with an associates in cyber security and network administration and am testing for my A+ later this month. I don't have many options and I feel stuck, even though it is the beginning of my career. I know a good bit of Linux and Windows administration, I set up a network at a new office space by myself since nobody else really knows Cisco, I do a lot with different CMS and frameworks for web developers, so it's not like I'm lacking skill, it's just proving it.

I feel burnt out just from these past few months, I used to love going to work even though it's a 4 hour round trip, but now I hate it and I can't get anything closer because there's little to no tech companies around me. Am I killing my career staying in this job and slowly getting more and more jaded as the days go by? Thanks in advance for any advice and sorry for the long post and any errors, typing with a squint and two thumbs.

TL;DR: am I killing my career by staying in a job I hate with a small company?"

[update],AtheistKharm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32jpf2/am_i_too_old_for_internships_update/,"Couple of years ago I made a [post]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19yr8v/am_i_too_old_for_internships/) asking if I was too old for an internship and asking for general advice. I found that old post in the FAQ, which kind of surprised me it was worth putting in there. I thought it would be worth doing an update. I’m going to use this old reddit account to post this, as a sort of verification, even though I don’t use it anymore (don’t really like the name).

I got an internship! I start the end of this semester. I’m so fucking excited! I’m finally escaping all the bullshit jobs that lead to nowhere. I’ve worked so many crappy jobs from doing trades work, retail, and eventually computer repair. God damn internship nearly pays more money than the best paying job I’ve ever had. I actually got two internship offers, which is a real confidence booster btw.

You might be thinking, “What took so long?” Well, I was working fulltime at the time I made that last post, and eventually got laid off. With the help of a very supportive wife, I have been going to school fulltime ever since. To be honest, I should have had an internship last summer. I should have at least tried to get one, but instead I opted to take summer classes, which further got in the way of getting some meaningful side projects done. I was afraid to fail. I was afraid of rejection. Please don’t do that to yourself. Expect failure and get some experience in interviewing.

I cannot say the University path is for everyone. I dropped out of high school in 10th grade. It’s been a personal goal for me to prove to myself that I can do it. 

Like Tom said the movie Office Space: “Just remember... If you hang in there long enough, good things can happen in this world.”

32kirn,0,2015-04-14,How I went from almost no experience to a Big 5 internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32kirn/how_i_went_from_almost_no_experience_to_a_big_5/,"I recently accepted my dream internship, and I figured my experience might be useful to some of you coming up in the field. Below are a couple tangible pieces of advice that you can use to better your chances in the CS job market. 


**Commit to Tasks You Are Not Sure You Can Complete**

This might sound a little counter-intuitive, but hear me out. Last summer, a couple of my buddies were looking to start a business to gain some experience, and they needed an iOS application. I had never made an iOS application, but I committed to doing it because I wanted to learn. I struggled the whole way through it, but by the end of the summer I had published my first iOS application, and gained a new valuable skill. By committing to making the app, I could not give up when I started to struggle, and was forced to find solutions to my problems. 

**Learn Design**

Look around you right now. Unless you're reading this post in the middle of the desert, chances are everything you see was designed. By understanding design, you understand why certain choices were made in the creation of an object. You are able to look at products critically and figure out how to make them better. 

In the Computer Science field, being a good designer makes you doubly valuable. Design gives you the skills to put your ideas down on paper, communicate them to others, and ultimately execute them. In today's world of ubiquitous computing, it is more critical than ever that software products are designed well, otherwise consumers will stay away. At the very least, you'll be able to make your resume look snazzy. 

**Reach Out**

Your network can be just as valuable as your skills in landing you a job. These days, it is easier than ever to reach out to industry professionals. Find someone who has the career you want and figure out how to connect with them. You would be surprised how nice and helpful people will be when you are passionate and excited about what they do. It's a low-risk high-reward move. 

**Be Confident, Smile**

I know, it's easier said than done. Often, it seems as though everyone around you knows more than you do - and they might. But that's okay. Be honest about what you do and do not know, and ask questions when you are confused. Stay open to new ideas, and voice your own. 

I cannot stress enough the importance of being a good communicator, and we all know how much of communication is non-verbal. By smiling, you make yourself much more approachable, and put whoever you are communicating at ease. You should your enthusiasm and comfort. The smile is a powerful tool - use it.  


Hope this was helpful!"

First of all, im an incoming freshman from mexico. I'm accepted to 2 colleges: Oklahoma state, and SUNY at buffalo.

My problem is money. OSU gave me enough scholarship that i can attend without any further help, but i can go to UB as of right now, as i am short some ~$10k. Loans arent exactly an option, since they work differently than in the US.

Thing is, i have the option of a scholarship/loan that will pay for the rest of the cost of UB for me, but i have to come back and work for the government here in Mexico for at least 5 years. 

My goal in college was to find a job in the US and stay there for my adult life (or europe, but i dont want to ccome back to mexico).

The dilemma is that i dont really feel like i would be at home at OSU, and i MUCH prefer UB, but if i go to OSU, i can stay there later and find a good internship and job after college. If i go to UB it will be much harder to try and move back to the US later.

Im not sure what option is best, i've heard that it's hard for an internationa student (engineering) to get a job out of college, even if working hard. Is it worth going to the college i like more, even if it means having to give up on what has been a ""dream"" of sorts for my entire life?"

I got a phone interview coming up for a Python developer position at a company that I really, really like in an industry I'd love to be a part of. It's working on back end web services and servers for high-load applications, using stuff like Twisted, Django, and Memcached. 

I'm one year out of college, working on my masters part time, and I've been a java software engineer for a year now at my current company, working on similar types of applications (high-load, back end web servers and services). I actually use python a fair amount at my current job (made/extended on a django server, write a lot of scripts and templating in python), we also use memecached, and I've worked on developing a proprietary event-driven architecture similar to Twisted, and I used python a couple years back in a systems engineering internship, as well as here and there in personal projects/scripts.

I personally really like the language of python and have no ties to any single language as a software engineer, so I'm pumped for this opportunity. I'd like to know if anyone has questions that I should PRIMARILY look out for related to the language of python. I've been crunching on review lately, so any/all help or references are useful.

Also, they're also a python 3.x shop, and I've done a lot of 2.x work in the past, so what should I look out for/anticipate primarily in the structural differences between the two?

I never did an internship and my GPA was relatively low (&amp;lt;3.0) so when it came to find a job after graduation, I accepted essentially my first offer as a .NET developer. At the time I was pretty low on myself and didn't feel like I had the ability to negotiate my salary or anything like that, so I took their initial offer of $42,000 (in a low-ish cost of living area in the south). 


My issue is that I have an enormous amount of debt, about $90,000 total (mostly student loans and some credit card debt) that I am having a terrible time paying off with my currently salary. I know the best way from here to increase my salary is to look for another job but here are my questions with that:


1. I started at the end of July last year. Wouldn't it look bad and make it more difficult for me to get another job since I have relatively little experience? My original plan was to stay for at least 2 years, but it's looking more like I need to change sooner rather than later, so should I at least finish out my first full year?


2. I really like my current job and the people I work with. I learn quite a bit each day and generally feel challenged. I'm almost scared to look into getting anther job because I fear that other places won't have as good of an atmosphere/work environment. Is this something I should really be worried about or should my top priority be finding a higher salary ASAP?


3. Would it be best for me to look for another .NET developer job since that's the experience I have so far? I actually like it a lot, but I'm early enough in my career that I can change tracks, right?


4. Can I realistically expect to be able to make more with my education and current work experience? Ideally I would want to make roughly $55,000 (in a lower cost of living area) but I'm not sure if I'm quite at that level yet. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting something else that I've had questions about so if you have any other general advice, let me know!"

I feel like that's arguably the most important part of all this, the practical knowledge aspect of how to actually *do* all the little things that are undoubtedly asked of you in a professional environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am lucky enough to have an internship where I can learn pretty much anything I want right now, but I'm the only tech/code/webdev oriented person here. I have an opportunity to make a website for a pretty decently sized company, but I have no idea how to do much else than actually make the pages, and I don't have anyone to ask any of this. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure if I want to make a career out of web dev, as I gravitate toward programming and really enjoy that aspect of things (that and I am not particularly skilled in design aspects- I am definitely not an artist!), but while I have the opportunity, I figure I might as well seize the chance to learn new stuff! 

&amp;nbsp;

So, here's my question, I guess: Where and how did you learn this type of information? If one were to try to learn this outside of a professional environment, how could they go about finding the resources to do so? 

I would be incredibly appreciative if you could point me to the resources to learn this kind of thing, whatever and wherever they may be! "

Originally, I wanted to be a teacher, but I couldn’t major in Education because that would require taking time off of work to intern with a public school, something I could not do.

Coming from a small public school it was pretty hard getting an interview at companies like Deloitte that hire entry level Business Analysts. 


With my credentials I easily got interviews in QA and Software Implementation.

I had just started programming when I started college so I only have about a year and a half of experience so far. I hated the job that I was currently working and decided to quit to search for a software development internship. I live in Detroit, which is large city but as most people know is just now starting to recover and the businesses have to cope with the loss of jobs and skilled workforce just as the residents here do. Anyway, I won't name the company, but a Detroit based company that is relatively large will be interviewing me today for an internship that I don't think is paying enough. I'm finding reports on Glassdoor in the $11-$13/hr range, when I normally see $20-$40/hr depending on the location. Do you think I should take this job, provided the interview goes well, and is it ok to take the lower pay given the location and that I won't be graduating for at least 2 more years? Or is this just way too low even for an internship?"

After high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I went to school and tried various things only to give up after a year. At 21 I decided to get into auto mechanics so I went to the local community college and studied auto repair there and came one class short of getting a degree in that, which was an internship class. After having trouble finding an internship for a while, I finally found one, but didn't apply this to the degree. After a while of working as a mechanic, some serious medical issues and an overall huge dislike for the job, I left and decided to try studying IT since computers were the only other thing I really have knowledge of. Things went relatively ok minus a few bumps in the road as I took care of all my core curriculum courses. Then I recently hit the ""meat"" and was blindsided by how much more difficult it was and everything just fell apart for me. My biggest struggle has been with the programming course, but I figured I would tough this and the other one out and finally get to the stuff I was more looking forward to, which I'm not even sure anymore that IT is even something that I want to do. Last night laying in bed, I decided to look more into the degree program and saw that I was no where near done with all the programming classes that were required and I've been too stressed to sleep since. I'm not good at programming and I loathe it, frankly I think I'm just not that smart. I have absolutely no idea where to go from here. I am beyond sick of the anxiety and stress that school brings me, I'm tired of homework, I'm tired of studying for tests. I just want to go out and work and make a comfortable living and never have to study for a test again. I have no experience in anything, other than those 2 years working as a mechanic, I have not held a job at all. Just fumbling my classes has been a huge stress in my life, I can't imagine how much of a wreck I would be if I had to juggle a job on top of that. Just for a little background info, I have multiple sclerosis so being under high stress is really not good for me and these last few weeks I have been in pain. On the plus side, my family is pretty well off, so supporting my bad decisions has not been an issue, but I am ridden with guilt about how much of their money I have effectively pissed away with nothing to show for it. I don't know what to do or what options I have as far as an easier degree or what possible jobs are open to me that would allow me to finally move out and get on with my life.

I know my grammar and formatting is a mess.

I am currently in my third year of uni. 


I have a pretty good CS GPA as is, though it should be around 3.5 come time to apply to jobs. Experiences are good; After this summer I will have interned at three different companies, all of which have said they'll give me positive recommendations. I have a few significant projects under my belt, although NDAs have prevented me from being able to discuss them in-depth. I've got a couple of ""meh"" personal projects.  I've also performed research for the past two years under the same professor where I've helped developed a fairly large codebase (unfortunately can't discuss that in-depth either). 

After speaking to advisors, I've realized that I can feasibly attain both math and econ BAs. Ideally, with these degrees, I'd like to land a job at a financial banking institution as a software dev or something along those lines. I've discussed this with professors, and got some positive feedback. I've also discussed this with a group of my CS friends, and they seem to be against the idea. 


My line of thinking is: 

1+ year at uni means = another internship, more personal projects, another year of research, another year of hackathons, and of course two more degrees. 

But that also means that I lose a year's worth of salary. However, the question ""is it even worth it?"" comes into play.  

**tl;dr should I spend another year at uni and earn math and econ BAs. If no, why? If yes, why?**

32mdjx,1088,2015-04-14,"The security filter, the manglement and the unfiltered intern",dtvhr,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/32mdjx/the_security_filter_the_manglement_and_the/,"Hi guys, first time poster, long time lurker, big time fan of Bytewave.


This is a story that was told to me by the guys at our Ops department where I work.


A few years ago, they worked at an online and phone based gambling company, which we'll call GamblingHQ. It was a good set up, similar to most modern gambling companies, you could set up an online account and bet that way or call into the company call center and get your bet over the phone.


One of the staff in the call center was a fresh from secondary school (high school for you guys in the U.S) kid who we'll call Shane. Now Shane was a quiet guy, he worked in the call center and was in a 2 month long internship. (GamblingHQ had an internship set up where if you weren't up to scratch after 2 months on the job, they could let you go)


 Apparently he kept to himself but was great with customers over the phone, had decent statistics for times on calls and could figure out most basic technical errors with customers over the phone.


However, it seems that he had a hidden talent for coding, and by hidden talent, I mean he was a coding wizard, he could probably write code to make lightning shoot out of a screen if you showed him how. 


*The guy had been teaching himself how to code since he was 9, he was fluent in Assembly, Basic, C+, Haskell, HTML, Python, Java and Java Script. *

*How did this talent come out?* Well the call center had a fairly open internet system with an internally calibrated filter that looked for specific keywords or images, you could browse most sites but if you hit a site that was considered out of bounds i.e an adult website with XXX in the title, it would be flagged with your manager. If you hit a site that was considered a security breach, IT and Security were notified. 

The only problem was that the filter wasn't always calibrated correctly, and completely innocent sites would sometimes send a hit to the managers/manglement. **Too many hits with the filter, explainable or not and you were fired.** 


There was basically a no tolerance policy for 'dirty' internet browsing. Indeed, a couple of brand new staff were let go after a week for accessing sites like youtube or dailymotion to watch football matches.


**However, if you use a site that opens up computer programming that wasnt recognised i.e manual entries, there was a filter in place that would not only shut down your computer remotely, but would send an immediate lockdown to the network, meaning only managers who had a password clearance could go online until this lock was lifted.** 

Certainly an overkill of a filter but the company had over 2 million customers and this call centre alone had over 300 employees so they could be forgiven for being cautious.


This also sends a silent email alarm to HR, Security, IT and most management so its documented.

Cue the manhunt as poor Shane is pounced on by his managers and two members of IT security. He is brought to a room and promptly questioned thoroughly while they pull up his internet history and remove his computer to check for infected files or outside data from a usb stick.


Keep in mind, this guy is 18, and is mostly being asked about hardware as everyone thinks he had outside material, no one thought he was trying to learn coding. It wasnt until the IT staff pulled up his history that they saw what was going on.

Throughout his browsing was a ton of learning how to code webpages, mostly manual education that you can learn with notepad or an online system.

Soon the questioning turned from hardware to software and coding as IT security took over and asked about his knowledge of programming languages, they were duly impressed by his array of knowledge and soon found out what had happened.


Shane had begun to use a new site to learn a set of 'Lamb expressions' in Python (feel free to correct me on that term if I'm wrong) and it turned out that his site generated a set of programming that triggered the security filter into thinking that he was accessing programming on the computer itself, causing the lock down.


The questioning continues and Shane actually shows a lot of knowledge for someone of such young years, he actually pulled out a textbook on Python programming that he had bought. There is a good giggle from IT, which just makes the Managers angry as they can barely understand half of the terms being used i.e Syntax, iterations and standard deviation. 


When what happened came to light, and was explained in laymans terms to his managers, they promptly informed him that due to the massive security breach, they would be letting him go.


The IT staff tried to fight for him explaining that it was a false alarm but Manglement wouldnt budge an inch.

&gt; MGT: No we're letting him go, we have a zero tolerance policy on this, especially with a security breach of this magnitude.



&gt; IT: But it wasnt a breach, hell we'll put it in writing that it was an error on our side.




&gt; MGT: Hes still going, its going to take ages to get that network out of lockdown (*It wouldnt, takes all of 3 minutes once IT are aware*)  


So Shane is let go, no severance, no reference, just told to pack his backpack up and to leave. He grabs his textbook, backpack and a couple of pens, says his goodbyes and heads for the lift.

He doesnt make it to the parking lot before he gets stopped by the head of IT, apparently what happened with the security breach got sent over to him and he brought Shane to his office for an impromptu interview.


In there, the formal part of the interview lasts all of 5 minutes before they both just start talking programming in the same way a Miami Heat fan would talk about the playoffs or a Manchester United fan would talk about Wayne Rooney: Passionately. They talk about programs they have both designed and dream projects


They talk for about an hour, and this is the head of IT for the entire call center that Shane is speaking to, a man more than 25 years his senior, and he is enthralled, all hes doing is asking Shane questions and throwing out scenarios and Shane is talking about Java and Assembly like he wrote the languages and cracking jokes about documentation in Python.


&gt; ITHEAD: Shane in all my time, I've never met someone so young who just 'gets' programming, you just seem to have a knack and a passion for it, listen I have an opening here in our department and I want to see if you're a good fit. Can you be here tomorrow around 10am to meet with the rest of the group?
&gt; Shane: I'm sure I can find the time.

In the end, Shane was hired as an IT intern but was soon promoted to work on the filter system in the call center. He soon had it set up correctly so it would only be triggered by adult material or unrecognized files....and he even managed to find out that one of the managers was embezzling from the company. *But thats a story for another day*


**TL:DR** Call center intern accidentally triggers network lockdown, turns out to be computer programming version of Gandalf the Grey, gets thrown into the depths of Moria by the Balrog known as Manglement, gets saved by the magic of IT, is reborn as IT intern the White.

Edit: Well this blew up, I'll try and get the follow up post on the embezzlement up in the next few days and post the link here. IT Intern the White will return.

Also......holy crap, I got gold for this? Thank you :)

TL:DR questions are below wall of text. 

I've just turned 25 a few days ago and I am really serious about taking my career to the next level. I sadly still live with my Mom because I live in a crappy small town with nothing to do but go to bars full of hicks and chance a DUI going home. My girlfriend is graduating in May and both of us would really love to get out of here and possibly live in Philly. 

I have a BS degree and I am the manager of a small computer shop. I hate it. The company loses money too easily and I don’t agree with a lot of the owner’s ideals. Furthermore I hate fixing things. What I once enjoyed now and then has turned into a massive source of stress. What’s worse is I know what I’m doing is stupidly easy and I’m hardly using even 10% of my brain power to do it. Any idiot can run a virus scan. Yet people here are so stupid we do it for them for a little under a hundred bucks. I wasted several years in retail and a call center full time as well while suffering through 6 years of college. I hated all of it. Now that my SO is graduating I feel it’s finally time to leave this rat’s nest and pursue something greater!

I want to eventually create mobile apps and videogames. However I am willing to take a more business related position for simply the experience and pay. I didn’t get to intern at all during college because work took up the rest of my free time so I have limited real world experience. In college I took as many programming classes as I could but the classes were mostly, stare at a power point and copy and paste type learning. During those years I did work with VBasic, Javascript, C#, HTML, PHP, and CSS. That’s pretty much the limit of the college I went to and regretfully it was due to family peer pressure and fear of getting scammed by going for a game design degree that may not be worth the paper it’s printed on. Regardless this is what I want to do. Regular IT is just too dull and I can’t stand much more of it. I understand it will be stressful and I may be tasked with a lot of work but if the pay is right and I can finally have a job that requires me to think, I’m willing to do it.  I want to create awesome applications and games someday, even if they are just steam indie games and mobile apps. I’m currently teaching myself C++ with the intention to create a simple side scroller game with my cousin in the summer as a fun project. I also downloaded UNITY and Unreal engine to learn more on the game development side of things. I intend to dabble with android development soon too. 

I apologize for the long wall of text but I just thought I should get that all out of the way so you understand my circumstances. 

TL:DR 
My Questions: 

1.	Is it possible to practice and get good enough to get an entry level job by this fall? 
2.	What type of questions will I be asked for a typical Phone/Skype interview? 
3.	I was told it’s not the language you know but how you think. I’m currently learning C++. Anything else you’d recommend for someone with my interests?  
4.	Does anyone know if programming jobs are abundant in Philadelphia, PA? 
5.	What can kind of pay and hours should I expect? Small Business and Corporate examples if you have any. 

That’s all I have for now. 


Thanks for any of your help and advice.

The only real options for me as a biochemistry major is to go to medical school or to go to academia. For various reasons, medicine is not an option. Biology academia is a bad place to be right now. There is a good (&gt;90%) chance I would spend 10 years getting a Biochemistry Ph.D. and doing a post-doc to get a position as an associate professor making perhaps 50k/yr. This is unacceptable.

I realized my mistake and started taking computer science classes in my fourth year. Luckily, I am reasonably intelligent. I go to a large and well known state university, have a good GPA (&gt; 3.90) and am good at taking standardized tests. If I work hard and heavily self-study on my own, I can graduate with a CS bachelors of science by the end of my fifth year. Unfortunately, I cannot get an internship this summer because I will have to take makeup classes. Based on the three CS classes I have taken, I can probably get between a 3.5-3.7 GPA in the CS major by the time I graduate.

It is my goal to make 100k-150k/yr in 7 or 8 years. My social skills are average, but I am highly motivated. E.g. I do not mind working 80 hours/week until I die of old age, having no significant other, etc. I am in my last year of college and I do not have any work experience or internships. Assume I can get between a 3.5-3.7 GPA in CS. What advice would you give me to achieve this target yearly salary? (Life advice also welcome, but probably not constructive)

Would it affect my career path if I let my GPA slip now?  It's my understanding that GPA isn't that important to tech companies.  Is this correct?"
32nltg,1,2015-04-15,The concept that BMEs can’t find jobs is utter garbage and complete bullshit,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/32nltg/the_concept_that_bmes_cant_find_jobs_is_utter/,"Sorry for the language but I am fucking pissed

Very fucking frequently I am “enlightened” by anonymous Reddit users that potential students should avoid obtaining a Biomedical Engineering degree since they cannot find jobs. Who are all you fucks that say this?

I graduated from a state university in 2012 with a Bachelor’s of Biomedical Engineering degree. I was not near the top 10% of my class. I have numerous professional connections in the business. The idea that BMEs cannot find jobs is bogus. I obtained an internship at a major biomed corporation as a junior. I started my first full-time job just two weeks after graduating and I was likely paid more than 80% of my graduating class. After leaving that job several months in, I obtained my second job less than two months later in a completely unrelated R&amp;D role (all of my positions so far have been in R&amp;D). I had HUGE responsibilities as a test engineering lead.

Every person I know from my graduating class has gone on to some of the best medical or graduate schools. Everyone else has obtained biomedical engineering jobs, whether it is at a startup, large corporation, or even software companies. Positions you can get hired for include manufacturing engineer, biomedical engineer, test engineer, software test engineer, reliability engineer, quality engineer, supply chain engineer, hardware engineer, verification engineer, sales engineer, validation engineer, and a ton more I’m forgetting. I’m not making this shit up – I or my friends have accounted for each of those positions above and we all have Bachelor’s of Biomedical Engineering. At my last company, I talked to a manager about biomedical engineering degrees, and I admit she said she didn’t know what to hire them as. I don’t think she knew she was talking to one right then!

I cannot reiterate that it is TOTAL BOGUS to say we cannot find jobs. I have met alumni from numerous companies that have spun their graduate school research into a startup. I know for a fact that one of the biggest biomedical companies ACTIVELY FUNDS the local biomedical program and then RECRUITS the students into internships and then full time positions. How the fuck do I know this? It’s EXACTLY what happened to me as explained to me by the department chair, who offered a recommendation for me. By the way, if you honestly can’t find an engineering gig, there are PLENTY of consulting firms that would be more than happy to hire you for your analytic skills.

STOP TELLING POTENTIAL STUDENTS NOT TO GET A BIOMEDICAL DEGREE. What the fuck is wrong with you people?  What the fuck do you know? This only discourages students with a passion in biology, engineering, and medicine to pursue a degree that they may excel in. If someone told me half the crap I heard online I certainly would never get a biomedical degree. The fact of the matter is most of the crap is untrue, and I highly recommend students to pursue the degree if they are passionate about medicine and technology. If you think biomedical engineering is right for you DO IT. You will be happy. You will find a job.

Im a very junior webdev looking for some hands on coding help and advice. Im not sure if this is the right forum if that case I apologize in advice. 

I completing and internship at the moment and figured I would try to pick up angular for the project I was given to learn as much as possible. Being a second year student with a pretty bare bones knowledge of javascript im kinda struggling with some basic concepts of javascript that I really wanna learn. 

One of them that I never had to deal with before while coding simple sites is event unbinding. I've never had to do it before because it's never been an issue. Now while coding in angular I realized that some of my event listeners stay active on all my partials since the site never reloads. 

I realize Jquery probly shouldn't be used in angular but since I used a bootstrap theme there was some jquery in there to start with. 

So here's my question: 

How I would register my events, listen to them and destroy them the angular way sort of speak.

I read somewhere you should use $scope.on but I don't really understand how it works? 

Here's a link to the question on stackoverflow with the relevant jquery im trying to use:

I'm currently a second year at a major state school and I just really feel defeated and lost on what to do right now. My entire childhood all I wanted to do was to get into a good school. Now here I am where I originally wanted to be feeling lost venting to reddit at 3am.

My first semester here I did awful. I failed two of my classes and felt shitty. I ended up getting a 1.XX GPA and placed on academic probation. I saw my flaws and put myself to work trying to pull myself out of the hole I threw myself in. I retook one of the classes I failed the previous semester and barely passed with a ""C"". 

By the end of my first semester of my second year I pulled myself up to around a 2.6 GPA, got out of AP, and changed my study course from Mechanical Engineering to Business Admin with emphasis in information systems (At my school this is basically CS with a splash of business).

Now here I am nearing the end of my 4th semester here and I've fallen in the hole I started in. Somewhere I started slacking and forgetting to turn in online assignments, failing exams, and am now just lacking motivation to do anything school related. I currently have an F in one class and it looks like I could possibly fail another on top of the other. I don't know what I want from myself. At my school you can only use course forgiveness on up to 3 classes and if I fail both these courses I won't have anything to save my GPA from further fuck ups as I need a 3.0 to get into my upper divisions

I had a great internship over the summer with an engineering company but my money I earned from working there is running low. The stress of paying my bills, and going to school is really taking a toll on me. If it weren't for the fact that I have already committed to living in a house with a few friends in the fall I would have moved back home to get back on my feet, work for a little while, and then go to a community college to boost my GPA.  I'm thankful that I come from a family that's been saving money my entire life for me to go to school so I don't have to worry about taking out loans and paying for books but I feel as if my failures are making that money go to waste. 

I've thought about going to a CC around here for fall but I'm afraid I'll bring myself to failure there as well for some reason. If I don't finish my degree I'm afraid I'll be looked at as a failure to my family  as they all see me as some genius who will do great things with my life, for whatever reason that may be. 

Sitting here thinking makes me wish I had gone to a local community college before a 4 year but being the typical 18 year old I was all I cared about was getting out of the house. 

I don't mean to scare anyone off from chasing their dreams but if you are a high school senior who's picking a 4 year university to be able to break free from your parents I would sit and carefully consider what you want. Although living on your own is a luxury it also comes with huge responsibility and burden. Make sure you're on top of your shit enough to not to do bad in school and be able to have financial support or you'll regret being where you are. 

PS: Has anyone here taken time off to go to a CC and gone back to their previous school? How was it and what was your story?"

HP is offering me a position at $20 an hour. They did mention I would be traveling a bit, possibly only being home about 3 days a month, but with a lot of overtime as a Field Technician. But I'm not sure how the company is. This was just offered pretty much at the same time (while I was away) a few days ago. Of course there would be a company car and expenses paid for while traveling from what I was told.

I have been with my current company about 9 years now. But I've been reading a lot of different things about HP, and not sure if it would be a company that I feel would stay stable enough to be with them (reading about splits in the company later this year, people being laid off). Also able to still receive tuition reimbursement with my current company as well. My schooling is online as well.

Just trying to get some advice of what others would do, or what people have heard about for the company overall. I'm only $5 above new hires in Disney, but at the same time, I do enjoy the work. It just feels like a big risk in my opinion, but that's what I'm trying to figure out."

32ptjp,7,2015-04-15,Cultural Vistas J-1 visa processing delay for summer internship at Amazon in the US,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32ptjp/cultural_vistas_j1_visa_processing_delay_for/,"Hello guys.

About a month ago, after following the advice on the threads here and studying hard for the interview, I was able to get an internship at Amazon (Thanks everyone). I am starting my final year of studies in September so this internship could potentially be a full-time career move for me.

So the problem here is that Cultural Vistas, Amazon's contact for dealing with visa and work permits and such, seem to be taking their sweet time with the process even though Amazon agreed to expedite my application. Last communication I had from their rep was that they sent the training package to Amazon who would need to sign it and return it to them, and then they do the same with me. Apparently I would receive the DS-2019 form after these two steps and then the whole appointment with US embassy starts. For some background on me, I am an Indian citizen but right now I am a student at a Canadian university.

My start date is supposed to be 5th May which is already so close. I was worried and I though that maybe I should ask you guys for your input.  


1) Would you be willing to share your experience regarding the J-1 visa application? I am curious about how much time should I expect all the involved parties (Amazon, Cultural Vistas, US Embassy) to take.

2) In case a candidate's work visa does not gets approved on time, have you heard of any case where these company is willing to change their offer from one location to another on such a short notice? Amazon has offices in Canada in Toronto and Vancouver so if the plan for working in US falls apart, I wanted to know if working in Canada is an option.

I am relying on my work term at Amazon for both professional and financial reasons and would prefer if nothing messes up (at-least from my side). If you have any other advice on how I should proceed, I would appreciate that.

I have seen other interns mention the same problem on facebook groups and seems like the response time from the recruiter(s) in pretty long which is understandable considering that they probably have a lot to deal with at this time."

I went to speak to the lab manager at Job B. He said that he thinks I'm a good fit for the position, but for round one of interviews I was one of the last ones to apply, so they have found someone else. They will have more people leaving, so another position will most likely open up over the summer and I am the first one on the list for round two. I was told to email him at the end of July ""to see where they are in the hiring process."" I think my chances of getting this position are high, but it's not guaranteed. This works out well because I am going out of town from July 3rd - July 22nd. When I told him this, he said that it should be no problem because they're still not sure when their people are leaving.

I did a phone interview with Job A. I just received an email from the director of the lab saying that they ""reviewed my application favorably"" and would like to speak to me about my interests and the position. This position pays less and I do not know if they will be ok with my vacation in July, but if I am offered, should I take it? What if I'm offered the Job B position in July?

Sorting through hundreds of internship applicants can be time consuming, so I’ve developed a system that allows me to eliminate 80% of applicants in under 10 minutes. This system allows me to quickly determine if the applicant possesses the basic skills necessary to receive further consideration. Here’s the inside scoop:

**Initial Meeting**

Are you confident? Well spoken? Do you show genuine interest? The first few minutes I meet someone often leaves a lasting first impression. Candidates who lack the traits above are generally placed in the “no” pile immediately. Those who stand out proceed to the next step.

**Follow Up**

I’ve touched on this in previous posts, but I want to reiterate its importance. Follow up is essential. Why? If you don’t follow up with me, how can I trust you to follow up with my customers? A simple email shows me that you are serious about the position.

**Communication Skills**

Timely and effective communication is key. Do you respond to emails in a reasonable amount of time? Are your responses well thought out? These are key factors that I look for in a potential intern.

While more advanced knowledge can be helpful in the interview stage, it is highly unlikely that you will get to that point in the hiring process if you do not possess these fundamentals.

Also programs in Japan usually starts in March 20 or April(and ends in Aug or Sep), so I think it might be a good time for taking an intern. But the office of study abroad advised me to do more preparations about the exchange and not taking an intern at that time...So normally how will you guys deal with the 5 months? 

Since I had never been there and just interested in the culture (I can speak Japanese, a little bit better than high school level). Need more advices.

32rvwp,5,2015-04-16,Masters Admittance,northavenue1,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/32rvwp/masters_admittance/,"Hi guys, so I'm a CmpE undergrad w/ a minor in Econ and I'll be graduating in a few semesters. My GPA isn't too great. I have a 3.0 right now, but it will probably go up to about a ~3.2 or so (hopefully) by the time I graduate. I want to try to get my MS in ECE at Tech, but I'm worried that I won't get in. I'll be starting a 2-semester internship with GTRI this summer, and they help pay for grad school at Tech which is part of the reason I turned down other offers for GTRI. 

My question is two-pronged:
a) is my GPA too low for getting into an MS program here?
b) If I do end up working at GTRI after graduation (they have a really high offer rate for interns/co-ops), will that help my chances of coming here for my Masters?

Thanks!"

I have a well off supportive family, an interview for a dream internship, a trip of a lifetime booked, etc. Basically, all the tangible things are going my way right now.

However, I have always been slightly socially awkward. I am a really well known and well liked person, but I do not have that close group of 5-10 friends that most people seem to have. Well, I do have this, but I am not an integral member. I am basically on the edge of every social circle, and not near the middle of any single one. This often means that I am not heavily included in people's plans. 

Also, I tend to not stand out from the crowd, which makes me disposable. In these group conversations, I always seem to stand there awkwardly. I AM ALWAYS SO AWKWARD at night clubs.

Again, I have everything tangible going my way (well off, decent looking, smart, etc) and most people say that I am really ""nice."" Yet I can't seem to really connect on that very close level to others outside of my family. 

This is very self appreciating, but I think maturity might be part of it. Most people my age seemingly don't see the world and life the same way I do, and I really don't want anything to do with smoking dope and doing much,much worse stuff. Party girls and one night stands don't really appeal to me much either.

Any help would be appreciated."

32s5q8,4,2015-04-16,Which is better for an internship resume: making and shipping a game vs working on current company's database?,nova_cheeser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32s5q8/which_is_better_for_an_internship_resume_making/,"By a combination of sheer luck and playing my cards right, I landed a full time job as a combined IT/Dev in a major VFX company for my first university co-op experience. They hired me not as an intern, but as a regular employee for the full production of a movie they're contracted to do. Unfortunately, the scheduling would leave me with 4 more months of co-op needed to be filled. However, I believe having such a role in a big name company in my resume gives me decent ammo to shoot for an internship in a Big 4 company. I am aiming to start contacting recruiters starting this summer to secure an internship term for January.

Before that, I want to make my resume as great as it can be. To do that, I feel that there are one of two things that I can do. I can either buff up the personal projects section of my resume with video game development or add more accomplishment statements for my work experience by working on the company's database.

The advantages I see in the former is that it shows I have experience designing for front-end. Also, my projects are somewhat lacking. I currently use the pong game I made from programming an FPGA board for a school project and a self made Powerglove controller as a personal project for my resume (I'm in EE). Additionally, I could actually show this project off. On the downside, I feel that a lot of my peers have something similar to this.

If I work on the company's database, my employment history section could potentially look way better. I'm looking to optimize the search algorithms of lookup scripts using the database API. This is easily quantifiable and I could list down how much money I'm actually saving the company. I feel as if this is more ""professional"", sets me apart from competitors and is a lot more technically challenging. Downside is, I can't show it off with an external link on my resume.

Ideally, I'd be doing the game on my spare time and working on the database on my downtime at work. However, I'm not an expert at either of those subjects yet and I still have to learn. Realistically speaking, mental fatigue would only limit me to focusing on one. To maximize my chances of getting an internship interview at Microsoft, Google, Amazon or any other huge software companies, what should I choose to focus on? Thanks!"

I decided on another office and accepted my offer for that location. 

All this now changes as I'm realizing more and more that for my future career goals I'd benefit from being in the NYC office. I'm trying to decide if I should reach out to my recruiter and see if anything can be changed at this point, or if I need to wait it out for a year and try to internally transfer back to NYC. I don't think I'd have too much trouble either way, as I developed a relationship with a managing partner in the NYC office during my internship as I tried to move from a more assurance/audit support role into tech consulting. I'm just not sure whether I should even bother asking as I know it will look poorly, but I don't want to get stuck somewhere where I may not be able to further my career in the way I want.

I know I should be taking it positive, but I just feel like it’s kind of demeaning. I want to think of it as a job, not something temporary I get portfolio pieces from. I have bills and debt!

And, I feel like they don’t give me as many projects as the other freelancers here. One guy previously did my job, but typically, they would have many people with my position. Now, it is him and I. 

Today I really felt like an intern. I just got out of a meeting for a project when my boss showed me this stuff they had torn down from redoing the office and told me to basically clean it up and rip the stuff off as a “little project.” I was pretty pissed but didn’t show it.

32u8j4,1,2015-04-16,I feel that my graduate studies became a trap to unemployment.,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/32u8j4/i_feel_that_my_graduate_studies_became_a_trap_to/,"This is going to be a bit long, so please bear with me.

I graduated with a psychology degree and got a teaching certificate a couple of years after. I originally planned on becoming a high school teacher, but I didn't have a license to back it up. Someone close to me offered me to work as a part-time college teacher at a public college. I was around 22 at that time. Since I really wanted to work, and I had problems finding a job, I just accepted it.

My mindset then was that it was just going to be part-time, while I look for another teaching job. I also thought that since I didn't have a master's degree yet, I would only be limited to general psychology courses.

However, the people close to me had the assumption that I should be tenured in that college. So they encouraged/forced me to take up a master's degree. It was not in my plan to get tenured, but I didn't have that much of a choice then.

I wanted to get a master's in history, but the people close to me shut it out, saying that because I'm a psychology graduate, I should take a psychology graduate degree to comply with vertical articulation in college teaching. Again, I didn't even plan on being tenured, and the key reason why I even took up psychology is because I just wanted to make sure that I'll have flexibility in finding work. After all, I was only 16 when I had to make that choice on which college course to take. But since I pretty much have very little choice, I just went on with it, and took graduate studies in social psychology as an acceptable compromise.

Over time, the pressure between my work in the college and my graduate studies has increasingly left me frustrated. I had to handle clinical psychology internships of around 100 students, and this is despite not having any clinical psychology internship experience myself. (I only had industrial and guidance counseling experience, which are way different.) I ended up getting major subjects, like statistics and experimental psychology, which forced me to re-study subjects that I've essentially forgotten from my college days. In some cases, I actually ended up studying the subjects from scratch, since my experience in college wasn't that satisfying. Plus, I had to teach other subjects like entrepreneurship for non-business students, because the college had a lack of teachers.

My graduate studies became a burden because for 1-3 nights a week, I had to literally hike on a mountain to go to class, since the building really is located in an elevated area, and oftentimes there is no vehicle to ride when I arrive to class.)

A point came when I decided that I've had enough. I was only working part-time (adjunct), without any medical benefits, and with way too much pressure in my brain than I could ever imagine before.

So I quit my job. I continued my graduate studies, though, because I've already started it, and I'll just have to finish it. I did want to get a social psychology graduate degree anyway; it's just that I had been forced to get it sooner rather than later.

As I looked for a job, I had very little luck. I got a job in teaching English to non-English speakers, which was cool, but then it didn't pay too much and it was only seasonal. Another college offered me a job, but I was misinformed about the nature of the job and I ended up feeling the same pressure once more. I had to teach major psychology courses in a college where I'm the only psychology teacher available! I'm not even an expert yet!

Now I'm trying to look for another job, while continuing my master's degree. But I honestly feel like the master's degree is becoming way too much of a burden for finding a stable job. I couldn't teach in a high school setting, because my master's will definitely kill me. I couldn't work in certain companies, because the long travel time and the master's will kill me as well. While my younger brother gets to enjoy a full-time job already, my master's degree is stopping me from doing so. And from time to time, it annoys the hell out of me. I'm being offered a corporate job, but then again, my plan was to teach high school, not a corporate job. Three years in, and the plan is all messed up.

Essentially, I feel like my graduate studies was a trap. The people close to me thought it would be fine, since it would supposedly elevate my career and make me get paid more. They said that it's going to be easy, because all of you supposedly have to do in master's is just sit around and listen to a lecture. (Even then, I questioned that notion.) They even told me to take the psychologist board exam to gain points in the tenureship. It always comes across to me as shallow thinking, and my decision to listen to them because they're close to me ended up screwing my life.

When a college tells me that they will pay me $28 a month for every major psychology course that I teach to a group of 10 students IF I have a thesis already, I can't help but question what the hell I'm doing. $28 to lecture in a school with no electric fan, no psych laboratory, no sufficient computers, no benefits. Plus, if there's a vacation that forces me not to have a class, I end up getting paid $7 per subject. If this was high school, I'd forgive it; but dammit, this is college. I sometimes wonder: is this really what this damn master's degree is worth?

Sometimes, I feel like it's not worth it, but quitting is no longer an option. I only have two years before I expect to graduate, so I might as well continue this. Plus, I really don't want to face the burden of getting letters of recommendation once again.

I feel that if I was just given more time to prepare myself and to be more mentally prepared, my master's would've been more productive for me. But because this master's degree was rushed to me out of a need for compliance, I've ended up being very disappointed. I'm not exactly becoming a ""master"", and I'm facing unemployment. (And thank goodness that English school offered to pick me up.)

I'm just hoping that after I graduate, I would still be able to fix everything in my life. I've taken some steps to doing so, and I hope my graduate degree won't be the immovable rock that blocks me from pursuing those steps.

tl;dr Being rushed to take master's has put me in an unemployment trap. Don't listen to graduate school advice from people who don't even understand what graduate school is really about. Or to some extent, what psychology graduate studies is really about."

So far I've applied to about 20 places and got 3 interviews, but couldn't get past the phone interview to the on-sites for any of them. So far, a lot of the places I'm looking at interviewing are asking that I be familiar with any programming language (java, C++, python etc.), but when I get to the interview -- they tell me they're looking specifically for X language and experience in X framework or technology stack. 

I was under the assumption that companies just wanted to find hungry learners (obviously with a background in CS at the very least), rather than already-competent students that could fill for an already-competent engineer but for cheap. My last interview with the lead director specifically told me that he expects me to know how to write tests for all the protocols in the 7 networking layers. To be frank, I've never really studied that sort of stuff, closest I got to networking protocols would be socket programming. I know my program definitely doesn't cover unit testing at all, since we're just expected to manually input values and hope to god our programs work (I know I should probably self-learn this, probably will this summer since I can't seem to get anything). 

How do recruiters expect students to know so much from the get-go?

I also notice that I sound pretty dispassionate and unknowledgeable during the soft-technical interview portion. When engineers ask me what I know about a certain field of programming (web dev, networking, etc.), I end up just giving them a general description of what the field is, embarrassingly -- in my defense that's really all a student is taught in school. I'm not sure how I can appear to be knowledgeable about something I'm really not. I'm at the point where I get rejected before I can even demonstrate a working knowledge of data structures or algorithms or anything I've learned, purely because of either a) shitty soft skills or b) I really do have no experience against other applicants.

32uffd,1,2015-04-16,How to approach recruiter about requesting an earlier decision?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/32uffd/how_to_approach_recruiter_about_requesting_an/,"Hey guys just quick background I am currently a sophomore in college who is just now finishing up the interview process for a summer internship. I reached the final round of interviews for two companies:

Company A is a  very large, established corporation with whom I interviewed for my dream position. I had a primary, somewhat informal interview/intro to the company. Then a secondary phone interview with the senior manager I would be working under. Then yesterday I went in-person, for what they said was the final interview. It was three rounds, one of which was with my phone interviewer and I think it went pretty well. I am also the only person interviewing for the position, it isn't of immediate need for the company, but they seem to like me and my experience. They told me at the end of the interview I would hear back in the next few days. 

Company B I applied to when I was freaking out a little bit about not having an internship yet so I applied on a whim. The position is a decent fit, but not exactly what I want to do. The firm is medium sized and in a pretty niche industry. I was never really enthusiastic about them, but their application process was straightforward. I made it to the second round which was a case-essay we had to submit within a few days. Submitted it, just hear back that I made it to the final round which is an in-person interview. They gave three dates and the one I picked was the latest since I wanted to hear back from Company A, so the interview is Monday.

Now here is my dilemma, I just sent the recruiter for Company A a follow-up/thank you email stating the usual etc. She replied rather quickly with this email:

""Thank you wingeddingbats, glad to hear you had a good experience. Would it be okay if we got back to you on Tuesday of next week on our final decision? We are finalizing a few things.""

I really don't want to have to go in to an interview Monday with Company B, a. Because I'm not very enthusiastic about the position and thereby don't think I would do as well and b. My finals week begins, and interviewing would inconvenience valuable time to study. 

Would it be inappropriate for me to send this message to the recruiter for Company A:

Hello 'Recruiter',

Unfortunately I have a deadline with another company on Monday and I was really hoping to hear back from 'Company A' before then. Having been through the interview process I have really enjoyed all the people that I have met and believe I would be a great fit. 'Company A' is my top choice and so I am wondering is there any way that you could possibly get back to me Sunday evening? I understand if logistically this is difficult and will do my best to reach out to the other firm. 

TL;DR: Is it appropriate to ask a recruiter to push their response time forward a day or two? "
32up23,0,2015-04-16,How much do grades in undergrad determine career outlook?,chevybow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32up23/how_much_do_grades_in_undergrad_determine_career/,"Hey everyone, 


I'm a cs major at Umass Amherst (Ranked 25 for cs) and I came here for the strength of the program and I know the education quality will be good. My first semester I got all A's in my major courses so I have a 4.0 for my major gpa. However this semester, it looks like I will end up in the B/B+ range for both my cs and my math class. 



I heard the class next semester that I'm taking will be hard too and most people end up with B's after curving/scaling. I do fine with programming projects but I've been losing points in my cs class this semester because I can't wake up early enough for my morning class and nothing I do seems to help me wake up earlier. 


Anyways I'm just wondering if I end up graduating with a gpa in the B/B- range if my gpa continues to go down slowly (I'm currently at a 3.8), will I end up with a ""bad"" job or will experience and internships through undergrad make up for it? I have an interview set up for an on-campus computer related job for next semester which might help with work experience and I plan to start applying to some internships next year and then definitely aim to get one end of Junior year. 



Will my GPA hold me back from some of the more highly desired jobs? I obviously have dreams of working for a company like amazon but I would be fine anywhere as long as its a good environment and has good pay. I am taking the weed-out course right now which is probably why I have a much lower grade compared to last semester- I still have well above the average grade for the class though. I'm just worried since I know the classes will keep getting harder and harder. 


Thanks! "

First of all, I need to clarify that I do not belittle software engineering jobs, but I know that they won't fit me and won't satisfy me probably. I am a CS undergrad student, (3rd year) in one of the best universities in my country. Nowadays, I chase an internship for this summer, thus gave a lot of thought about this and realised that a software engineering job that will make me sit down and write 7-8 hours of code everyday probably won't fit me. What I would prefer to do in the future is probably thinking about, struggling with 10 (or 20, you got the point) lines of code or some other thing for hours or even days rather than thinking less and doing more to get things done. (In terms of video games I enjoy playing Dark Souls more than playing Skyrim) I think that in order to get a job that I would enjoy, I should get a real expertise on a field. I have some interest in parallel computing, computer architecture, machine learning. (These are very broad fields but I am an undergrad student after all, I don't know much) I think that I may chase a career on R&amp;D departments on these fields but probably an UG degree won't be enough to do so. And I also wonder, would being an expert on any of these fields get me a job of my dreams? As you can see, I am in a struggle right now, so can you help me to sort things out?

That's all. I may sound cocky, weird, awkward etc. since English is my second language and my word selection can be awful. Sorry about that.

I'm just kind of taken off guard now after the interview. I know this is a male-dominated industry, but seeing it first hand was totally different.

32vczw,316,2015-04-16,"""You don't need the C: drive. It's not important.""",cheesy_italian,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/32vczw/you_dont_need_the_c_drive_its_not_important/,"Hello again, TFTS!!  I have yet another tale from my time as a Windows Sys Admin for $LargeFinancialCompany.  Enjoy!
*****
Part of my ever-growing list of duties included training the new interns that we got in our department.  This wasn't really too bad as I had experience training people before and I really liked helping out the new guys get a grasp on how things worked in our department and company.  So when $Boss informed me we would be bringing someone else in to help with the workload, I was pretty happy.

Monday morning rolls around and $NewIntern shows up promptly at 8am.  I usually take punctuality as a good sign.  I realize it was his first day and he was trying to make an impression but I needed some hope to cling to so I went with it.  $Boss makes the introductions and $NewIntern is left in my completely capable hands.  Cue the “getting to know each other” conversation.  

During the course of the conversation, we started talking about his technical background.  I found out $NewIntern was a senior in college and would soon be graduating with his Bachelor’s degree in CIS.  As a side note, I should mention that my only previous experience with anyone who did programming was an Army buddy of mine who knew as much about hardware and software as I do.  Based purely on this friendship, I made the assumption that this fellow programmer too had an in-depth knowledge of hardware and software and understood the basics of computers.

Now, this isn’t an insult to any other programmers out there by any means.  I have met plenty since this time that have blown me away with their knowledge of computers and how they work.  And I have also met plenty whom I was surprised could even find the power button.  This guy fell into the latter group.  For example, he broke a motherboard the first time I asked him to replace RAM in a server because he was trying to put it in the wrong way and decided brute force and a hammer would make it fit.  Yes, you read that right.  He used a hammer to pound RAM into a server the wrong way.  Imagine Thor using Mjolnir to fix your computer.   

*(I’ll give you guys a minute to compose yourselves and wipe your eyes after laughing your asses off.  If anyone fell out of their chair and was injured, I apologize.)*

The incident at the heart of this story is what made me understand he really had no basic computer knowledge.  For chronological sake, this came before the RAM incident.

Part of my job included wiping drives before sending them out to be destroyed.  We used a program called KillDisk and these were wiped according to DoD standards.  I had a wiping station set up that consisted of 4 servers.  Each server has 2 OS drives and 6 additional bays to be used for the hard drives to be wiped.  I wrote out explicit instructions that included screenshots, warnings, and tips for exactly how to do this process.  Apparently, they were not clear enough.  
&gt;$NewIntern: Hey, cheesy_italian, I think we have a problem with the KillDisk servers.

&gt;$Me:  Oh really?  What’s wrong with them?

&gt;$NewIntern: Well I was wiping hard drives last night and all of a sudden, I got a blue screen and it rebooted.  Now it won’t load.

Oh no.

We go back to the room and what is greeting me on the screen?  [This great Windows message letting me know there was no longer an OS]( http://imgur.com/PLZCwnV) on all four servers.
&gt;$Me: What happened?  Which drives did you choose to wipe?

&gt;$NewIntern: All of them.

&gt;$Me: Even the ones the instructions that I gave you explicitly say not too??

&gt;$NewIntern: Oh.  I didn't think I’d need them so I threw them away. *(shrugs shoulders)*

That’s right – he ran the KillDisk program on the C: drives of all four servers.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the program, it allows you to select which drives you want to wipe and which you want to leave alone.  This was spelled out in my instructions to avoid this exact scenario.

I don’t mind honest mistakes.  We've all made them before and will make them from time to time.  What bothered me was he blasé attitude about the whole thing and that he knew he made a mistake but didn't care.  No apologies.  No offer to learn to fix or restore the servers.  Nothing.  Just a shrug of the shoulders and a turned back as he walked off towards his desk.  Thankfully, he left shortly to go destroy some other companies’ hardware and software and we got a replacement that turned out to be awesome.
*****
TL;DR – Your C: drive isn't important and can be formatted; also, a hammer works wonders to install RAM.

Here are a handful of opinions, situations, and anecdotes I've encountered on reddit and in real life. Paraphrased from memory:

- ""My company is having troubles filling positions. Nobody wants to go into CS anymore.""

- Lockheed Martin has trouble finding qualified personnel.

- Some people say there is a shortage of CS workers. Others say this is a myth propagated by the man to keep wages low.

- Web dev jobs seem to pay shit. I've seen ads for web dev positions ranging from minimum wage to 20 dollars. I've never done web dev so I don't know how easy/hard it is.

- Some people on this subreddit are having extreme trouble finding a CS-related job in spite of having a degree. Granted, this can probably be chalked down to selection bias.

- The US is importing foreign CS talent and this will damage home grown talent.

- Foreign competition is getting pretty stiff all around, and this will damage American CS workers.

- Recently, I delved into a search for internships and I found that most of the CS-related ones paid double or more than paid internships in other fields.

- If you want to go into computer vision and have the skills for the job, there is high demand for this area.

- Employers prefer younger devs to older devs. As you get older, you become less employable in CS-related fields.

That's all I can think of for now.

Bottom line: I want to plan for the future, but I'm getting mixed signals about the current climate for CS workers. It seems like everyone has their own set of strange beliefs that are based off nothing. I'm inclined to chalk down most of the opinions I encounter as voodooism if they are not based on hard facts, but I nevertheless find them unsettling. 

Is the future bright for CS grads?"

They're pretty much puzzle solving programs, one puzzle with GUI, a program that just sends/receives a file, nothing really big. Not only that, I'm having an incredibly hard time on the behavioral interview. Especially when they bring up my GPA. One question in particular is that I have a tough time answering why I have a low GPA. I actually asked a friend afterwards if telling them that I did poor in the theoretical stuff and that I did amazing in the projects was an acceptable answer. He said no, and that I should make some shit up. What's an actual and reasonable answer that I could give?

I've already cut down my gaming time, so I asked some friends for advice. A friend has recommended me to learn Python, make some things, and fix up my resume first. Another friend recommended I read the first few portions of Cracking the Coding interview about how to dress, talk, and all that jazz in the behavioral interview. I've started that a few days ago but I'm starting to doubt if this is an actual course of action I should take. What are my options at this point so that I can still pursue a career in programming?

The teacher does all the work on the board and does a terrible job explaining what she is doing. The entire class is just mindlessly copying everything down and nobody is really being challenged. Everybody gets an A.


I know this problem will be fixed if I go to a better school with a better computer science program. I was thinking of attending Missouri Science and Technology, which seems to be a great school in the industry. The only problem is that I will be paying about $40,000 a year if I go there and I know they have great recruiting opportunities there so I can possibly get a good internship to help pay some of it off before I get into the field. Also I should probably mention that I am in process of getting a green card, my priority date is in about 2 years if all goes well. Should I take the plunge and pay ~$40,000 a year for the next few years until I get immigration, or ride out community college for another year before I transfer?

Very happy to say that I've been offered a job about a month and a half shy from graduating. I'm excited about the position, but want to ensure that I can properly negotiate some key aspects.

The short story is that I'm in the animation and art industry and have two previous internships under my belt, both related to my career path. I cold called a small studio in NYC and they interviewed me and offered me an internship with strong/likely possibility to go full-time after two months. Here are a few things I'm wondering:

1. How do I make sure I don't get strung along and dropped from a full-time position, aside from doing good work? The interviewer really liked my work, but said that because they are a smaller studio, they usually have new people intern or freelance for a time before they get hired full-time. I have talked to a few other people at my school and apparently that is a common process among boutique studios. 

2. How do I approach pay? As an intern, I was paid $10/hr at my last job. However, NYC is a lot more expensive than the city I was in and I'd like to receive at least $15/hr. I also want to make sure I get a full 40 hour work week (I was full time at my last internship but part time at my first). I don't think I can afford the city on part-time pay. Figures have not been discussed yet. What's the best way to politely bring that up?

3. If I get hired on full-time, how do I negotiate for a higher salary? As full-time my professors advised me that $25/hr is a good amount for someone starting out in animation. I guess it would be like getting a promotion to go from intern to full-time.

My problem is, my husband and I are planning to move to a different place (100+ miles away) as soon as I've graduated so he can start his PhD where he wants to go to school. This has been the plan all along and I do not foresee me having any problems finding an equally awesome job where we plan on moving.

It has been brought up to me a few times by my first-line manager that they are looking to extend the internship positions to the interns who they like, but who still won't be graduated by the time the internship is up.

I want to stay extended in the internship if they offer it to me because it's good money, but I'm also afraid they might assume I'd take a full-time position with them once I've graduated. 

How do I stay honest/real with them that I plan on moving once I've graduated, but don't make them want to pass over me in internship extensions?"

**Little background on me**: 3rd year accounting/finance major. I have just changed my direction this year and have gotten extremely interested in the consulting field. Been using a lot of resources on this subreddit as they have been extremely helpful! 

**My predicament:** Being an accounting/finance student I am a little disadvantaged when it comes to landing a gig in consulting, however from what I have read opportunities exist for all majors. I've done what I could, got involved on campus, attended a few competitions and eventually landed internship interviews for Deloitte as a BTA and AccentureStrategy. Didn't make it through unfortunately, however I still have a year left of school and am doing what I can to build my value proposition. 

**My question:** I've accepted a financial role with one of the big oil&amp;gas companies this summer, and I was wondering how I could leverage this internship to best position my experience for full-time consulting?


I appreciate any advice/direction I can get. :)


Thanks again!

I'm interested in studying IT. I'm really passionate about computers, I love to solve problems, ever since I was little I had interest in electronics, made circuits, solved software issues, etc. So I have some question for UCF students who studying IT.

1) How rigorous are the math courses required for this major? Is it a lot easier compared to someone who is studying to get a computer science degree?

2) How is tutoring for the classes required for this major? I don't think I will struggle but I am wondering if UCF has great resources for students who need help. Sometimes I don't understand things and I will seek help

3) How is UCF with internships? Does the Computer Science college help to land good internships? What are your experiences? Did you land a permanent job from an internship?  

4) How is the stress load of this major and the stress load at a beginning position? 


I'm interested in this major because I am passionate about computers and I would like to use my skills to solve problems. Eventually I would like to become a IT manager, then work my way up to Chief Information Officer."

I started this journey way back in 2003 when I graduated high school, but I didn't try very hard and got little to no direction from anyone about the college experience other than the movies. I scored a 31 on my ACT after taking it just 2 times and doing no prep for it, so I easily got a full ride to the local state school. 

Well it rolls around to the Fall semester I decided to not live on campus and commute for 30 minutes each way every day (did I mention I was stupid and signed up for classes last minute) and waited too long to get my books (did I mention I was stupid had no money other than gas money so I needed financial aid to pick up books), so I downloaded the books I could get and hoped to wing the rest without material. Well that landed me squarely in academic probation and you would think I would learn my lesson, but alas I did not. My second semester was also bad and after skipping all of my finals I ended up with a 1.52 GPA. 

Fast forward to now and I'll be finishing up my second semester back and now have a 3.56 (which should go to a 3.75+ at the end of the semester) and can graduate next winter with a associates of applied arts in general education from the local Cc and transfer. Now to my questions since the back story is out of the way. 

1) Should I stay at the community college and finish my business administration associates and possibly try to get into a more prestigious school? 

2) If I can get into a more prestigious school would it be worth it to pay a bit for it or would it be better to get the freebie education from the local University? (Arkansas State University) 

3) What's my likelihood of scoring a good internship the summer after finishing CC if I work on some decent projects this summer? 

4) I'm also interested in electrical engineering and was planning on double majoring. Would it be worth it outside of learning to do that? 

Give me some opinions guys I've been reading the sub for awhile now and until doing so thought I was doomed, but there is some really uplifting stuff in here and some true feel good stories. "

32zim9,3,2015-04-17,Salesforce or eBay Internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/32zim9/salesforce_or_ebay_internship/,"Hi everyone,
I'm a 2nd year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering in Cali. I accepted an offer from eBay back in January for a mobile web development internship. However, I received an offer today from Salesforce for a Software Engineer Intern position for a Platform Engineering UI team. However, the recruiter described the position to me as a hybrid of development and testing, and this is evident by the position's roles/responsibilities found here: [Roles/Responsibilities](http://careers.force.com/jobs/apex/ts2__JobDetails?jobId=a1k7000000084eeAAA&amp;tSource=)

&amp;nbsp;

I think Salesforce is an awesome company, and working in SF would be sweet. However, I'm worried about the testing aspect of this position (again, look at the roles/responsibilities in the link above) and how it may affect my opportunities for internships for next summer when I'll have completed my junior year. The hiring manager who I interviewed with gave me a few algorithmic exercises on collabedit and then had me come up with test cases for each problem. The recruiter said this position is 50% development, 50% testing, and that as long as I do well this summer, there's a LOT of opportunities for positions for next summer. Also, they love their interns and have a 80% conversion rate from junior yr summer to full time, and for people who have interned two summers, they have a 100% conversion rate.

&amp;nbsp;

What do you guys think I should do? Pay is similar but I love the appeal of working for the industry's #1 Cloud Computing company while eBay is ok, but it isn't as ""hot"" as Salesforce is. 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Accepted Mobile Web Dev position at eBay, but got Salesforce position where it's on the tools/testing team where it's 50/50 testing and development (probably on internal frameworks). I like Salesforce much more than eBay and they have an awesome return offer/full time offer rate. "

I have some options:

1. start studying fall semester's material (because the work is very, very hard and time-consuming)
2. try to get a summer internship
3. take the INTRO classes for a SECOND major that I may want to pursue. 
4. get a job
5. summer coding projects

Explanation of options:

1. Another friend and I, if we do this, want to simply expose ourselves to material. I think if we even just get to week 6, we'll be super prepared for next semester. Pros: Free. Cons: Not really using the summer.
2. Self-explanatory, but it's a little late to look for them (in my field at least)... and I am only a freshman. And I don't have any projects. Pros: maybe $$$, definitely a resume-stuffer. Cons: hard to get, may be unpaid, may not learn much.
3. My favorite option. My current Comp Lit/Rhetoric professor encourages me to be a Rhetoric major (she actually told me to drop CS for it). And I love the material. Pros: won't be behind in that major's classes. Cons: expensive... $2200 (including apartment, food, books, tuition), may not get all the material. And I already NEED to be taking a math class this summer, too. So potentially 3 semester-long classes during the summer (though no more than 2 classes at once). 
4. I already have a job--they'll likely still want me. Hours flexible, $20/hr. Pros: easy and good money. Cons: not related to majors, so not really furthering my potential career... also very boring.
5. Self explanatory. Pros: may be fun, free, potential source of passion. Resume-stuffer. Cons: what if nothing comes out of it?"

32zweo,2,2015-04-17,Certain I have ADHD. I will be undergoing testing through the health center at my university in a couple of weeks. Seeking advice/guidance,TheRelentlessSkeezix,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/32zweo/certain_i_have_adhd_i_will_be_undergoing_testing/,"Hi guys,

I'm new to this subreddit. I'm mainly a lurker on Reddit, but I would like to seek some advice/guidance from this community.

A bit of background:

As a teenager, I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I have been on and off SSRIs, SNRIs, benzos/mood stabilizers throughout much of my adolescence and young adult life. I'm a 24-year old female. 

Without divulging too many details, I had a very traumatic upbringing and have been diagnosed with PTSD. This past winter, I went through some major episodes of depression. I live in Michigan, so it's not uncommon for some people to go through the winter blues, or SAD (seasonal affective disorder). 

When I was 3, my grandmother told my mom that I needed to be on Ritalin because of my hyperactivity and high levels of energy, but my mom refused to put me on any type of medication. I have never been diagnosed with ADHD, but now I am going to get tested for it since I exhibit many signs of it. 

In recent months and weeks, I have been experiencing panic attacks, low motivation, lethargy, outbursts of irritation/anger at trivial things and I constantly experience racing thoughts and jump to conclusions.

My wonderful, patient and supportive boyfriend has been there for me through all of the turmoil this year. I am a graduate student seeking to get my Masters of Social Work and I'm the news editor for my campus' newspaper.

The panic attacks and anxiety I've been dealing with have been crippling and debilitating. I've missed work, class and internship due to them in recent months. 

After talking with my mom and boyfriend, in addition to doing some research, it's becoming more and more evident that I may have ADHD. It would not surprise since my father (now deceased) had ADHD and self medicated. (Marijuana was only the substance that helped him. Unfortunately he turned to harder drugs that had a role in his untimely death). My twelve year old brother has also been diagnosed with ADHD. It seems there is a genetic component. 

After talking with my boyfriend, who also happens to have ADHD and has received the proper treatment, we are both certain I have it as well.

These are the signs and symptoms I experience on a regular basis:

-Impulsivity, I want to act on something right away and I jump to conclusions.
-Procrastination. I put too many things off until the very last minute. I tend to avoid them by hyper focusing on an entirely different task.
-I get started on tasks, but have a difficult time finishing them.
-I have very poor organizational skills. My desk at work and my bedroom is a mess. I've never been much of an organized person.
-I'm forgetful and I tend to lose items (such as my phone, car keys, etc on a daily basis).
-I experience difficulty paying attention to lectures in class or I have trouble focusing while reading a textbook and often have to go back and re-read a paragraph several times over before moving on. 
-I tend to ""blurt out"" answers a lot and interrupt people without thinking about it at certain times. 
-I have major issues with focusing on one thing at a time. My mind is constantly jumping from one thing to another. 
-I overreact, I'm impatient and I'm prone to being defensive.

After visiting my psychiatrist and explaining the symptoms, she agrees that it would not be a surprise if I have ADHD. I will be undergoing extensive testing in early May from a psychologist to find out if I have it.

The antidepressants I've been taking have not been working. I was recently put on Klonopin (which does help with my anxiety) and I've been prescribed LeMICtal (25 mg) which is a mood stabilizer. I am also on Pristiq (50 mg) for the time being. 

I also experience trouble sleeping at night because of racing thoughts and constant worries. I'm more likely to sleep during the day by taking naps after I get home from class/work/internship because I'm exhausted and unmotivated. I find that my worries from putting things off become depressive thoughts and I find ways to distract myself from them until I absolutely need to get them done. 

I also have a hard time sitting still and I fidget/squirm a lot in my seat. I always feel like I have to be doing something and have trouble relaxing. 

My boyfriend, who has a background in chemistry, biotechnology and pharmacy, feels I was improperly diagnosed with MDD. I think he may be right. 

At this point in time, I can not say for sure that I do have ADHD since I have not been formally diagnosed, but I'm highly certain I have it and have had it, it has just gone untreated throughout the course of my life. 

I apologize for the novel, just wanted to share some points so it makes sense. 

What would you guys recommend I do for the time being until I undergo testing and get the results? What habits/rituals should I begin to ease the difficulties I've been dealing with lately and for much of my life? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any advice/suggestions are greatly appreciated. This seems like a very supportive and helpful community. I look forward to your feedback. 

TL;DR - 24 year old female who may have ADHD. Has family history of ADHD and exhibits many of the signs and symptoms. May have been wrongly diagnosed with MDD. Will be undergoing testing through my university's psychiatric/psychological services in early May to find out if I have ADHD. Seeking advice and tips to help me stay on task with school, work and other aspects of my life. "

 I am currently a senior in college, looking to graduate next month. During the summer of 2014, I interned at a big corporate firm. Unfortunately, toward the end of the internship, the recruiter stated they weren't able to offer me and the other interns full-time positions after we graduate (most likely budget strategy). The recruiter, however, did mention that if we ever come across any junior roles on their page, to let them know.

Earlier this month, I came across a position that I felt I would fit in quite well, given my experiences. I emailed the recruiter, and two weeks later, she asked my availability to come in to interview with her and the hiring manager.

I had the interview today. The hiring manager spoke to my manager over the summer, and she got some great feedback about my work. The interview went very smoothly, we spoke for close to an hour. 

I thought everything went swell, until the hiring manager mentioned that since this position recently opened up, she wanted to interview a few more people. While she was walking out, I asked her about the timeline as to when I could possibly hear back, and she said she wasn't 100% sure as she still wanted to interview others.

Given that last bit of information, where does that put me? Was this some kind of social cue letting me know I didn't get the job? As soon as I got home, I sent the hiring manager, and the recruiter a thank you email.

I may be overanalyzing, but i'd love some outside perspective. Thank you!"

I have been trying to get more experience under my belt and build up my resume for when I need to start applying to full time jobs soon. I interviewed for internships but, unfortunately, I did not receive any offers - so I've decided to create my own internship over the summer. I decided that I was going to start contributing to some open source project. However the guides I usually read on getting involved in open source all seem to say the same thing: contribute to a project that you are already using. Being a university student we don't use any external libraries. It's always been pure Java code. 

So my question is... How do I proceed into open source? Do I just pick something off of github and start getting familiar with the code base, or is there a better approach? "

A bit of background: I got into computer science because I played a lot of computer games and I thought it'd be cool to get in that industry. Since then I've realised that I don't enjoy playing games let alone making them. I used games as escapism from my bigger mental health problems. I don't hate computer science, but a big part of me thinks I'm doing the wrong subject and that I am not cut out for being a software developer.

I have e-mail addresses of two IT managers that work at my previous employment. I have a good standing with the company and HR knew me by name. I left to go to college and I will finish two classes in networking and database fundamentals with a 4.0 gpa and earn two MTA certificates (database administration and networking fundamentals) this May. Questions!

* Should I send an e-mail to both, or just one of them? Should I Bcc or cc the message if it's for both? 

* Should I meet them in person instead of sending an e-mail?

* When I ask about an internship, should I be quick to mention my certificates and GPA?

* Would I even be worth anything to them? My networking class had a focus on Cisco equipment (IOS commands), and they have some at the company, but other than that I only have fundamental skills and knowledge

* Should I contact them ahead of time or wait until I've finished? I'm confident that I will have the 4.0 and certificates after I'm done, but would that come across as cocky if it's beforehand?

I told them as much at the interview,  and they seemed ok with my level of experience.  At first I wasn't worried,  because I thought it was unpaid.  However,  when they called me to offer me the internship,  they told me it's paid,  and pretty highly. 

Am I about to embarrass myself?  I have some experience with Java,  sql and html5,  but it's pretty much all classroom stuff.  I've been told that c# is similar to java,  and from what I'm reading,  it is,  but I don't even know java very well. 

What should I expect of an internship like this?  I'm trying my best to learn so much about c# as possible now(it starts in a month),  but I'm worried that they are going to expect more than I can deliver.

332s6s,1,2015-04-18,School &amp; life advice,vFlorentino,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/332s6s/school_life_advice/,"Hi, I have no real friends to talk to, or peers who I feel close to. I kind of just need to discuss a few things and I hope some of you can help me out here.

I am 24, I've been in community college for about 5 years now, part time for the last 2. I've wanted to study architecture and pursue a career in design. Out of high school I wasn't equipped to go right into a University; I had no portfolio prepared, and had average/poor grades, and I just didn't understand the education system. I seriously learned a lot in CC, and had good, meaningful relationships with some of my professors. I felt like I was prepared to transfer out and move on with my education. I wanted to get on with my life and get a degree already. I was motivated and felt that my hopes could be achieved.

I just found out yesterday that I didn't get accepted into UCLA. It was the only school I applied for. I had a 3.2 GPA with a good portfolio and 2 years of volunteer work at a small architecture office. I think I can say that I genuinely tried to get accepted.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I don't think I'm a good student. I'm not sure how else to put it, but I don't seem to work well with the school system. It's difficult to focus, difficult to care. I don't know if I'm lazy or just stupid. In the back of my head, I just keep wondering if I tried my best. Maybe I didn't. Maybe my best just isn't good enough for school. And if I didn't try my best, is it worth trying anymore, or should I just cut my losses and try something else. Maybe I'm not a thinker, maybe I'm just a worker.

But I seriously love to learn, and find most meaning in doing that. I want to know things, I want to be informed. But something about school just kills it for me. The books, the formality, the classrooms, and even the students sometimes. The teachers are mostly great, and I can see the humanity behind them, the lives they've lived and things they care about. A lot of the time I just wish I could work with them, 1-on-1, on site, and learn through practice and work and apprenticeship.

I seriously tried these last few years. I had a rocky start, but in the last 2-3 years I joined a club, audited classes with professors I cared about and wanted to learn more from, made up bad grades, and volunteered a lot of my time as an intern so that I could learn more about the field of architecture/design.

If you're still reading by now, thanks so much for your patience. I really have no one else to talk to, so really, thank you.

I think I know the core of my sadness right now. It's that I have nothing to contribute to the world. I have no qualifications, no knowledge to impart, nothing to give. I want to work, I want to research and contribute to people's lives. Architecture doesn't seem to be doing that for me. After years of pursuing it, I'm not sure I want to be in that field anymore. Office-life isn't fulfilling; being a consumer isn't fulfilling either. Being outside, however, is where I feel clear and normal. Working with nature, understanding it, growing life, and giving to others who can live off of it. That feels more meaningful to me.

I don't know what I'm good at. I don't know what I am capable of. I'm okay at design, I'm okay at being a student. I don't feel I'm good at being a person, though. Most times I don't feel qualified to even have a conversation with somebody. What's there to talk about? What do I even know? It's hard to care about the world, the politics, the qualifications, resumes, college, texts after texts of reading material. This post is a mess, I'm real sorry for that. And again, thanks for sticking around, the one or two who have made it this far down.

So yeah, 5 years gone by. Telling people and my huge family that I want to be an architect, but really I just want to find purpose. I just don't seem to fit well anywhere. I have no real skills, no confidence in myself. I don't connect with people, with my family. I do care, though. I want to stand up and shake it all off and look forward. I want to work; I want to have hope for something better. I just don't know where or how to go about it. I don't know where I belong.

I'm not sad that I didn't get into UCLA. I'm sad that my best attempt to move forward wasn't good enough. I'm sad that maybe the life of a scholar was never for me. And I'm sad that after 5 years I still feel just as scared and lost as after leaving high school. Learning and expanding my horizons through the educational system; maybe I'm not that person.

I am considering finding work through the wwoof program. It seems more fulfilling than what I have going on right now. I can get out of my parent's home and pull my own weight for a while. I hate living with the guilt, seeing the people who are helping me and not being able to help them back.

Yes, this post does have an ending. And really, thank you for reading through it all if you did. I know this post was more of a rant; I don't mind if it's deleted or ignored, I'm just glad I made the time to express what I'm going through. Your advice is very appreciated though.

And a tl,dr: 5 years of community college, still just as lost as before. Maybe school=no."

After applying to over a hundred jobs, I was able to finally secure myself a job interview (45-60 minutes!) for a summer  finance internship at a fortune 100 company. I'm extremely nervous right now as I feel like this job is a great opportunity to jump start my future career. 

I have read many of the top threads and noted as many tips as I could, but I am still extremely nervous about this due to the lack that I lack experience and I am not a great speaker. Here are my concerns and tips would be greatly appreciated.

- HR and the job requirements asked me if I knew how to use advanced Excel functions. I said yes because I'm desperate for a summer internship and I have always planned to learn Excel after exams or after I receive a job offer. The problem is that my interview lasts for such a long time (45-60 mins), I feel like I'm going to be tested on Excel. I am really short on time right now as I have 2 back-to-back exams on Tuesday while my job interview is on Monday.

**NOTE:** I'm not a complete beginner in Excel. I have experience with it from my finance courses, I just haven't been introduced to advanced functions such as Macros/Pivot tables (the ones that will probably be important for this job)

- I am not a real great speaker and I tend to stutter when I am unprepared of what to say. I tend to be a lot better speaker when I know exactly what to say since I don't really have to think about what to say. In other words, I talk faster than I can think which leads to my speech impediment.

**A bit about myself**: I am a student in an accounting and finance program who is going to specialize in accounting. my GPA isnt terrible, but it's not something that's really exceptional either. I'm definitely above average.

I have not much experience other than a bit of bookkeeping that I do once/twice a month recently.I volunteered for the university tax clinic where I prepared tax returns for students free of charge.

All other work experience is retail, not much related to the job position.

**Things that I have done**

* Researched the company and the interviewers. One of them is an alumni of my university. 
* Dressing sharp. I'm an avid follower of MFA. I'm wearing a tailored navy suit, burgundy tie, white dress shirt, matching coffee oxford shoes and belt
* I have prepared myself for the basic questions and will rehearse them to myself so I attempt to mitigate my problems speaking under pressure. For example, I have answers for ""What is your greatest weakness"", ""Tell me about yourself"", etc
* Physical copies of my resume to bring to the interview
* Questions I will ask at the end of the interview will be: ""Why do you like working for this company?"", ""What would the typical day in this position be?"", and lastly ""How is success measured in this company?""


That's all I can think of right now. I'm extremely nervous right now and being able to work at this company even for just 4 months would be a real dream come true.

Thanks

Software engineering student,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/333omx/i_dont_know_if_i_can_make_it_software_engineering/,"Hi Reddit. I've been feeling really anxious the past few days and I just need some advice or help or something.

Basically I just don't know where I'm going and I fear living a life of unhappiness and anxiety. Some background info:

* Starting my 4th year of software engineering. Should've been my last year but will need 5 years to graduate
* Currently studying abroad for a semester in Asia
* Early 20s, F

I honestly don't know where to start so sorry if the following sentences seem a bit disorganized. Basically I'm stressing over a lot of things. I've never been the typical computer science student and I feel like companies only value hard-core computer geeks that know everything about everything. I like coding but once I'm done with homework, I don't head home to code more, unlike most of my classmates who have tons of personal projects to showcase. I put on my resume that I'm in a music committee, that I'm studying abroad, that I work part-time and that I do a lot of sports, but no company ever asks me about that. I feel so frustrated that nothing that I do except for code is valued.

I have a 3.5 GPA (yay, I guess) and even got a scholarship because of it. But I feel like I'm such an idiot even though my grades are good. I feel like I'm that example of the person that's good in theory but sucks in practice. I always have trouble with technical questions during interviews. Homework always takes a really long time. Recently a prof recommended me to a really good company (think something like Microsoft) and I got an interview very quickly. Of course I didn't get an internship and I'm so embarrassed because apparently, everyone this prof has recommended got a job. Everyone said ""Oh, you're a girl, you have even more chances of getting it"" (something I fucking hate hearing. I want to get hired for my skills, not for my vag) and I wish I could just hide the fact I'm a girl. I've never felt like it was a plus for me, personally.

Up to now I have done 2 internships for a total of 12 months. I fucking hated them. They weren't in the fields that attract me (which are web design, video games, visual/digital design). Because I don't have any experience in these fields (and no personal projects because I simply don't have the time with work and involvement at school), I feel like I'll never be able to land a job in them. I dread having to work in a boring company that does boring stuff. Even then, I'm afraid I won't be able to find a job because they'll judge me: ""what, no personal projects? Probably went abroad to party. Kind of weird she needed 5 years to finish her degree."" 

All of these factors just make me dread finishing my degree and entering ""real life"". I know it would be stupid to drop school now when I only have two semesters left, but I feel like I'll never find a job in my dream companies and will be miserable forever. I hate to be that kind of person, I want to feel like I have my life under control and that I can do whatever I want, but right now I feel like the worst programmer that has ever been and the worst candidate companies have ever interviewed. Please help me. I hope I'm wrong and that I'm just overreacting. 

PS: English is not my native language, I apologize if there are any mistakes."
333qcb,0,2015-04-19,"Low GPA, good GRE -- any chance at top schools?",Dro133,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/333qcb/low_gpa_good_gre_any_chance_at_top_schools/,"A little bit of background on me -- I have considered myself ""pre-med"" for the past 6 or so years, but after one unsuccessful application cycle and another cycle looming, I'm considering a potential change in my future career path and applying to Ph.D programs instead.

- 3.3 undergrad GPA (Top 15 school, neuroscience BA)
- 33 MCAT
- GRE: 164 verbal, 161 quant
- Masters GPA: 4.0 (state school, cell biology MS)
- Research experience: I had various internships/grunt work during undergrad, got one abstract out of it (does that even count?). The research I did during my masters was much more substantial and culminated in a solid thesis, although I didn't get published (I probably could have published had I stayed another year and furthered my project, but being pre-med, I was in a hurry to finish my courses, graduate and move on to the next thing). 

After finishing my masters, I began an internship at a well-known tech company in a group that is involved in the bioinformatics field. During my time here, I have picked up some programming skills and developed an interest in combining biology with technology/computation. As a result, I am thinking of applying to bioinformatics or biomedical engineering Ph.D programs. I've also been collaborating with researchers at a nearby medical school, and one of the projects I'm working on might lead to a publication. 

My question is, do I have a shot at any of the big-name schools with my numbers/lack of publishing record? I understand that in many cases, the quality of training one receives can be more lab-dependent than school-dependent; however, I would like to keep my options open in terms of going into industry someday, and I have heard (anecdotally) that the name of the school can go a long way in that sector. I would really appreciate any input!

It's been a fun thing to do on the weekends and in my free time. However, something has recently came up. I haven't had any issues before this. 

The competition I mentioned is at the end of the school year. It's about 6 weeks away and one of the last few things that needed to be considered was who would go to compete. Long story short: 3 spots open for our sub-team, 4 of us, I got the short end of the stick. 

I'm kind of heartbroken and frustrated. Not so much because I wouldn't be going (I wouldn't have been able to go because of an internship this summer), but because no one brought it up to me. I had to ask. It makes me feel like I'm not an equal member of the team. 

Although he was sincere and apologetic, my software lead wasn't exactly forthright about the issue. Granted, if you had to ask me who should go, I would have chosen the same people. Their reponsibilities seemed to be greater than mine. My two team members (who would be going) remained silent while he spoke with me. I wasn't in the mood to make a big deal about it. To me, it seemed so painfully obvious that this wasn't right. I had to walk out from time to time to take a breather. My interest in the project has pretty much plummeted. 

What should I do?

334ft6,5,2015-04-19,Which school should I attend?,allofthebytes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/334ft6/which_school_should_i_attend/,"After a couple of years at a big state school, I was suspended because of poor grades, mostly because of my laziness and poor study habits. I've been attending a community college since and I have good grades from the cc. Should I apply back to the big state school? The reason I attended that school in the first place was because it is in a tech hub and it is the biggest engineering school (which includes CS) in the state, I figured I could find some part-time internships while finishing my degree. The thing about that school is I'll still have the super low GPA (under 2.0) when I go back to that school and I don't know if I could bring it back up to something respectable.

My other option is to start fresh at my local university. I could live at my parents' place while going to school there, which will save me some money. But, a lot of the CS classes I took at the big state school might not transfer for their CS program but i'm guessing my gen-eds will transfer, so I'll start over on the CS classes again. The local university is also on a somewhat small city with few Software Engineer jobs so my best chances for internships would be during the summers only. Also, since it's a no-name university, recruitment at the career fairs might be weaker compared to the big state school"

335fiw,4,2015-04-19,Frustrated/Confused with job prospects: New Grad,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/335fiw/frustratedconfused_with_job_prospects_new_grad/,"Hey guys first post at reddit here,
I just graduated with my degree in computer science in Canada and have been feeling really frustrated with trying to get a job right now. Particularly a job with a company - I won't say the name for privacy reasons but its a Big Software company in the league of Microsoft, Apple etc. 

About me:
I completed an 8 month internship at a startup in my city and a 4 month stint with the CS department for a coding project to be integrated in the universities computer systems. I was also the system administrator for the CS Society at the university, maintaining our servers. 
I also took a part time job in technical support for the last 2 years at my university. Just to pay the bills and such. I took an 8 month break to work in my internship so its really 16 months. First part of my job was basically QA on technical issues with clients. 
However over the last 8 months I have been doing programming projects for the department I work technical support for. I made sure to put all that on my resume. In fact most of my accomplishments on my resume for the technical support job are about my programming projects. 
I completed some side projects on my own, nothing heavy weight and dibbled in mobile apps. 

At this particular company it seems I am only getting interviews for technical support roles. I applied for over 70 entry level software jobs there -over the last 2 years - many of which I was well qualified for. All without a single response or interview. I applied for only 5 technical support jobs for kicks and got 2 great interviews and 1 offer at a great salary. Its 65k and way higher than any starting offer a company in this region could offer. 

While i'm happy I got a well paying post graduate job, I feel really annoyed and frustrated that despite my good experience and relevant degree I just can't crack the software barrier at this company. To the point where I'm questioning whether something is wrong with me. 


Should I keep trying for a software job - I really don't like technical support I'd rather code - or take this one and hope I can later transfer positions internally in the company. I have other dev interviews for small/mid-sized company's that don't pay nearly as much as this offer. Only problem is this is very hard offer to turn down and I really want to work with this company because I see a lot of potential for growth in my career. 

**TL;DR**
I applied for a lot of positions at a company but only got ones in technical support. its frustrating. Should I keep trying to take the well paying technical support job for now. I have interviews in other companies but they don't offer as much as the company I want or seem to have the same momentum for growth"

335jcb,13,2015-04-19,"Software Engineers: How often do you get in the ""zone"" or ""flow"" while at work?",sunshine_hugs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/335jcb/software_engineers_how_often_do_you_get_in_the/,"Programming as a newbie/student, I love getting in the ""flow"" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29 ) while coding.  I always seek out ""flow"" in life... anything that rewards me for continuous concentration. (like bicycling in a crowded city or a particular video game)  I get bored easily otherwise.  My ideal job is one that involves being ""in the zone"" regularly.  Is SE a good career path for someone like me? 

I'm aiming for a career that uses a fair amount of math and/or statistics and/or computer science, though am open to other ideas.  Biostatistics sounds really fulfilling, though I don't know if the day-to-day work as a statistician (or actuary, analyst, etc) tends to involve a lot more or less ""flow"" when compared to software engineering.  I love how SE sounds relatively meritocratic, and rewards continuous learning.  The problem solving aspect sounds great... I used to have a non-IT job that I'd brainstorm ideas/solutions for while in the shower, and I miss that.

I read from some of you here that some SE jobs are incredibly boring when compared to coding for fun.  I'm really afraid of that, and feel I won't know if I'm on the right path until after I get an internship or graduate.  The other day I read an SE here say that they have to regularly click on FB/Reddit while coding to keep their brain from drifting away during a monotonous coding task... that scares me.  I understand that most jobs in general involve a lot of boring work... but I'm hoping to choose a career that *relatively* minimizes that.  Could I avoid much of that by working towards the ""right"" SE jobs?  Any thoughts / comments would be really appreciated!"
336mpk,20,2015-04-19,"4.0 Computer Science CC student here, got rejected from transferring to UC Davis and UC San Diego and looking for advice.",NeedCS_CareerAdvice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/336mpk/40_computer_science_cc_student_here_got_rejected/,"Hey guys. Recently both Davis and San Diego's admission decisions came out and I was waitlisted for both. I know UC San Diego's CS program is top-notch and also impacted so I wasn't that surprised to get waitlisted, but when I saw that I was waitlisted for Davis I was absolutely devastated and quite frankly shocked as this was my fall-back. The only reason I'm thinking that I got waitlisted for Davis is because I'm missing linear algebra and my last chemistry course, but advisors at both Davis and my community college have been giving me the impression that I'd more than likely get in.

I'm still waiting on my last school that I applied to which is USC, but after these two waitlist offers, I'm feeling really down and I don't think it looks good. I did get accepted to UC Santa Cruz which I had never even considered at this point in attending...  I just can't help but feel that I should have been accepted into a better program and school that better reflects my grades and all of the hard work I've put into my schooling over the past two years. My biggest regret now is that I didn't apply to more schools, but I really thought I would get into Davis at least.

I would take a third year of CC, but honestly I'm so incredibly worn out at this point just trying to maintain my 4.0. Last quarter I was deathly afraid that I was going to lose my GPA to the point that I was losing sleep (this is not an exaggeration - I'd just lay in bed for 4-5 hours unable to sleep thinking about the next day's exam and then go on to take said exam on 2 hours of sleep.. and this happened over and over and over again). Funny enough, I ended up getting all A's, but the quarter took a very hard toll on both me mentally and physically. Honestly at this point I'm just sick of caring about my GPA. I want to move on from pre-reqs like chemistry and physics that I feel barely relate to my major and that I feel like I'm taking solely for the grade. I actually had a lot of fun in my data structures &amp; algos class a year ago, but that feeling in school seems completely foreign to me now, especially since I've finished all of my CS-related lower div courses. I love everything about CS and I know this is what I want to do with my life. Nothing at all gets me more excited, but I feel like I got caught up way, way too much in the school aspect of things and striving for a perfect 4.0 and it ended up hurting me. Especially now that I didn't get into Davis or San Diego.

But am I selling myself short for possibly going to UCSC and not taking another year of CC and re-applying? Or am I just feeding into the sunk cost fallacy with this mindset? I'd likely be able to graduate in 2 years at UCSC and apply for jobs right away, and really I'd just be banking on the fact that SC is so close to SV for networking and getting employed or an internship.. but I *still* can't help but feel in the end that all of my intense studying and work was for nothing..

If I do go to UCSC, will I need to work harder to stick out to employers among other applicants from maybe Stanford or Cal or San Diego? Should I just really focus on side projects in my spare time that can be listed on a future application? Or should I just tough it up and go another year at CC? 

If there is any other insight or advice you guys may have, I would really, really appreciate it. Thanks everyone."
336sw2,2,2015-04-19,Stuck in a negative feedback loop and don't know what to do,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/336sw2/stuck_in_a_negative_feedback_loop_and_dont_know/,"I figure I'll post this here since I've been feeling very suicidal lately and want to get some sort of perspective.

For the past two years, I've been having trouble shaping my life the way I want it to be. I had an amazing year before that and things seemed to go downhill afterwards.

Basically, my last semester as a full-time student ended and I moved back in with my parents. I finished my remaining credit hours as a part-time student and got my degree last year.

During this time, I've worked at Walmart and now I currently work at a grocery store. It's really depressing for me. I went from being happy in college and having a decent social life to being isolated and feeling stuck in my situation.

It's not that my job sucks (the Walmart one did, though), but I feel like life is passing me by. I can't afford to live on my own due to wage I make and my student loans. I can rarely go out anymore because I hardly make any money. I want to date, but what girl is going to want to date a guy who lives at home? Not to mention, I'd like to get some one night stands as well, but living at home makes that impossible.

I've never felt more suicidal than in the last few months. Part of the reason is because I turned down a chance to teach English in Japan. Now, you'd think I'd be trying to make that happen again, but honestly, I want to find a job here in my country (U.S.), work there for a little bit, and make some new friends. My social skills have went to hell these past few years. I'm not saying I was at the level I wanted to be before that, but I was much better than I am now.

However, I wouldn't even know where to start for a job here. My field was in Asian Studies and while that certainly helps with getting an English teaching job in Asia, it makes every other option for me here impossible. I really regret not taking an internship or maybe majoring in something that would get me a job (i.e. Computer Science). I also wish my Japanese was better, otherwise I could get a translation job, but that's my fault for procrastinating and putting off my studies. Worst part is, nobody seems to have an answer for me on what to do. I wish I got into an office job in college instead of pushing carts the first half and spending the other half being unemployed. All the jobs I've ever held, a high school student could do (in fact, at my current job, almost everyone there is in high school).

Like I said, usually, I'm suicidally-depressed. I wake up in the morning and feel like a complete failure. I lay in bed and don't get breakfast. I surf Reddit on my phone and feel even more neurotic reading about people having better experiences than me and being happy. I would see a therapist, but I have absolutely no health insurance (I work part-time; no insurance). This is another reason finding a full-time job would benefit me, since many of them offer health insurance.

I feel isolated from everyone around me. I rarely initiate anything unless someone talks to me, and whenever I'm feeling particularly depressed, my responses to them are always robotic or seem like I'm giving them the cold shoulder. I'm at this new job, and I'm already isolating myself from everyone. I don't even know what I could say, ""Oh, sorry that I'm acting this way. I think about killing myself everyday and it makes it hard for me to even function like a normal human being.""

I really have no idea what I can do. I want to go to a Meetup, but due to the fact that I work at a grocery store (this was the case at Walmart, too), my schedule is always changing and makes going to a lot of them impossible. Not to mention, I don't even have a car anymore and I have to rely on my dad to drive me everywhere; at age 26. The fact that I don't have a car doesn't bother me too much. If I lived in the city, I could just rely on public transportation, which is a big reason why I want to get the hell out of this suburb.

I just sit in the house feeling more and more isolated; and going out doesn't exactly solve anything because I'll still be lonely, only now there are people everywhere. I need a social context. Last Friday, I went to a bar by myself and sat outside. I saw a girl from work and her friends seemed to be friendly with me. But then, they just ignored me. I tried talking with her again, but she seemed reluctant to talk with me. So I just scrolled through Imgur on my phone and continued pounding down the beers. I felt like such a loser sitting by myself at the bench when they seemed to be having such a great time over at their table.

So, where do I even begin? I just feel like if this continues, I'm just going to end up dead, because being bored out of my mind and slowly watching my youth waste away is so painful. I want an answer; a real, concrete answer. None of this ""it get better"" or ""life has phases"" bullshit. I'm not getting younger and I don't want to finally get my life sorted out and then be that creepy old guy at the bar. And if it gets to that point, then I'll just end it."

**CPU:** I know a lot of you guys are going to be freaking out about how I'm able to get a 4690 for just $111. Like I mentioned above, I have a lot of family friends that work at Intel who were kind enough to give me a sweet employee discount. Words can't describe how grateful I am for this.

**Motherboard:** I'm obviously not going to be overclocking, so I didn't see the need to drop $90+ on a Z97 motherboard. Instead I looked for one with great reviews and with USB headers. Plus this one is made by MSI, which I've heard nothing but great things about, which is why I chose it. 

**RAM**: Nothing to explain here. Just your standard 8GB DDR3  @ 1600 mHz.  

**HDD**: Again nothing to explain here, just your average 1TB 7200RPM HDD thats on basically every build in this sub. A 128 GB SSD will be an upgrade next year for sure. 

**Case**: Has good reviews, ATX, looks like it handles cable management pretty well from other builds I've seen on PCPP. Plus it has USB 3.0 headers and looks clean.  

**Power Supply**: 500 watts is way more than enough for my build, and the fact that it has an 80+ bronze rating plus its made by Corsair is great for me. Oh and did I mention it's *Semi Modular?!*

**GPU**: I feel like I could really make my money go the distance if I opt to buy an R9 280 off of /r/hardwareswap for $125 shipped (thats what I see them frequently go for). To me this is a much better decision than buying an R9 270. 

**Monitor**: I honestly just need something thats 60 hz and 1080p. I might upgrade to 144hz next summer, but for now this will do the job great. 

***I know this is a huge wall of text,*** but I think I should give some insight to why I chose the parts instead of just pasting in a build and giving no backstory to what the PC will be used for or why the parts were chosen. If you actually read all the way down here, thank you so much. 

Again, I'm only 14, and I fully expect there to be mistakes in my part decision. If anyone could make reccomendations or corrections, that would be great! 

Sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, this was written very quickly without any proofreading. :)


**Edit:** Reading this back, it seems like I actually built the PC already. This is not the case. I just have all the parts ready and am looking for feedback/criticism on how I can improve my build before I order parts.

With regards to reputation, for example, I brought up the name at a few career fairs and recruiters didn't know what Cerner was, so I'm concerned that I should maybe look for a small startup that would potentially have better recognition in the Valley/NYC. Any thoughts on this?

In regards to the program, I don't want to just be doing small front-end changes to websites...hoping for something more substantial, but if anyone has experience or knows about the program, I'd appreciate input.

**Also, don't want to come across as a pretentious asshole, but it might anyway - I'm at a pretty top CS program, but all the past interns I've found are from pretty much local schools/midwest schools, and so if that changes anything I would like to know. If not, disregard."

For example when a colleague comes over and we attempt to trouble shoot some code, I seem to stumble and have difficulty saying the right words/terminology as we step through code. Like I would say 'member' instead of 'field', 'invoke' instead of 'field access' etc. And this makes it hard for the other person to follow what I'm trying to get across.

Any tips or suggestions on how I can improve my communication skills with describing code?

I do not know if any of you guys remember me but a few weeks ago I had an interview for Deloitte without any clear areas of preference. The just called me and i did it and it seems I did great. 

Today the called me and offered me an internship for a new department so called DxD, which is an IT department made for IT people. The thing is, I studied business management and I am kind of confused. Dont get me wrong i would love to get that spot but I would need way more training than an already tech undergraduate. 

What is happening, what would you guys do?

3384wb,313,2015-04-20,Don't be a (Bad)min...,Toakan,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3384wb/dont_be_a_badmin/,"Hey Guys,

It's been a while as i've been caught up trying to stabalise my work and 'Other-work'. For those who don't know, I was an Intern for a global technology company. However at night, I run various services including VoiP, Web and technical support. This story comes from the latter.


I do have one key note about this story, that i may write up properly after this.

Now the clients email is rather strange and requires backstory, I'll cut out the details but essentially their old Web Admin was rather bad at being a Web Admin, and one day decided that he wanted to run the business since he hosted all the services from his hosted rack.

This happened when I was visiting the company for other business, however I overheard some of their suggestions and was quite vocally dismayed at what I heard. I took over service that day.

-------

Friday night, about 11pm. Just turning all the systems off for the night and heading to bed.

Time from attack start : 5 minutes

My phone pings. This ping is recognizable as it's from my alt-work account. No one uses that unless it's urgent.

&gt;Damn...

Open it up, Nagios host reports connection time-out errors to Primary Production server. Various other minor details, yada yada...

Two minutes later, I get an email from a VoIP client, service is offline. Then another follows.. Yeah, that notification was silenced very quickly.

So I do what any technically responsible person does; Turn my system back online, and open a can of red bull.

Reading through the emails, I notice this charm.

&gt;Toakan,

&gt;Our old admin just came onto the VoIP and stated his intention to remove service to prove he was correct about being the best host we require.

&gt; Service has now gone dark. Was this planned or has he actually done it?!

Well crap, ok so I now have a starting point. After checking the nagios logs, it seems that there was a lot of traffic being sent to the primary machine, and none was coming back. 

However the way the Primary is setup, is there is a second hardwire into my failover box (Local network). So i jumped on the Failover and see connect through the LAN. 

Apparently this DOS was killing the NIC in the Primary machine, which couldn't then failover as there was no connection. (My mistake, which i've since corrected)

Kicking up wireshark on Prod, lo and behold there is a lot of packets being sent from an 81.xxx.xxx.xx address, not a usual address for a DOS attack to be sent from, however with the source IP, I quickly setup a rule within the router to ignore all traffic from this address. 

I'm pissed at this point, because it's already caused 40 minutes of down time and this guy is still sending the DOS (It's impacting the routers now).

Time from attack start : 45 Minutes

I decided to reverse lookup the IP on a whim, a few dns entries for Badmins websites and even better, it turns out that it's not from a VPN or company, but rather a client connection from a Telecom company! It even had the connection point and Telecom ID for the line!

I decide to call the Telecom, as their online attack form is diabolical...

&gt;Tele : Hi this is %Telecom, what is the nature of your enquiry?

&gt;Me : Yeah, Hi. I'm currently being subjected to a DOS attack, is there anyway you can throw me to your network guys so we can get this stopped?

&gt;Tele : Have you tried restarting your router?

I don't have time for this... I know that a smatter of you guys on the phones read this sub, and i know it's a script, but ... Gahhhh...

After a brief explanation of how serious this is, and that I don't have time for the common user support.

&gt; Tele : Oh, can you hold a minute please?

&gt; Tele : I'm transfering you to 3rd line now.

Time from start of attack: 1 hour 10 minutes 

&gt;3rd : Hi this is 3rd, what can I can do for you.

&gt;Me : Currently being DoS'ed, please can you verify the traffic from $IP$ and stop the service.

&gt;3rd : Under the Data Protection Act, i can't give you any information about the client or account details however. 

&gt;Me : Not a problem, however this is business impacting of just over 1 hour now, I have a 2 hour window for this type of incident.

&gt;3rd : Yeah sure, the monitor shows there is a lot of traffic from that account, hang on i'll get the tools running.

&gt;3rd : Alright, I've verified that it's pointed at your address, i'm closing the connection now. You should see servive restore in a couple of minutes.

&gt;Me : Yep, system is back online and services are restarting, thanks for your assistance.

Time from attack start : 1 Hour 30 Minutes

Great, so service is back online all clients are connected and happy. No more flags from the alerting. Time to fix those environment issues and write up the incident.

The bit I feel bad about? Badmin also had clients running from the $IP that was disconnected. Hopefully his clients took it as a sign to come away from him.


---------

TL;DR - Jealous ex gets sent to prison for sending new spouse crap in the mail.


Cheers for reading guys! 

~~I may have a look at writing up the story behind the Badmin situation if I can write the story in a decentish format.~~

:--|:--
[Noma and Mikkeller are probably the biggest names when it comes about the new wave in danish cooking &amp; drinking. What do you think about pairing craft beer with food (I know that you had a partnership with Mikkeller at Noma\)? Can the beer replace the wine as a companion of food? And how do you see this craft beer movement in Europe, because in US it is a phenomenon?  How did Noma managed to recover after the scandal from 2013, when over 60 people became sick after eating in your restaurant? Can a scandal like this ruin a 2 Michelin Star reputation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih8c7?context=5)|1) Here's a few: **San Sebastián**, as a destination in and of itself, it needs to be tried. Coming to **Copenhagen** in August or September when the game season starts is really nice, although Copenhagen is not at all on the same level culinary wise as San Sebastián. It's great to visit it now to see the beginning of something that's still quite new and fresh. Then there's also La Boqueria Market in **Barcelona**. Wine bar hopping in **Paris** (there's a real boom of small fresh wine bars popping up), kick the experience off at Chateaubriand or Verre Vole with a lunch or dinner and have them recommend the next places- have them pass on the baton (it's a good way to travel, by letting the locals decide).  2) The craft beer movement is a real phenomenon here and has been for the past ten years. I don't think that beer will replace wine but I do think it will be more present going forward. It's a phenomenon that I personally really like, to see a bigger range and diversity of beers.  3) I think any restaurant can get over a tough moment like that but you have to be totally honest and tell everything the way it is to the public. Don't try to hide any details. Then people will quickly see that it's a situation that's almost beyond any chef or restaurants control.
[As someone who himself staged at some of the best restaurants in the world, do you have any particular perspective that you would like to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih53m?context=5)|Hey there,
[On a similar note, what is the typical experience for a stagiere at Noma?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih53m?context=5)|1) I loved being a stagier myself, it was an opportunity to travel and learn without the grueling responsibilities of being a full time employee. Back when I did it it was on my spare time, unlike today where staging is usually part of school program and I don't see it going away anytime soon. I think that it's a good way for young chefs to get a taste of real kitchen work. We see that from time to time interns are surprised that the reality is so different from their ideals, what they see on television, or what they learn at school about professional kitchen life.
[Do you believe that this is something that is possible in every location, so long as one just looks hard enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih53m?context=5)|2) About foraging: to me it's an extraordinary way for a cook to connect themselves to the place they're in but roaming about and tasting the different seasons, the plants, the mushrooms, the berries, the leaves. Throughout the year you really get connected to the place. I believe there's a wealth of forgotten ingredients still, and I think it should be as normal as peeling carrots for any cook to be able to (responsibly) harvest things in the wild. 
[Hi René, I'm a huge fan with a few small questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|Hey!
[What's your favorite ingredient to use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|1) I don't actually have a favorite ingredient, but my favorite range would be anything from the plant kingdom.
[What are your favorite restaurants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|2) Again I don't have a favorite restaurant, but I enjoy any place where food is cooked with generosity and honesty.
[What cookbooks do you recommend if any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|3) If you're a budding chef then you should start by reading some of the classics, get a sense for sauce (or vinaigrette is), and after that head over to some of inspirational chefs of the world.
[What current big chefs are you a fan of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih7er?context=5)|4) There's too many to mention so I'll just focus on some of the up and coming ones: He may not be a -huge- world famous chef... yet, but Matt Orlando from restaurant Amass in Copenhagen ([Link to www.amassrestaurant.com](http://www.amassrestaurant.com/)) he is truly a talent and I love going to his restaurant. There's also Tatiana Levha from Paris, and the guys from Sixpenny in Australia. 
[Hello Rene, I am a very big fan of ours and I really hope that I will be able to visit your restaurant this year!  I have three questions to you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih4xc?context=5)|About the Michelin guide (or any rating system), that should really be a topic of its own because there's much to say-- to much for a quick answer! But basically if you go to work with accolades in mind as your primary motivation then I think you're on the road to a burnout. Go to work and find a way to make yourself happy in what you do. If the guides tap into it and like it then that's an added bonus.
[What is your opinion on the Michelin Guide and their rating system?   I’m coming from Poland and I read that you came a few years ago to my country with the Cook It Raw event.  How did you like Poland and our cusine?  And my last question how was the trip to Japan with the whole crew?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih4xc?context=5)|The trip to Japan was the biggest experience in my professional and private life. Being together with the team so intensely was inspiring and touching- even when I think of it just now I get the chills.
[Hi Chef, what's the best advice you have for someone who wants to quit their day job and go to culinary school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqiipgq?context=5)|A lot of my cooking friends would say don't: don't because you're going to work 85 hours a week for no money, you're going to have cuts all over your body, and the chance of frequent humiliation from some chef is almost 100%. Yet this is the trade that I totally love, and I don't know anything else. It is a lot of work, yes, but it is extremely gratifying in terms of teamwork and friendship, and the fact that you get to make people happy every day, twice a day. If you do it well you'll end up being part of a community of cooks from your restaurant, former cooks, the farmers, some of your regulars... it becomes special. Something I can't be without. 
[I’ll be at noma on May 22, but what is another restaurant in Copenhagen that you would highly recommend I try while I’m there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqihn27?context=5)|Hey there,
 |You should definitely try [Relae](http://www.restaurant-relae.dk/en/), and  [Amass](www.amassrestaurant.com). Besides that there's [Geranium](http://geranium.dk/) as another fine dining option, and also [Kadeau](http://www.kadeau.dk/kbh_english.php) (especially if you go to their second location which is on Bornholm island, a short 15 minute flight away). For more casual dining check out [Bror](http://www.restaurantbror.dk/), or for breakfast go to [Cafe det Vide Hus](https://www.facebook.com/detvidehus). [Democratic Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Democratic-Coffee/147810001973306?fref=ts) has the best croissant in town. 
[Hi Chef! when is it a good time for a cook to leave a restaurant for another one? 1year? 2 years? when he stops learning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqiicn5?context=5)|That's a good question! Me personally, I've only had a few jobs in my career. I've always stayed a while and each of the places I stayed in, there was more to learn. But a year is definitely the minimum if it's a place that follows the seasons and cooks up a full range of what's available... then you need a year to see everything, and in your second year you'll start to get more comfortable. We have people who have been in our kitchen for 7, 8, 9 years, and we're still all learning!
 |Find a place where they're really cooking and changing the menu and stay for a while. Stay for years. 
[Hi Chef Redzepi! You probably don’t remember me, but I took you to an espresso place with Lars in LA in 2012 to do some planning for food and science course at my university. I would just like to thank you for inspiring me to pursue a career in cooking instead of engineering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|Hey Chef Jon! Thank you for coffee-- did I ever say that? ;-)
[What was going on through your head when you met Jiro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|1) Meeting Jiro was truly nervewracking, I was awe-struck. Interesting note is that you're not supposed to shake his hand when meeting him because he doesn't want them polluted before touching the rice. I got to shake his hand though and as soon as I remembered I wasn't supposed to do that-- I almost shit myself, literally on the spot diarrhea. It's mindboggling to have two hours privately with a man that is full of wisdom the way he is.
[What’s the next step after Noma?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|2) I'm very happy in my situation doing Noma, the next step for me is doing the same, but better and better.
[What are some of your greatest failures and successes?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqih50m?context=5)|3) Too many failures to talk about. The biggest joy I have running Noma is seeing staff fueled and ready to attack the world!
[Hello Rene. I am fairly new to the industry. I've been cooking professionally for a little over two years without any prior education in the field. A year and a half in I landed a gig as the executive chef of a restaurant that had a poor reputation with food and a limited kitchen in the basement. Almost exactly a year later we are moving forward with building a brand new open kitchen upstairs and have become known as one of the best restaurants in our town and surrounding area. My two questions are: how have you dealt with success and maintained a level head? And what is your secret to keeping your staff happy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/338fd7/i_am_rené_redzepi_chef_owner_of_restaurant_noma/cqiho54?context=5)|1) Success is great but it comes with complications. Will you get absorbed in success and have that be your guiding light? Or will you just keep focused on why you entered cooking? Which for me was a wish to explore ingredients (and the seasons), be with people, and also because I love eating.
 |2) Keeping staff happy is also one of the keys to a great success and it's always hard striking that balance between a work with pressure and high intensity and also a good spirited, nurturing environment. It's difficult in the kitchen. But one thing you shouldn't do, and take this from a guy that's been a fucking lunatic for many of the opening years (at Noma): don't start shouting! It doesn't do anything good to your team or anybody else. Find a way to get your message through without being a fucking asshole. :)

I'm wrapping up my second year of a double mechanical/electrical major with a comp sci minor. 

I'm doing very well; finishing off this year with above a 3.8. However, I'm finding it very hard to find a company that will hire me.
I have plenty of electrical and mechanical experience as I did FIRST Robotics in high school and have two labs weekly. However, I've applied to over 40 places and have only heard back from 2. Many want a student who already has technical work experience.

So how am I supposed to get the first internship if no one will take me without previous intern experiences?

I appreciate any insight and help.
Others are free to post their work experiences also. I'd love to get some opinions.

Also, if there is a better subreddit to post in, just let me know.

I saw that a lot of STEM majors end up getting jobs outside of STEM, [according to this article](http://www.governing.com/news/headlines/gov-where-stem-graduates-are-finding-jobs.html). The article admits that the numbers might be skewed because the definition of a STEM job isn't very solid and other factors.

I tried what little advice I could find for people like me in this subreddit. I wasn't looking to apply to the Big 4 or that nonsense, but there were some useful tidbits here and there: Work on projects. Put them on GitHub. Post on LinkedIn and Dice. Get your resume checked.

He worked as an intern for about a month, getting to know the local systems, getting tested to see how he could handle hardware and to see what type of work he would be best suited for.


They soon found out that hardware wasn't a big strength of his and trained him for a while, but more importantly they promoted him to a development position where he would monitor company data as a sysadmin as well as develop new software. (The companies betting software was, at that time, mature at best)

Now he would monitor times for calls, data speeds, MB size of transmissions, heat readings for server rooms, log in times for employees as well as filters for the local internet. He even monitored cameras to the call center itself so he could see if there was a physical explanation for any anomalies.


Fortunately a lot of the work was run by well made, audio alerting scripts that made some humorous alerts (If there was a download cap was broken at a computer, they had Nelly's 'Hot in here' play or if one of the staff was locked out of their accounts, the system rang out saying 'Unlock the door, open the latch' in an automated voice) so most of Shane's work involved developing the new software.


However, Shane was the inquisitive type and noted a couple of anomalies that weren't picked up by scripts and yet would still look ok if you didn't look too deeply.


The first matter that came to attention was the filter system, now GamblingHQ had an internet filter system that worked on keywords showing up. I.e xxx, games, computer programming and so on.


But more importantly, **the filter was calibrated for each specific member of staff**. 


Now the frontline staff taking bets all had a blanket ban on most obvious sites but they could put in requests with their manager for access to certain sites once they passed the 2 month internship and were made permanent. I.e They could request access to Reddit for example.


And these access changes could be made by managers as well as IT staff. If you've read the previous story, you know where I'm going with this. Remember how staff were fired if there were too many hits on the filter, whether they were explainable or not?

Well Shane had a look through the filter logs and spotted that a set of specific staff were having their filter's keywords altered in a way that would make it next to impossible not to trigger the filter. 

Keep in mind, this is a betting company, they took bets on Horse Racing, Football, Basketball, Tennis and any other list of bets you want to make.

**The keywords were being changed to football result pages for certain staff or for Basketball team names. It would even generate hits on the sites own website**




Shane checks the logs for previous employees and soon noticed a pattern emerging, the changes were coming from two main managers, lets call them Wilma and Wendy (not their real names obviously), and he recalled that those two managers werent very fond of the agents that are having their filters changed.


He believes that the two managers are changing filters so employees they dont like are removed from their jobs, but of course, he was fired from their call center, it could be seen as a conflict of interest. **Furthermore, Wilma was the manager who originally gave him his marching orders.**


So he goes to his boss (first rule of IT: Cover your ass and document everything) and explains the situation and says that he wants to run an audit of all call center managers e-activity, not just the two floor managers. He believed that there may be more than just the filters that were being changed.

Fortunately, the log system was very comprehensive throughout the building, they had logs for call times, when you log in, when you use your access card, who you've called, your hours worked, every and any bit of data, that went through a computer or server on the public network was logged. The company was very cautious over records as they had been sued before over betting issues.


*And just in case you're wondering, all of the staff were aware of most of the logs, a few of the new staff didnt know their access card use was logged but that was about it.*

So an audit request was sent through, it took about a week for clearance as all managers had to be made aware of the audit and some reports had to be signed off on as they dealt with sensitive informations i.e Pay, Address, hours, disciplinary reports and so on.

But soon, more than a few patterns were emerging involving a group of 5 people.

* Wilma and Wendy: The floor managers. Mgt1 + Mgt2.
* The accounting manager, we'll name her GinnyAC. 
* One of the frontline staff, we'll call him DeanFL.
* One of the HR managers in charge of both hiring and dismissals, Amos. HRD.

What were the patterns? The log in times didnt match, filters were changed consistantly, staff were working suspiciously long hours and making large bonuses for good statistics and an embezzlement scheme was shown that in a period of 2 and a half years, **more than 200,000 euro was stolen from the company and over 37 staff may have been unfairly dismissed.**

&gt; Shane: Hey boss, come check these figures, there are huge discrepancies here.
&gt; Bossman: Oh oh is the system auto locking again?
&gt; Shane: Just come look...

TL:DR Gandalf is reborn as Gandalf the White and comes back to fight his old foes the Balrog and his Uruk-Hai for one last battle, what happens to the beasts is yet unknown.......

I have been in IT for about two years, my first year was in an internship, which I enjoyed but there was alot of down time and felt I didnt learn much hands on. After the internship I landed a pretty decent job as a network admin. But to be honest my job duties feels alot like technical support. On top of that there is alot of down time as well (find myself bored). I do study on my down time and have built a few labs, but to me thats not the same as hands on type of stuff.
I am starting to look for a job, if I look for a similar job title, the scope of the work they require is above me. So should I look technical support job or a help desk?? When I do look at these I feel like I am over qualified and will not learn anything.
Its like im stuck somewhere in the middle and don't know which route to take. I would even take a pay cut if it allowed me to learn and grow my knowledge.
Do I take a step back to help desk or a noc position and hope I can climb the ranks there?"

339wkw,16,2015-04-20,[Tinfoil hat post] Something abnormal I've been noticing at College Confidential.,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/339wkw/tinfoil_hat_post_something_abnormal_ive_been/,"What if, just what if, there is a large-scale conspiracy at CollegeConfidential.com. We've all had our motivation crushed at one point because we came across a post where a kid with a 36 ACT, 4.0 GPA, multiple international awards, and published papers asks whether he can get into his local college that has an acceptance rate of 85%. But what if it's just a huge hoax to stop somewhat qualified people to applying to selective schools? I've noticed a few, somewhat suspicious trends there...

Firstly, the awards people say they gotten are vague or just outside-the-ones-that-get-listed-online that verification is almost always impossible. Go check out the SCEA results of [MIT](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/massachusetts-institute-technology/1717092-mit-class-of-2019-ea-results-thread.html) or [Harvard](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/harvard-university/1714730-official-harvard-university-2019-scea-decisions-only.html). Look through them and try to look up their awards. Nada. I've only came across ~~one~~ two students that had their award come up on the Internet. 

Another trend I've been noticing is the lack of a distinct standard distribution. I see three types of people that say they've gotten accepted (well actually four but I'll get to that). The first type is the person with about a 2200 SAT, a 3.9ish GPA and a state prize and a few internships; the type of student that you say ""Oh! Wow!"" to but not “holy shit you’re probably an alien”. The second type is the person who has been the secretary of a senator, 4.0 GPA, 2400 SAT with 4 SAT Subject Tests over 780, a few publications in Scientific Journals and placed 4th or 5th in National competitions and got accepted. Basically a person that you cannot comprehend how they're not giving ted-talks. And finally the third type: the type of person that beat the first type in almost everything but didn't get in. This type has stats slightly lower than type 2 but much higher than type 1. Why did they get rejected instead of the group 1ers?

Another thing I noticed is the people precisely fitting, and exaggerating, racial stereotypes. They are either Asians with REALLY higher scores, basically like the people in group 2 but that have gotten rejected. Another common reoccurrence I see is African-American/black people with REALLY low scores that have gotten accepted. Are these stereotypes sometimes true? Yes but The GPAs to acceptance for different races aren’t as dramatic as CC posts show them to be. Just check the Decisions threads and you'll probably see this. A few students claimed to have SAT scores of under 1800 and mediocre extra curricular activities but yet claim to have gotten into Princeton, all of them claiming to be black. Also, in another thread, an Asian with jaw dropping everything didn't get into a single school, and got wait-listed at Hopkins. Check the treads out and you'll see quite a few examples of this.

And lastly, when results threads are posted in smaller sub-forums, the thread starts with a lot of group 1ers then evolves into the classic overtake of the thread by group two and three-ers. Check our results threads in the India or Canada sub-forum for example; you’ll see this trend. 

Cunning tactics are nothing new to selective college additions; there have been an uncountable number of acceptance scandals; people paying to get their essay written, bribing councilors, cheating on the SAT… there has literally been a scandal for every single thing that carries weight on college additions, so why not a little forum manipulation to discourage qualified applicants in both themselves and the application process? I haven’t slept in like two days so this might just be the rambling of a sleep deprived brain rapped in aluminum foil but what do you think? Have you noticed anything like this?


**TLDR: Maybe there is a large-scale conspiracy on collegeconfidential.com trying to discourage qualified applicants from applying by making it seem harder than it is and to make people lose trust in the application system**

Some background: I have an engineering degree in an unrelated field from one of the best schools in Canada. Shortly after graduating I started regretting the discipline I chose, and as I'd always found programming interesting and enjoyable I decided to enroll in a second bachelors. I transferred most of my first year credits(intro to compsci/some math courses), and just finished two semesters of full course load. 

Some of the technically relevant courses I took are:
A still relatively introductory CS course (Python)
A more advanced software dev course (Java/Android)
A course in computer organization

Originally I was planning on not looking for a coop or internship until after second year, but my financial situation has taken a turn for the worst and I've started considering my options. Is an internship at this stage of my education a realistic option?

I feel very comfortable with data structures, basic algorithms, and was planning on working through Cracking The Coding interview over the summer, as well as starting up on CLRS (recommended by some upper year friends). I read somewhere when searching for related questions that a sign of being ready is ability to do well in an interview, if I have a good grasp of the more common questions do I have a chance, or will my lack of experience in actual applications of computer science fail me.

I don't have any personal projects outside of coursework, as I was planning on using this coming summer to start up on some ideas I have. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I've searched a lot for a Q/A that has addressed the finer points of what I'm asking (having a previous degree) and couldn't find. Would appreciate any insight anyone can provide to someone new to the industry/scene!"

To quote Forrest Gump: “I am not a smart man.” At least I wasn’t in high school. I was lazy, unmotivated, and had a bad attitude. I was more interested in playing videogames and partying than studying. Unfortunately this was a trend that continued through most of undergrad. I didn’t have any career prospects. I was premed and then ended up prelaw. I eventually graduated with a liberal arts degree with a mediocre 2.8 gpa. It wasn’t until senior year that I started to get my act together. After a graduation and six months of unemployment, I decided to take some graduate business courses. I did well and managed to get accepted in my schools MBA program. The acceptance rate was 18% - I consider myself quite lucky.

All my hopes, aspirations, raw ambition, competitiveness, business acumen, et cetera – it all started coalescing in graduate school. Business school was a cathartic experience. Honestly, I am disgusted by the person I used to be. I’m a new man now, a better man. B-school was a very successful endeavor for me. I was awarded one of my university’s highest accolades – the congressional internship and scholarship. I lived in DC and worked full-time in the US House.  It was one of the greatest learning experiences of my life.  I finished my MBA and got a job as a Commercial Credit Analyst for a mid-sized community bank in Lubbock, TX. It’s a long story, but my ex gf and I finished our master degrees at the same time. She wanted me to stay and eventually get married.  I turned down several great jobs in Dallas. Big mistake because we broke up three months later… I left my job, moved to Austin and got another Commercial Credit Analyst position – this time with a much larger bank. I enjoy the work. I’ve learned more about finance and accounting than I ever thought possible in school. I have over a year of financial analysis experience now, three if you count grad school.

Credit is one of the central pillars of the economy and it’s given me a very diverse and quantitative set of skills. However, I’m far more interested in areas more aligned with investment banking – equities, sales &amp; trading, hedge funds… I get far more excited about financial markets and macroeconomic events than commercial lending.  I definitely do NOT want to become a lender. I’m not sure where to go from here. I want to make the transition but I don’t know where to start.  I wasn’t one of those driven academics in undergrad – the ones who graduated with multiple internships and knew what they wanted in life, and how to achieve it. How do I compete with that? I feel like my academic past is a huge albatross around my neck.  It seems like regardless of my personal victories and growth as a professional adult, I’m still haunted by my past. How do I convince people do give me a chance? How do I get past my crummy background? I welcome any and all advice.  It’s greatly appreciated.

Sorry for the length.  I definitely was not trying to write a sequel to “Ulysses.”

33bgwe,2,2015-04-21,"Back to school for second degree in CS; working full-time, would love some advice on BS vs. MS, value of internships",gw2380,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33bgwe/back_to_school_for_second_degree_in_cs_working/,"Quick background on me; I graduated from with a BSBA from a pretty good state university in 2003. I blew off college for a number of reasons, and didn't really think through what I wanted to do with my life (sounds dumb now, but didn't put much thought into it then). Skipped my way through classes towards a 2.30 GPA.

Since then I have been working in marketing for a variety of companies. I fell into this profession because I have a bit of a background in doing things like graphic design, web design, etc. on my own. I've done okay - I make a comfortable living at 30 at around $50k, and could continue down this career path and end up doing well for myself.

That said, in September of 2013, on a trip to see my sister graduate top of her class from one of the top law schools in the country, my girlfriend and I had a long conversation about life, which ended up with me realizing that I wasn't doing something I really loved. I felt that whereas my sister had a career and accomplishments that she was truly proud of and had worked for, I had lacked the vision and drive until that point to achieve that. Until that point, I'm not sure I had ever really had more than a fleeting thought of what it was that I really wanted to do with my life. In the back of my mind, I had always kicked around the idea that I should have worked in Computer Science - logic, mathematics and computing are three things that I would say I am very skilled in. I decided that day that I wanted to go back to school for a second degree, bust my ass towards a top GPA and honors, and get a job that I loved doing. I enrolled in January of 2014.

I'm proud to say that I have accomplished my goals so far. I'm around halfway through my degree program with a 4.0/4.0 GPA. I've found a passion for programming, and have really felt like I have made a great choice. That said, while my situation is not entirely unique, it is different enough that I have had a hard time finding advice.

My first question: I work full-time at a job that will have little to no overlap with my new career. However, it is a low-stress job that pays fairly well, I enjoy my work and my coworkers, and I get five weeks of vacation a year which has helped immensely with having to take off for finals, for random study days, etc. My current plan is to graduate in December 2016. It seems that internships are very important to working in the CS field. Would it be to my best benefit to leave my current place of employment in Summer 2016, work the summer as an intern, take a final semester of school in Fall 2016, and then look for jobs upon graduation that December? 

My second question: My school offers an option for those who have had a previous undergraduate degree to skip the BSCS and go for an MSCS with high marks in certain courses. I’m fairly confident I should fit that, but I am worried that applying for jobs as someone with a BSBA, little to no practical work experience, and an MSCS will leave me as a weird profile and I will struggle to find jobs. I’m not sure the payoff is worth it, especially since the school I am attending is probably on the below average to average end of state schools.

I appreciate any insight any of you can offer. I think I'm on the right track but want to make sure I'm not making any missteps here. "
33bmi7,0,2015-04-21,Projects and Trendy Technologies,curiouscat321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33bmi7/projects_and_trendy_technologies/,"It's pretty common fact on this sub that projects help get jobs and internships. Jobs and internships look for experience - that means either a previous job or some kind of project. What isn't common fact are the types of technologies and projects that you should be building.
   
   
I firmly believe that projects built with trendy technologies look far better on a resume than those built with older technologies. First, I want to prove to all of you that this is true:

   
1. Shows that you keep up with industry news
2. Shows passion towards keeping up with the industry
3. Shows you're capable of teaching yourself (older tech can be more easily taught because more people know it).
4. Shows you can build something with the knowledge you've acquired and aren't just relying on libraries or regurgitating code from slides.

Now, what constitutes a trendy technology? Ideally, this is a well-known piece of the stack that is still fairly new, has momentum behind it, and is being used by large companies. Here's some examples:

* Node
* Python (Python is great, some of the libraries, like Django are on the edge)
* Ruby, Rails (on the edge)
* Backbone.JS, Angular, React, Javascript 
* iOS / Android , if sufficiently complex
* Haskell
* Golang
* Rust
* Docker

What doesn't count?

* C#, .NET, Microsoft stack
* Java, JREE, JDK, Other J-words in caps
* COBOL, FORTRAN
* SQL ( on its own)


If you think of others or are unsure, feel free to post them. We can make our best guesses.

Basically, list any technology that has been on the front page of Hacker News for the past month or so. Those are the trendy technologies. 

All of these have enough documentation and online tutorials that you should be able to learn what you need to learn.

Now, what is a good project? There's a million ideas out there and don't be afraid to steal or rebuild the wheel. The ideal project should have the following things:

* **Shippable!** Startups especially really care if you've shipped code (put it online, in a package manager, or on an app store). It shows you can follow through to completion of a project.
* **Easy to explain the technical side at a high level.** There's a fine line to walk between explaining something and making it sound trivial or not explaining how technical it is. Use the technologies to describe the project. Say things such as ""Used React to format the data of a Mongo db"" or something like that. Don't talk about individual functions. Make it somewhat clear that you understand the technology and aren't wowed by simple things.
* **Not too academic.** Don't make your projects sound like class projects. Class projects are sort of frowned upon because they don't show one's ability to program. Don't talk about textbook algorithms you've implemented or the specific data structures you've used. 
* **Full-stack.** If possible, try to show that you have some breadth in your project. That's why websites are so cool. You get to go from rendering HTML all the way to grabbing information from a database/API. Basically, don't just build one part - just the views of a mobile app or just the database of a website. 
* **It doesn't have to be polished or launched** If you've worked on it, put it down. I know, this goes against the first bullet. But, many companies don't care entirely if something has shipped and nobody cares if it isn't polished to full professionalism. Something is way better than a to-do.

Let me know if anybody has any questions! I really feel that side projects have gotten me to where I am, so I'm glad to help!

I appreciate the help you have given me in the past.

I am a 19 year old university student in an accounting program. I have fairly good grades (~3.4), a lot of volunteering and club involvement, and a lot of sports stuff (soccer and running). Plus I am studying abroad this summer, and have an interview for a dream internship that I am hoping to land. My business school basically has a case competition team that travels to compete with the best schools on the east coast. Basically, after contemplating whether or not I wanted to do it, I tried out and didn't make it.

This personally made me feel awful. I felt like I did really well in the interview (aced both logic questions), and I also did my best to make a good impression on the professor and captains of the ""team."" It's not like all the people that did make the team have internships at goldman sachs and 3.9 GPA's, hell, I have better marks than probably half of them. What hurts is that it feels like this is someone saying ""you're not good enough."" How am I supposed to have a successful career when I can't even make a stupid case team that you do for FREE??

These events lead me to have a lot of emotions. On the one hand, I took it gracefully and thanked them for their consideration, etc. I can still join the debate or sports section of the business competition, I just didn't make the academics side. Conversely, I have a feeling of rage towards the people that 1. made the team over me 2. didn't pick me. This leads me to have nasty thoughts about how I'm better than them because of all these egotistical and elitist reasons like looks or my family's social standing.

So clearly I can't handle defeat. It just hurts when you're basically rejected, especially since most of my peers who tried out made the team. I took a personality test for this class once and it said ""competitiveness"" was my most prevalent trait. The strange thing is that most people wouldn't know that I'm such a competitive person, I guess I just don't show it and it eats away at me."

I have 1 year till graduating and this is thus my last opportunity of doing an summer internship. I wish to work in the banking sector later on, with analysis and technical work involving a lot of programming and mathematics (a quant if you really want to use that label). 

 &amp;nbsp;



I have been offered and accepted an internship position as a electrical market analysts at my countries biggest energy company. The position would involve computing regressive analysis and using optimization models. I have done some courses in optimization but did not find it to stimulating. I figured this job would help me gain some knowledge in analysis and optimization.  I have accepted the offer in an email but have not yet signed a contract. I told the recruiter I had an other interview upcoming and asked for some time before I accepted or rejected the offer, but they wanted me to answer on the spot. As I did not have any suitable offers at the time, I accepted. 

&amp;nbsp;




The other offer is a summer internship program at a large commercial bank. I will be doing risk calibrations from a large quantity of different data and learn tons of how to apply my math skills in practise. This summer job is more in line with what I want to do in the future than the one at the energy company. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am planning on calling the first company and explain in some way I have gotten an other offer I would rather take than their one. What is the protocoll for doing this? Is this acceptable? What job would you recommend for me, given my aspirations?

I'd grateful for any advice! Thank you in advance!

So I'm a Junior CS student who has missed out on Summer internships so far. I have a Web Developer job which is great but its mainly Wordpress and I'm needing some real programming experience.  I recently got an email about this ""opportunity"":

I'm looking for 4-6 programmers to work on an app for the IOS and Andriod platforms. The work itself is not complicated, as all of the facets of the app have been done before in various programs. Target launch date would be mid to late summer, earlier if possible but before the start of fall semester in order to work out any bugs before the heavy use begins. Target audience would be college students and young adults in densely populated areas. Compensations for work is a share of the company. Details will be disclosed after an intellectual property agreement has been signed. I am hoping to conduct interviews as soon as possible.

Do you guys think it would be worth going for something like this? Its not paid but the experience could be worth it? I'm sure the ""share of the company"" is complete bullshit but I really need some kind of internship experience developing software. Should I say screw it and keep applying elsewhere?

I'm looking to transition into a career in programming, but I do have an existing well-paying job that I don't want to completely compromise. The schedule is 9-5 and that's creating some issues.

The college I'm attending currently places students in internships based on their resume and qualifications. I have maintained a 4.0 so I figured I would be in good shape to land a position. I was unfortunately told there are no internships available that fit around my existing work schedule. 

I have also contacted several companies on my own based on their internship listings and thus far the conflict of hours has been an issue with each one. Should I turn my attention to side-projects instead? I assume on-the-job experience will be crucial since I don't have a BS in the field.

**Things I like:**

* I enjoy building things from the ground up: planning, design, implementation, shipping.
* I enjoy highly visible projects.
* This means I've gravitated towards mobile apps or building small websites. 
* I've been teaching myself AWS for mobile app support as well.
* I really enjoy mentoring students and interns. 

**Things I don't like:**

* I find making not very visible contributions to a large system less rewarding. 
* Management, while lucrative, strikes me as draining. 
* Balancing customer requests with developer skills and traits, hiring/firing, keeping people happy while extracting as much work from them looks stressful.
* Job insecurity. 

**Therefore, I've set this as my goal:** 

1. Gain as much experience in building applications and programs from start to finish in the next 3ish years. 

2. Start a consulting/contracting business on the side. 

3. If I get enough side work, switch to contracting full time.

What sort of role would 4) be? What sort of preparations can I make now that would make getting into that role easier later?

I've received and accepted an internship offer with a company that works on a military base. This was about 3 weeks ago and since then I have been interviewing at several other places in anticipation of my record preventing me from working there. Since then, I've received 3 other offers (one of which I decided to inform the HR of my background ahead of time to get an immediate answer). The military base background investigation sounds like it has barely even started, the first steps going on later this week. Company B has an *outstanding* offer and wants to know my decision by the end of this week. My question is, considering I already started filling out the application and employment forms for the on-base internship, what would you do in my situation? Company B has a background investigation of their own as well, but given the company has about 20 employees, I feel it might be more lenient.

The situation really is quite depressing and a huge let-down every time it prevents me from pursuing something. If I don't end up being able to follow through with any position this Summer, I think I'm going to give up on internships until it's expunged from my record. I don't want to get to the front door of several companies for them to have in their records I was rejected as the result of a background check. Do you guys feel this is probably best?

Thanks a ton for your advice everybody.

A side-note: Since the event I've been unable to work at 3 different locations, one of which was a pretty large company. If you're over 18, and plan on looking for a job anytime soon, stay away from cannabis or be ***very*** careful with it. "

I don't live with my parents as I'm away for college but my mail gets delivered to my parents house. 

Fast forward about two months- February. I get pulled over. 
Officer: ""your car is coming up uninsured.""
Me: ""are you sure, it's been insured since December *hands insurance*""
Officer: ok I took a look at it and called your insurance company, seems like there was an error in communicating with the DMV and they told me it got squared away. 
*lets me go, no biggie*

About two weeks later, same situation, I tell the officer my car is insured, it seems like my insurance company didn't contact the DMV like they were supposed to. 


Two weeks later again, I get pulled over, this time I get a ticket for Driving with a suspended license because of an uninsured vehicle. After your car is uninsured for so long for failing to provided proof of insurance, yet still registered, they suspended your license. 

I immediately contact the DMV and after waiting some four hours on the phone got my license restored right on the phone. 

I went to court today for the suspended driving ticket and found out that in NJ it is a $560 mandatory fine and 6 months mandatory suspension of license for driving on a suspended license. 
Nearly shitting my pants at this point because if I lose my license I can't afford to work at the internship I worked so hard to get into. 

The judge says that I should have came to court with the restoration letter. But my parents house never received a restoration letter. 
Nevertheless, I plead not guilty, and that I am representing myself on trial. 
Judge said to come back with the restoration letter. 

I am now waiting for my trial date, and probably going to be on the phone with the DMV for a couple of hours just so that they can send that stupid letter again. 

My insurance card says that my car was completely insured every time I've been stopped, it's valid from December to June. Additionally, it's a lump sum payment so my car didn't all of a sudden become uninsured because of delinquent payments. 

What do you guys think? Think I'm pretty much screwed?

33enr6,12,2015-04-21,Should I leave my job at a startup?,csthrowaway6554643,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33enr6/should_i_leave_my_job_at_a_startup/,"I'm asking this because I'm becoming increasingly disillusioned with the startup I joined right out of college. Problem is that, being my first real job (excluding internships), I don't know if my experience is normal or not.

After graduation I did some contract work for a startup that was in its very early stages. Long story short, I ended up sticking with the company as the first engineer. I accepted a small amount of equity in the company in exchange for a salary ~35% under market value for the area with no other benefits (health, bonuses, etc.). With the understanding that my salary would increase to market rate once the company had raised funding which it had plans to do in a few months time. Please don't tell me this was a bad decision; I already know that. I'm looking to mitigate damage at this point.

The company was doing well enough to continue operating without needing to inject investor capital so the decision was made to hold off on doing a seed round. It's been almost a year now and I have not received a salary bump or more equity and the plans for raising funding are continually delayed since it is not needed to keep the company moving forward. The opportunity cost of this for me is huge.

On one hand, I work from home 95% of the time which is a big plus for me and as the only engineer, most engineering decisions are left to me. The future of company appears stable so I also know there is potential for me to be in a leadership role as the team grows. However, as of late, the founders and I clash over various topics on a nearly daily basis, I don't get to work on the stuff I want to work on and think is important, and feel as though I'm simply an assistant for the one founder to get his work done with constant ""urgent"" feature requests around stuff that is more IT management than actually working on our product.

Is this just the way software engineering jobs are? Or is this a toxic environment I should get out of? I'm generally increasingly unhappy with the way things are here, but I don't know if it's actually bad or just the usual ""I dislike my job"" feelings everyone gets. Is it time to leave or should I stick it out?"

Anything will help and if you can only answer one or two that's completely fine I'm just happy to hear anything. I will try to organize the questions into sections so if you can only answer one section or graze through and pick a few that is fine.

Also I plan on posting this on a few subreddits just to try and hear back as much feedback as I can, I apologize if you see it pop up on several subreddits you are subscribed to.

**Average day:**

* Do you get to work from home very much if at all?
* If you are going to the office, do you get to dress casual or in a suit style?
* Do you have a “cheat sheet” of sorts or do you just have to memorize most of what you use? Also a side question, how many different commands do you use in a normal day (a lot or a few)?
* How often do you work with your team compared to alone coding?
* Do you normally enjoy your job?
* Just what is your average day working like?

**Education and getting a job:**

* Where could someone like me be able to learn a lot online (hopefully for free)?
* How do I actually go ask for an internship do companies have an application form or something?
* People love these huge universities and talk about how great it looks to go to a well known one, but how much does that actually matter? 
* Most colleges say they have a great technical program, but where actually does have a program that can benefit me greatly in my job.
* How hard would you say it is for an average programmer to get a job?
* I have heard that large gaming companies have a bad rep, why is that and would you say that not working for them is suggested?

Maybe I could go back to uni but I feel like there's just no work anywhere. I don't want to spend another 3 or 4 years at school and still not be able to find work. I just have no idea what to do and I'm sick of people asking me about it. "

I haven't done anything here. I've been given an assignment, and I'm not far at all on it. I feel so pathetic since its a relatively simple task. I keep asking questions and trying to get where I need to be-but I'm falling short each time. Further, its like I'm not actually doing the assignment, but rather the people I'm asking are(more on this).

So with that, my day also isn't very productive. I do maybe about 2 hours of work--MAYBE. The rest of the time I'm trying to teach myself things about the company, learn how they are doing other work(not related to my tasks), and general reading/asking questions. Makes me feel unproductive. Now, I've asked for more work, but I can see the hesitation in my boss's eyes because I'm not versed in this engineering discipline so it will take a lot of work to get me up to speed. 


Now, back to my assignments. I ask for a lot of help. Even on the most basic stuff. I'm trying to learn, but at the end of the day it seems like I'm just transcribing things that my coworkers have said. I feel like they are doing the real work here. I'm also always asking for review of my work. Always. I'm not sure if I should be, but I always do, and there is always mistakes. 

Further, there's two other interns. Both are masters graduates, and this is their second internship(different companies) and I am always bugging them for help. I ask them all the time for review and things since they work on similar tasks. I feel bad because I'm eating up a lot of their time, and then they even present things very professionally and mine are sloppy. Everyone likes them.

And that's another thing. I don't think anyone likes me. I feel like they think all I do is sit around-true, but still. To add to that, I'm the only one who hasn't been invited to any social event that they've had. I'm also trying to fit in but when I talk or make a joke(similar to the ones made) it falls very very flat. My boss doesn't really like me. I know he's disappointed in my progress. I know he wants me to be better in meetings and presentations but I let him down every time.




Sorry for the long post its just how I'm feeling. I'm going to get a bad review for sure. I'm assigned relatively simple tasks but the subjects are things I've never seen. I spend a lot of the day circling around reading, and then confusing myself. I ask a lot but then feel like I'm not doing the work but rather the people I'm asking are. My assignments have been torn apart before and I'm reworking them. I just don't know, I'm not productive, I haven't done much, I don't spend my time well, etc.

Feels good to let it out, but I'm looking for any advice?"
33fn3l,3,2015-04-21,I need help choosing my future for the next four years and possibly beyond.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/33fn3l/i_need_help_choosing_my_future_for_the_next_four/,"Hello Reddit, I need your help. I have been accepted into two colleges in the US, [Gettysburg College](http://www.gettysburg.edu/) and the more well-known [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/). My problem is that I cannot decide which college I want to attend. To better inform you, heres a breakdown of the facts -

______________

My major- Computer Science.


Gettysburg - 5 hours from home and will cost around 16,000$ (which my parents will be paying in full) a year after I received a 44,000$ grant from them. A great school for history related majors, and is ranked among the top liberal arts schools in the nation. Attending this school will leave me with no debt after college, but could be harder to find a higher paying job with a degree from here. The starting salary of a Gettysburg graduate is about 55,000.

 

NYU - Only an hour from home, but will cost me personally 28,000$ and thus will leave me 113,000$ in debt after college. The benefits are the amazing experience of living in NYC during college, the internship opportunities, and the chance of getting a very high paying job immediately after my graduation. The average starting salary of a NYU graduate is 75,000.


My ideas- I love NYU and would go there in a heartbeat if the price was lower. Gettysburg is also a very nice school, and I think I could be happy there, but NYU is my dream school. 


_______________


So my question to you is, does it really make sense to go to NYU instead of Gettysburg? Does the NYU degree really make up for all of the debt? What should I do?

Thank you for all of your help!"

33hhlx,2,2015-04-22,Small Engineering business looking for a file serve system,Harshdog,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/33hhlx/small_engineering_business_looking_for_a_file/,"Hello All,

I am an intern at a small engineering consulting company and the boss put me on the task to find a better solution for handling our files than what we're using now. 

Firstly I'll begin by explaining a little on the type of work we do and the ecosystem of the office. 

We are a small start up company with about 15 engineers. Around half the engineers are veterans of the business and are very good at what they do. We primarily do work in the heavy industrial department like cement plants. We all use Autodesk software so there are a lot of dwg and pdf files floating around. Since there are only 15 of us we are pretty good about communicating with each other about who has what file open, so there haven't been many issues with project files getting overwritten and such. 

Now, here's where the problem is. We are using Dropbox as our file server.. Yes.. And whats worse is the fact that we're using a single user account to sync across all of the computers in the office... What??

It actually Isn't horrible but it definitely causes a lot of frustration as you can imagine. 

The main problem we have is due to the sync time when pulling a file from the cloud. We tried to have our PC's in continuous sync but then we fill up our local drives with unnecessary data. 
I'm surprised we made is this long actually. 

Ok, so a little about my own background. I'm the intern in training to eventually become an engineer. I have pretty extensive knowledge in terms of computer hardware. I run my own side business building high-end workstations and gaming desktops. I've actually built most of our workstations here at the office. I worked for a while assembling server hardware for AT&amp;T for a few months when I was younger. The only problem is I lack knowledge on the software side of things when it comes to file serving, file check-in check-out systems..etc. 

Anyways, we need some sort of system for serving our files but we're not ready for a full blown server. I have been researching NAS options as well as other cloud services such as SharePoint online. A NAS seems to be a pretty good option for the office but two of my coworkers occasionally work away from the office when traveling and they need remote access to some of the files. 

Just hoping to get some suggestions on what route to take. 
revision control would be a plus but I'ts not entirely needed. 
Again the main issues are having to pull files from the cloud just to work on them is a hassle and the need for remote access for those of us that work away from the office. 

How well do the Synology NAS systems work? 
Sharepoint Online?

Any suggestions are appreciated,

Thanks "

I normally don't like to post kind of thing but my current job has me on edge and I would really like some advice / input on my current career situation. Basically, I have been working in operations as a production supervisor for 2 years and the gig is wearing me out to the point where i am to look at other career paths 

To begin, I graduated in 2013 with a nontraditional engineering degree from a Big Ten School (think industrial engineering or an engineering/supply chain hybrid) and got a job immediately after school as a production supervisor. At the time i wanted to jump into an engineering role but for most industrial engineering positions I understood that 2 years of production experience was typically necessary before moving into an engineering position so I accepted the production supervisor role with that ultimate goal in mind. Since then I have worked for 2 different companies as a production supervisor since then and I feel like the gig is killing me.  

What bugs me the most about the job is the stress associated with getting more product out the door (at the expense of employees) coupled unpredictable hours and varied working hours. It kills me that i need to force employees to work 3 or 4 16 hour days in a row just to meet a production demand and it kills me that I will get berated and chewed out from my bosses for not having an ideal production run due to a mechanical failure that i have no control over. When I do have time to recharge I often have to come in for an hour or two on my day off to help with training exercises because it is on a regular workday and the rest of the world is running like normal. I dread going into work on ""Monday"" and I am honestly scared about what all the stress and off shift work (mostly 3rd) is doing to my health. Recently my boss told me I am not cutting it at work so I am taking as a sign that I need to start looking at other opportunities come October when my 1 year moving commitment is burned up. I am grateful to have a good paying and reputable job where I can grow and learn but  I want to find a less stressful / more work-life balance oriented position that might be a better fit for me. 

So Reddit anyone have any insights to a potential career change for someone with 2 years of manufacturing leadership experience in the food industry +1 year of internships as an industrial engineer? Currently I am not the best gear head in the world but I feel like I am a good people person and enjoy working as a member of a team where i can feed off the energy of my teammates. I don't mind being on the road for work or away from family or friends if I believe my job is a good fit so moving is always on option for me.  Personally I have thought about getting some formal education in software development and going down the computer science route but I thought i would see what else anyone may have to suggest

Appreciate any input!

Hello Mr.Wojcik and Ms. Seay, 

I was excited to see your listing for an intern at Wojcik | Seay Casting on Playbill.com, as I am pursuing a career in casting, and looking for a company that I can grow with.  

While interning at Binder Casting, I was responsible for the daily operations of a busy office. I was tasked with scheduling auditions, preparing audition materials, and handling all calls and emails for the office. In addition, I worked as a monitor for many of their larger auditions, including; The Lion King, Dames At Sea, and The Little Mermaid (tour).

I also assisted Mikie Heilbrun and Alison Goodman at the CW during the several months of its bustling pilot season. I was given the ability to observe sessions and read with talent, which helped me learn about working with clients on a more personal level.

I believe I would make a passionate and dedicated member of your team. I have included a copy of my resume for your review. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss my background in greater detail with you over the telephone or in a personal interview. I will follow up with you in a few days to answer any preliminary questions you may have. In the meantime, you may contact me at the number or email listed above.

Kindest Regards,

I have taken an intro course in C++, am familiar with Python, and am going to take a Data structures course this summer in Java (which I audited last year).

I still feel so incompetent to even undergrad CS majors because I don't have the same background as they do. However, working full time in a career path I don't like saps up all my time in the day. I just feel very overwhelmed and unprepared. Any advice, help, or criticism is welcome."

Company A:

1. Subsidiary of ""tier 2"" company (one of the companies: Redfin, Zillow, Expedia, Kayak, Trulia)
2. Subsidiary is &gt; 5 years old and is decently reputable  
3. Will be doing EXACTLY what I want to be doing when I graduate
4. Only con is that a good portion of it is built on PHP
5. Salary: a few dollars per hour less than LinkedIn without free housing

The team I am on in LinkedIn is pretty interesting too. I would rate it a 7/10 where 10 is my interest level for the project of company A. 

My goal is to either get into Google (doing anything) or one of the 2nd tier companies on a team doing what I will be doing at Company A when I graduate. 


Would you guys choose LinkedIn or Company A?

I went to a job fair on Monday to see if I could get myself an internship over the summer. I received an email for an interview for a possible internship. The one of the internships offered require experience in Python and Unix shell scripting. I have the experience in Python but I have never coded for Linux machines. The other internship offered requires experience in Java; I took a course in high school but I am pretty rusty. Where are the best places to learn Java and Unix shell scripting?

With Ohio State, however, I would graduate almost debt free (Scholarships and money from parents/grandparents). My plan for the future is to do internships to gain work experience so I can find a job right out of college. I can't decide if the program and internships at Purdue is worth upwards of $100,000 of debt, especially if I can find just as good internships at OSU. If you went to OSU or are currently attending it would be really helpful for me if you can let me know what kind of internships you were able to find at OSU. Also if you have anything that will help make my decision easier that would be much appreciated. "

My highest ACT score was a 27. I have been awarded around $15,000 in academic scholarships from my private university that I will be attending in the Fall of 2015. I figured I would make a post explaining how I got into a fairly selective college (44% rate) after having horrendous grades and attitude my freshmen and sophomore years. It seems like everyone on this subreddit screams community college every chance they get and I just wanted to offer some insight into my situation and how I avoided going to community college when I clearly should have. 

My junior year I decided I would get my stuff together and worked towards raising my GPA from the 2.0 it was at. I worked my ass off however at the end of junior year I realized that it is really fucking hard to increase your GPA. I refused to go to community college and during my senior year I applied and enrolled in a local state university. I took college level classes in the classroom for dual credit while also attending to my senior year classes part time. Many colleges have programs for non-degree seeking high school students to take dual credit classes on campus, the trick is just finding one locally and getting accepted. I loaded up on 10 credit hours and again, did anything I had to do in order to be successfully in these classes. I finished with a 3.6 college GPA. Not only did this prove that I could be successful at the collegiate level, but I was also able to get incredible recommendations from my professors who were blown away at having a high school student in their classroom. These dual credit classes also were calculated into my high school GPA and were weighted as AP classes, helping to inflate my GPA because I was taking more classes than a standard student would in a semester. 


The college GPA and recc. were fundamental aspects of my application and the sole reason I got accepted and among the toughest freshmen class in terms of admissions in the history of the school. Of course, there is the reality that I got denied from many other schools that I applied to but you only have to find one. 


One thing to remember is that your entire application will need to be focused around your transitional period, take responsibility and explain yourself and your mistakes. Then show your college GPA and present it as the ethos to back up your claim. Work to get the best recc. you can get from people you know, and make sure you have plenty of interesting EC's. Also, don't be afraid to file a letter of appeal, these letters usually give you unlimited or much more space to tell your story and explain yourself. Plus, if a college has a deadline that is before your Fall semester of your senior year classes are over with, you should be allowed to include it in your appeal since admission decisions are usually released well after December. 

If you want to go to a four year university straight out of high school you have to realize you will have to work your ass off. If you don't think you could handle the college classes then yes go to CC and learn those skills. I was able to get about 1/4th of my tuition paid for through scholarships because of the initiative I took and most importantly the incredible networking I did with my professors. Perhaps you might even get lucky enough to have one of your professors be an alumni of a school you want to attend... You'll never know if you don't try. 

I am now about to take my last final at this university and will have completed 3 semesters of coursework. Reflecting back now, there are several things I would have done differently that probably would have made my life easier and application even better.

* Go to class, I got knocked down from a A to an A- in my intro Psychology class simply because I missed class about 4 times. When you are counting your GPA so closely, this can make a big difference, especially when you don't have a full 15 credit hour semester.

* Get connected with your field and participate in activities and events that your college offers. I regret not going to job fairs and mock interviews put on by the department. Even though you are a high schooler, this will do nothing but impress professors. Employers will practically beg you to work with them since very few high schoolers that show this level of initiative.

* Do an internship. Yes you are in high school and no you might not have all the qualifications for the internship, but it shouldn't matter in your case. Send a letter to the HR director or see if your Career center/professors know anyone in your field that have a job and would be willing to let you job shadow for a week or do an unofficial internship. If you do a job shadow, even for just a week, you can earn recommendations that will be priceless in the future. The whole purpose of this is to network in your field, you might not even contribute to the company, but asking questions, attending meetings, and simply observing will impress nearly everybody.

* Be stubborn (or persistent) The summer following my sophomore year was when I realized that attending a 4 year university straight out of high school was a unlikely possibility for me. I felt like a failure and a looser who had wasted their life, it was without a doubt the lowest moment of my life. Balancing college classes with your normal senior and junior year coursework is no joke. You have to be completely dedicated to this. You also have to realize that any mistakes you make with your college classes will be on your permanent record. So don't fail. You will need to be stubborn when applying to colleges as well because trust me, you will get denied from a lot of places.

* Don't give up, seriously. Not many students even know that they can take college classes on campus while in high school (unless your state has a Running Start program), use this to your advantage. Keep reminding the admissions office in your application how you have demonstrated your ability for success at the collegiate level. Lastly, expect to be denied and plan accordingly. Your application is going to be viewed as ""nonstandard"" by the admissions board and may subsequently be thrown out just based on your GPA, without consideration given to the rest of your application. The university I am attending next year denied me, however I petitioned for an appeal and won. Don't rely on an appeal though, the odds for my university were about 1 in 20 for a successful appeal. I even wrote letters to professors in my major at the university expressing my interest for the program at the university in hopes that they would put in a good word with the appeal committee. 

One last thing, make sure you spend the time researching the college you want to take your dual credit classes at. It is perfectly acceptable for it to be a community college. Look for satellite campuses of big state schools, generally satellite campuses have higher acceptance rates than the main campus. Make sure you contact the admissions office and see if they have a special application for non-degree seeking high school students and of course get it approved with your high school's administration/counselor.

6:30 AM Monday Morning September 18, 2011

	His eyes open slowly as the light creeps over the foot of the bed. The familiar sticky taste inside his mouth reminded him of the last night’s final decision to have that last drink. 

A mistake, of course.

	Charles Weston was 57 years old, greying slowly in his age, albeit gracefully. He stood once at a solid six foot, with a surprisingly trim build for a man of his age and profession. He was a homicide detective, and seemingly to spite his silent internal disdain for the job, he was constantly inundated by a large caseload of violent crimes with plenty of hideously remorseless faces attached to them. He often wondered late at night to himself what it was that kept him from retiring, maybe something a little less taxing, all the while swilling 18 year old whiskey around in his rocks glass, and then he would remind himself that the look of pain on each and every face he put away kept him coming back the next day. Unfortunately it always kept him up far too late as well.

	The first leg slid off the right side of the bed tentatively, as if it wanted to test and see if the floor was still solid beneath it. After a moment, the second followed. A brief stretch and crackle of vertebrate later and it became time to rise completely from slumber. a shuffle to the bathroom, immediately followed by a wretching hack and spit. A quick look in the mirror confirmed the thought that had just rushed itself through his head regarding the last night’s decision making processes.

	The sickly thud of the footsteps transition off the cold bathroom tile onto the wooden floor of the bedroom almost seemed welcoming. A hard stomp down the hall and into the kitchen for coffee and sustinance- the greasy cure-all for last night’s indiscretions. Three slices of bacon, a cup of coffee and an egg later, the pounding upstairs had decidedly lessened. Finally.

	After a shower and failed consideration to shave his gravel-colored stubble, he dressed himself for the day, choosing a white shirt with light blue pinstripes and charcoal grey suit. He meticulously buttoned each hole and stared into the mirror and sighed slowly before tying his  shoes, threading his tie then knotting it, then moved back through his kitchen and into the den. 

	He opened the front door and walked outside, then bent to pick up the plastic-rolled newspaper nestled on the cracked concrete drive next to the street. Removing the blue cellophane, the paper slowly unrolled into its full shape and glory. Back inside to the naturally lit den he trekked, to plop down for another cup of joe and a skim over the paper. It would have been much easier to simply look online and filter through one of millions of news sites for his daily intake, but somehow the paper seemed to be much more satisfying. The texture of the pages, the way the cheaply manufactured ink rubbed off onto one’s fingers, the smell of crisp rolled paper merely hours off the press. Simple creature comforts like these were hard to come by in this day and age he thought.

His reading chair sagged as he sat back fully into it, a worn, brown leather arm chair complete with equally worn and matching futon. Both smelled of spilt coffee and years of set-in tobacco smoke. Charles reached into his inside jacket pocket and pulled out a soft pack of Lucky Strike filterless, gently tapped the pack on the back of his left had, and pulled the protruding cigarette out with his lips. On the coffee table to the right of the chair there sat a end table, devoid of anything save a telephone nearly as old as its owner and a half-full box of two hundred wooden matches, out of which he pulled one and lit up his morning routine. After skimming briefly accross the front page for a content overview of the previous day’s events, he had almost made it off the page when he decided to re-read the top story again. Usually murder cases didn’t phase him, as his line of work had numbed his senses over the decades. What he saw made him stop, place his coffee down on the table next to him and tamp out the nearly half of a cigarette in his hand. He reached over and picked up the phone and dialed the presinct captain. 

	“Fucking hell”, he muttered as his smoke yellowed fingertip pressed the last button on the handset.

This was definitely not going to be a typical day at the office for Detective Weston. No, not this go around.

The phone clicked to signal te other end had picked up.

	“Captain Stephens here,” the voice on the other side barked.
	“Captain, it’s Weston.”
	“Charles, what is it? Why the hell can’t you just come in like a normal person?”
	“He’s at it again.”
	“Who’s at it again?”
	“You know damn well who I’m talking about sir. The nurse who was found dead wrapped in the sheet in the alley near the hospital. Front page of The Chronical this morning.”
	“Yeah, I saw it. Some of our boys handled that yesterday morning. Why? And who the hell are you talking about?”
	“Azriel.”
	“Christ Almighty.” wheezed the captain.
	“Quite the opposite sir. More like the Devil is back in business again, and this time, from the looks of it, he’s pushing the limits again. Have you read the initial report from the crime scene?”
	“No, it’s in a file on my desk, but I haven’t cracked it open yet.”
	“Wait until I get to the station if you don’t mind.”
	“Sure, how long do you think?”
	“Half an hour, maybe forty five minutes. Depends on traffic.”
	“Alright. Want me to send one of the interns down to O’Rear’s for coffee for you?”
	“I’ll just drink my own piss, thanks. It’s a higher octane anyhow.”
	“Don’t doubt that a bit. Say Charles, just why do you keep obsessing over this guy? What I mean to say is, what makes him different than any other psycho out there?”

	Charles hung up the phone before Captain Stephens got his answer. He sat back in his chair again and lit up another smoke. Most definitely not another typical day at the office. 



3 AM Saturday Night September 16, 2011

	Ricky’s diner wasn’t much to call home about. In fact, it wasn’t much to call anyone about at all. The main redeeming factor was the desert. Blueberry pie, flakey crust, gooey insides. But with coffee like gasoline, orange juice that spurted inside of a fountain that looked like it had seen better off seasons, and torn red pleather booth seats all rounding out this dingy little joint that looked like it was straight out of a Hitchcock-esque movie. Frank Sinatra’s “Strangers in the Night” whined from a nearly dead jukebox in the corner, while pale off-white tables filled the gaps between the booth seats, matching the countertop that sat in front of bar stools apholstered with the same red plastic leather cover. 

	“The whole place had a smell like burning eggs,” Grace noted to herself as she pushed the door open with her back as she closed her umbrella and shook the rain from it. She wiped her feet on the dirty mat by the door and looked fleetingly around for a seat. It was easy to find one, as it appeared that Ricky’s busy hours didn’t include the three AM slot. 

	She walked over to the counter and chose a seat left-center. Aside from Grace, the place was relatively empty, save for a an elderly regular whom Nancy recognized worked at the hospital she was employed as a nurse. The only other patron in the diner was a man of late middle age, maybe in his 50’s, seated in a corner by himself. Grace looked him up and down slowly, noticing his strangely dry clothes and neatly groomed appearance. He was wearing a brown fedora tilted down low, as if to block his upper face from view, and western-style duster overcoat to shield from the weather.

	“Hmm, wonder how long he’s been in here?” she pondered to herself. “Must’ve been a while, it’s been raining for almost two hours straight now.”
	“What’ll you have sweetheart?” Denise the waitress broke Grace’s thought train.
	“Sorry Denise, didn’t see you there. I was thinking about something. I’ll have the usual, coffee this time too.”
	“Oh honey, you’re foineee”, Denise blurted back in her northern voice, nearly as oddly boisterous at this time of night as it was contrasting to Grace’s own light southern drawl.
	“Need anything special tonoight?” 
	“No, just cream and sugar please, cup of water too if you don’t mind”.
	“Watah? Watah’s just foine too, sweety. Comin right up!”

	Grace waited until she walked away to resume thinking to herself again. Denise was such a character, what with her late night energetic nature and matching levels of caked on rouge. Her lips were bright red colored by makeup, contrasting her equally white teeth that shined bright behind her lips with a nearly joker-ish leer at times. Her tight waitress dress seemed dated, but then again so was the diner; they most likely hadn’t updated anything inside the dump in decades. Whatever it mattered to Grace. She was just here in between shifts.

	“Here yah go honey!” Denise broke her concentration again, and plopped the drinks down in front of Grace. “Yah look distracted. Everything alright?”
	“I’m fine, thanks. Just been a long night. Damned rain means car accidents, and those always keep us busy late.”
	“Rainy nights keep me lonely. I wish I had someone to cozy on up with if yah knows what I mean, hehe.” Denise cracked a large smile at her own statement. Grace barely parted her own lips.
	“I know what you mean.” Grace sighed as her brief smile faded. Her husband and college sweetheart had caught her in bed with another man only just a year prior. They divorced shortly after, leaving behind only tears and no children to show for it all. 
	“Sorry honey, I forgot...” Denise trailed off. “I’ll be right back.” She moved to the older man, and handed him his check for his food. “Here yah go sweety, you comin back to see me soon?” she preened her hair a bit while she winked at the gentleman. He proclaimed he would, with a laugh and winked back at her. “What a harmless old coot” she thought to herself. He paid and left, still smiling. 

	She closed her til drawer and walked to the stranger in the corner, looking at him with a smile as well. He didn’t return hers, at least not at first, and seemed to peer straight through her with a lazer-like gaze. He blinked twice in quick succession and looked up at Denise and broke a sly smile himself. 

	“How yah doin over here honey?” She asked. 
	“Just fine,” he answered, his smiled dissapearing just as quickly as it had appeared. “Another cup of that stuff you call coffee, though.”
	“Sure, sure. Just a sec, dawl.” She grabbed his mug and took it behind the counter and filled it again, grabbing two sweet-and-low packets for him as well, just like the first time. She brought it back over and sat it down in front of him. “Need anything else?”
	“Just the bill will be all,” he responded without even looking up at her.
	“Comin right up for yah.”

	Denise began to feel a sense of unease for the man, whom she had never seen before, but had no real basis to understand why. Something about him just seemed wrong. Off. Maybe his elevator didn’t go all the way to the top. Maybe it went a bit too high. Who knows? Either way she totaled him up for everything and moved quickly back to his table. She placed the bill on the front end of the table, smiled briefly and walked back over behind the counter and leaned up on her elbows, putting her hands under her chin and looked back at Grace.

	“Honey, have you been dating ANYONE since, well, yah know?” she pried.

	Grace stared back just as intently and paused just a moment before answering “Well, I’ve been out a few times, with a couple of nice guys, just hasn’t panned out to anything more”.

	“Aw honey, it’ll work out. Plenty of nice guys out there. Just try not to keep thinkin about that prick all the time”.
	“It’s not as easy as you think.”
	“Sure it is, been hitched twice now. It’s as easy to forget about ‘em as it is to find ‘em in the first place.”

	“Wish I had your sense of drive,” as it was Grace’s turn to smile and laugh. She reached out over the counter and pulled an ashtray closer to her seat. She dug into her bag and pulled out a pack of smokes, tapping one out and gingerly placing it between her lips. She lit it and took a big drag, pausing before her exhale, “You know,” blowing the smoke out, “maybe something will happen soon. I’ve been getting a good feeling about meeting someone new lately, more of a sense of peace about the whole thing.”

	“That’s the spirit, hun.”
	“It’s something, thats for sure.”

	Denise moved now to the kitchen window and picked up the slice of pie Grace always ordered and snagged a roll of silverware to accompany it. She slid the plate out to Grace, who thanked her and slowly unrolled the utensils.

	Denise walked back to the kitched and made small talk with the younger hispanic cook for a bit, She awaited the sound of the bell above the door to jingle, signaling new customers entering, but it didn’t come. Just the ding of the bell in front of the counter, the sound that Grace was ready to check out.

	“Everything alright tonight?”
	“Just like always, Denise,” Grace cracked another smile, “But it’s back to work for me. Long night shift again, as always,” her smile fading again into nearly a frown. “This has been one of those nights.”
	“It’ll get better hun, just you wait.”
	“I sure hope so. Just seems like everyone that can come in fucked up on something or hurt tonight has, and it probably won’t be the last of them either.”
	“Well, there’s always more pie and coffee where this came from if yah need it.” 
	“Thanks, you know I’ll be back soon.”

	Denise handed her her change and watched as Grace moved to the door, unlatched the strap on her umbrella, and toed the door open in anticipation for opening the unbrella and shielding herself from the rain. She opened it, took a deep breath, and walked out into the storm, preparing for the three block walk back to the city hospital. 

	The stranger in the corner waited about a minute after Grace left, then dug some change out of his pockets for the coffee he had guzzeled, placed it on the table, and pulled his duster coat tight around his waist. He tipped his hat down even lower, as it to ready his face for the rain, and walked straight to the door and pushed it open quickly and walked out.

	“Good riddance,” Denise thought out loud, as she watched him go and picked up the change for the coffee. No tip left, and he was about ten cents short on the bill. “Fuckin typical, asshole”.
That visit to the diner was the last time anyone saw Grace Reed alive.




1 AM Friday night October 11, 1985

	The door to the bar opened abruptly, slamming all the way open and crashing with a metallic thud into the dirty brick alley wall behind it. 

	“AND STAY THE FUCK OUT!” yelled the bouncer, as he threw the man into the alleyway by the back of his shirt collar and belt. 
	“Oh, don’t worry I will,” he called back to the bouncer. “I’ll be sure to stay as far away from this place as I can!”

	The man drunkenly smiled, the moonlight gleaming from the blood that covered his teeth, chin, and the front of his shirt. Waiting until the back door to the bar closed fully, he looked around to be sure no one was there, and reached into his pants pocket and pulled a small plastic bag from it. Tapping a bit of the contents onto the back of his left hand, he sealed the bag again using his lips and sat it onto his lap. He then pilled a small piece of a straw from the left breast pocket of his ruffled pink oxford and slipped the straw into his nostril, pinching the other closed at the same time. A quick sniff and it was off to the races again, as the pain in his mouth and face faded swiftly away. He slowly turned over onto his side and used his hands to scoot himself back into the wall behind him and lift up onto his feet and start the tedious lurch down the alleyway, away from the entrance to the Smoking Pig bar, pulling his shirt back into its proper postition. He peered back over his shoulder to ensure no one was following him, then shuffled to the curb to attempt to hail a taxi. 

	James hadn’t always been such a troublemaker his whole life. It just seemed that since he had come out of the closet at the beginning of the decade nothing had appeared to go the way he had planned for it to. Drugs and alcohol had mixed badly for him on a regular basis, and often got the better of him in public when it shouldn’t. Tonight was no different. Maybe that last shot of tequila had done it for him. Pulling the hot little piece of ass next to him in for a kiss after it definitely had. That little piece of ass had socked him a good one right back in his kisser, and had landed him face-first into that alley. 

	Several cabs go by, and after nearly twenty minutes of standing on the curb it begins to sprinkle lightly, at first. The downpour starts slow, but picks up tempo as the wind sharply increases, and he feels the temperature drop three degrees almost at once. His clothes become soaked completely, sticking to his thin body like wet sheets on a line, starting a race between the lines of blood spotted on the front of his shirt as they bled further down towards his beltline. 

	Suddenly a dark sedan slows and comes to a stop near the curb he is standing on. the front passenger side window slides open with a mechanical whine of resistance and from inside the vehicle he hears the words come out sharply.

	“Need a ride buddy?”

	At first he is taken aback by a stranger stopping and offering a ride, but with his luck so far with taxis tonight, why not?

	“Ah fuck it, sure,” he smiled coyly and opened the door and stepped inside. “Sorry about the wet clothes,” he muttered, trying to hide his obvious high.
	“It’s no consequence to me, the stranger said back. “Just looked like you needed some assistance, what with every cab from here to the capital passing you by like you weren’t even there.”
	“Well, I do appreciate it.”
	“I’m heading towards sixth avenue, are you close to that location?” asked the driver in a flat tone.
	“That works for me. I live off of ninth, so sixth will work just fine for me tonight I suppsose.”
	“Very well then.”

	The ride goes on in silence for a few minutes, with the only sounds in the vehicle coming from the squeaky windshield wipers beating off the rain, and a tape playing classic gospel hymns from the radio. “Just a Closer Walk With Thee” comes on, and for the first time since he got in, he felt uncomfortable in his skin, perhaps from the chill of the wet clothes, the cocaine, or the fact that he was a gay man in a stranger’s car late at night listening to gospel music. Perhaps a combination of the three. 

	Sixth Avenue comes and goes, and suddenly the man feels the sudden increase in speed from the driver’s foot pressing down harder. James felt a sudden rush inside him from adrenaline, and blurted out,

	“Hey, I thought you were only going to sixth?” he questioned the man.
	“I said I was going towards it. Not to it,” the response almost seemed a quiet hiss.
	“Oh, well, you can let me out here if you like.”
	“Oh, we aren’t there yet. No need to get more wet than you already are.”
	“Well, if you insi-”
	“I do.” 
	“Alright then... if it’s no trouble to you.”
	“It isn’t,” he shortly retorted.

	James sat back into his seat again, feeling a bit more at ease, thinking quietly to himself that this man couldn’t be all bad, a tad on the strange side, but probably just some religious freak.

	The car came to a stop under a streetlight at the corner of Ninth Avenue. James looked over at the man who had driven him home for the first good time since he had gotten in. Straight faced and clear-eyed, staring straight ahead of him. Not at all the type of friendly good samaritan he had been expecting.

	“Thanks for the ride,” he lisped out quietly.
	“Never a problem at all,” croaked the driver, who for the first time turned and looked James. His dark eyes stared out from underneath the brim of his hat like pieces of coal set into the face of a pale human snowman, and although James could tell they were looking at him intently, he couldn’t help but feel as though they were burning a hole right through him.

	There was an uncomfortable pause for a moment, and it was then that James decided to take an initiative and ask a very frank question of the man.

	“Do you often pick up strangers for rides late at night?” James pondered out loud.
	“You’re my first,” came the flat reply.
	“Well, it sure doesn’t seem that way,” he quipped back.
	“Trust me, you’re most assuredly my first. I try not to stray from my comfort zone often.”
	“Haha, is that so?” James began to lighten up a bit. “Sure seems like you’ve done this before, but if you say so... thanks all the same.”

	It was then that he looked down to reach for the door handle, located near the middle of the door, and noticed something strange indeed. The front seat was covered in what looked to be two towels of matching color to the seats layered on top of each other, with what also appeared to be a layer of sheet plastic in between them. Scrunching his face up tight, he wondered out loud to the man,

	“Hey, one last thing, are you some sort of neat freak or something?” 
	“Whatever makes you ask that?”
	“Oh just how you covered your seats like this,” he inquisitively noted.
	“Oh, I have to be careful you know.”
	“Careful for what?”
	“It keeps the seat from staining.”
	“From dirt? Paint? What are you an artist or some kinda construction worker?”
	“No, not quite. A different sort of preternatural fear entirely.”
	“Oh, well, to each their own I suppose.”
	“Of course. To each their own indeed.”

	James turned again to open the door, grabbed hold of the handle, and never saw the military-grade knife stashed so perfectly between the driver’s seat and center console coming as it plunged into the back of his thin neck nearly surgically, breaking the vertebrae with a twist of the blade and a resounding crunch. James fell forward, dead almost before he hit the dashboard. 

	The car started forward again, throwing the body back against the towel and plastic covered seat, then slowed to a near stop again, allowing the man to reach accross and buckle it in with care. He smiled to himself, and pressed rewind on the tape deck in the dash, stopping it again on the song that was playing when he picked the young man up that night. “Just a Closer Walk With Thee” scratched its way out of the speakers of the car as it entered a highway on ramp, heading out of town. The moon shown down on the darkened, empty road like a beacon from a lighthouse through the clouds as suddenly the tape made a chipmunk sound and the player spewed brown tape out like vomit, seeming to reflect the nature of the music versus the act that had just occured mere feet from it. 

	“Shit,” cursed the driver. “I suppose it’ll be time for a new tape soon enough then,” he thought.

	He looked over at his victim, posed as if he was asleep in the seat next to him. At least gravity was working in the favor of the driver, keeping most of the blood down in the body and off of the seat, a problem he would deal with later when removing it. He whistled calmly to himself, and pulled off the lonely highway and onto an equally lonely and empty street, headed towards a private boat dock nestled in a privately located bay, where he had already moored a rented boat earlier in the day. He parked next to the dock, and put the emergency brake on. 

	He walked to the boat, still whistling, and removed several items from it including a roll of duct tape, a sheet, and a six foot hand truck. He opened his trunk and removed a painter’s set of coveralls, and put them on, including a full hood and pair of rubber dish gloves. He then laid the sheet out flat on the wet, muddy ground, and opened the car door and unbuckled his passenger. Next he carefully pulled the towels beneath the body towards the door, making meticulous movements so as not to leave behind the layer of plastic in between the towels, lest the trickle of blood reach the leather of the seat beneath it. The body made a soft thudding squish as it, the towels, and plastic beneath it hit the sheet below. The package was rolled tightly together, resembling a human shaped rolled cigarette, and tightly sealed shut with the tape. The hand truck was then laid on the ground next to him, and the body lifted calmly onto it, and again taped securely into place. He lifted the makeshift gurney onto its wheels and pushed it trepidatiously down the bumpy wooden dock to the boat. He had set up a ramp beforehad, and used it to load his cargo. 

	The enging coughed and sputtered as it attempted to come to life, and eventually gave in. The driver lifted the mooring rope off the dock and began his journey out of the quiet bay and into the ocean. He didn’t travel far, as the rain had only subsided perhaps half an hour previous to his excursion. He rode the waves for twenty or so minutes until he was satisfied with the distance from the shore. He then dropped anchor, and lit a cigarette, staring up at the cloudy night, seemingly deep in thought. Upon the cigarette’s completion he tossed the butt into the water and knelt beside his package. He took his hand and rubbed the top of the victim’s head a moment and smiled.

	“You were indeed my first. A learning experience, this was. For everything you have taught me tonight will be put to good use. But for now it seems as though you have outstayed your welcome on my little vessel. Would you be a good sport and fuck off for me now? That would be quite lovely.”

	With that he lifted the handtruck back onto its wheels and tilted it over the side of the boat until it fell with force over the side, splooshing into the water and sending spray back into the man’s face. He wiped it away and watched the faomy sea water bubble for a moment, then return back to its black glassy self again. He returned to the helm of the boat and steered it back towards the bay as a large cloud of blueish smoke coughed from the carbuerator and into the chilled night air. A gigantic smile crept accross his face.

	This was only the beginning.




11 AM Wednesday May 23, 1990

	“I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection
to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night”

	That was what the note “pinned” by the switchblade to the chest of the prostitute read in clear, red typeface. The woman’s body had been found left in an alley, partially covered by garbage bags, as if to hide it. But that wasn’t the impression Detective Charles Weston got when he thought the scene over in his head again. Sure, the bags clearly were covering the body to conceal it, but that wasn’t the ultimate intent it seemed. In his report, Detective Weston would later write that the bags were placed in order to delay the discovery of the body until the appropriate time, not to hide the act from view forever. The placement of the note was proof enough of that. 

	The note was written on a peice of copy paper, and had obviously been made using such a machine. There were no fingerprints later found on the note, save those of the victim and the careless first response officer, a rookie, who pulled it off the body without thinking.  Weston had blessed the kid out for that one. What did they teach these kids in academy anymore? 

	“Did you guys check behind the dumpster next to her for evidence yet?” barked Weston. “This isn’t fucking amateur hour anymore,” as he shot another glance at the rookie cop. “We need to secure this area from press ASAP. Those jackals can’t wait to sink their teeth into a story like this.” 
	“Yeah, yeah, yeah, they got it. Ease off a bit Charles, let the uniforms do their jobs for five minutes before you jump down their throats will ya?” countered Detective Troutman.

	Weston’s partner at the time was a chubby, peculiar sort of man that watches police process a crime scene as one might watch a baker glaze a donut. Both of those things appealed to Phillip Troutman in the way that an overly eager child might anticipate Christmas. He stood to the side of the crime scene watching carefully as it was cordoned off and the necessary pictures were taken of the body and surrounding area.

	“Phil, sometimes I wonder if Marcy making you go to all those goddamned spin classes is starting to make you go all touchy-feely soft on me in your old age,” Weston chirped back at him with a smile. “It’s days like this that really make it hard to decide just who works for who,” he chuckled. 
	“Just another day at the office Charles. It’s what I’m best at.”
	“I sure hope solving crimes is what you’re best at.”
	“Whatever you say boss man.”
	“Cut the shit will ya? You’re starting to give me an ulcer.”
	“I’ll file that under “to do for later”.”
	“See that you do that.”
	“I’ll do what I can. Hey, so whaddya think this note business is all about anyway? Some fuckin psycho trying to leave a political statement or something? I mean, I’ve seen some weird shit in my day out on the beat, but something like that on a dead hooker? This is definitely a message. This guy’s done this before, obviously, but nothing I’ve seen recently fits this type of M-O. It’s strange to say it, but I don’t think this is going to stop here. Theres going to be something else happen.”
	“I hope you’re wrong about that. I really do. But something in my gut tells me that you’re right about it. This has serial killer written all over it, to save the pun.”
	“Guess we just get to sit back and play the waiting game while we sort this mess out then.”
	“Yeah, I guess so. What do you think so far?”
	“Well, obviously we have a dead hooker here, with no obvious signs of sexual assault or physical abuse, save that old shiner she has and the fact that she was apparently killed with the knife the killer used to stick the note to her chest with. Outside of that I don’t see any motive, it wasn’t a robbery, all her shit’s still here.” Detective Troutman took a moment to pop a piece of gum into his blubbery maw and think for a moment. He smacked his gum loudly as he postulated, “Honestly, I don’t really know what to think here. This is gonna take some time to sort out.”
	“Well, let’s finish up here and get to it then.”
	“Sounds good to me.”


	Following a two hour scouring of the scene, there was a pile of paperwork to do, and not a lot of evidence to accompany it. There were a few loose statements from the garbagemen who had originally found the body, and a couple of passersby who had just gotten hot dogs that heard the initial scream when the body was found. There were a few sparce notes on the rest of the alleyway’s contents and condition, but no other related evidence was found at the scene. 

	The official report of the scene submitted by Detective Weston read as follows: The body had been moved from a secondary site, most likely where it had occurred. There were lacerations about her stomach region visible above her waistline running up to her breasts.


	The two detevctives spent another two hours collecting statements taken by the other officers from the garbagemen who had found the body, and several other witnesses who had been close by when they heard the initial yell of discovery. They took a few notes over the placement of the body, and conversed with the crime scene unit to determine if the body had been moved there, or if the crime occured on site. It hadn’t. The prostitute was most assuredly killed offsite then placed carefully in her current resting location by whomever had perpetrated this act. Her grotesque stationary position indicated a clear level of detail and care. The degree of positioning and set up most assuredly showed that someone wanted the police to find her like this. They wanted her to be seen, posed and doctored specifically to convey some sort of meaning. As to what exactly that was, now that was the question. 




**************
If you guys like this I'll keep writing the story, as I'd like know what happens to Weston, and if he ever gets his man.

He and I are pretty close and he was the one who inspired me to go into computer science (current high school senior, starting at a state school next year). He said in the next year or so he wants to take his savings and start his own firm. He said he'd be happy to let me intern to get a feel for the business as well as get some experience for my resume. Long term I want to work for Google, but I dont want to rush it as I have a very unusual opportunity on my hands.

Here's my idea: What if I work for him for my 4 years in college part time. Then, during my senior year I apply to work at Google. Having HFT on my resume should get me a phone screen (I hope). Then, assuming I can get an offer from them, I get my friend to write an official offer letter that gives me a salary of $150k + $100k bonus. I then present this to Google and ask them to counter it with a higher salary + more stocks and bonus.

My question for you is, would they entertain it? Would they even consider something like this from a new grad?

Thanks!

Edit: BTW, I live in New York, not sure if that matters."

I transferred to a 4 year school after getting an AS in engineering science at a community college, so I have an extra semester to catch up in this school and receive my BS ( will probably have to take another 5k in loans to finish up). 

My question is, should I work off the debt after I graduate, or continue to Grad school? My GPA is rather low (3.2, which may go up before graduate). 

I have two research internships under my belt (including one I'm doing this summer), as well as 2 semesters of research at my school. 

The thing is, I don't think I will be able to land an industry job out of college with research experience and no industry experience, and research jobs usually need a masters. I really want to get into research, but I don't know if I will be able to get a job or even get into Grad school because of my GPA (let alone be able to fund it).

Right now, I would like to have a tech job, but am not sure whether I should apply to an internship or full software job, or if I need more practice.

I have a B.S. in physics and have spent the past year or two learning programming on my own. I decided not to go to graduate school and picked software engineering as a goal career since I wasn't sure what I wanted to do instead. During school I took a lot of math and chemistry classes, and did experimental research where I built lasers and electronics.

I've got a few projects in different languages:

- Computational origami project, in python. This calculates the locations of origami folds needed to make the figure given. You draw a stick figure / tree in a gui, then it does circle-packing / optimization math and returns a new graph. It's hard to explain.

- twitter app, in ruby: input a user, access api and then it returns who they talk to (and who they talk to, to however many levels of recursion you want), + other info.

- Tetris. Converting a program somebody else wrote in Ruby to Java. (I thought this would be quick and easy, but it's turning into the hardest thing. I wish I just tried to write my own)

- in school I did some assembly programming in a digital electronics class. I made a stopwatch / timer for a final project.

Other experience I have.

- SQL, 1 open courseware programming class (Theory of Programming Languages, made a mini-language in SML, among other homework assignments), racket, algorithms/data structures (I've done some practice interviews, but probably need more practice), mathematica project, some knowledge of databases.

I don't know how much more experience I need. As far as what area of programming, I find mathematical stuff more fun, but am open to anything - I haven't seen any of it from the inside.

33mvnx,2,2015-04-23,How should I deal with my Mother-in-Law?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/33mvnx/how_should_i_deal_with_my_motherinlaw/,"I know, I know, it's cliche. First, let me tell you a little back story.

I am a young adult, recently married and living with my husband's family. I came from an abusive home and was living in another friend's house for a little while before my husband's family took me in. I owe a lot to this family and to the mother-in-law for taking me in almost free-of-charge, giving me food, ect. They have been nothing but kind to me but lately my relationship with the mother-in-law has been extremely strained. The apartment we live in is small, there are six of us and so a little stress is to be expected. However, it seems like nearly everything I do results in this woman feeling deeply offended and a talk I had with my husband revealed to me that my mother-in-law doesn't feel like I respect her enough.

Now, I said I came from an abusive home-- I was literally my parent's parent. I was practically raised by cats growing up, so maybe my idea of ""respect"" is a little skewed. To me, I believed in giving the people around you deserved respect. If you are an elder, I will treat you well because I understand that you may be becoming a little senile, maybe your sick, maybe you're a grouch because of x or y reason and it's a little late to be expecting you to change your ways now. Fine-- but if you're a middle-aged adult and you treat the people around you like dirt, I expect you to know better and will call you out on your behavior. 

I wouldn't go so far as to say that this woman treated me that badly, but since I began living in her house she had been an overbearing presence. I can't tell you the amount of times she has made me cry-- including on my birthday or before/after work-- and she never felt the need to apologize for that. She constantly mocks my paranoia of spoiled food/germs (the woman leaves EVERYTHING PERISHABLE out of the fridge for weeks). She even calls me ""chubby"" and says that I am going to get diabetes while I am perfectly thin! She pressures everyone to act according to her wishes (with good intentions, I understand that) and she seems utterly inconsiderate. She's the type of woman that blasts her TV and talks in the kitchen (which is right beside my bedroom) in the middle of the night and as loudly as possible because, surely, if she isn't sleeping then NO ONE is! She also has a terrible habit of leaving trash everywhere she can and RARELY picks up after herself. I am talking about banana peels in the car for MONTHS. Yet she expects everyone to clean up after her!

Anyway, please excuse my rant. The point is that while she does all of these things that drive me (and her children, occasionally) insane, you are not allowed to correct her. To so much as tease her a little back for a joke she made would result in her heart breaking into pieces. Every single time I've accidentally offended her, I've always apologized. I've tried explaining my background to her, I've tried explaining that she took what I said the wrong way and this is what I really meant-- I feel like I've tried everything and it isn't enough! Today she refuses my apology and is walking around crying and complaining about me to her children. 

According to her son and what he says is ""their culture"", the way you show respect to your elders is by NEVER correcting them or suggesting a better way of doing things, NEVER point out a flaw they have, NEVER tease them, NEVER do anything they do to you back at them, NEVER expect an apology from them and ALWAYS apologize, and do whatever they say. 

This sort of thing is completely alien to me. I don't get the concept of obeying someone this way. I don't understand how I am expecting to suck up whatever she does but not point out the hypocrisy. My strategy right now is to flat out hide from the whole family. My husband is in college right now and I am in a Internship Program, so neither of us can afford to move out yet (and trust me, we are saving up). 

Is there something I can do in the meantime? How do I show respect to someone like this? Please explain it to me because aside from being polite and helping around the house, I don't know what else to do to prove my appreciation to this woman! "

I have almost a year of experience with Node+Express, Angular, and MySQL, but I've also worked with React, MongoDB, and Redis to varying degrees. My clients are mostly entrepreneurs fleshing out their product for the first time-- several of them from this very subreddit! Check out [my website](https://noahmuth.com) for more information.

Academically, I'm a junior, with a 3.7 GPA, double majoring in computer science and poetry at Hamline University. I write papers, poems, and compilers in equal amounts.

I'm looking for an internship with a team of happy people who like what they do. Programming is a craft, and like any craft, the best person to learn from is someone who truly enjoys their work. If that sounds like you, and you're interested in taking on a productive team member who is eager to learn, send me a PM! I'll hook you up with a copy of my resume.

Thanks for reading!"

1.Take some interesting 4th year cs courses to better understand computer science (compilers, capstone, principles of programming languages) 

2.Raise my gpa. Right not its a horrible C+ cumulative gpa

I could have potentially just graduated with my honors degree but felt I would not be as skilled as other cs majors. Hence I dropped 1 required course to extend graduation.

Now I am starting to regret this decision, because I don’t think taking these courses would contribute to me finding a job after graduation. I have been struggling all term to get a summer internship, even though I had a previous summer internship doing software development. 

I am also mentally struggling with things, like particular draining friendships and my poor fitness level. I think that this stress and the stress of studying and getting better marks is getting to me. Add to the fact I have 30k of student debt I constantly think about.

Lastly, I have am enormous amount of ideas that keep me excited for the summer. I want to launch an android app, a web app, improve my website, and work on my Arduino.  I have been dabbling in each of these things this year on the side. Unfortunately I find school to keep me from actually completing any of these ideas.

Therefore, I have thought about taking first term of school off, and finding an 8 month internship or 2 four month internships. I would also work on my ideas and finally ship something. I can also focus on finding a full time job without having school as a distraction, by reading cracking the coding interview and learning the skills that certain company’s actually want in order to make myself a more attractive candidate.

Would you consider this a good idea? Am I shooting myself in the foot for not taking important 4th year courses? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."

I consider myself very intelligent (high iq, strong critical thinking, high MCAT etc...) so I am not worried about the school material.

My number one goal is to get an internship ASAP, hopefully by next summer.

Question 1: I was just offered an accounting internship for a successful IT/Advertising firm. It pays $13/hr. Not the best pay, but I'd be working/reporting directly to the Controller and other higher-ups on a daily basis, so it sounds like pretty good experience (I'd help with the annual audit process, AP/AR, reconciliations, etc) . **I need to respond to the HR director by tomorrow about my offer. Would it be stupid of me to deny this offer to interview with two more prestigious companies (one is a financial company, one is a publicly traded defense company)?**

The reason I'm asking this is because an interview obviously holds no guarantees. If I weren't able to get either position, I have a feeling that I would be out of luck for intern experience this summer as it is already late April. If that were to happen, I'm not sure how I'd be able to sleep at night, knowing that I pissed away an opportunity.


Question 2: If an internship contract mentions that expenses related to working for the company may be reimbursed, would commuting to the city each day count? I'd be spending ~$370 a month on commuting, and coupled with the fact that my pay isn't exactly competitive, this would be fantastic. 

I'd really appreciate any input here!"

Do you think it is possible at this point to find a CS-related internship before starting my CS program in the Fall?

**Here's my situation:** I left a job a couple of months ago due to some company culture/management issues. I'm currently unemployed, but have been accepted into a BSc in CS program at a state university. I am technically transferring in as a sophomore because I have a 2-year degree (only 44 credits were transferrable).

I'm self-taught for the most part and have a general/basic (if a bit rusty) understanding of OOP from the Java class I took. I've tinkered around with Python, C(++, #), JavaScript, Batch/Bash, etc also. However, as I won't start until Fall, I haven't taken any CS classes like algorithms, data structures, etc.

**Here's the issue:** I need some income over the summer, but trying to find work seems impossible right now. I have a 2-year degree with 2-3 years of experience in the IT field, but it seems questionable of me to seek out a full-time job only to drop it in 3-4 months when classes start.

With my experience and knowledge, would it be possible to find a developer internship? do I need more pre-requisite knowledge first? Is it too late?

Otherwise, what are my options at this point?"
33ntk4,1,2015-04-23,How can I get past the dismissive treatment I've received from others in the past?,as1kennel,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/33ntk4/how_can_i_get_past_the_dismissive_treatment_ive/,"This is going to be a total train wreck. I'm sorry. I'm just stuck, guys. I'm stuck in a mental cage and I don't know how to break out of it. I could use some advice on what to do. Here's an explanation of what the ""cage"" is and where it comes from.

Over time I've embraced the philosophy that nobody really gives a shit about me. People don't care what I think. They don't care what I feel. My opinions, feelings, beliefs, and interests exist so that they can be ignored or belittled by others. I exist to be ignored and belittled by others. Because of this I've become something of a hermit. My day-to-day life is always exactly the same. I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. I don't do anything on weekends, either. I don't hang out with friends (not that I have friends to hang out with). I don't go anywhere to eat. I spend my time at work to myself and I spend my time outside of work at home.

So why do I feel this way? There are many reasons, but I can roll it up into one sentence. I've constantly been belittled and put down for the things I care about the most. When I was an undergrad I studied economics. I absolutely loved economics. I really, really did. And I liked talking about. I wanted to talk about. But when people would ask me about economics they didn't really care what I had to say. They already knew what they believed and what I said never mattered. That sucked, and it sucked more because I really cared about what I was studying. But I made peace with it by telling myself that these people were stupid. They weren't as smart as me. That's why they ignored me and threw the things I said back in my face.

So then I got picked for an internship program in DC. I and a bunch of other students were selected to take classes and intern in DC. Getting in was tough, too: essays, letters of recommendation, interviews, volunteer experience... It took months. But I got in and I was fuckin' pumped. My heart soared when I got that acceptance letter. I was fuckin' pumped because I finally felt like I'd be surrounded by smart people like me. I mean, they went through the same process I did! They must be smart people! We'll have discussions! Things will be different. I was so wrong. They were even more obstinate and intractable than the people I'd me at school. They were even more adamant in throwing things back in my face. I had been so certain that things would be different and they turned out to be just the same. Actually, I'd say it was worse because I had my hopes crushed.

So after that I accepted the fact that other people didn't care about me or what I had to say and I started shutting myself off. I stopped reading and watching documentaries and caring about anything that happened outside my immediate vicinity. I started focusing on my little corner of the world. I told myself that even though strangers didn't care about what I had to say, my friends would. So I stopped trying to be an intelligent person (that clearly wasn't worth shit) and tried to be a loyal one. That went okay until last year. 

What happened was, in a nutshell, a girl. I fell in love with a girl, but once she realized we wanted different things she broke up with me. So I turned to my friends for help, right? That's what you do in that situation. But they didn't help. Even though I'd known them for years and I'd helped them countless times, they took my ex-girlfriend's side against me. They called me an asshole. They called me conceited. I tried to explain how I felt. I tried to explain why I felt. It didn't matter. They'd already decided their positions. They already knew what to think about me and my girlfriend and the relationship we had and nothing I said could change that.

So now I'm fucked. I've learned helplessness. No matter what I do, no matter where I go, no matter how close I get to someone, the things I feel and think and want aren't relevant. I feel that way because that's exactly how people around me have reacted when I've tried to share with them the things I hold close to my heart. Even my closest friends, people that I'd known and supported and helped for years, reacted that way. 

Now I'm scared and frightened and living in a tight little box of my own design because I don't want to get my head chopped off anymore. But I want more. I'm smart and ambitious and I want more out of life! But if I stick my head up I'll get beheaded 'cause no one gives two shits what I want! But I don't want to live in the box! And on and on it goes.

I guess that's it. Sorry for the long post."

I have a dilemma however.

The internship program puts you in charge of a single sport and you work on marketing promotions for the season. However, since football is so big, everyone works this one. This means that during gamedays, I can't go to the game or tailgate. 

I've already bought season tickets for the next season, and I really want to go to the games because there are some huge games next year. 

However, I also don't want to miss out on this opportunity. I'm only a sophomore, so I guess I could go for it my junior or senior year when I'm not going to worry about the games as much, but I don't know.

Recently been stressing out about the prospects of going to B-school, worrying about being too old.

Currently pursuing a degree in B.sc. in Mech. engineering and next year will go for an M.sc. in Industrial Engineering (B.sc + M.sc. is required in my country to become an engineer, also gives me more time to get great internships.). Also, getting a degree in financial economics (only need the equivalent of 1.5 years of courses since I get credit from my engi courses aswell).

I have an internship this summer at a small HF.

Looking to eventually work in London (most realistic) or New York. 

How important is getting an MBA for advancing in IB and to compete with other grads?

I took 2 years off between HS and college (personal reasons) and will graduate when I am 26. Working the required 3-5 years will leave me at minimum age of 29 when I can apply.

Is 29 too old? Should I apply for jobs after my B.Sc instead of going for M.sc even though job prospects will be worse?

Thanks for any and all advice.

My choice is obviously UIUC as it is so highly ranked in the US . I do want to do my OPT after graduation in the US for the allowable time ( currently 27 months ) and save money to do my masters. Being an international student I have to pay the full ticket which is $ 57 K per year for UIUC and $ 38 K per year for UMN and this is where I have an issue..

My dad is willing to sponsor from his savings the full cost for UMN for 4 years - approx. 190 K . His logic is that in case I have to do my masters - an undergraduate school should make not much difference in my career and people will look more at where I have done my grad school for. UMN is also a good school and if I grasp all the opportunities I should be in a position to get good internship/ OPT jobs as well as get into a reputed grad school later on.

But, I am extremely keen to go to UIUC. My logic to my dad was

a) is UIUC is rated 5 in computer engineering b) companies like Microsoft come regularly hiring at UIUC.( this is the information I could gather from the web ). So it will be easier and much more better if I could go to UIUC . c) the average salary for a UIUC computer engineer is around 72 K as compared to 56 K at UMN d) If I stay frugally I should be in a position to pay off the loan and save some amount for my masters as well. e) I have already got my desired major in UIUC whereas at UMN I will have to still work for it.

Looking at my enthusiasm he has asked me to take a private loan for 50 K to bridge the difference. In fact he has cosigned the loan and the loan is already sanctioned as well. He has also made it clear that in case there is an issue of me getting a job he will pay this amount from his retirement savings as well so that I do not get saddled with a burden at the start of my life. I obviously would not like this to happen and hence am looking for advice from you if my logical reasoning is correct.

With the decision day looming I have to make a choice - should I go in for UIUC and take the burden of a loan and follow my dreams or do I do what is more practical : join UMN and may be always have the regret later in life that if only .....

Please help urgently!!

PS issues of urban/ cold/ party school are not very important to me as compared to my career and whether a loan of 50 K is worth going to UIUC."

Advice?,AncientApple,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33pggn/first_technical_interview_ever_advice/,"Long story short I applied for this summer IT ""Help Desk"" internship and just found out yesterday that I passed the first 1/2 phase of the interview process. 

I'll be doing a Skype interview on Monday with the tech team that will last about 1 hour 15 minutes. At least that what I was told in the email. 

I'm guessing this is some sort of technical interview. This is my first tech interview ever and I'm not sure how to prepare for it. I mean the job description seems like it doesn't involve any programming just helping people with computer issues if any.

Any advice? "
33pj58,2,2015-04-24,Developing an Off-Cycle Recruiting Strategy,Ames92,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/33pj58/developing_an_offcycle_recruiting_strategy/,"Hello all,

There are not a lot of resources* out there concerning off-cycle recruitment for management consultancies thus, I was hoping to use this post to:

1)	Understand how off-cycle recruiting works within your particular firm (ie. How are candidates found, When are slots made available)

2)	Determine how best to network to uncover these opportunities

3)	Develop a strategy to pursue a role in management consultancy off the traditional campus recruiting cycle.

-Personal Background:

Last summer, I interned and received an offer from a prestigious M&amp;A investment bank. In the fall, I declined the offer in order to pursue my interest in a role in consulting. I decided this because I am far more interested in working in the operations and strategy of a company and understanding how to best streamline business and create efficiencies, than working in financial engineering. 

I believe I have the appropriate credentials to pursue an opportunity in management consulting: 

1)	I earned a 3.7 GPA from a top-25 American university, along with honors in economics.

2)	I have relevant internships which gave me experience in handing large data sets and working with clients.

3)	I took leadership and founding roles in extra-curricular clubs at my university.

4)	I have international work experience in a junior year gap year along with second language fluency (Spanish).

In the fall, after declining the offer, I began networking and applying online to all the major consultancies. I understand I lost time by waiting until my offer expired, and unfortunately, I did not receive any communications from many of the firms I applied to and was only formally invited to one interview (which I learned from).

I graduated in December and have been doing part-time due diligence work and traveling since then. I have returned from a long planned post-grad trip with my girlfriend and I am looking to continue pursuing a role in MC.

I wanted to ask your advice on how best to network to find opportunities. For example, I understand networking is important, but how do you do it in a manner that will produce opportunities. Secondly, any advice on how to approach firms and recruiters is also welcome.

Thank you. I understand most of you guys are pretty busy and certainly appreciate any insight you can provide which might help.

I sometimes like to look through these because it's interesting to read bug reports from 1996, and you sometimes find gems like pictures of cross dressing coworkers. One folder looked like a backup of someone's 'My Pictures' folder, and under that was a folder full of images that were screenshots of Firefox's 'Saved Passwords' window. Here were the username and password of this guy's Facebook, work computer, *bank accounts*, all sorts of random stuff. He still works here in a relatively high up position. Now, this picture is five years old, but judging by the fact that a lot of the passwords were reused, I'm guessing a lot are still valid.

Why it's complicated: Even though this was in a folder accessible to everyone, even a lowly intern, it still feels like personal data. It's mostly pictures of his family including his young and teenage daughters, and I feel bad that I was rummaging around through it.
Should I tell him about it or just delete these password files?

I have been accepted into two colleges in the US, [Gettysburg College](http://www.gettysburg.edu/) and the more well-known [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/). My problem is that I cannot decide which college I want to attend. To better inform you, heres a breakdown of the facts -

______________

My major- Computer Science.


Gettysburg - 5 hours from home and will cost around 16,000$ (which my parents will be paying in full) a year after I received a 44,000$ grant from them. A great school for history related majors, and is ranked among the top liberal arts schools in the nation. Attending this school will leave me with no debt after college, but could be harder to find a higher paying job with a degree from here. The starting salary of a Gettysburg graduate is about 55,000.

 

NYU - Only an hour from home, but will cost me personally 28,000$ and thus will leave me 113,000$ in debt after college. The benefits are the amazing experience of living in NYC during college, the internship opportunities, and the chance of getting a very high paying job immediately after my graduation. The average starting salary of a NYU graduate is 75,000.


My ideas- I love NYU and would go there in a heartbeat if the price was lower. Gettysburg is also a very nice school, and I think I could be happy there, but NYU is my dream school. 


_______________


So my question to you is, does it really make sense to go to NYU instead of Gettysburg? Does the NYU degree really make up for all of the debt? What should I do?

Thank you for all of your help!"

**Here's my situation:** I left a job a couple of months ago due to some company culture/management issues. I'm currently unemployed, and decided to go back to school for a CS degree. I have a 2-year degree in IT, so I will be transferring in as a sophomore.

I'm self-taught for the most part and have a general/basic (if a bit rusty) understanding of OOP from the Java class I took. I've tinkered around with Python, C(++, #), JavaScript, Batch/Bash, etc also. However, as I won't start until Fall, I haven't taken any CS classes like algorithms, data structures, etc.

**Here's the issue:** In the past, I have tried to balance part-time work &amp; school before but performance in both suffered. Thus, I want to focus exclusively on school beginning this Fall. So even with 2-3 years of IT experience, it seems impossible to find a position knowing I'll be dropping it at the end of August. But another 4 months is a long time to go unemployed. While I do have to look out for myself, I don't want to waste employer's resources on-boarding somebody with short-term intentions.

With my experience and knowledge, would it be possible to find an internship? Is that even an option since I haven't started classes yet? Should I seek full-time anyway? 

Otherwise, what are my options at this point?"

33qkgy,1,2015-04-24,HR scenario Help - GA (Long),[deleted],AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/33qkgy/hr_scenario_help_ga_long/,"X Company is a dealership located in Covington, Georgia. The dealership contains 106 employees. Joe Reek is the owner and General Manager. X Company contains 20 sales associates, 4 service administrators, 15 car tech’s, and 1 service manager.  The service manager reports directly to Joe Reek. Like most dealerships, tech’s at X Company are paid based off of a flat-rate pay system, which means that the tech’s are paid by each job. The dealership uses a commercially available reference guide  to determine the amount of time expected to do general repair work.  If the work is estimated to take 4 hours based on national statistics, the technician is paid for 4 hours, regardless of how much time it actually takes.   For instance, if the job is estimated to take an hour but requires four, the employee is paid for only one hour. However, if the job takes only 45 minutes, the employee still receives an hour's pay. For technicians who work quickly and efficiently, a flat-rate pay system can be lucrative.  X Company pays apprentice technicians $20 per flat-rate hour, junior technicians $30 per flat-rate hour, and senior technicians $40 per flat-rate hour.  The top technicians can make $1,900 per week. 

Joe Reek has outsourced many compensation activities to ADP, but he takes care of the other HR functions.  Unfortunately, Reek may be over his head since the dealership is facing some major problems related to two previous employees.  He needs the advice of an HR expert to understand his options. 


Allen Muse

X Company hired Allen Muse as an apprentice technician in November 2011.  In December 2012, he was promoted to junior technician.  Six months later, he learned that his coworkers made an average of 50% more than he for the same number of hours worked.  He complained to Joe Reek about the disparity in pay and asked for an immediate pay increase to establish equity. Muse argued that the jobs are equivalent and noted that he is the only Latino.   Reek explained that Muse is paid less for several reasons:  his coworkers are “Senior Technicians,” they have more experience, and they work faster. From Muse’s perspective, they all do the same thing, work the same number of hours, and are held to the same standards.  Muse was unhappy with Reek’s explanation but said nothing more since he needed his job.

A month later, Reek’s 15-year-old son, Tyler, was helping in the service department.  His dad hired Tyler as an unpaid automotive technician intern for the summer.  Reek hoped his son would take over the business one day.  Moreover, he thought the internship would keep Tyler out of trouble.  Tyler worked 8:30 – 4:00 Monday through Friday and 7:00 – 5:00 on Saturday.  He spent most of his time cleaning the shop and moving cars.  

Muse and the other technicians thought Tyler was a big distraction.  He was constantly horsing around and getting in the way.  Of course, no one said anything since he was the owner’s son.   On July 15, 2013, Tyler let his 15-year-old girlfriend sit behind the steering wheel while he was washing a customer’s car.  The girl accidently hit the accelerator.  The car ran over Tyler’s foot, jumped the wall, and drove into a pond.  The car was totaled and Tyler was rushed to the hospital with a crushed foot.  As you can imagine, Reek was distraught over his son’s injury.   While surgeons were trying to save Tyler’s foot, Reek was receiving text messages from a local newspaper reporter asking about the accident. The next day, the accident was front page news complete with photos.  But wait!  There’s more!!  
Two days later, OSHA showed up at the dealership, unannounced, to investigate the accident. Reek had to leave his son’s bedside to deal with the OSHA inspector.  Imagine his outrage when Reek learned that the newspaper learned about the accident from one of Reek’s employees. Apparently, Muse had posted photos of the accident on his Facebook page with sarcastic commentary, including: “What happens when you have an incompetent manager running things.”  He confronted Muse about the posting, but Muse was unapologetic stating that it was his private Facebook page and “It’s none of your business!”  Reek fired Muse on the spot shouting, “How can you be so heartless after everything I’ve done for you?”

One day after he was fired, Muse filed an EEOC complaint based on national origin and filed a lawsuit claiming BB illegally invaded his privacy. 
   
Gaby Frost

Gaby had worked for BB for almost three years until she was fired after refusing to attend four sales meetings.  She had a great first year making almost $70,000.    However, the second year she only made $30,000 and for the first four months of 2014, she made less than $2,400 despite working an average of 50 hours per week.  Before she was fired in June 2014, Gaby had not sold a car in six weeks.  Monthly sales were posted in the sales manager’s office for all to see.  Thus, all of her coworkers knew about her poor performance.  

Overall, BB’s sales were down 15% from a year ago.  During the same period nationally, Buick’s U.S. car sales had fallen 18%.  Reek believed that his salespeople could benefit from training and hired a motivational coach. 

On May 21, 2014, the motivational coach implemented his new program to increase sales.  Every morning, before the salespeople went on the showroom floor, there was a 15-minute meeting.  The meetings had a pep rally atmosphere, with yelling, chanting, and cheering.  Every Monday, the top salesperson for the previous week received a standing ovation and a $200 bonus.  The salesperson with the worst record the previous week was required to sing “I’m a Loser” by the Beatles and clean the employee bathrooms.   

Gaby had the worst record for the first two weeks of the new program, but she refused to participate in what she described as a “humiliating and sexist” exercise.  Moreover, she argued that cleaning the bathrooms was “disgusting and unhealthy.”   It should be noted that on April 30, 2014, she informed Reek that she had Mysophobia (fear of germs) after he threatened to fire her after noticing that Gaby was refusing to shake the hands of customers.  

She refused to attend the next three morning meetings.  Instead, she sat at her desk in the showroom.  She was told in writing that another absence would result in immediate dismissal.  The next day (Thursday), she again refused to attend the “pep rally.” Gaby was fired and furnished a separation notice that contained the following reason for her separation:  INSUBORDINATION

The day before she was fired, Gaby contacted the EEOC claiming gender and disability discrimination.   After she was fired, she added retaliation and harassment to her EEOC complaint and filed a lawsuit accusing BB of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  

GUIDELINES


1.	Is Muse likely to win any of the following claims: invasion of privacy or discrimination based on national origin?  

2.	Is Gaby likely to win any of the following claims:  intentional infliction of emotional distress, discrimination based on gender or disability, retaliation, or harassment?  

3.	Should I be worried about any FLSA violations?

My ""worst case"" is that they try to offer me the same pay as my current location. Expected case is the same pay as the other interns, best case is they take into consideration my experience and offer me more.

I have two years left in school, so I really want to get an internship next summer. Right now I'm trying to figure out what went wrong, and what to do next. My current goal for the summer is to find any sort of job and also to develop and document a simple yet complete embedded application (a board that does something useful).

For what it's worth, I am also quite interested in the EE side of embedded systems (specifically FPGAs and board-level design), although I realize my resume doesn't show that. 

Here's my current [resume](http://postimg.org/image/nntz7zfld/full/).

As far as employment history goes, the most recent job I had was being a short-order cook for 4 months in 2010. I couldn't find a job after my B.A, and when I decided to move home and pursue a B.S, I quit looking for work. That may have been a stupid decision and a big detriment to my employability, but all I can do now is find a way to overcome it and find a way to 'get my foot in the door', as they say. My goal so far has been to try and do this through projects, but I guess I'm just not trying hard enough.

So, how good or bad is my situation, and what should I do now? Any feedback or advice is appreciated. Thanks!

I am 19 years old at the moment and i have one year until i will have to apply to a university. I'm quite good at mathematics, IT, Programming  and a little bit of Physics. 
The main dilemma i'm in is, which uni should i apply to (which degree) and what will the job for me be, when i get out. I have been hearing about IT students having a tough time getting a well paid job so i thrown that out of the options i have. I'm mainly looking for a CS school that offers internship (is internship important and why? At the moment i just blindly follow the idea that it is very useful). What are the main characteristics of a university i should look for when deciding where to go? 
To add i live in Europe and know all of the subjects mentioned, so i will be able to study in any country at a uni that offers english lectures. Last question i have is if it matters too much where you studied or if it's more about your skills. I really started to love programming and would love to continue in the future.

33uf4o,0,2015-04-25,Moving into CS? (currently junior chemical engineer),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/33uf4o/moving_into_cs_currently_junior_chemical_engineer/,"Hi,

I know the question that follows is quite complex and obviously there is no magic answer, so I am just hoping for some thoughts and ideas from people, especially those who have been in a similar scenario. I also apologize for the length of this post.

Background: I am currently a junior in college, majoring in Chemical Engineering. I took some programming classes (java) in high school, I liked it but not that much (a lot of it was theory instead of producing actual code, which didn’t exactly turn me onto programming). I ended up going for an engineering degree because I had always figured I would solving problems and working other analytical solutions, and my parents always pushed me towards engineering. Anyway I took a class at the end of sophomore year that centered on VBA programming in excel. I ended up really liking this class, and have been working on learning more about VBA programming outside of my classes. I will be entering my senior year this fall and don’t really know what I want to do with my life after I graduate. My previous chemical engineering internships were ok but it’s not like I really loved it, although there are a vast array of different opportunities in chemical engineering. For this summer, the internship that I was going to have fell through due to funding issues, I am applying to some things now but it is very late as far as things go. I am considering just using this summer to figure out what I want to do.

Anyway, this leads to my question; what do you think my best option is to help me make up my mind? One idea that I had was to essentially make learning to program my full time “job”. I had read an article a little while ago about coding camps, and I would essentially try to do the same thing, spending all of my time trying to learn. If I went this route what would be a good language to learn and are there any good resources to follow that would be more structured rather than typical programming courses? It seems like half the battle with learning to program on the side is that I don’t know what I know.

My other option would just be to continue learning VBA with the intent of just using it occasionally in whatever chemical engineering job I end up doing. With my current VBA knowledge I have created several useful applications, both for the company that I worked for last summer and myself. I have also been trying to do some freelance VBA work but have only had time to do one small project as exam and projects have kept me extremely busy. 

Other thoughts: I know that programming for fun or on the side can be different from doing it day in and day out as a full time job. That is half of the reason that I want to do this, so I can get a sense of whether I truly like to program or not. What has your experience been like moving from learning to program into programming as an actual job? Also, how hard is it to get a job as a self-taught programmer? 

Thanks you for reading through this whole thing! If you have any thoughts or ideas I would greatly like to hear them.

I am also double minoring in Studio Art and Digital Art.

Honestly, my passion is in the arts. I have a huge background in art, and that is something I have always wanted to do my whole life. I realize that I feel much more comfortable on the design side rather than development.

I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Python. I also have experience with Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and InDesign. My classes next year include Unity, JavaScript, mobile and web development as well as databases. I am also a TA for introductory computer science classes. I am currently doing a government internship in IT during my breaks. I also did an internship at a startup where I was doing a bit of web development, but I left because I did not feel like it was a good fit for me because I was not pushed creatively. 

I know I want to have a career in digital media, however, I still haven't discovered what I love. I love to program and I love doing art and animation, but I am confused as to what direction I should be pushing in.

I have spoken to some of my professors about this, and they have all told me that I should be considering grad school. Some places that my professors and I have considered are NYU Tisch ITP and SVA.

What I don't want is to be stuck at a job where I sit and program all day. Nor do I want to work in tech support. I want a career where I create and manage creative projects and utilize my skills in a meaningful way.

Can anyone give me any advice and guidance as to what career paths should I be looking into? Is grad school something I should be seriously considering? "

I've worked 4 months at a company as an research engineer intern.  I recently gave a presentation about my project and management wants to place a patent for my work.  They asked me to photocopy my notebooks, etc. as well.

However, as I am leaving soon and the patent application won't be submitted while I am still with the company, is it likely that my name would still be included on the patent considering I am only a 4 month intern?

Thanks, please let me know if you've had any similar experiences as well.


EDIT: To put things in perspective, even though my direct supervisor is proud of my work and extremely satisfied with my performance, the engineering director doesn't seem to like me a lot.  He seems a bit salty about the fact that I'm only doing a 4-month work term and would be leaving the company soon.

Is it standard procedure to include temporary interns in patents when they did the majority of the work?

However, I am still not completely decided on what area to specialize in. I have chosen Machine Learning as my main concentration, because I consider it to be one of the growing fields in CS. However, I am not sure if that is the right area for me.

My main concern with doing a Masters in Machine Learning is that I will be stuck in a research job position, which I am definitely not interested in. I have had past internships, and the thing I enjoyed most about them was the coding, and the software engineering aspect of them. I actually like development more than I would like doing research. I have many options to choose my concentration in, but these are the areas I have narrowed down. 

- Databases and Software Engineering
- Information Security
- Dual Specialization between one of the above and Machine Learning

I am leaning more towards the dual specialization right now because it will allow me to pursue jobs that are less on the research side, while still having a Machine learning degree that can prove to be useful in the future. I need help deciding whether this is the right decision or not, and if not, what I should choose.

EDIT: Some people are getting confused with my passport situation, I'm an American citizen born abroad. My mother is from Illinois. I have already gotten my American passport and SSN. 

**The problem**

My parents just approached me and said they'd like me to move out asap. I've been home since I graduated in mid Feb. It's a long story but I completely understand and I'm (mostly) fine with it. I had always planned on moving to the States after graduation. 

* **Degree:** BSc. Computer Science &amp; Information Systems double major

* **Certs:** Completing my CCNA in June

* **Work Experience:** No paid or internships. I was the IT Specialist for a University club for ~2 years.

* **Portfolio:** Penetration test as part of a interview, small Python program. Odd school project which I need to find and improve. 
* **Career goal:** Anything security related, it's a mad passion.
* **Current career path:** There's several paths I can take to get into computer security (development, IT support etc). Once I get my foot in the door I'm confident I can work my way into the industry. 

**The Questions**

1. What are some good job databases I could look at? 
2. I understand my work experience and portfolio are weaknesses. I'm developing a Hearthstone Deck builder in Python and performing penetration tests on Mutillidae using Kali Linux. What else should I be doing to make myself more valuable to a future employer? 
3. As I said, security is my passion. I want to engulf myself in all things computer security. I currently listen to podcasts, follow ~300 security related twitter accounts, I'm performing penetration tests and I'm reading various testing guides, standards and whitepapers. Is there anything else I should consider? (only two security conferences in NZ)
4. What are some things that I should be aware of when entering the US job market? The process? Expectations of me? 
5. Certs are a hotly debated topic. Given my obvious lack of experience, would it be worth getting one? If so, which one(s)? Comptia? GIAC? 

I've tried to keep this brief as possible, if you'd like to know more just ask me.

I am studying at a top 15 university and am on track to achieving a first.

My hope is to study a masters in the US after I graduate but I am struggling to find information that isn't either confusing or overwhelming. 

I am looking for any information in the following areas:

___

**Costs**

* Financial aid and scholarships for international students, what is offered and what am I eligible for? 

* Part-time jobs for international students, am I allowed to work in the US? 

* I heard there are schemes where in return for financial aid I can help the university in various ways, research, office work, etc. Is that a thing? If so what is it called?

* I am aware of costs in tuition, accommodation, cost of living, visas and flights. Is there anything I am missing.
___

**Application Process**

* What is the application process? Is there a timeline of when I should do what?

* I don't really understand GPA? It seems that 4.0 is the best but I have also seen other scales which is confusing? We don't have them in the UK but they are required for US colleges, so is a first class degree in the UK comparable to a GPA score? Or does it not work like that?

* Aside from grades is anything else taken into account for post grad entry? Such as work experience, side projects, extra-curricular activities? Also from movies I learnt that college essays are a thing, would I need to do one also?

* Here in the UK, we apply to university with a UCAS application. On that application we choose 5 universities to apply for. Is that the case in the US? Is there a general application that everyone uses or do you just apply to schools that you want to go to? Is there a limit?

* Is the undergrad and post-grad application process the same, aside from the level of degree you're applying too? 
___

**General**

* Should I look for public or private schools? Are private schools better or worse? 

* Of course I want to go to an Ivy League school. Is that unlikely for international students or are the amount of international students accepted at Ivy schools similar to non-ivy? Also here in the UK an elite school like Oxford costs the same as the worst school, is that the case in the US?

* Am I eligible for internships? 
___

**Visas**

* Do I have to apply for a visa completely separately from my college application. My research seems to bring up a 'Visa Lottery', so lets say I get accepted to a college but I don't get a visa for whatever reason (because I don't get picked from a lottery or whatever) what happens then?

* What happens after my masters? Must I go back to the UK or am I able to stay and work in the US?

* Is there a requirement that I must have a certain amount of money in my bank account to be eligible for a visa? Right now I am poor student that earns very little money and is relying on student loans to apply.
___

Sorry for the huge amount of questions and the frankly inarticulate post, I am just confused about where to start my research so any information would be hugely appreciated."

I have a GPA of ~3.4.  I've been applying and interviewing for internships since my freshman year with no luck.  Since I come from a very poor family I get exorbitant amounts of work-study funds from the government, and I was hired in the HR department of a non profit where I have been working for the last 8 months.  Some of the interviews I had for this summer seemed highly promising but did not pan out, so my bosses at the non profit gave me a full time seasonal position as an HR clerk no questions asked.  The pay is on par with that of a summer internship, and I need the money for summer classes if I want to graduate on time.

In the long run I want to get into trading, pursue a masters degree once my life shows some signs of stability (I can't afford to live in this area if left unemployed, home is an 8 hour drive away).  My resume is on par with my peers minus the internships, I have extracurricular experience in both equity valuation and derivative trading, but recruiters in those fields have yet to give me the time of day. 

I feel like I'm falling into a trap.  I don't want to be in human resources, but it pays better than fast food.  My recent work history is  sparsely relevant to my career choice (and only when I can successfully play it up in an interview).

On the other hand, I know for a fact after doing college + work that I actually do have above average problem solving skills, which makes me good at software development, thats why I chose this career in the first place, and it would be a shame not to let a potential employer know.

I wouldnt want to give a bad impression because of this small detail, so, what do you guys think? would you put that into the resume, or only things that you have proof of (eg X months of experience)?

I'm in my mid-20s and failed out of my undergrad studies after several years. needless to say my grades aren't anything to brag about. When I work, I work hard, but with school it's like I'm a 12 year old idiot trying to learn graduate-level mathematics - I don't even know where to start and I get really disheartened and give up. So school didn't really work out for me, and I dragged it out for a long time before being forced to accept that. 

I went to a good CS school and took a couple of CS courses, but my major was in engineering. My internships have given me some experience: 16 months of QA work, 4 months of build/release engineering/server management, 4 months of Web development, 8 months of driver development, and 12 months of your usual UI/app development. Despite all of this, I feel hopeless. My team leads and managers have often praised my work ethic, how quickly I learn things, how ""smart"" I am about things. But I am a brutal interviewee. I am not upfront in-your-face technically proficient. I am not charming. I am awkward, anxious, and ditzy. If you give me a week or two to learn a programming language and/or codebase, I'll be there, I'll pick it up maybe faster than anyone else you've met. But there's no way for me to demonstrate that in an interview, my experience with technical interviews are ""answer these specific questions and solve these problems"" and I choke and I flail and I fail. I am the person who fails at writing FizzBuzz in an interview. And now I'm going into the ""real world."" No degree. No ""I'm cheaper and don't need benefits, worst case scenario I'll be out of your hair in a few months"" internship situation for companies. 

I don't know what to do. I have a lot of friends that dropped out who work in the Valley now, but they're all so much better than me at software development, I'd never be able to do that. I'm from southern Ontario, currently live in ""the Silicon Valley of Canada,"" but it's not reassuring in the slightest. These days I stare out at the unknown void of the rest of my life and I feel so hopeless I want to throw myself in front of a train or something. I've never worked outside of software and now I wonder if I'll ever work within the industry again.

I know this is a ""questions"" subreddit and I'm sure I had a question when I started typing, but only one comes to mind now : is there any reason for hope?"

**PREPARE FOR WALL OF TEXT**

I am a 2nd year Computing Science student and I seem to be struggling in finding a company ready to employ me during the summer. I'll give you some more detailed information.

As stated previously, I am a 2nd year Uni student studying Computer Science. I live in a place where this is the only real University (other places are just small branches of foreign Universities, ex. University of London) and therefore, it is the best rated University in the country. Being the only University in the country, it takes pretty much all student (with regards to IT) assuming you get the required grades in your A-Levels. First year was very tough. I managed to scrape through with an average of around 61. Not great, but I seemed to be above or bang on the class average (to be fair, we had a lot of classes with students from other subjects such as Business and IT, which I feel are less intelligent than CS students, as their requirements are lower, and they probably altered the average a bit). I was obviously not happy with how I performed. With that grade, I would have gotten a 2nd lower degree. (45-59 3rd class, 60-69 2nd lower, 70-79 2nd upper, 80+ 1st class). I tried to up my levels 2nd year 1st semester, and I aimed for a 70+ average. I was very disappointed when I ended up with an average of 66, although once again I seemed to be somewhat above the average in a number of subjects. For this semester, I am aiming for an even higher average, around 74, which will hopefully tip my average to around 70. This is unlikely, but the least I can do is try. Although I recognize these are not the best marks possible, I really am trying to achieve higher marks, and I seem to be on an upward trend. 

I have done little to no projects in my free time. I tend to get lazy when I am at home, which definitely needs to change. (more on this below)

I have some work experience. I have worked for 2 summers in a row in a governmental IT agency. Unfortunately, this job was more administration related rather than hands on programming (which is what is really needed). I had to administer a number of systems, help in integration of a VLE system, create a manual program using MS Excel (nationwide government initiative. Had to create a 'temporary' 6 month program using Excel until the real product was done [outsourced btw]), etc.. As you might notice, it was useful to a certain extent. I did learn a bunch of new technologies and procedures, but it still is somewhat distant from a real IT job. Also, the government has the stigma that employees don't actually work, which to a certain extent is true (although I always did over and above what was expected from me). I feel I was quite good at what I did. When I first joined, I was not wanted by the department, but the department was forced to take a student and they had to accept me (I was part of a nationwide project where we get put in IT companies for experience, and I ended up in this governmental org.) I quickly managed to win their trust (?) and they started giving more more jobs, and also invited me in certain meeting with big foreign companies (Ex. Microsoft). After the first summer, they told me to join again the second summer, because the department didn't want any other student apart from me. I joined them again (hence the second summer experience). They have also given me an offer to join them the following summer (more on this below) and also jokingly asked me to join them when I graduate. 

I am now nearing the end of my 3 year course (just passed half of it) and I am trying to get a 'real' internship, i.e. programming in a software house. I sent out a number of e-mails (probably around 10), with a covering letter and a CV, but I have received limited responses. Most of them just told me that they will contact me if there is an open position, and only 2 companies contacted me for an interview. I would like to say that I feel that my CV is well structured, and I asked a number of people for help, and I think it is quite good. I think the lack of responses is more due to the fact that certain companies are relatively small (~20 employees) so they don't have much space for students. I also don't think that my grades are a cause for the lack of interviews. Only 2 companies asked for my Uni grades, although both didn't answer me after sending them my grades.

Now, regarding the 2 interviews I did.

The first one was from an International company, who initially gave me a test (similar to an IQ test; number sequences, picture sequences, math problems, computer related questions). The next interview (?) was pretty much just laying down the terms of employment. From their end, I was accepted. The reason I declined them is due to the fact that they wanted me to start working from the following Saturday, for 10 hours weekly, up until the beginning of summer (during exam period too), as a training phase. Apart from that, they wanted me to work additional things at home. I was not able to accept that, due to the fact that I honestly have too much Uni work to do, and I wouldn't be able to juggle the two at once (I feared it will impact my marks negatively, and I'd rather have a better degree). 

The other company who interviewed me first asked me to complete a task which they sent over by e-mail. I managed to complete the task and they asked me to come in for an interview. One of my interviewers was one of my lecturers, which was probably a good thing. The interview first started with them speaking to me about CV related items, then they asked me to explain my implementation to the task. They seemed to like the approach, but then went on to ask me other questions. The first one was regarding Java exceptions, and I felt I fucked up quite a bit. I know what exceptions are, and how they work, but the last time I used exceptions was around 3 years ago (as stated, I pretty much only do assignments, so I deal with exceptions/problems in different ways) so I was not great when answering. I did have a decent idea though, so i scraped through. Then they asked me database and SQL related questions. I do know databases/sql, but once again, I was rusty on the subject (around a year ago was the last time I used SQL) and only managed to scrape through. Needless to say, they didn't accept me. 

Now I'm stuck. Personally, I don't think I will be called for any more interviews. I don't know many more companies who do take on students as interns, so at this point, it looks improbable that I will manage to get an internship. Assuming, I don't get an internship, I need help on what my next step should be. I am thinking about going to my previous place of employment (governmental agency) and just suck it up for the summer (along with hopefully doing personal projects at home AFTER work hours) or just skip the job and create personal projects. I already have a decent idea of what I want to start on, but I'm unsure whether I want to go to work and work on side projects, or just work on personal side projects. Money is not really an issue for me. I do have enough money to get me through a summer without a steady income. I just need to know what is more beneficial for my career. My only fear of working only from home is that companies still won't see this as valuable , and I'd rather do something which isn't valuable and get paid rather than do something which isn't valuable and not get paid.

I appreciate any help that I can get. 

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I recognize that some parts are relatively poorly written. Writing this took me way more time than I anticipated, and I really need to get back to work."

I thought it might be beneficial for some of you to have an inside perspective of how to identify, pursue, and get various jobs across a wide variety of industries. This is my personal technique so take any bits of it you want. A bit of background about me, I am a current management consultant with one of the Big 4 accounting firms (PWC, Deloitte, KPMG, EY). My experience is in a business environment, but the same principles will apply across the board.

I graduated from Temple with a BBA in Accounting and from the get go I wasn’t one of those intense networkers who attended every single free pretzel day or networking dinner. I was introverted in that regard. I thought for sure that a job would land in my lap. I was wrong.

In my junior year I applied to 12 internships. I received all rejections except from one. I hated to admit it, but it wasn’t totally unexpected. I barely networked and had a modest 3.0 GPA. I received an invite to interview on campus for a boutique consulting firm. I took the interview and received an invite to the local office. I got an offer for the New York office and the reason being that they liked me, but they liked three others more for the Philly office so they tried to keep me any way they could. I wasn’t going to say no... It was all I had. 

Subsequent to my internship I received a full time offer. I worked my tail off for it, too. I did a solid 2 years at the firm until I decided I wanted to do something a bit more challenging, so I shot for the top (Big 4). I went through the entire hiring process for the Big 4 and have even worked a bit in recruiting and saw first hand what top-notch companies look for in a candidate. My goal is to give this advice to any of you who may be having a tough time or who are just starting the search.

----------------------------------------
Four strategic principles to remember in searching for a job:T
Target
Arm
Fire
Massage
----------------------------------------

TARGET
After deciding which position  you want to pursue, you’ll need to identify where you’ll apply. This is the Target phase. I suggest using a spreadsheet to keep track of your communications with Target companies. I created a handy one here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g5_QPxLTMJ1SmefvqBqamS4Bax3Tzu9NYc73JxPf2zo/edit?usp=sharing

There are various resources you can use to identify companies: Indeed.com, Glassdoor.com, Monster.com, LinkedIn (!!), Facebook, Jobvite.com, etc. 

For example, if I’m looking for a job as a UX Designer, I would search one of these websites and note down any companies that interest me. 

NOTE: Don’t let anyone fool you, networking is the BEST way to get the job you want. You could submit 100 resumes/day via online systems, but that may work 1/30 times. Networking and getting in front of the Target is key. 

Once you narrow down your list to around 5-8 Targets, it’s time to move on to the ARM phase. 



ARM
You’ve got your list of Targets, now you need to identify who the key players are at that company. 

For example, if I’m targeting Google, I want to make sure I identify any recruiters or managers that may be associated with the position I’m seeking. If the UX Designer job I want is located in San Francisco, I want to scour LinkedIn under the Google company page by using the search terms “recruit, talent” etc in the Keyword field. This will identify any individuals within the company that work in Recruiting. If you’re going for a job in San Francisco, make sure to find recruiters located there. Once you find some, note them in your tracking spreadsheet. 

NOTE: I also suggest searching for managers and associates if you come up empty with recruiters. These individuals will know where to point your application. 

So how do you get this information you might ask? It takes a little bit of creative thinking and investigation. 

My go-to tools are MailTester.com and the Rapportive GMAIL application. MailTester requires you to type in an email moniker and it will ping that address to see if it’s valid. For instance if you want to reach Brian Wilson at Google, you would type in brian.wilson@google.com or bwilson@google.com or any other combo and see if it gives you a “success” message. (if there is a real Brian Wilson at Google, which there probably is, i’m sorry dude).

Rapportive is great because you do the same as MailTester.com but you type the email address into a new Gmail email window and if it’s a match, rapportive will pull up the POCs (Persons of Contact) social media profile so you know you have the right person. 

Once you find a valid email address, add it to your tracker. 

By doing this, you’re setting up for launch, or Arming!



FIRE
You’ve done the prep work, you’ve identified your Targets, you’ve identified POCs within those Targets, and you’ve found their email addresses. Now it’s time to send your cold e-mail. I’ve tried numerous email scripts from a variety of sources online, but this is my best script:

“Hi ______,
My name is ______. I’m a ’09 grad from _________ and current management consultant. I came across your name on LinkedIn while searching the __________ company page. 
I’d love to get your career advice for 15-20 minutes. I’m currently working at ______, but a few of my friends work as _____ (UX Designers) and each time they tell me how much they love their job, I get more interested.
Most of them have told me that if I'm interested in becoming a UX Designer, I have to talk to someone at _______(Google). Do you think I could pick your brain on how I can position myself to be attractive to _______ and what motivated you to choose the company? 
I can call you or keep it to e-mail…whichever is more convenient. I can work around you! 
Would it be possible for us to chat?
Thanks,
__________”

I sent this script out 10 times and received a 70% response rate. It’s not perfect for everyone, but it’s a start. 

It’s important to note then when firing emails to your POCs, you make sure you tailor each to that specific company. There aren’t many things worse than writing an email to Google with an SAP thrown in there. Keep it relevant and keep it GENUINE. 



MASSAGE
The final phase is more of a routine and not a phase with a distinct start and end time. In this phase you will keep track of your communications and “massage” your POCs (sounds weird, huh). What this means is that you will periodically follow up with relevant tidbits about yourself and about pieces of news that pertain to that individual’s position. For instance if you read an interesting article about UX designing, it wouldn’t hurt to email that POC the link to it maybe a couple of weeks after the initial communication. 

By massaging your POC, you’ll become familiar to them. But you dont want to be too pushy. You want to be an asset. So when you send interesting articles, specifically tell them that no reply is needed. 

---------------------------------------------

This was a quick (lol, not so much) overview of the techniques I’ve used in the past that have worked for me. Network, network, network!

I was thinking of creating a course or a video series with some more insights. Is this something any of you would be interested in?

342adr,13,2015-04-27,Putting in my 2 weeks. Did i go about this wrong?,wwoodall,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/342adr/putting_in_my_2_weeks_did_i_go_about_this_wrong/,"So in December the semester before i graduate i accepted a full time offer with a company i was really excited to work for. I told them i was also looking to work during my last semester so they offered me an intern spot and then full time when i graduate. I signed both offers and was really excited. 

Anyways once i started i realized that the work i would be doing is really really boring. We are not really making any new features so i just constantly copy and paste code to integrate new clients. On top of that my ""trainer"" who is really just an entry level dev does not get along with me at all. Its a small startup so only like 25 people in my office. I talked to my boss and got more work/responsibility which was good but the work is still the same. Nothing challenging and mostly just bug fixes or very simple integrations so i started looking for jobs again and landed a couple new offers. I ended up taking another offer in early April since the company seems like it will have more for me to do and 30% salary increase plus better bonuses. I dont start my new job until july so could theoretically work at my current one until then but i feel kinda like a dick leading them on longer and dont need the money so vacation after graduation sounds nice.

Anyway im about to put in my 2 weeks and i am really nervous it is going to go poorly. They still believe i will be starting full time and obviously that is not the case. Not to mention my boss i get along really well with and feel like i am kinda screwing them since they have been waiting for me to start full time. 

What should i say? What should i expect? Am i leaving a bad rep with my current company?

Edit: Should i be asking for references also? "

342eo2,3,2015-04-27,Getting a job/gradschool with a low GPA,poliscicomputersci,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/342eo2/getting_a_jobgradschool_with_a_low_gpa/,"I'm a CS major at a very good school for computer science, just finishing up my junior year. I enjoy programming and I'm quite good at it, but I'm very mediocre at math/theory stuff. I've spent at least three times as much effort in probability, physics, EE, linear algebra and graph theory classes as in any of the programming classes I've taken, and tend to get Cs. In programming classes I have an A- average, but together my GPA is far lower than I'd like.

A lot of my friends don't have this disparity at all and have had a lot more success getting internship interviews, or at least it seems that way. It's also possible they downplay the number of jobs they apply to. I have a research position this summer that I'm super excited about and had a good internship last summer, but getting these took more work than seems typical from talking to people.

Basically, how much will this bring me down in getting a real job after graduation? I also ideally would want to get a masters degree in computational biology/bioinformatics but I don't think anything less than a 3.5 will be good enough for that. Is there anything I can do, besides taking more of the classes I'm good at, to put myself in a better position?

Thanks!"

I majorly fucked up the one internship I had (as a research assistant in mathematics).  Thus no connections, and no work experience.  My degree is in mathematics and computer science, so naturally I am more interested in the theoretical and foundational topics.  I am not terribly confident in my ability to make it in as a mathematician (though if I had the choice, nothing would please me more than to study math every day).

I've decided I should at least have a go at making a living as a programmer, but I need to prove myself somehow, presumably with a portfolio because I have no references period.

One idea that intrigues me would be to study Dragon Book and start building a compiler of some sort, posting my work at every step of the way on my github.  Is this a suitable project for my situation?"

342igh,27,2015-04-27,The Marni Papers. Part 1.,marnipapers,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/342igh/the_marni_papers_part_1/,"[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3492km/the_marni_papers_part_2/)

All you need to know for starters is that I work for a really prestigious museum. I want everyone to know what happened to me so no on else can suffer my same fate.   

&amp;nbsp;

By “work” I mean I’m an unpaid intern. I’m currently spending a semester interning at this really great museum because I’m a bit of a history geek and thinking of going for a Museum Studies M.A. I work in the Bibliography section of this museum—it’s really small and only has a couple employees. We analyze books, catalogue them, and see if they can be exhibited. Today my really nice boss, the registrar of the department, Paloma asked me to go through these really old documents. If you’re at all familiar with museum work, you know that around 70% of it is grunt work. And since I’m a college intern, I’m basically stuck with all of it. I don’t really mind—Paloma turns a blind eye when I go on Facebook, and she’s always been really nice about my vitiligo, unlike a lot of the other employees.  

&amp;nbsp;

Sure, people won’t ever ask you upfront about what the hell is wrong with your skin, but I’m not stupid. The other day when I was using the bathroom, two coworkers came in and began washing their hands and gossiping. I had my iPod in, but I could hear snippets of their conversation.  

&amp;nbsp;

“What ethnicity even is she? She’s black *and* white.”  

&amp;nbsp;

The other one gave this really gross guffaw. “Julie, you’re so mean!”  

&amp;nbsp;

Ugh, Julie, that bitch. She’s this really chubby lady with these beady little eyes and I know she steals the food I put in the communal fridge. I’ve never really liked her, and now I had a concrete reason not to.   

&amp;nbsp;

But I digress.

&amp;nbsp;

Paloma gave me these documents to look over. There’s probably five Hollinger boxes jam-packed with notes and loose leaf papers. They’re all from the 80’s, and when Paloma heaved them onto my desk, she gave me a sympathetic look.  

&amp;nbsp;

“I’m sorry, Renee. I know it’s grunt work, but it’s really important!”   

&amp;nbsp;

Feigning a smile, I said it was no problem. But the minute she left, I sank into my dismally uncomfortable office chair. Fuck. I had just finished putting together and assembling the accession numbers for some other files, and I had to do even more tedious work. Rubbing my eyes to keep myself awake, I delved into the first box.  

&amp;nbsp;

Within each folder was probably 30 pages of letters, and each started with “Marni,” or “Dear Marni.”  

&amp;nbsp;

Frowning a little, I rifled throuh the rest of the letters in the folder. They were all little letters and notes to this “Marni” about really trivial stuff. For example,  

&amp;nbsp;

“Dear Marni,
Janet didn’t show up to work today, I think she’s sick. It’s probably the change in weather.
Talked to Veronica about the new acquisitions. She said they should be ready by the 24th. 
Bob needs to see you about 1974.1.1.”  

&amp;nbsp;

So on and so forth. There was nothing especially interesting these letters, but the more I read through them the more I got curious about Marni. Since we have an open office, I wheeled my chair over to Paloma who exited quickly out of the Weight Watchers website she was perusing.   

&amp;nbsp;

“What’s up?” she asked quickly.  

&amp;nbsp;

“Who’s Marni?”  

&amp;nbsp;

Paloma frowned, a furrow appearing between her brows. “She was the registrar in the 80’s.”   

&amp;nbsp;

Now it was my turn to frown. “Was? What happened to her?”  

&amp;nbsp;

Paloma shuddered, and crossed herself. Despite her high position, deep down was a very traditional, Catholic Filipina.   

&amp;nbsp;

“She got fired.”  

&amp;nbsp;

My curiosity piqued, I ventured on, ignoring her obvious discomfort. “Why? Did she take something?”  

&amp;nbsp;

“No, the opposite. She lost a very important piece to the museum.” And that all she would say about it. “Now didn’t I just give you something to do, or do you need some more work?”  

&amp;nbsp;

Smiling cheekily at her, I wheeled myself back to my desk. I brought up the museum’s database on my metallic hunk of a computer. I had a hunch about what she might have misplaced.  

&amp;nbsp;

I typed in the accession number I had found in the notes slowly. “1974.1.1.”  

&amp;nbsp;

The website flickered, and then showed me what I was looking for.   

&amp;nbsp;

“**Item ID**: 160173  
**Accession Number**: 1974.1.1  
**Level of description**: Anthropodermic bibliopegy  
**Author/Creator**: Unknown  
**Title**: Unknown  
**Biographical History**: Loan from _______ University. Was previously thought to be sheep skin. Delicate and in poor condition. No other information known. Considered lost since 1974.”  

&amp;nbsp;

They’re extremely rare, and would have been a great boon for the museum’s exhibit. No wonder she was fired. A shiver ran up my spine. What exactly happened to that book?

When i got in i was overjoyed and was really happy, but now looking at the cost both my parents and i are nervous that this debt is WAY too much for me to handle. As a little background i live in new york and wads lucky enough to get into many different schools for engineering that cost a lot less ( queens college (not engineering but they have a 3-2 program with columbia), GWU, Stony Brook, and U Miami. I dont know if this is a bad idea but i really need advice so im going to say how much each of these cost so that hopefully some amazing sole can give me advice because right now, i'm a lost 17 year old who doesn't want to live in debt for the rest of his life. onto the costs:

queens columbia program: (3 years at queens college (~3k a year which my parents will pay) and 2 years at columbia (estimated probably at ~60 with financial aid

GWU (~30k a year); U miami (~28k a year); Stony Brook (~20k a year)

with UIUC i got 0 in FA so its 50,502 and most of that will be loans so will end up being around ~29k a year for 10 years if its going to be that every year ( i know i can make money from dorming off campus in an apartment to getting internships but regardless this is of course still a lot). I know this is probably the wrong place to post this and i will probably also post this on college confidential but my main choice right now is definitely UIUC because of the great reputation and rigor that the school offers in engineering which will lead to a better job. so if you can't answer my questions if you could tell me where to post this so people could.

-The company itself is relatively small so the roles are not concretely defined. They have opened up roles for students to come in and intern in the past.

Some closing thoughts...

Just because a company isn't advertising specifically for a timeframe, doesn't mean they aren't hiring. Companies don't really care what season it is the way schools do. If you see a sweet gig you're interested in that's only advertising for summer, you should apply anyway.

Company isn't actively advertising for interns? Doesn't matter, you should apply anyway. You're likely to receive a lot more rejection this way. I've been doing this for a while with some success, though. I've submitted my resume to companies under a full time position, and included that I wanted to do an internship in my cover letter, or mentioned it to the recruiter when they inevitably send me the ""uh, you're still in school, why are you applying here, exactly?"" email.

Do not wait for companies to come to you. YOU GO TO THEM. Especially if you don't have any experience. Kick down the door and show them that you're awesome and that they're goofy for even considering not hiring you.

For those of you considering taking a semester off to get more experience: I am doing this right now, and absolutely loving it. Easily the best decision of my life so far. If you have any questions about what it's been like, I'm happy to answer them via PM or comments.

Hooray for engineering!

Smaller customers that don’t need a server for other software use hosting provided by the company I intern for that  at the moment is a small server room in the attic.

The assignment I have been given as an intern is find out and write a business case on what is the cheapest or best option to move the customers servers and the company’s to a datacenter of some sorts

* Colocation,
* Dedicated server(Baremetal VM?)

I have been checking in with this subreddit about every other day for the past 3 or so years. And just yesterday I signed an offer letter with a company I really want to work for.

I know around this time of the year there is a surplus of threads with to-be grads or recent grads who are kind of freaking out about finding a job.  I was one of them. 

My advice is there really is no secret.  My GPA is bad: ~2.4, I only have one internship where I didn't really learn anything, and I only have 3 projects on my github (all from one CS class). 

You just have to get yourself out there and apply.  I made it a habit of applying to about 2 or 3 positions every other day. Also if someone messages you on LinkedIn about a position, reply (unless its a staffing company [personal preference])! They messaged you which means you sorta have the upper hand and you have nothing to lose.

Their will also be times where you are in the middle of the interview process for 1 or more companies and you keep getting contacted by other company recruiters.  Times like this were really stressful and busy which made it easy to just say I wasn't interested or not reply at all, but you never know if one interview process will fall through so you want to take every opportunity you can get.

Now that it's typed out my advice seems very common knowledge, but I really wish someone told me this 2 months ago. Again, thanks for all the help guys! And good luck to everyone trying to find a job.

I applied for a (very large multi-national) company at the beginning of April, ~1st.

I got an email from a University Specialist saying they want to set up an interview. I emailed her back immediately after getting her email requesting one for the following Tuesday (the 14th). She didn't email back for two days, so I emailed her again. She immediately emailed after that, apologizing for the delay and setting up an interview for Tuesday morning, and that she would send me a confirmation email the day before.

Come next Tuesday, two hours before the interview, I still get no email, so I email her again where she once again apologizes and does confirm the interview.

I interview with the two people, it seems to go great. They ""evaluate"" my interview at the end, saying I did very well and was very prepared and that I would hear back with a decision at the beginning of next week. I say ok, I send the thank you notes etc. etc.

Come next week I get nothing. So on Friday (the 24th) I email the University Specialist again, wondering what's up.

She emails me back (with a recruiter c.c. to the email) later that day saying that a recruiter will get back to me ASAP.

She ends the email with ""fyi [recruiter] - [my name] interviewed on April 14th for the [position]. 

So to me it seems that the recruiter wasn't even notified until I sent out that email 10 days after my interview.

Now I admit I might be a bit more annoyed than I need to be due to the problems I've had with the specialist, but still. Does the process really take this long?

The only saving grace I see is on glassdoor most interns that got an offer said the process usually took 4+ weeks.

And is there anything I can do to possibly speed up the process?"
345yww,14,2015-04-28,Internship social life?,guyvango,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/345yww/internship_social_life/,"I'm interning at a well known company at a location where there are lots of intern events but the number of interns is low (50-400), so everyone will know each other and there isn't the big company ""anonymous factor"". There is also dorm-like intern housing where all the interns live. Does anyone have experience interning at a company like this? I was wondering if I would be able to not be involved socially and just do my own thing in this internship.

I'll go into a little depth about myself to give you a bit of context. I've had social anxiety(SA) issues for most of my life. Freshmen year of college was miserable for me because I always had SA because of having a roommate and having to talk to people. I've luckily been able to get my own place every year after that and been able to basically be anonymous irl. Being involved socially is a bit painful for me because it brings up feelings that I've been trying to avoid. I have been making progress with my SA and I do want to actually make friends and talk to people but only when I can do it by my own choice and have enough space to ""recover"" from talking to people.

At an internship like this, I feel like it would a bit weird for me to keep doing what I'm doing especially when everyone else will be really close to each other. I've had internships before and I can talk to people at work about work related things but that's kind of the extent of my social skills. Outside of programming related topics, I get nervous and anxious because there isn't a defined purpose to what is being discussed so my mind blanks out on how to act. All my life, I have basically had to choose between looking weird for being socially anxious or looking weird for not talking to anyone. At other companies, the latter option is usually better for me because a lot of people do their own thing.

Will I be ""that guy"" if I don't get involved in the company social life?

I have no idea what sort of resources are out there for this purpose, and since I live in a small town I'm scared said resources are non-existant. So...how does one actually fund a job search effort? 

Context: 

*Education wise: I'm currently a few weeks from wrapping up my masters degree in Electrical Engineering (Worst Idea Ever: Deciding to continue into my masters directly after undergrad. I feel like I'm in this sort of limbo-land where I'm either over or under qualified for everything so I'll never get hired.) I have money to last till this is done, but not much else.

I've almost 100% convinced myself that I the worst engineer in the history of the world. Most of my projects/internships I've worked on mostly end in a state of mostly-failure, with most of the failures (in my mind at least) having a direct line toward me. (I'm also pretty convinced that a high-school graduate has a better chance of getting a job than me, but I feel like that's more of depression talking.)

Experience: I have some internship experience (including for my thesis,) but as I am probably the worst engineer in the history of the world I'm pretty sure if any potential employer contacts them I'll be immediately removed from the process.

Network: None that I really know of. Classmates have either gone away or already been tapped. Parents will (most likely) not be options, and professors have already given what they can afaik.

In all honesty I'd rather go for a software developer role but would 'settle' for the web developer role. A lot of what I've done so far is more front-end based so I'd probably have a better shot at that too. I'm just wondering what the etiquette is for trying to apply for both roles? It's one of these places that require 'real passion' for the role so I kind of feel sending them an email saying, well I would take either role, is going to come across as me being nonchalant about both.

I know next to nothing about the CS world, and would greatly appreciate anyone taking the time to answer a couple questions!",Idiot-Warranty,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3468ds/music_major_took_cs_course_for_a_ge_credit_and/,"**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the helpful responses! I think now that I'm definitely going to go for it, especially since I was just offered an internship position today. I'm really optimistic about the future and plan on working hard to make it happen!

Hi everyone! You seem like a pretty friendly, helpful group of savvy humans so I figured why not chance a post. 

As the title states I am currently a music major. Basically, I decided I wanted to do more than math for my one of my General Ed requirements so I took Intro to CS instead of Calculus.

It's crazy... but it's like a light went on in my head. I feel like I've fallen in love with the language of programming-- its elegance, efficiency, and utility. (We're learning with Python, if that means anything.) Now, I am seriously considering and planning a complete career switch and need a couple drops of advice.

**My Questions**
My first question (or question ""set"") is this: am I just getting ahead of myself? If I love CS 121, will I probably love going through with a CS major and a CS career? Or, does the beginning just feel awesome while the reality is different?

If I'm doing well in Intro, is that a good predictor of doing well in the rest of my training, and in a career if I choose to pursue one? (I don't want to be fooled into thinking X when I've only just dipped my toe in the water.)

What are some realistic employment prospects for someone with a BA in Computer Science, no further degrees? (I'm most interested in software development/programming from what I've gathered.)

Oh yeah, one more thing, I'm almost a senior, but with my music major I can extend my financial aid for a fifth year and add BA in CS. Is the degree a better idea than loading up on CS courses, graduating next year without a BA in CS, and then self teaching afterward?

**TL;DR:**
I know next to nothing about computer science besides what I've been learning in Intro. After just one semester, though, I'm intrigued enough to seriously consider switching my entire life's path. All I know about CS is what I learned in class. Any helpful advice would be hugely appreciated!"

I currently work part time for a small start up company in a smaller city in the UK. 


I do web development part time making use of tools like php/html/css/Freemarker/Liferay, I also have some side project work in android development.


I have an interview coming up at a fairly Big company in London for an IT Operations Internship described as:

The IT department consists of seven main areas: New Business &amp; Transformation, Investment Portfolio Management, Design Authority, Development, QA, Security and Operations. As an intern, you will work largely within the IT Operations area with exposure to multiple teams responsible for our networking, voice, peripheral security, data-centers, servers, back-up, storage, databases, application support and service request fulfilment. 


I've had a lot of correspondence with both the HR/Recruitment people and feel I've communicated clearly that I do not want to go into operations and that I am looking for roles in development.

They seem at the very least not closed off to the idea of me coming and being able to talk their people and being able to find a role that would work to everybody's advantage.

That was a lot of words, but my question is:

How can I properly describe my skill set and articulate the things I am capable of to put myself in a better position of obtaining a role I want in development?  "

Here's the message 

""Good afternoon,

I was wondering if you are still interested in the position of Web Design Intern. This position will include designing and running our website, social media promotion, experience with YouTube channels, general promotion for the business to really get our name out there, etc. We need someone who would consider themselves highly experienced in all of these areas. If you are still interested, please reply with an updated resume, the best number you can be reached at, and if you are available tomorrow at 10am for an interview in Morristown, NJ.""

My questions are

1. Is this something worth it to take when it has nothing to do with my major? Should I just go look for part time job or something?

2. I mean I checked the description of job and this requires some coding and web-designing. I did put java as one of my skills when I applied for this, but I literally do not remember anything I've learned since freshmen year (which why took out the java out of my skill list after some time).

I specifically want to go to Stanford due to the combination of location, entrepreneurial spirit, and research opportunities(they are top of the field for my area of interest). 

GPA-
I will most likely have a 3.8 gpa at the end of this semester, but plan on taking the harder CS core courses sophomore year. I am slightly worried because I've gotten A-'s on all of my cs courses this year, which are offset by A's for all of the classes required for my second major (economics).  However, I also realize that a 3.8 is reasonably high. Around what gpa do grades start to not matter anymore, and what is the average for accepted applicants? 

I also find myself putting in an almost unreasonable amount of work in trying to earn A's in classes as opposed to A-'s, which are worth a gpa of 3.66ish as opposed to a 4. Are grad schools going to care about such a small differential, or am I just wasting my time? I don't inherently place any value on the actual letter grade itself and would much rather spend the time not stressing about grades and working on projects instead. It seems somewhat absurd that admissions committees would place weight on a 3% differences, but at the same time, the A-'s are cumulatively beginning to bring my gpa down.

GRE-
When should I start studying for it, and how difficult is it compared to standardized tests for undergraduate admission (SAT, ACT)? Do graduate schools place heavy emphasis on these tests?

Research-
How important is research for Master's admissions? Should I focus on gaining experience through research or internships?

Recommendations-
How should an undergraduate student go about getting 3 great recommendations from professors? I feel that most of my research work is overshadowed by masters and phd students who are substantially smarter than I am.

I recently got Academically Disqualified from school. I tried to reappeal, but it was rejected.

I want to be able to figure out how to get back to school. Currently I'm a 3rd year (next year is my last year at UCSD), Computer Science (originally Computer Engineer), and I'm done with all my GEs, except HUM from Revelle.

I was supposed to graduate Srping of 2016.

My grades have been terrible from my 2nd year to my 3rd year. Due to my lack of focus and also since I have a job. Currently I am a Software Engineer intern. 

Basically I don't think I have any excuse for my grades. I just didn't focus, and keep hanging with people who don't focus anymore since they all graduated. But, despite knowing each quarter I need to do better, I still lost focus in one class which dropped my GPA back to below a 2.0.

Last quarter (Winter 2015), I did well, but failed my ECE course since I missed a midterm and couldn't drop due to it being my 2nd time.

I pretty much only have UD left till I graduate. I want to figure out how I can re-appeal my decision. With a year left, I wanted to re appeal for Fall 2016... But I don't think I have anything to show in terms of Academics besides my job and Letters of Recommendation from Professors. The Asst. Dean told me I should switch out of Engineering even though I currently am a Software Engineer at a good company. I learned a lot from there. More than I did from school. Still, I want to complete my degree. 

Thanks, and I hope I can figure this out.

I'm 26, studied Computer Science for 4 years but didn't graduate(long story). Moved back home to take what I thought was going to be my last ""break"" after having taken a few semesters off before that. I was working retail at a dead end job in NYC, and ended up seeing an ad for a mobile developer internship at an up and coming studio. I interviewed, and eventually got the intern gig. I knew how to code and had a few mildly successful apps under my belt, so that helped.

That's all she wrote from there. Worked my ass off since, soaking up as much experience as I could about the field, industry, my platform(Android, soon to be iOS as well). Eventually started landing paying gigs as a freelance developer. I honed my skills day in and day out, working on side projects to build up my resume. I joined meetups, went to every tech conference I could get into in my area, and just networked my ass off with other devs. 

This whole time I was working, I still wanted to do my own thing. I couldn't let go of the idea that that's why I got so hooked on software engineering in the first place. You had the power to create, your world, your ideas, anything you want. And to top it off, you could just put it out there, at whatever cost/worth you deemed fit.

Fast forward 3.5 years. I'm currently working at a very big and well known media/broadcasting company as an Android engineer. Love my job, in fact it doesn't even feel like work. It's the exact same thing I would've been doing right now anyways, only for free.

I bit the bullet back in Februrary, and started my own company. We're a Creative Studio named Permoveo. Right now I have a marketing partner who I'm considering making co-founder, and I just hooked up with an ex-coworker(full stack web dev) who wants to come on board as well.

I met an iOS developer recently at a tech event who seems interested, but he also has his own thing going so we may just do some contract business going forward.

The goal is to operate much like other creative studios/agencies in that we will be doing a bunch of client work to pay the bills, but I really really want to focus a lot of my time and resources on my own passion projects and ideas. As my old boss used to say, ""all it takes is one"". I currently have a couple ideas, but only one in active development right now. 

I notice that most entrepreneurs, and creatives in general, seem to suffer from the same disease. For the life of them, they cannot bring themselves to simply focus on one idea to fruition. Their passion wanes, or they get distracted, or they get discouraged, or something comes up. I honestly believe that this is the most poisonous trait to anyone serious about making it in the tech industry, or any industry for that matter. You absolutely must be able to execute. Consistently.

Anyways, I decided not to quit my day job. At least not for now. A common theme around the entrepreneur community it seems, is that unless you quit your day job, or leave your ""safety net"", you won't be motivated enough to go at your entrepreneurial pursuits with all your might and ability. Again, I can tell you that blanket statements like this are largely false, and useless.

Frankly put, there's no way in hell that I'm going to turn away from 150k a year to pennies running my own shop. You can do both. It's possible to do both, others have done both! 

I'm single, with no kids and no crazy debt minus ~30k in student loan debt. I'm using a lot of my salary to get things off the ground currently. We're working on a small project right now and I'm paying my web developer out of my salary from my full-time job. 

I work 10-6, then come home and code from about 8-12, rinse and repeat. I don't want anyone to ""work for me"", instead I want to work with really smart and talented individuals and make us both some money. Weekends I still find time to have a social life(somewhat), but I make sure I'm structuring my days in such a way that I'm the most productive. I recommend the books ""The Power of Habit"" and ""Maximum Achievement"" by Brian Tracy for developing the mental attitude necessary to become more productive at goal setting/execution, and those are just must-reads in general. 

To be honest, so far, It's draining. But I love it. I don't want it any other way, I don't want it to be easy. I want it to be the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life(it will be), but that's what makes victory so glorious! 

I will say, I am in a bit of a unique position since my day job and my business are basically the same thing. 
We design and build apps, websites, and hopefully we'll be doing a bunch of stuff in the open source electronics and 3D printing spaces in due time(investing in a CraftBot).

This idea that you have to quit your day job needs to stop, as it's largely relative to your field and current situation. If you have the drive and willpower to balance both, go for it. I am in no way ""comfortable"", no matter what my salary is, my vision is far greater than a sum of money. I also think that's what it is. If you're truly comfortable making 6 figures, so much so that you lose your passion for owning your own business, then I'm afraid entrepreneurship is not what you're after..you're after a nice salary.

349xpg,29,2015-04-29,Things are finally turning around and I couldn't be happier,throwawaycliche1234,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/349xpg/things_are_finally_turning_around_and_i_couldnt/,"This is going to be long but I need to share this.

To all of you who think that because they are not doing as well in school that you wont be able to find a job and aren't good enough to be an engineer I want to tell you that isn't true. The past two semesters have been pretty rough. I am currently about to enter my senior year in AeroE, I have had a low 2.5~ Gpa for a while now after doing poorly in dynamics/DiffEq last spring. I have been down in the dumps ever since and honestly a lot of posts on here have not helped how I was feeling. I finally realized at the beginning of the semester that I needed some help from the outside. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with depression, my doctor suggested medicine along with seeking help from counseling and change in diet and exercise. I took her words to heart and started working out every day along with eating a lot healthier. I then went to counseling student services and got some great free help. With all of those things I've really turned around this semester. I changed my work ethic a lot and am studying at least twice as much as past semester. I am sitting at A's in nearly all of my classes this semester at 18credit hours. Another thing that was getting me down was the lack of internship opportunities. I have always heard you need that 3.0 otherwise you're just thrown out of the runnings, but I applied to any and every company. I have been working as an undergraduate research assistant since my freshman year so I have work experience but I was still pessimistic. Eventually I heard back from only two of the companies and the interviews went fantastic. After a few rounds of interviews I managed to land an internship with one of the big Aerospace names! I just want to pass my positive feelings to all of you. If you think that you have not shot you're wrong. Working out and getting outside has helped so much. I've been able to lose all of my negative thoughts just from exercising and clearing my head. Sometimes all it takes is just a little motivation and a lot of hard work. Sorry for the rant guys!  

TL;DR: Did shitty in past semesters, thought it was a lost cause, changed habits this semester and worked my ass off, ended up landing my dream internship and should finish this semester with a ~3.7 Gpa"
34a7bx,12,2015-04-29,amney,beforethewind,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/34a7bx/amney/,"My uncle started hospice last weekend. 

He is not terribly old. Of course, he is not terribly young, either. He is my grandmother’s brother, on my mother’s side of the family and he is dying. I am sitting on his bedside and outside, far away, police sirens are roaring. He was always our uncle, but he was more of a cousin, he was more of a peer. Uncle was a child at heart. With my brother and I being the only children in the family, he was our de facto cousin. He was the family friend we could relate to. He was not a condescending source of maturity; he was as ridiculous and optimistic as we were. The fact that he is dying destroys us. It destroys me. An obnoxious measure of sirens blots out my thoughts. 

Adam is taking it with particular difficulty. He is the truest baby of the family and my younger (and only) brother. That is not to say that the rest of the family is coping any easier. Uncle Jack was the youngest of his siblings, as well. It is a terrible situation no matter how you word it. He would always be the one telling me, “John, you take care of Adam if anything ever happens to us,” meaning, the older relatives and my parents. That advice gives me little solace today. 

Uncle Jack was a police officer for many years. He married a beautiful woman who we came to love as our aunt in his early thirties and that was probably the symbolic ending of our “peer relationship” with him. At that point, he was our elder. We were no longer arbitrary cousins. It ironed out the family. We knew who we were and what our family consisted of, at last. Adam was almost out of middle school when this happened and I was just graduating high school. 

It is incredible what a decade can do to your being. Adam is now a police officer, very much so following in the footsteps of his beloved uncle. But Uncle Jack, dearest uncle… he is not nearly as thriving. He maintained a lustrous career in the New York Police Department and was looking forward to retiring by fifty. Instead, he contracted a rare cancer, probably due to a consistent bout of responding to emergency calls in this one devastated area of the city. You know the area: uprooted partitions of asbestos and every god damned carcinogen known to man were crudely molded into low-income housing. Now, every time some schmuck with a gun let a slug fly, these chemicals became airborne. These chemicals infected the lungs of the men and women who were there to protect the innocent bastards who were unfortunate enough to live in these areas, to live besides the walking scum of mankind that fought such petty wars. And now he was dying, before sixty years of age. 

I will not get into the philosophy and utter bullshit that comes into play when discussing such matters. Would a just god allow a kind and fair person to die before the age of seventy? Would an omnipotent universe allow a schoolyard of young child to be slain at the end of a gun belonging to a madman? I am not one to even begin rationalizing these conversations and will sure as hell not begin to do so here. The fact remained: my uncle was dying and my family was preparing for the absolute worst. And we struggled against futile efforts. 

Adam and I, we grew up and matured under almost direct-influence from my uncle. Of course my dearest mother and father crafted our personalities. Of course our friends and schoolmates helped to form our ideas. But, as far as anything beyond our genetic destinations, our uncle was probably singlehandedly responsible for our identifications as selves. From our profound interest in the afterlife to our preference to spending the weekends playing paintball in the mountains, he forged us. Honing in on the whole “afterlife” aspect of our interests, he gifted us one item that truly solidified our love for the macabre. When I was just beginning high school, however many years ago, our dearest uncle gave my brother and I a simple Ouija board. 

It was a mass-produced and super commercialized item. We were, concurrently, super skeptical, but my brother was feebly open-minded and I was always looking for a way to spook myself and my family out. The silly board game even had a “glow in the dark” feature that added to the ridiculous nature of the whole ordeal. This led to Adam and I spending countless afternoons in the basement, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the dark, peering into the softly glowing, barely visible face of the Ouija board. 

My skepticism had never left me and Adam was never particularly deft in the craft of manufacturing a storyline and characters of a fictional persona. So, when we began “meeting” otherworldly beings and dead humans through this board game, I was a little bit more than pleased and worried with our findings. Whenever we would ask their names, we would get a handful of random letters that only loosely resembled realistic names. But their backstories would always be spelt with the utmost of tact and grammar. While their names were gibberish, their explanations were perfect. It was a tad unsettling, sitting as the elder in the room. 	

With all of this apparent fright, let it be known that I was never upset with my younger brother. I did not receive these paranormal readings as malcontent on his part. It just surprised me, at times in pride, at others in fear, that he could move the dial on the Ouija board and spell out entire life stories of people who had lived in the 14th, 18th, and 19th century. How did he, a public student living in 21st century America, know the politics of Luxemburg? How did he know that women in historical China would bind their feet? How would he, a boy who had barely begun to pick up the guitar, know what a mandolin was? I could not tell if it was my practical joking getting the best of him and I concurrently or if otherworldly forces were at play. Could this ridiculous board game actually channel… something else? Of course not. I refused to believe it. It must have been something about our subconscious or some other psychological phenomena that I could not explain.

Time went on and I found other vices to occupy my time. I found petty flirtations with girls my age that never came to fruition. Young puppy love and relations that never manifested themselves into an actual relationship. I was far too afraid to actually ask a girl out on a date, so these feelings only resulted in my confiding with my good friends. But I had not kept tabs on my younger brother. As where I had grown tired of playing with the Ouija board, Adam kept at it with his friends and even, at times, by himself. In the days that we had played with the device, we had “met” an entity known as Xenon. It was a completely ridiculous and unbelievable name, but she was supposedly an Asian immigrant of the Luxemburg storyline that I had previously alluded to. She was a servant of a household in the European micro-nation. She had also played the sitar. How my brother had created these characters, I have no idea. My imagination was certainly not at play and I, even as a younger teenager, truly did not try to disenfranchise the results of the board by creating my own metaphysical stories to frighten my brother. 

I allowed them to play with the board without supervision for quite some time. He had shown it to various girls and boys from the neighborhood whenever I was working at the local craft store. As I had said, I was no longer interested in the game, but his young mind surely was. Life went on. 

As we grew up a bit, we would cater to our love for the paranormal through alternative means. Fortunately for us, it became a topic of popular culture and many television series and specials were produced for broadcast programming. This allowed for our parents to become involved in our hobby. After a few episodes of a ghost hunting show on television, my mom confessed, with a slight bit of sarcasm and enthusiasm, that she had thought she had seen a “woman standing in our living room, late at night.” This was, of course, an appeal to my brother and I, an attempt at stirring our imagination. I nodded and worked on my dinner as Adam stared in amazement and swore that he, too, had seen such a manifestation. Our dog, a small Jack Russell Terrier, entirely white except for a splotch of brown on her head, took this opportunity to steal some food off of his plate. The little rat had always sat right behind Adam, sharing his chair and hoping that he dropped food. 

Having been next in line for our creative development (behind my beloved uncle), my mother would consistently drop little story starters into our daily lives and never provide much more to go on. Much like the short story about the woman in the living room, she would give us a mental image and an out-of-the-ordinary situation, and let the ideas cultivate in our young minds. This continued for a long time and at certain points, I could not tell if she was merely being whimsical or actually telling stories which had occurred in her life. I remember when I was a freshman in college, visiting home for the winter, she swore that when she was working on her computer in the kitchen, our dog walked past her legs and into her bed which was typically at my mother’s feet. She reached down to pet my dog and realized nothing was there. A few moments later, after searching, she found the dog sleeping upstairs. 

Weeks later, after watching one of these television series with the entire family, we found ourselves enjoying a scene, invariably scripted beyond oblivion, of the “paranormal investigators” utilizing a Ouija board and attempting to talk to spirits in the attic of an old house in Washington State. Adam sat there on the couch, with this knees held against his chest in rapt attention. It was pleasant to see that childhood enthusiasm alive and well. Although he had still regularly played with the board, seeing this television show had completely rekindled his love of the game. He asked that I would play with him that weekend when he had his friends over. 

There were two boys and a girl. They were all around fourteen years old and, naturally, little shits. There is really no other way to put it. I am all but positive that one of them and the girl were a couple. He’d take every opportunity of physical contact as a grace-lacking attempt at touching a personal area of the girl’s body. Were this incident to occur today, modernly, there would absolutely be harassment issues brought up between the girl and the boy, their school’s guidance counselor, and possibly the police. But that is merely my age revealing itself. Unfortunately, the curse of young adulthood and piss-poor personalities did not keep its hands off of my younger brother. 

Before we began the séance, we sat around the board and Adam gave the instructions, their objectives, and his “house rules” of sorts. The girl lit three candles and turned the lights off at his request. He warned his friends to be very serious in this exercise. He warned that it could be a lot of fun, but that they may end up talking to very powerful and sometimes malicious entities. He did not want them to display any disrespect or rudeness, because he frequently had spoken with “demons” who had initially introduced themselves as benevolent spirits. One of the boys asked what he meant and Adam, appealing to the annoying nature I had previously mentioned, told him that he would be temporarily cursed. Further inquiring to what Adam meant, he told him that “whenever he went into the bathroom, your face would be replaced with white eyes and a horrible screaming mouth” – I intervened and told him to knock it off. There was no point in playing with this if you were going to be a lying schmuck throughout the ordeal. 

He laughed at my objectivity and apologized. The three others laughed nervously too: they still believed in my brother’s ridiculous warning. No such “curse” ever came about, so there’s always that. Ha.
Before long, we encountered an entity that refused to give a name. The boys teased, saying that it was afraid of us, and the board said, simply, “bullshit.” They asked if it was a boy or a girl and it did not respond, again. The group was quiet for a little bit, nervous, and the girl hazarded, “Are you a demon?” The room was still for a moment, then the dial moved, all of our hands on it: yes, you little slut. I chalked it up to the touchy-feely boy, but he looked as shocked as everyone else. They were a little upset. 

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

34abaw,0,2015-04-29,Need advice on rejecting an internship after already accepting the offer.,watamidoingwithlife,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/34abaw/need_advice_on_rejecting_an_internship_after/,"So, I accepted an internship offer at a company that was relatively close to home and paid well, especially for the low-cost of living in the area. It's not exactly something I wanted to do, but since it was already March, I went ahead and accepted it. 

Now I just received an offer from a company that is very cutting-edge and would overall help my career much more just having their name on my resume. It's in an awesome place (Bay Area, CA) where I would get paid enough to live relatively comfortably for 3 months. 

So my question is, how bad is it to reject a company after already signing the offer letter, especially since I'm supposed to start in less than 2 weeks? How exactly should I go about contacting the first company? I wouldn't do this until I signed the second company's offer and they confirmed it, which probably wouldn't be until next week. 

If I should reject it, how detailed do I have to be and should I call or is e-mail enough? 

Thanks in advance!

I have worked a few jobs, and my current one offered me full time position after I graduate, but I need to be interviewed again so I'm not sure if this is a rejection. I haven't looked into other jobs because of time restraints.

So there's a few things I want to point out:

* I don't really like the work environment I was in and I don't think I'll be paid enough to keep me happy, story of almost every person tho
* It's all self-learning in the company, even during the internship, so there's only going to be a wall that I'm going to hit eventually, that or I'll be banging my head against the desk
* I want to go to grad school but I haven't taken standardized tests yet and deadline is coming up as well as finals, gotta work hard because my GPA ain't looking so hot
* I don't want to work full-time or at least that many hours so I can concentrate on studies and other self-improvement activities like the lone wolf I am, but I'm not sure how to bring it up or when to bring that up

I'm planning on asking about the hours if they do hire me. I have already told my employer that I want to go to grade school. Have not discussed salary.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do is the best course of action and I hope you guys can help me out or guide me in the right direction.

Also, I don't have a github or anything of the sort and my development work has been internal company stuff. So I can't post any of the sort on github anyway. How important or enticing is it to include it in a resume for future job prospects?

I am in a bit of a situation that I need some advice in. I received and accepted a full-time offer from a company this spring semester, that has a start date of August . Before the fall semester, I was planning on earning my undergraduate degree in May but I was forced to drop one of my classes for my major this semester and now my graduation date (3 weeks away) will have to be delayed to the following fall 2015 semester. The classes that I need to graduation are not offered in the summer so I can not complete it then.

I was a part of and completed this company's internship program last summer and performed very well and had many positive reviews coming from full-time professionals including the internship program coordinator. Throughout the interview process for this full-time opportunity, they continued to give my good praise and really wanted me to be apart of their company.

What is the best way to approach letting my hiring manager know that my graduation date has now been delayed?

Should I ask if I can be considered for the internship program this summer again?

Will the delay of my graduation due to a necessary drop of my class negatively affect my relations with this company that I would love to work for in the future?

34bey0,7,2015-04-29,Respectfully reneging on former employer's offer with 4 months notice... nasty response back,atalossforjobadvice,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/34bey0/respectfully_reneging_on_former_employers_offer/,"Dear All, 

Today I had to renege on an offer from a former employer. I worked there for 2 years as an intern and they told me I would have a full time position upon finishing up school. Then out of the blue they told me that they would not have a position available due to some restructuring... And so I began my job hunt... about a month later they told me, actually we will accept you, here's the offer letter. I signed it - it was on an at-will basis with a start date for Mid-august. I had to accept it because I had nothing else going for me at the time and with graduation looming large, I couldn't say no. They gave me less than 3 days to respond to the offer which pinned me in an unpleasant situation.


.


. 

This was in December and all this time I was worried that they would flip flop their minds again on me (note, they gave me an offer for 25,000 less than verbally promised initially when I was interning). I had to accept it because I had no other options at the time. 

With the job hunt, I applied to over 200 positions, had about 15 interviews... I finally landed a position with a 30 minute commute round trip versus 2 hour commute roundtrip. I accepted that position and today I was given an offer letter - I then emailed my former employer and very very respectfully informed them due to personal reasons of not living in the area after I finish school, I won't be able to work for them. 

**I got a VERY nasty response back that took shots at me personally when I had to take a couple weeks off when I had surgery for cancer - which they trivialized in the email and was just exceptionally rude.**

..

..
..


 They claimed that I was essentially stabbing them in the back and that at this point in the game they wouldn't be able to find someone else and there will be an empty space.. 


.

.

Let me inform you all that the reason a position was available was due to someone going to graduate school, that person will be there until mid- August (when I was supposed to start).**I feel as though giving them 4 months notice was respectful of me. I didn't spring it upon them in the last week before starting?**
.

.


The position I accepted pays a very competitive rate and the 30 minute round trip commute versus 2 hours will significantly improve my quality of life. Something that means a lot to me with all the health struggles I had last year. Not to mention I would be working 8 hours per day instead of 11 hours per day at my former employer. 


.
.
.

**My concern is that my employment at the new company contingent satisfactory references from previous employer... Am I completely screwed here?** 

Do you all have any advice in this situation? Thank you so much for your help!! 


...


...


...
**EDIT: My apologies on the format.  Here's a TL;DR - Company A was former employer when I interned, Company A flip flopped back and forth and then gave me an offer at the very beginning of year which I took because I had no other option. I had commenced searching for other jobs at that point, Company B comes in and presents me with offer today which I couldn't refuse. Today I had to renege on Company A - who was furious. Company B needs satisfactory reference from previous employer for offer to hold. Company A is pissed and I'm worried about getting terrible review?**"
34bjj5,3,2015-04-29,mechanical engineering student considering switching to computer science,Jeida,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34bjj5/mechanical_engineering_student_considering/,"Hi everyone,

So I am a mechanical engineering student in my 4th semester at a good technical university in Denmark. I sort of ended up in ME after way too much pondering and asking for advice from too many student counselors, even though my initial intention was to do computer engineering... anyhow, it is kind of too late now.
The only courses I have enjoyed so far are maths, matlab and electronics design and to a certain extent control systems. I have struggled my way through mechanics and even though I got decent grades I can't stomach it. Same could be said for machine design, CAD, FEM which i almost failed... 
At the moment, I feel extremely demotivated to continue and feel so bored by lack of applicable skills, feel like I have wasted time on all this theory and machine design which is useless unless you have access to industrial resources. In other words, I feel like if I did computer science instead I could be creative and productive on a daily basis without needing external resources, does that make sense? So whenever I get the time, which is very rare since ME studies are way too challenging for me, I find myself trying to learn more programming (mainly improving html skills and python)

But what I would like your opinions on is this:
I have only one semester of courses left for my ME degree besides the internship semester and the bachelor's thesis. And I just found out that I can do an online bachelor's degree in computer science in with a Swedish university. 
Do you guys think this would be manageable if I am already struggling with ME studies?
Would it be smarter to drop ME and switch 100% to software engineering instead? 

If I went on with my ME but graduated with a poor GPA , and did the computer science online degree from a rather unheard of university, do you think I would still have chances of landing a good job within comp. sci. ? or would i just be taken less serious &amp; considered as a confused, unfocused person? 
should i just take whatever skills i can get from the studies and focus more on developing a portfolio instead of caring too much about the diplomas?

Also, like many others, I was wondering if I have a chance to get in. I will have a B.S. in CS and a B.S. in Mathematics from University of Maryland Baltimore County. Graduating with ~3.4 overall GPA and a ~3.9 GPA for comp sci. My work experience was only an internship over the summer as an associate web engineer, and a semester of being a peer tutor for a 200 level computer science class."
34bxzh,3,2015-04-29,"I'm a third year computer science student, the semesters are making me increasingly anxious and a stressed out mess. Is this similar for anyone else?",ryman2012,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34bxzh/im_a_third_year_computer_science_student_the/,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I just wanted to know if anyone else can relate.

I'm 22, and I've always loved computers and knew I wanted a career in something computer related.

I didn't have high enough marks out of high school to get straight into the comp sci program, so I did economics for a couple semesters. After that I realized I would never enjoy a job in that, so I did what I needed to do and got improved to switch majors.

I sort of lacked motivation for the first little bit, but once I got an internship (that I'm still working at part time, programming), I knew I needed to get through the degree.

My first semester back after a year at the internship just ended, and I'm really scared about my upcoming semesters.

This semester was terrible for me mentally, I was anxious, stressed, always feeling an impeding sense of doom or failure related to school, etc.

I was only taking 3 courses (calc II, databases, and computer graphics), but just the stress of it all gets at me.

The biggest part if just not knowing how your doing, or not doing as well as I wish.

In Calculus II had a final percentage of 51% and in graphics I had 65%. I got a C+ in calc and an A in graphics. The whole semester I was freaking out and worried I was going to fail. I remember for graphics crying on the floor for an hour trying to do a graphics assignment I spent 20 hours on and was stuck.

I'm still working 20 hours a week, but I feel like I need to. I would be so depressed if I didn't have the balance of being able to work, go to school and be social. Sometimes going to work is the only thing that kept me sane from school.

This upcoming summer I can only take one course, Numerical Analysis. My friend just took in and got 40-something percent in the course and ended up with a C+. Its stuff like this that just makes me sick to my stomach knowing I can work my ass off and get terrible percentage marks and then get a C+.

I feel like a large percentage of it is because I don't feel confident in learning and getting help I need. Its just not available. I have the time to put into all this, but I go to lectures and the professors are terrible and I feel like I learnt nothing, I try to go to the 1 hour office hours they have a week (that get cancelled for who knows what reason), and they aren't very helpful. It just feels like I'm always completely on my own to learn things despite paying to at least have someone teach me partially. I understand its how it works, but sometimes I find the lectures to just be waste of my time depending on the professor. I feel like the school can do a way better job teaching than it does.

I only have 2 retakes left, and 50 credits left to graduate, and I'm just not looking forward to the stress and anxiety from all this. I'm terrified I'm going to fail too many things or something and not be able to graduate.

Is it always this stressful?"

I'll hold a B.Sc in Computer Science with a decent GPA. There were quite a few important concepts that went over my head this semester and I've become burnt out due to the difficulty of the subject and several personal issues outside of college.


I intend to take the summer off to take a road trip, maybe go hiking, clear my head while casually learning some of the important topics, such as data structures and algorithms, and do a little development to improve my coding. 


Now, I fully intend to start interviewing in late August or September, perhaps taking some freelance jobs during the summer to sustain my basic needs. I might shoot for an internship to test the waters and pick an area that best reflects my goals in life? I've only done academic research in computer vision and data mining for mobile devices and a few freelance web development gigs.


Am I ruining my chances of getting a solid job, given I'm going to take the summer off to reclaim my mental focus? I'm burnt out and want to start off strong when I do land a job.


Thanks for reading."

I am 21, from China, college student, he is 29, real estate agent, American. 

About 4 months ago, I found him cheating after he was being emotionally abusive to me. After many struggles, I agreed to not leave. And now this relationship just feels wrong yet I cannot name what's wrong. I, of course, want this relationship and love him a lot, but...

I feel that he is not putting much effort into the relationship. It feels like he just wants to keep me there until he finds the next best one. I have this feeling because he plays Ingress (a game) and Dota (another game) more than he spends time with me. Also, he would put hours of effort to create a wonderful mission for Ingress game, but I truly forget the last time we did something together besides he had sex with me, played game with me, eating food with me, or sleeping with me. Undeniably, as Chinese, I tend to want guys to initiate events. I, actually, tried to propose some but he was either working, had already had an Ingress playing party (where people play the game together), or ""it is not a good time today"". 

He is also distancing me in a sense... He basically never calls me nor wants to video chats with me, and we can only be physically together at weekends because I have school. He also rarely texts back. Guys like real interaction more, I get it; he also argues that he just texts more often than calls and most of times he just feels he has nothing to say. You may wonder how he got me at the first place if that is him...He was not like this at the first!

He also becomes more silence besides not replying messages or not communicating on a daily bases. He always has this annoying problem that he get distracts very easily during conversations, because he honestly uses distraction as a runaway to deal with the pressures in conversations. I cannot tell enough how annoying this is, and this is becoming worse. He asked me 1 month ago if I wanted to room with him in the summer because he tries to move out from his current place and I will need a place in town for my internship, and I said yes. Now I have to move out from my dorm in 15 days, he still has not acted. (Since he is the real estate agent here, he takes the responsibility to find housing) After many times asking him, finally I said ""do you just not want to live together anymore"" and he EVENTUALLY said YES. I do not understand why he could not just tell me instead of avoiding the question, which causes me much trouble and pressure now. 

He always says he loves me, but I feel that he would only give me some attention from his life when i am physically close to him, when I talk about the potential of having a 3some (yes he DEMANDED for it), or when I cry. He used to give me much more attention if I got upset, and now he just uses silence. This poor communication and the indifference it shows make me feel really difficult about this relationship. 

Now whenever I talk about something, he says I am messing up with his head.

He says he loves me, but I cannot feel it unless I am 1)being extreme 2)talking about 3some or 3)before he wants to have sex with me. 

I do not know what's wrong. I think everything is wrong. I am so upset. Can somebody help me please?"
34cx1j,2,2015-04-29,"I want to become an engineer, currently an apprentice electrician, will this help in the long run (I don't want to be an electrician forever)?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/34cx1j/i_want_to_become_an_engineer_currently_an/,"Sorry, I don't know how to word my title, but I could really use some advice. I am 20 years old and want to be an engineer some day. I haven't quite decided between electrical or biomedical engineering. But that's not my main concern. I'm an electrician apprentice right now, only 6 months in. I've heard that having this practical knowledge will help me in my future with being an engineer. Give me a leg up hopefully.
However, in the 6 months I've been in the program, I have been laid off twice already (both in the last 2 months). First time, I messed up and was gone from work a lot. I was having a hard time deciding if I wanted to actually be an electrician or not. But to make this short, it's probably why I got laid off from the job (not sure though b/c 30-40 other people got laid off and some of them were there everyday working hard.) We were told they just didn't need as big of manpower anymore. Second time happened today. I have to go to school every 8 weeks or so for a one week period. Afterwards I go back to work the following week. Well I was laid off for about 2 weeks before I was called to take this job, and I had a changed attitude when I took it. I didn't want to be that ""missing work guy"" anymore and just wanted to be a good, hard worker, especially if this was really going to help me become an engineer. Well I'm in school this week, and I received a letter of termination and my check. I know the project I was on was supposed to be finished up next week so they probably didn't need me, but it sucks. I'm in the JATC program and we have multiple contractors that take the apprentices to train them. However, one company just laid off 15 apprentices, the company I was working for last just laid off a good amount of people from the job I was on about two weeks ago ( I don't know how many were apprentices), and I got laid off with my company.
Pretty much, this comes down to, is this worth it? I've heard a lot and even read that a trade is a good skill to know. Especially electrician. Too many college students, not enough skilled workers, etc. But will sticking this out really give me a good edge for engineering? I'm attending school this summer to major in electrical, was going to do part-time throughout my apprenticeship and once I journeyed out, I would hopefully get an internship. Anyways, some things I know: 1- I don't want to be an electrician forever. I have asthma and value my health quite a bit. I respect all electricians, but I feel engineering would be better suited for me in the long run. I got into the program b/c my uncle gave me a heads up on it when I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. 2- Even though I don't want to be an electrician my whole life, I still have the goal of being a renaissance man. I want the skills you gain from the electrical field (I like what I'm learning, just don't like the work environment a whole lot), but the knowledge of an engineer. I want to create things to help society. Maybe eventually move into the business world one day. I just want to do a vast amount of things with my life. Multiple page resume if you were.
It's hard for me to know if this trade will truly help me in the long run. I can't plan anything in advance, because I don't know when I'll be laid off. The job roles with the economy. 5 years is a long time to deal with this. I feel I am a good worker, I know I am. I made my mistakes starting out in the apprenticeship, but I know what I am capable of. I'm rambling right now, I'm frustrated. I don't have much money and unemployment can barely cover my expenses. Especially going back to school next month. I can't get a job b/c I would have to leave it the moment the apprenticeship called me. Any advice or encouragement could definitely help right now. thank you. 

tl;dr: want to be an engineer, currently an electrician apprentice hoping practical skills will give me a leg up in the engineering industry, however the stresses and lay offs of the apprenticeship are making me really consider if it's worth sticking out, I do like what I am learning though, just don't like the work environment"

As an avid (blank), I was very excited to learn that an opening for an internship was available for (blank). As a student of public health, I’m very interested and eager to learn more about the position and hopefully get an opportunity to talk face-to-face about it. Going down the list of requirements for the opening- I’m your perfect candidate. If you’re interested in someone who is capable and willing to create original content while searching and reporting related stories while doing interviews to really bring awareness to issues, look no further.

This is the part of my cover letter in which Google is tells me to brag about my accomplishments. Instead of boring you to death with a plethora of bullet points, here are just three (3!) reasons why the jobs that I had make me the ideal candidate for this opening:

I’m highly skilled at communicating with people. My experience with working on a campaign as a volunteer coordinator helped me with dictating and processing information at a rapid pace while maintaining the quality of work that my employers enjoyed.

My work at (blank) gave me a real affinity for charitable work. I say *real* affinity because I’m all too familiar with being able to help one day and forget the next. Long gone are the days that I take my education and family for granted.

Lastly, my work as a receptionist in a residential building taught me more than I could have ever expected. My exceptional logistics and organizational skills are due to managing calls, packages, guests and cleaning at (blank).

All in all, an internship at (blank) feels like a definite step in the right direction for me. I can guarantee you that I want this internship more than any other candidate, and you will be very pleased with the quality of work that I deliver to your team. I hope to hear from you soon.

I tried searching around the sub-reddit for something like this, but couldn't find anything in particular.

I'm finding some conflicting info regarding qualifications/job searching results around the web. I've read some stories where people with very reputable Master's degrees(some even with PhD's) in quantitative fields (stats, math, comp sci) with a few years of relevant experience who claim they can't get a job.

Then, there are some who will claim if you have a strong foundation, maybe an advanced degree, and get a couple years of relevant internships/positions, you should be set to make your way into the field.

For those who have gone through the process, what do you think is reasonable to expect for those who are trying to get into the field? Also, I'm wondering what is meant by ""Entry Level"" data science positions. Are we talking actual positions titled data scientist, and if so, I don't seem to see many of these positions that are entry level. Or are we maybe talking positions like ""quantitative analyst"" or ""data analyst""

Obviously there is no formula. A degree from X university and 3 years on your resume won't give you a data scientist job at some great company, and countless other factors (connections, interview skills, etc.). But I'm just wondering what some people's experiences might have been like. Let me know what you guys think!


(My story: Getting a Master's in Applied Stats at a very reputable university this year; not much professional experience but will try to get a good internship this year; have just begun learning python)

What should I do?",terrablezach,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34dpue/offered_an_internship_by_one_company_still/,"I went through an interview around a week ago for a company (let's call them ""Company A"") and they have just sent me an email offering me a future internship after I have gotten a security clearance. Here is the email that they sent me  (formatted with parenthesis around sensitive information).

&gt; Hi (/u/terrablezach),
&gt; 
&gt; I just wanted to let you know that we will be getting you an offer for a future internship with (Company A) soon. This internship would require you to go through the security clearance process, which can take 4-8 months. But given that you don't graduate until (Date), we have time on our side.
&gt; 
&gt; Please let me know if you have any questions and we'll get you the official paperwork soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; (Company A Employer)

Earlier the same day that this email was sent to me, I had an interview with another company (let's call them ""Company B"").

Company A seems to have the requirement of me going through a security clearance before I can start an internship there.

Company B seems to have no requirement like this, and if I were to get an internship there I would get the security clearance as I work on unclassified material and I wouldn't have to wait until I got my clearance to start the internship.

Also, Company B gave me a rough figure of how much I would be making hourly if I were to get the internship. I don't want to disclose how much, but I like the amount very much. Company A has not given me a rough figure yet.

What should I do in this situation? What should i tell the employer of Company A? I would like to wait and see if I am offered an internship at Company B, I think I would prefer to work there because I could start immediately and I know roughly what I would be making.

Does anyone have any advice for me?"
34dz61,1,2015-04-30,Trouble choosing between computational math and computer science,letslearnmath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34dz61/trouble_choosing_between_computational_math_and/,"Hello, I am having a difficult time picking my major, I have had a back and forth with computer science and math for awhile now and I am currently at the point where I need to make a decision. So my options are, comp sci major with minor in applied/computational math, or applied/computational math with cs minor.

A little bit about the programs, the computational math degree is about 1/3 pure math (analysis, abstract algebra, etc), 1/3 stats (probability/stats/more advanced stats courses), and 1/3 applied/computer based math (PDEs, differetnial equation simulation, numerical analysis, scientific computing, etc). 
Computer science is split between programming related courses (data structures, software engineering, a general languages course), part math (discrete, stats, and algorithms), part hardware/low level (MIPS assembly, courses over building virtual machines to parse languages, and operating systems). 

I am currently computer science but am considering switching. With the minor in CS I will have taken data structures, software engineering (goes over design patterns, unit testing, etc), discrete math, and algorithms. So I will be left out of the language parsing, virtual machine interpreting, and low level assembly courses. 

So my question is, if I want a typical software engineer job would the math degree + comp sci minor cut it? I have one internship as a software engineering intern, and I am looking to find another internship next summer. I feel that I will have a solid foundation for programming (through software engineering, algorithms, and data structures) and will be able to code general software. I am not looking for an intense compiler building job, or embedded systems, just a typical java developer, or ruby on rails, something like that. I have been doing programming as a hobby for awhile and I feel that most of what will make me a better developer is going to come from experience building software. I feel that I am kind of missing out on being able to learn something really interesting to me (math), by continuing on into parts of CS I am not particularly interested in, and may not even need much familiarity with. If it makes sense, math is what I want to study, but software engineering is what I want to do as a career. Any advice? Can I make this happen?

There are multiple web applications that pull from many different databases of different types. We've clicked around on the site and everything looks good so we've asked the departments that use the intranet to assign a group of test employees to use the new site for a couple weeks. 

I was wondering if there's some program I can make use of that would 'click through' our multiple applications and spam them with different query parameters to try to produce errors. If I would have to write such a thing myself, how would I go about doing that? (I know it probably wouldn't be worth the time at this point, just curiosity)"

Starting next semester I will be doing the Computer Science major in which I will be learning to program in Java. Right now, I am learning C++ hoping that by the time my classes start I will be able to make simple programs. After I feel comfortable in C++, I plan to move on to Python. If all goes well, I will graduate in 2 years with my degree in Computer Science, knowing the languages Python, Java, and C++. My question is, is that a decent combination? I am interested in Video Game design but I´m not hell-bent on it. My main hope is to find a decent entry level job. I will be looking for a summer internship during my senior year to help my chances.

TLDR: My 4 questions

    Is Java, C++ and Python a good combination of languages?
    Could someone give a very rough estimate of what entry-level salary I might make knowing C++, Java, and Python? (Rough because I know there are many other factors that determine that number)
    What might be my responsibilities in a job I might find? Could I be using all 3 languages at the same time or might I never use one of them again, like if I go into gaming and not use Java.
    What are my chances of finding a job right out of college, if I have a decent GPA (let's say 3.7 in the major)?

I paced across my hotel room swirling a glass of gin, lost in thought. Tomorrow I had a meeting with the Louisiana Bank to view the old school that Robert Jennings had looked into. When I told them I was interested in buying the place they were a little surprised, and when I heard there was next to no interest in the place, I was surprised as well. The house, albeit dilapidated and in need of repair, was beautiful. The woman I spoke with on the phone informed me that the school had become somewhat of a local spook story for the townspeople. It was shut down when the funding ran out, and a lot of the students and their families were really upset with how the local government had chosen to send them elsewhere rather than provide additional funds. After that it went on the market, but I guess no one felt quite right about taking something that had done such good for those children. Fast forward a few bad storms and no maintenance later and the place had become a paranormal attraction, although no real activity had ever been documented there.

I took a long sip of gin and gulped it down. I couldn’t believe how accustomed to this shit I’ve become. While I wasn’t much of a drinker before, I had always had a taste for whiskey. Now this is all I can drink.

The hotel room I was staying in was dark and musty. My bank account was starting to run low now that I’ve been living without income for more than two months, and I couldn’t afford to spend lavishly. I thought about writing some prescriptions and selling them but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. While the money would be great to have, I refused to turn my back on who I used to be. Who knows? Maybe this school will offer some new information I could use to possibly kill Ubloo. Kill? I shook my head. It’s a fucking voodoo curse, how do you even kill something like that?

I put my hands against my dresser and leaned forward over my glass of gin, watching the ice cubes bobble and clink against the sides.

“Doctor.”

It came from behind me. I spun around so fast I nearly fell, and my eyes had to adjust to the rapid movement. Before me, someone was beginning to come into view.

It was Andrew.

We stood there and stared at each other. He had on a plain black shirt and jeans. His hair was messy and tangled, and his once familiar bright green eyes were replaced by balls of pure white.
“Doctor, why are you here?” He spoke again.

My words caught in my throat, but finally I managed to push them out.

“I’m trying to find a way out, Andrew. I’m trying to beat it. I’m trying to beat Ubloo.”

Andrew slowly shook his head at this.

“You can’t beat Ubloo, Doctor. You can’t.” He said. “Ubloo is always there, always waiting, always watching.”

We stood in silence, my stomach churning in depression and nervousness.

“Well I have to try Andrew.” I finally spoke. “I have to try, because I can’t let this happen to someone else, I just can’t.”

And then I saw it. It slunk out of the shadows behind Andrew with slow, almost clumsy movements. Its skin was slick and gray, pulled taut against his body, and I saw every bone and muscle twitch and move as it hobbled over on its six long legs. It had to be at least six feet tall, probably more, and this was hunched down on its knees. Its big round head and those deep black eyes stared right into me. While it had no pupils I could tell it was watching my every move, examining me. The long trunk that dangled from its head swayed back and forth as it walked, as if it hung limp. It stopped just behind Andrew as he began to speak again.

“It will happen to someone else Doctor.” His white eyes staring right at me. “There is only one way out now.”

Ubloo’s trunk reached up and pressed itself to Andrew’s ear. I then saw its long, thin black tongue emerge from Andrew’s nose and he let out a shrill scream.

I covered my ears with my hands and slumped down against the dresser.

“NO! STOP IT!” I screamed, but to no avail.

Andrew’s flesh began sloughing off his bones in sloppy chunks, dripping like candlewax and exposing his skeleton and muscle tissue. He continued screaming as his body turned to a soupy pile at his feet. I watched as his face melted and revealed his jaw bone, and then I heard a sharp twang and saw his jaw muscle snap, and the bone fall crooked at an angle, all the while screaming in agony.

“PLEASE! I CAN’T! I JUST CAN’T ANYMORE! END THIS PLEASE!”

And with that Andrew stopped, his jaw still hung open. He was nothing but a half-skeleton now, with bits of meat and entrails caught between his bones that hadn’t made it to the floor. He was frozen, and then his head snapped and turned to look at me, and the balls of white rolled from the back of his head to reveal those bright green horrible eyes. Behind him Ubloo watched all the while.

“The end is the beginning Doctor.”

And then his skeleton shattered and his remains fell to the floor in the mound of flesh and bile he left behind, and Ubloo’s trunk fell and dangled below his head, and I heard him say it.

“Ubloo.”

My legs were tangled in my bedsheets like knotted wood. I laid in a pool of cold sweat, panting, staring up at the dark ceiling as the outline of a cold light fixture came into focus. 

I laid there panting for a while. Once I had caught my breath I stood up and walked over to my dresser and opened one of the drawers. Inside lay a pill bottle, and beside that lay a revolver.

While I still held on hope of finding a way to rid myself of this curse, a small rational part of me remained that there might truly only be one way out of this whole thing.

I pulled out a full bottle of adderall and popped three into my mouth. I grabbed an almost-empty bottle of gin and downed the rest of it. I turned and looked around the room, nothing. I flicked the light on and checked my watch. 4:37 AM.

It was time to pack.

I made it to the bank just after 7 AM. It wouldn’t be open for another hour or so, so I pulled out one of the many pints of gin I now kept in my car and emptied some of its contents into my coffee. The first sip burnt my tongue but I just didn’t fucking care anymore. There are worse things than a burnt mouth.

I kept thinking about what Andrew said, if it was Andrew. Could it have been the Ubloo speaking to me? It made no sense. If it can tell me to wake up every damn time why would it want to fabricate a vision of Andrew to talk to me? Hearing that thing talk would be much more freaky, in my opinion.

I met the woman who was to show me the school at the door. Her name was Linda. She was middle aged with brown hair and freckles, and had a brilliantly white smile. I took the time to really clean up my appearance for this meeting. If I was going to look like someone buying this house and squeeze information out of her, I’d have to play the part. My hair was neatly combed and I trimmed down and cleaned up my haggard looking beard. I put on some of my old work clothes that I ironed the night before and even put a spritz of cologne on. Truth be told, it felt good to dress myself up a bit.

We took her car to the school, which was only a few blocks from the bank. When we pulled up I got an eerie feeling in stomach, the way you feel when you see someone you’ve only seen in pictures before. I felt like I knew this place already with the amount of studying I had done on it.

“Now it may not look like much now but this used to be a real beauty I tell ya.” She said as she walked up to the big iron gate.

She pulled a key ring from her purse with three keys on it and fumbled through them. I watched her carefully. There were two gold keys and one silver one. She settled on the silver one and slipped it into the gate’s lock. I looked up at the fence and inspected the sharp pikes at the top. It wouldn’t be ideal to climb over, but if done carefully it was certainly doable.

“The yard is a little overgrown right now, we usually send someone out to mow it once every few months, and to check in on the place, make sure no one has been messing with it.

We walked up the walkway and ascended the front steps. They creaked under our feet as we made our way to the door. From the same key ring she gripped one of the golden keys and slipped it into the lock. The door opened inward and she began heading in.

“So, here we have the foyer and as you can see there’s an old open floor with high ceilings, which is all the rage nowadays.” She said as she shut the door behind me.

The house truly was beautiful and I can understand why it was easy for Robert to play the acquisition off as a good investment. Linda showed me the rest of the house, which was bleak and dusty. The floor boards creaked where we walked, and evidence of water damage littered the walls and ceilings. Most of the first floor was classrooms, with the exception of a small kitchen that the teachers must have used as a break room. Upstairs was the dean’s office and more classrooms.

I kept walking through the house, only half listening to what Linda was telling me, the other half just waiting for something to jump out, but nothing did. I was hitting a dead end. I had followed clues all the way up to this point, and now I couldn’t help but feel lost and alone.

When we were done viewing the house I went back to the bank with Linda to go over some of the documents and talk numbers. I took a seat in her office opposite her desk. She put her purse down and went to get us some coffee. When she got back, she sat down and pulled out the paperwork.

“We’re asking a minimum of $685,000, with all fees in the exchange of the deed covered on your end. There’s also a broker’s fee of $10,000 but to be honest I can see the bank waiving that if you can commit, they’re pretty adamant about getting rid of this property.” When she finished speaking she slid the paperwork over for me to look at.

I pretended to read it and then sat back in my chair.

“$685,000 sounds doable.” I said. “Although a similar home would go for almost double that on the market right now, especially one with this square footage and architecture.”

Linda knew what I was saying before I even said it.

“It’s just that,” I continued “I had heard some rumors about the property while I was in the area, and while I’m certainly skeptical, I’m also understandably curious.”

Linda sighed despite my generous wording of the inquiry.

“Well I can assure you there’s nothing to be worried about with this property. When the school was shut down they sent the students to public schools, which a lot of the parents weren’t happy about because there was still a lot of racial tension. The parents begged us for funding but it was just too expensive to keep it going. They chased off some of the first potential buyers, the house stayed vacant for a long time and then the stories started. After that, it’s pretty difficult to sell a house, especially one that had sustained damage and had bad blood behind it.”

I nodded. Made sense. Part of me was hoping there would be a story to go off of but all I ever found was the usual, run-of-the-mill tall tales; people seen in the windows, people going in and never coming out, etc.

“Well, I’ll have to speak with my wife about this and see what she thinks.” Saying that felt weird. I took a sip of my coffee. It had cooled down to a drinkable temperature, which made me feel a little better about what I was about to do.

“Of course, I understand.” Linda answered with a smile.

“In the meantime do you mind if I take a copy of-“ I reached my hand across the desk to grab the papers and dropped my cup of coffee so that it spilled onto Linda’s shirt and lap. “Oh my gosh I’m so sorry.”

“Oh!” She stood up and looked around the room for something to wipe herself off with. “I just-umm-one moment please.”

She rushed from the room and I heard her heels pacing down the hallway.

“I’m so sorry!” I called after her as my hands dug through her purse and found the key ring. “I’m so clumsy I should have warned you!” I slipped the keys into my pocket, and then pulled out the box of tissues I had hidden under my chair and placed them back on her desk.

“Oh it’s quite alright!” She said as she came back in with a roll of paper towels. “Happens all the time dear. Let me just get one of the interns to print you another copy of those agreements.”

Linda walked me out and I apologized to her again for spilling the coffee. She said she hoped to hear from me soon. I waved to her from my car and couldn’t help but chuckle as I pulled away at the sight of her standing there with a big coffee stain on her blouse.

Once I had gotten back to my hotel room I poured myself a glass of gin and sat on my bed. I threw two more adderall in my mouth and swallowed.

I’ll go to the house around 2AM. I’ll have to remember to bring the flashlight and some tools, just in case I grabbed the wrong keys. While highly unlikely, it was unlike me to ever leave myself room for error. I started packing a duffle bag. Flashlight, hammer, wrench, screw driver, crowbar. I walked over to my dresser and pulled out a ski mask. I felt something heavy underneath it move and looked down at my revolver. I stood there staring at it, and was jolted back to reality when my phone rang.

I pulled it out and read the caller ID.

It was Eli. I hesitated a moment and then answered the call.

“Eli, how are you?”

“I’m fine Doctor, yisself?” He said with that charming Southern twang.

“Been better, y’know.” I trailed off. “How can I help you?”

“Well Doctor, I’ve done some researching on that… y’know.”

“And?” I said back. Ubloo was nothing new to me, so I was less inclined to tip-toe around the issue than he was.

“Well I couldn’t find anything else about ‘Daiala Bu Umba’ specifically, but I did find something similar. It was in some other tribe’s history.”

My ears perked up and I felt my stomach flutter.

“Go on.”

“Well it says here, a member of this tribe was afflicted with terrible nightmares. They found him dead one morning in his hut, and the person that found him started getting the nightmares.

“Sounds promising.” I said, trying to hide the excitement from my voice.

“Well this went on a few times before the tribe caught on, but unlike other tribes, they didn’t banish the one with the dreams, instead they assigned him an ‘Ubuala.’”

“Ubuala?”

“Yes Doctor, that’s old Khoe for ‘The Waker.’ The Ubuala would sit with the person afflicted and wake him if he started to have nightmares by shaking them and yelling ‘Ubloo!’”

My stomach dropped. This was getting eerie, and started to hit me a little too close to home.

“Did it help?”

“Well it says it did, for a little, but then the tribe member started reporting that he was seeing the monster while he was awake. No one believed him, and then one day they found him off when he was supposed to be gathering water with his wrists slit.”

Somehow this didn’t surprise me.

“Well, then what?”

“The tribe’s elder commissioned that he would be the Ubuala for the man who found the previous cursed tribe member, and never left his side. Until one night, when the man was woke from his nightmare, he wrestled a knife away from the elder and killed himself before him.”

“Fuck…”

“Are you sitting down Doctor?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Because you’re not going to like this next part. It’s says that the elder wanted to rid his tribe of the curse, and that anyone who finds him dead will inherit it from him, so…”

My heart was racing.

“So?”

“So he asked that his tribe bring him somewhere that no one would ever find his body.”

Silence from both of us.

“Where?”

“They buried him, Doctor… Alive.”

I felt sick to my stomach instantly.

“Jesus, Eli…”

“I know, Doctor. Now this is where the trail runs cold. I had found minor reports of nightmares elsewhere in history texts but nothing after this. So I read into the art of voodoo. I learned that once a curse has been placed, the spirit will hunt until it has claimed everything it was promised. This is the only way to rid a curse, so I haven’t figured out how burying the elder alive could stop it.”

I choked back nausea and tears.

“Well is there any way to summon it again once it hits a dead end like that? I mean there has to be some reason it’s back.”

“Yes, well a curse can always be revitalized if it’s summoned again, but even still, it will only hunger for what it was promised, and whoever summoned it would need to know the exact ritual performed. You see, certain components are required for voodoo. The witch doctor who summoned Daiala Bu Umba cited using elephant tusks, snakes and many other things, as well as the remains of his whole tribe, and the book you gave me was all I ever found from the Binuma Tribe. Before that, everyone assumed they never even existed.”

My head was spinning from all this new information.

“Alright well, I don’t plan on calling it quits yet Eli. And if burying me alive won’t even kill this thing for good I’d hope to exhaust all my possibilities before even considering that.”

“I understand Doctor. I’m sorry I had to tell you this.”

“It’s alright, Eli, any information is good information.” I hesitated, and then asked the question that hung between the both of us. “Would you bury me if we had to, Eli?”

The pause was long, but finally, I heard that old Southern voice speak again, smooth as water.

“If we had to Doctor, I would.”

…

I reached the school at almost exactly 2AM.

I pulled the duffle bag from the back seat and put it in my lap. I exhaled deeply, and then opened the car door.

The night air was still and damp. I had parked a considerable distance from the school so I slung the bag over my shoulder and started the long walk to the gate.

As I walked I couldn’t help but think about what Eli had told me. About the elder, the Ubuala’s, everything. How is it that Daiala Bu Umba says Ubloo? Why would it tell me to wake up in the absence of someone else? I walked a bit further and then it hit me. I stopped dead in my tracks.

What if it isn’t the one saying Ubloo? What if it’s something else? Some other spirit trying to help me? Trying to stop the worst from happening? It made sense. It made just enough sense. That’s why I wake up from the dream, why I always hear it just before.

I felt butterflies grow in my stomach as I walk again. If the beast feeds on despair then it would make sense for some benevolent spirit to wake me up before it can have its fill. My mind was racing with this new information, and for the first time in a long while, I finally felt a tiny spark of hope.

By the time I reached the gate my shoulder was beginning to ache from carrying the duffle bag. I reached into my pocket and found the bottle of adderall. I took another one, just to be safe. I put it back in my pocket and pulled out the keys. I held my breath, stuck the silver key in the lock.

It turned.

Finally things were starting to go my way again. I opened the gate softly and slipped inside. I ducked down and silently ran up the walkway to the door. I slipped the gold key in, opened it, and slipped inside without making a sound.

I shut the door behind me and was surrounded by pitch black. I unzipped the duffle bag and fumbled around blindly until my hand found the flashlight. I pulled it out and turned it on. I shined it around the first room, half expecting to see something there. Too many horror movies as a kid I guess. I chuckled, and then began making my way through the house.

Again, I didn’t know what I was looking for when I was searching the house, but somehow I felt I would know when I saw it. I started upstairs and went through the office and classrooms. I knocked on the walls, trying to hear if there were any false passages or things behind them. I scanned the rooms and then moved back downstairs. I went through the classrooms and then the kitchen and then the classrooms again. After an hour or two of searching the house, I squatted down on my heels and let out a sigh.

I was going to have to come back another night and try again. Fuck.

The funny thing was this building wasn’t too much unlike the one I lived in back in Stoneham, Massachusetts. I got up and walked over to the walls and rubbed some of the grime off. Same color paint, or was it looked like. Same set up. Same hardwood floors. There was just something about carpets that I couldn’t stand. Probably because I hated to vacuu-

Then I saw it.

One floor board, a slight shade lighter than the rest.

I walked over and shined my light down onto it. While it was the same wood it looked lighter, the finish a little more pronounced. It looked… newer.

I dropped the duffle bag and pulled out the hammer and crowbar. I pried up the nails on one end and then pried the whole board back until it snapped in half. I had about three inches to see through. I tried shining my light into the whole it left but I couldn’t see enough. I went mad with excitement, ripping the boards up using the open space as leverage. I pulled another two back and then shined my light through again. What I saw almost made me sick.

There were bones on the ground beneath the floor. It’s not uncommon for Louisiana houses to be built a few feet off the ground, as to avoid flooding, although this one was considerably far from any bodies of water. There was about a foot or two of space and then dirt, which was absolutely littered with charred bones and ash. I searched around that patch of the floor frantically with my flashlight, and then I saw it.

Faded, but still there, was a large circle around the pile of bones and ash, with symbols that I recognized almost instantly.

It was ancient Khoe.

I sat there frozen, staring at the horrific inscriptions when I saw a piece of paper off to the side. I reached down through the floor boards and just with the tip of my fingers grasped it and pulled it up.

I opened the note and read it:

“I asked you how you sleep at night, now I’ve got my answer.”

Signed at the bottom:

“Monaya Guthrie”

I sat back on my heels bewildered.

“Monaya Guthrie.” I said to myself as I welled up with anger. She must have somehow summoned Ubloo back with this ritual and sent him after someone responsible for closing the school. My eyes welled up with tears of anger and frustration. But why? Why is the monster still searching? If it killed the tribe then why would it still be out there?

And then it hit me.

The witch doctor wrote that his wife was pregnant when she was murdered, and that he burned his entire tribe to summon the monster. But what if it wasn’t his entire tribe, what if what the monster wanted once it had killed off who the doctor sent it after, it still searched for this child? What if the witch doctor had somehow managed to save his child?!

My mind was racing frantically. While primitive it wasn’t uncommon for ancient medicines to be able to perform such a procedure. I mean, it’s just a premature c-section after all.

I stuffed my tools and the note back in the bag and stood up.

Monaya Guthrie, I have to find her. Or at least someone who knew her. She has to know what to do next. For fuck’s sake she might even be the descendant of-

The floor board behind me creaked and I froze in horror at the sound.

I spun around and shined my light and screamed.

There in the darkness, illuminated by just a beam of light, stood Ubloo.

It watched me with those cold black eyes and stared as I shook in fear.

I need to wake up. Fuck fuck fuck I need to wake up.

I watched as it slowly began to crawl towards me, the bones of its body visible with every movement under that smooth gray skin.

And then I realized. Never in a dream had I known I was asleep.

The panic set in like a fever. The tribesmen who saw Ubloo when they were awake, the way Andrew died propped against the wall facing the door. My heart was pounding out of my chest.

It wasn’t some benevolent spirit trying to wake me up. How could I be so fucking stupid?

It was Ubloo. All along it was Ubloo. Telling me to wake up every time. Making me feel safe at the last moment so that this time, this time I would realize there is no waking up. There is no escape anymore.

Ubloo stopped, tilted its head ever so slightly, and then galloped hard towards me. I screamed and turned and ran. I ran out the classroom door and into the hall. Halfway down the hall I saw a door and heard Ubloo crash into a wall behind me, chasing me. It was gaining on me and fast. I spilled out of the door and found myself in another classroom. I ran and searched frantically, finding another doorway. I turned a few feet before it and pulled the revolver from the back of my waistband. I shined my flashlight at where I had just came in and saw the door frame crash inwards as Ubloo came barreling through it. I fired three shots and saw its body flinch. Where the bullets had hit it there appeared small holes of black. It didn’t bleed, and I watched in horror as the holes simply closed up.

I ran through the doorway near me into the middle of the room and searched around with my light. No way out. I felt my heart pound harder as I realized this. I flashed the light around more and then I realized in horror that there were no windows either.

“No. No no no no no. Fuck fuck FUCK!”

I heard Ubloo approaching the door from the other room. I ran to the corner and turned to face it.
Slowly I saw the trunk reach around the door frame, and then its head poked in, those big black horrible eyes staring at me, trapped in the corner like a rat.

I clutched the handle of the revolver tightly and slumped down against the wall into the corner. This is the end. This is the end of Thomas Abian. The genius Doctor Abian who was entrusted with saving Andrew Jennings all those days ago.

I began to cry.

“The end is the beginning.” I said to myself as I cried.

Ubloo entered and was slowly crawling his way across the room to where I sat.

The end is the beginning. What a stupid fucking way to say it. I shook my head and tears fell into my lap.

I could hear Ubloo getting closer now.

I’m just going to become another fucking clue. I thought to myself as I sat there, crying like a baby. And to think I actually hoped to-

And then I realized it all, the dark horrible twisted sickness of it all.

The monster doesn’t feed on our despair, our sadness, it feeds on our hope.

It keeps us alive just long enough to think we can make it, and then it takes us.

The floorboards around me creaked from Ubloo’s weight as it got closer.

The hope Robert felt when he found the book, Andrew’s hope when I gave him the cyproheptadine, my hope when I found the ritual and note beneath the floor, and thought there may be a benevolent spirit.

But most of all, the hope that when he finally came for us, we’d wake up.

I began to cry harder as it all made sense.

It’s the perfect curse. One that gets stronger the more you think you can beat it. The end is the beginning after all. The end of my life is the beginning of its hunger for someone new to curse.

I opened my eyes and stared up at Ubloo. His head was just over a foot from where I sat. It knew, somehow it knew it was about to take what it came for.

“I should have let him bury me.” I cried as I raised the revolver.

I placed the cold heavy metal in my mouth and felt my teeth hit the barrel as I sobbed.

I opened my eyes just long enough to see its trunk reaching forward, to see my pitiful reflection in those dark empty eyes, to feel my finger grip the trigger, and I closed my eyes and readied myself for the end.

**VHOOP**

My eyes shot open. Where Ubloo once stood a plume of black smoke was now dissipating into the dark air.

“DROP THE WEAPON!”

I was in shock. For half a second I froze and then realized what was happening.

I turned and faced the officer with the barrel of the gun still in my mouth, wide-eyed.

“I SAID DROP THE FUCKING WEAPON NOW!”"

* Country of purchase: Canada

The clear two front-runners were Google and Amazon. I decided to go with Google and declined the Amazon internship.

Recently, I read about someone who received a couple internship offers, one of them being Amazon. He couldn't decide so he asked to defer Amazon's internship to the fall, which they were fine with. 

That got me thinking... I could have easily done that. I'm thinking that since it has only been two weeks since I declined Amazon's offer, I could potentially email my recruiter asking him if it is possible to intern at Amazon in the fall without having to go through the interview phase again.

Let's say Amazon allows me to intern there in the fall. Would it even be worth it?

Pros

* I would gain valuable experience at two different companies regarding tools, technologies, development processes, and culture.
* I would be able to see what both the Bay Area and Seattle are like.
* Greater chance of receiving a return offer, as there are now two companies that could potentially give me a full-time offer.
* My resume would be even stronger with Amazon on there.

Cons

* I'm not *super* excited about Amazon as a company. I've read many negative stories about them.
* This pushes my graduation back a semester. Not a big deal but graduating sooner would be better.
* Would Google be mad if they knew I was interning somewhere else right after their internship? They don't seem like a company that would care, but I don't want to ruin my relationship with Google at all as I would love to work there full-time.
* Might be better to focus on performing well at one company.
* A semester later in earning a full-time salary.

Let me know what you guys think."

As far as I know, my degree requirements only has 4 courses in Java (Intro, Data Structure, GUI/OOP, and software development), the rest is theory and other computer science topics (comp arch., automata, logic, etc). I've already and I don't feel quite prepared for a future career. I also have some experience in MIPs assembly and C, but I'm really only comfortable with Java. Even so, I feel like my Java isn't developed enough, what steps to I take to push it to the next level?

1) I haven't worked on any independent projects, I'm not very creative and can't think of any interesting project ideas.

2) I don't know what area of computer science I want to focus on, and I know it's a very broad field

3) There's so much to learn and I don't know where to begin (HTML/CSS/Javascript, databases, cloud computing, mobile development)

34fxds,1,2015-04-30,New Laptop for Law School &amp; Gaming,Wolfeh56,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/34fxds/new_laptop_for_law_school_gaming/,"Hi everyone,

I'm attending law school in August and my current laptop is going to shit with different parts no longer working at full capacity/at all. Because of this, I am looking for a new laptop that will last me at minimum through 3 years of law school. As for what I'm looking for:

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: $1000-$2000

* Purpose: The main purpose of this laptop would be to use during all 3 years of law school for papers, exams, internships, etc. However, I would also like reliability for gaming and *possible* recording/streaming. 

* Screen size preference: 16""-18""

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows - Preferably not Windows 8 because I hate the layout, but I'll consider all possibilities.

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): I'd like to be able to run different steam games (CS, GTA V, Battlefield, etc.) and League of Legends at 60+ fps.

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): I'm not sure how much I'd really stream/record considering law school is so time consuming, but I would still like the laptop to have the ability to do this.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): I don't really have a preference, but definitely not Samsung. My current laptop was a $1500 Samsung and multiple parts went bad after 2 years. I debated on Alienware, but a friend of mine suggested ROG (Asus) or MSI.


**Which of the following qualities would you prefer?**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: I prefer high performance and battery life

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: High performance again, but I would love to have HIGH build quality so I know that it will last through law school.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: High performance, but with high enough build quality that overheating won't happen. Fan was the first thing to go bad in my current laptop...

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: Maybe - How big of difference is this in cost and is it a noticeable difference from regular resolution.

* A great keyboard: Yes - Preferably a keyboard that lights up under the keys.

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: I have a great mouse, but reliable touchpad/mouse buttons would still be nice.

* Great audio: Yes!

**List any features that are critical:**

* This probably has to do with the gaming requirements section, but I want a very high quality video card and the ability to use 2 (and possibly 3) monitors.

I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to laptops and that leaves me with a question. Is $1-$1.5k a lot for a laptop? Would I get a better quality computer if I invest the majority of my money in a desktop and then bought a laptop for class and work outside of my house?

I look forward to the replies!"

34fyrp,2,2015-04-30,Arts Administration Versus Business Administration? Please Help! (X-Post),yennyyen,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/34fyrp/arts_administration_versus_business/,"Sorry I'm posting my saga on here, I just feel as if I have no other sources to turn to.  I'm currently a high school senior making my college decision, and this has become a very involved process in which I am at a dead end.  



For the future, I hope to become an arts administrator, working in highly reputable theatres throughout the country after stage managing (possibly touring) for a couple of years.  I have two education options left, and I cannot seem to distinguish my better option, so I was hoping someone may have some type of advice that may help with my decision.  My two choices are as follows:



**Illinois State University**

* Only $6,000/year (very inexpensive for my family)
* Degree in both Theatre: Design/Production (for my theatre/stage management experience) and a degree in Business Management: Organizational Leadership (for my administration experience)
* I have the financial freedom to support any summer internships I may wish to take on, any study abroad options I could dream of (which is highly weighted in my decision), and excess financial support to join stereotypical college-y things, such as a sorority
* Closer to home, my family could visit for my productions
* Not exactly the college experience I was hoping for, but I could make it work and possibly have the best time
* The two majors will require five years if I plan in study abroad, but that is financially possible for me
* Not a large presence of Arts Administration opportunities on campus, but if I try hard enough I may be able to find assistance with career planning



**University of Kentucky**

* $25,000/year (Very top of my budget, not any extra room for other costs, I will be required to pick up the extra costs myself)
* Specific program in Arts Administration available to me that can be finished in four years and includes all training necessary, also planning on a second degree in Theatre in order to gain extensive training in this area.
* The University as a whole has everything I could ask for and want of my college experience
* The distance from my home will not allow for frequent returns home or visits from family
* Not sure how juggling two majors, student activities, and a job would work out
* Possibility of no study abroad due to cost of the school (although I could find programs that will work under my price range, I just will not have my pick)
* Arts Administration is very present on campus and has a lot of support to find the right internships for what the student wishes to become involved in
* This school is trying out a new culture from where I live (in the North) and could be a really great experience for me



I'm sorry for the length of this post, but I just really hope someone out there may be able to help me make a decision.  I have been at a complete loss of any idea of what to do (choose the school I have dreamed about, or go with the money and hope I can have a great experience).  In regards to transferring, unfortunately for these majors they require four full years at each school, so I would only be losing scholarships and have to start again if I was to transfer in after a year or two.  My decision deadline is May 1, so I really could use any assistance, advice, or personal experiences anyone has to offer.



Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"
