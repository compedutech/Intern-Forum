I'm a junior in CS and kinda applied late to the game for summer internships. Despite that, I was able to land a phone interview for an internship position next Monday and really don't want to blow it as it could be my last chance for getting an internship for this upcoming summer. What should I do to prepare for the phone interview over the weekend? Below is the job description and qualifications for this internship.

&gt; **Position Description**:
&gt; Harmonic is a leading creator of professional video and audio processing products. Our state of the art technologies include MPEG-2, MPEG-4/AVC, and HEVC video compression, for use in broadcast as well as mobile and internet applications. We are looking for well qualified candidates to develop video and audio processing software, with a specific emphasis on performance. 
&gt; 
&gt; The position entails developing tests that measure various aspects of performance and code coverage. If achieved test results do not meet performance objectives, performance analysis and subsequent problem resolution will be involved.
&gt; 
**Qualifications**:
&gt; Have a solid understanding of computer architecture internals, such as processor, cache, and memory subsystems.
&gt; 
&gt; Have some understanding of how high performance applications are built, including issues of multi-threading and synchronization. Experience measuring SW application performance a plus.
&gt; 
&gt; Be able to write code in C/C++ as well as various scripting languages such as bash and python. Experience with build infrastructure such as make or GYP a plus.

The person that is conducting the phone interview said he wants to discuss my qualifications and the associated opportunity and said it would take around 30 minutes. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks"

I would be working on the business product, and am essentially the sole developer. The technology surrounding the product really interests me, and I may have an opportunity to stay with the company long term if the project is a success. The product has a deadline to be reached, since it will be demo'd to the primary investor. If the investor is satisfied, then there will be much more funding. To me, it seems like an awesome opportunity , which will satisfy my desires to learn about start-ups and work with the cool hardware. Furthermore, the boss seems like a nice person. He presented the situation nicely, hyped up the high growth potential. He also told me it would be a risk, because if the project doesn't go well, I might be looking for a job, rather than extending the contract for the fall term. He also addressed my concerns nicely. He didn't bash big corporations, even saying they are great places for students to grow. Hence, I do not thing he would screw me in any way. Also I am being paid for this, more than the average co-op in the city he said.

However, I am hesitant on accepting because I will be required to build something from scratch and am nervous I won't be able to finish. Furthermore, I am the main developer and won't have co-developers helping me out, nor software veteran mentors to learn from. I feel like as a student, I should be aiming to join large corporations, where there is an infrastructure in place to enable interns to thrive in. Being mentored, learning proper software development, etc. 

I just want some input on whether this is a great opportunity for a student, or a waste of time. Is it normal for start-ups to ask students to help build a working demo of a product? I feel like trusting a student with responsibility like this indicates something bad, however the boss did say my resume was exactly the type of person he was looking for.

Please ask me for any clarifications. Thanks!"

One company I noticed was Flex-It/2Xcel who was supposedly recruiting CS majors for what I thought was their company (at least according to the career fair site they were). 

I went over to the booth and the woman introduced herself and was nice enough. However, when I inquired about possible internships at their company she just pointed towards a large sign with some companies names on it, and told me they could help me find an internship with them. 

I asked if **they** had internships at their company and once again I was told that they could help me find an internship at a company on the sign. The woman showed me the site which was like a modified LinkedIn. She then asked me to put my info in and they would look at my resume, so I did. She then gave me an envelope and I left.

I went back to my car and opened the envelope to find a sort of ""congratulations for joining our site"" letter. Overall, it seemed like they were giving everyone a false impression that you could intern with them, but instead were just using your information to boost the companies registration numbers.

Did anyone else have the same experience? Or am I completely wrong and this is legit? Just thought it was weird compared to the way other companies who actually wanted interns were acting."

This was my first IT intern interview and I am proud to say I nailed it! 

I'd say the key thing here was confidence and preparation. Almost every post that I reviewed had an up most comment of confidence and just being plain friendly. In my internship I'll be working with the IT team helping them develop exciting new projects. However, I think the team was looking for someone with a friendly personality that will be easy to work with. By no means do I think I got the job because of my technical skills. But also experience as a help desk assistant did give me an advantage. 

Thus, I encourage anyone who is an IT major to try and get a help desk job within their school. It really stands out on your resume if you are looking for internships. 

Again, thanks to everyone on this subreddit. And keep the tips coming. But remember, personality is everything when interviewing.

Here is some background story to this: I am 22 years old, just graduated last year in Computer science in a not really famous university (I am not in the US). After graduated, I have stayed at home and being an indie game dev for about half a year with 3 released game on Google Play using Unity game engine. None of my games make money, so last month, I went out job searching, are a few companies, few tests and some interviews, I got hired by this company, let's call them company A.

First, please be noted that company A is not the only one who offer me a job, there are 2 other wanted to hire me as well but I choose company A in the end because it seems like the best deal.

As of now, I am currently working (still in trial) as Unity developer in their game department. The company is a Japanese owned company, but set in Vietnam with the current size of 120 employees. Only 4 people know how to use Unity. My salary is 8 millions in Vietnam dong, which is considered a fairly good salary for a freshman like me.

So, what's the problem ? Well, there is this guy, an internship at the company. He is one year older than me, in his last year at a more famous university than mine. He started the contract the same day as mine, and even though we have a secret salary policy, I managed to take a glanced at his contract, and saw that his ""intern"" salary was way larger than mine, 10 millions in Vietnam dong. It is NOT technically 10 millions in the paper, it is actually 56 thousands per hour, in which, if I do the math, lead to 10 millions. He doesn't come to work everyday, only 3 to 4 days on a 5 days week, so his salary should be around 7 or 8 millions, but still, if he works as much as I do, he will have that much salary.

Now, normally, I would be fine with the salary like currently, but now, knowing this intern makes way more than I do, I want to get the strike on him. If the company is able to pay that much to this intern guy, this makes no sense to pay me that little.

As of now, I have only been working there for 2 weeks. My trial contract ends in June 20th. If things go well, I will have a one year contract with them after that. I think I will negotiate the salary with them there. But I don't know how. I mean, a small jump from 8 to 9 is OK, I guess, but a jump from current 8 to 12 (my intended salary) seem too big and will most likely to make my lose my job. What should I do ? 

Here is some information about me, the company and the guys.

The company is Japanese owned, mostly do out-source job for Japanese companies and the mother company in Japan. The company was found 1.5 years ago and beside outsourcing jobs, I don't think they have ever released a game on their own name. The company currently has 120 employees, but they plan to expand it to 400. They have the biggest (and most expensive) office compare to all the company I have gone to before, and they treat their employee really nice.

The intern guy. He is one year older than mine, is currently in his last year of a 5 years undergraduate program in the most famous university in this country in Computer Science. He also has a national prize in a quite famous competition so he is pretty good I think. His works here. Currently, he is doing a mobile chat application, just working on the core, where if multiple users are connected to the same wifi network, they can discover each other and send messages to each other.

About me and the works. Well, as off now, I am assigned to to a game for a Japanese client. Just me, since the client asks the game to be made using Unity engine, and all the other unity guys are busy doing other projects. Still, I already impressed my project manager in my art skill (they only have 2 artists here and both are really busy), and I am already under his term, creating a game for the company. I can do music as well.

That's about it. The company, myself and the other guys.

What you guys think should I do ? I really like the company, because of their office, their attitude towards employees, but at the same time, I can not stand working really underpaid like that.

So, what should should I go. All advice and comments are welcome.

I'm a recent grad with a BS in CS. Received an offer for $110,000/yr in SF. A few months later in January, key senior engineers left after their retention bonuses were up (company previously acquired).

As a result, I got bumped up to $150,000/yr. I've enjoyed the autonomy and making money, but I'm ready to move on after a year. 

I don't agree with the direction the eng org is heading. I feel like I have SO much to learn, and my biggest fear is to plateau. Isn't there a phrase that says, ""if you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room""?

Anyways, I've been talking to serious tech companies now. Most are willing to bring me in around $125,000/yr and up. Sign on bonuses, equity, etc. are all factors, but base is clearly the most important. This seems much more reasonable considering my experience: 1 yr full-time, 1 internship, BS in CS, and 2 projects in production (plus github contribs).

I think it speaks volumes of my current employer that I'm willing to leave for $135,000-$140,000. I'm really curious to hear how others have handled similar situations? Did you sell yourself out for the paycheck or opt for long-term happiness instead? I think I care more about working at a SaaS provider with really smart people that can challenge me.

Also, I think it goes without saying that I'm clearly grateful for my position given that some recent grads aren't so fortunate. Not sure if anyone made it this far down the wall of text, but please feel free to leave your thoughts. Thanks!

I'm currently a sophomore in college, CS major. I interned at a fairly prestigious software company last summer. A few months after I got back to college, I got an offer for a summer internship from a company out in California for the upcoming summer, which I wasn't too sure about. I had until May 1st to decide whether I would be taking the offer or not, and I also started interviewing at other places.

I applied back at the company I interned at last summer, for a different position. Unfortunately, I totally bombed my interview and got a rejection pretty quickly after.

A few weeks ago, I got an email from my manager (at the same company) saying they wanted me back as an intern (in the same department I interned in last summer). I was really excited because I would absolutely love to go back, so I confirmed saying I'd be interested in going back, but that I had the decision deadline coming up really quickly.

I was supposed to have a written offer for my return internship by early this week, but they never sent it. I called my manager yesterday because I needed a written offer before I turned down the other places, and he said I would have an offer by the end of the day yesterday, which never happened. I got a verbal offer from my manager today, and he said the letter would be sent by the end of the day, or I should contact him.

End of the day is here, no offer letter, contacted my manager (no word from his end), and I have to say something to the other companies. If I turn them down and my return offer never comes, I'm screwed for the summer.

What do I do and how worried should I be?"

Ive been lurking for a bit and noticed many aren't too fond of PTC Winchill, but we need something that can integrate well with ProEngineer and Altium.  Our main hope is to find a Cloud based PLM or something of the SaaS (software as a service) type with solid integration for ProE and Altium, so we wont need to go through the costly process of setting up servers and hiring someone to manage it. 

The cloud PLM systems we have been considering are: PTC PLM Cloud, Arena PLM, and Autodesk PLM 360. 

I would say that PTC PLM cloud would be the clear front runner due to the sure integration with ProE, but Im having second thoughts when hearing of what a pain PTC windchill can be. Especially when we don't have a dedicated PLM manager. 

Arena PLM seems to integrate with Altium, but we worry about ProE. 

Does anyone have any experience using or implementing Cloud based PLM?

I talked to my recruiter about swapping teams. They said they'll let me move if I'm really unhappy, but they did seem reluctant. Internships are just so short - my guess is by the time I'm successfully switched, it'll be half over, and I'll end up with two half-assed experiences.

My current company is small but growing. There is so much potential for learning. I am treated like an equal, and I'm not being given work ""for the intern"". Another huge factor is that I can work on whatever team I want. I'm a frontend developer right now, but I could switch to data science! Or database stuff! Or other backend stuff that I don't have much experience in, but want to learn...

The opportunity to continue building rapport with one company I love, having the autonomy to do whatever the heck I want, and the slightly better pay and location make this seem like a great choice.

That being said, I don't want to burn a Big 4 bridge. I also think that having their name in my employment history will boost my resume (not that this is a huge concern, I've had no problem getting calls back for even fulltime positions, though I'm still in school).

Am I totally insane for declining a Big 4? The crappy project is a major turnoff for me.

Is it worth it to try to delay the internship, rather than outright rejecting it? If I do decline, will I have a shot at getting an opportunity there in the future? I'd imagine it will either be really positive (""Oh, we already hired this one before, let's hire!"") or really negative (""Reneging is rude, BLACKLIST!"").

Please ask any questions or give whatever feedback you can. I have to decide very soon and I'm starting to panic. What's the best option here?"

I am a US citizen living in DE for the next two years or so doing my graduate degree. I was hired as a freelancer by a consulting company for work that requires a native English speaker.

I found out when looking at starting an internship, that according to daad.de website students are not allowed to work as a freelancer/self employed, and risk deportation from the country.

The company I worked for knew I was a student, and offered me this work. They also have my tax number on the two invoices I sent them. They seem to be unaware (or ignoring and didnt tell me) that its illegal for me to work as a freelancing student.  
  
My impulse is to immediately tell the company I have been working for, and see if they can change the contract to be part time or werkstudent or something.   
  
I am curious if the fault lies entirely on me, or if a company can be penalized for hiring someone illegally? I am also wondering if its even legally possible or grey area at a minimum to anull the two old service contracts and make a new one for me to be ""part time"" or whatever. 

Anyone have any suggestions about how to go around this without getting screwed up the ass and potentially kicked out of the country (I assume getting kickd out of DE means I am super boned for entering a lot of countries including all EU countries, and I know others like new zeland and canada and stuff too will not let you in if you were ever deported, I travel a ton so this would be super fucked for me).

Thanks guys so much!

I would love any feedback r/entrepreneur has :)",kobyc,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34o44r/we_just_raised_195000_launched_our_website_mvp_i/,"A few months ago I got hired as the marketing director to a really cool startup in my city called Basedin. We just finished raising over $195,000. I was hoping to go over our business strategy going forwards and get some feedback. :) 

*If any of you have any questions about anything like raising $$ feel free to ask!*

So...

**Description:** We are a big data company. What we do is scrape all of a businesses information and collect reviews on it through API's and then we evaluate the business on a 1-10 scale - we're basically like the ultimate review website accurately evaluating businesses online reputation. We focus on services similarly to Angies list. 

**Getting More Money:** We raised $195,000 by participating in a startup incubator in Boise, Idaho. Through the incubator we were able to network with investors and basically raise a ton of money. We want more though. We've applied to a second incubator that's ranked #15 in the nation called Boom Startup down in Utah, its graduates have a 60% fund rate averaging $300K-$600K so we're hoping to be able to finish raising money to the tune of $500K-$800k. 

**Building The Product:** We have a pretty big development team that consists of 2 people on the management team and 9 interns. We are also working with 2 outside programmers and an outside development firm down in Utah. We *just* relaunched our [website](http://www.basedin.com) &amp; so far we are in 4 cities - we hope to be able to be in over 100 cities by the end of the summer. I would absolutely *love* any feedback you guys have on the website (Sorry about the backend, we are still working on it a little bit). 

**Marketing The Product:** So what we sell is adspace at $100 a month - you get a premium listing &amp; your name will show up next to your competitors pages (and your competitors will no longer show up on your page). What we don't have is traffic. What we're doing to fix this is offering a 100% cospend on when people sign up. What that means is that if you sign up for our $100/mo package, we will spend $100/mo advertising your business on Facebook, driving traffic to your BasedIn profile page. 

We've been going after agencies offering them a 15% commission on the ads instead of directly to businesses to try and get people to sign up. So far we met with one agency that had 200 clients, 25 of which were interested in hopping on board once we launch (which is today!). 

I would love any feedback you guys have on this ""cospend"" package. Positive or negative I just want to hear what business owners &amp; entrepreneurs think about it.

Thanks so much for any feedback you guys leave me we really appreciate it. I'm super excited for this project it's the largest startup I've been a part of and I can't wait to see how this summer ends once we are finished raising money. :)"

If you have the time, I would greatly appreciate answers to any of the questions posed below.
&amp;nbsp;

Hello all,

I have been browsing this sub for the past few months and I am now posting with the hope of gaining some advice regarding a possible career change into the field of web development. A little background for context: I am approaching the age of 30, have no dependents, reside in the U.S., possess a doctor of pharmacy degree, and have worked as a pharmacist for a number of years. Through my education and work experience, I have had sufficient exposure to my current career options to conclude that I made a huge mistake by pursuing a degree in pharmacy.

I was afforded the opportunity in high school (early 2000s) to take a web development / design course which I absolutely loved. This was the one subject matter in high school that sparked a genuine interest and desire to take learning outside of the classroom. Unfortunately, I followed the advice of others which resulted in me pursuing a college degree in pharmacy rather than a web-related career. I spent countless years in college studying around the clock followed by a number of years working as a pharmacist in a variety of high-stress and mind-numbing settings. I consider myself to be a creative person who enjoys solving problems and the world of pharmacy seems to be suffocating me in this regard. I honestly feel as if my career choice has destroyed me as a person and resulted in my loss of interest in most facets of life. Knowing that life is too short to spend doing things that make you miserable, I opted to leave the profession a month ago which brings us to my current predicament: where do I go from here?

Deciding on a new career path has not been easy (mainly because I am afraid of making another poor investment of time just as I did when settling on pharmacy). Looking back on the last decade has made me realize that my interest of learning how to create and develop web sites has remained constant. Unfortunately, I never had the time or energy to convert my interest into actual practice and I now feel overwhelmed with how much technology has changed and continues to change in regards to web development. I have started to re-learn HTML, learn CSS, and plan on following suit by learning JavaScript. I also have a small amount of experience with C and Python. With all of that being said, I would appreciate it if you guys wouldn’t mind answering the questions (or some of the questions) below.

**Education**

1. Will my doctor of pharmacy degree be of any benefit to me the field of web development (even if it may just help me get my foot in the door for interviews after I establish a portfolio)?

2. I feel under qualified without a technology related degree. Has anyone had experience with U.S. universities who offer online web development degrees?

3. Would a degree in web development be beneficial or is there another degree that would be of more benefit towards becoming a web developer? (I am a bit wary of a computer science degree - mainly because of the math courses required since I haven’t taken a math course in over 10 years)

**General / Lifestyle / Work environment**

4. Are you a front end developer, back end developer, or both?

5. Are you happy working as a web developer? Why or why not?

6. What do you wish others had told you before going into web development?

8. Would you say that you enjoy a good work-life balance? (ex: How many hours do you work during the week? How many hours outside of work do you use to educate yourself on new technologies? Is it normal to have to work on the weekend? Do deadlines cause you to frequently work long hours?)

9. Is your annual compensation enough to live without constantly worrying about financial crisis?

10. Do you ever worry about a surplus of web developers leading to a lack of employment opportunities in the future?

**Web Development / Technology**

11. What technologies should front end developers be comfortable working with?

12. What technologies should back end developers be comfortable working with?

13. What makes a good web developer?

14. What makes a web developer employable / desirable to hire?

15. Do you encounter bad web developers on a common basis? What can someone do to avoid becoming a bad developer?

16. Did you feel overwhelmed when you first started down the path of web development?

17. Besides creating web sites on my own, what other skillsets should I work on developing to become a respected web developer?

18. From the time that you started learning the basics of web development, how long did it take you to land your first job as a web developer (including intern or junior developer positions)?

Thanks!"

I have a low GPA: 2.6~

Have had aerospace internship experience (fortune 50 company) and held student jobs throughout college such as Information Technology Lab Assistant.

Late bloomer, decided that I want to work in tech/silicon valley after all. Initially, wanted to be a pilot/astronaut blah blah and so stayed committed my whole life and finished aerospace engineering. back then, i used to think: my mom is a software engineer, I don't want her job/life sitting at a desk/computer all day. Turns out, that's pretty much aerospace and most engineering jobs and most jobs as general.

Culture sucks in Aerospace industy, very old, very traditional, low pay, lots of bureaucracy and in terrible locations. I love the West Coast like Seattle and Bay Area.

So anyway, have decent programming experience and turns out that at companies likes SpaceX and Tesla, they hire a lot more software engineers anyway.

So, have been considering doing all sorts of things like a seconds bachelors in CS or CE but most good universities won't let you do a 2nd bachelors. Some smaller ones do let you. Now, I'm thinking a 2nd BS would just be a waste of time. I know theoretically, Masters CS programs do consider applications from non CS background but given GPA, programming experience and University attended, I don't think I have a good shot at regular Masters programs. This is where a degree like this from Georgia Tech comes in. Do all of you agree with my line of reasoning? Feel free to comment.

So reddit, can I get in? what are my chances as unpredictable as they are, if you had to say yes or no, what would you say? thanks! "

Firstly, there's TL;DR at the bottom of this text for those who don't have much time to read.

I'm an international student studying in the UK, first year undergraduate engineering, who is yet to be 100% sure about what career path to take.

To explain the context why I am considering to take 2 masters in similar area, I must go back to my secondary school period. My secondary school was rated one of the best in the UK and I had high expectations in my academic performance that I was aiming for Cambridge and Oxford, but due to family circumstances I had totally missed my study period-got into somewhat a few levels lower graded university by clearing (clearing is just like begging to get in).

I managed my first year course pretty well that I AM already offered a MEng in the university that I currently am. The advantage of taking this MEng course over MSci is that:
1.it's a lot cheaper than MSci, MAst and MPhil etc.
2.the course contains a year out in industry placement. One thing important here is that I cannot take a voluntary year out for a year in placement like others, because I am currently preparing for a permenant VISA application and also my home country is under conscription. This is probably the only opportunity for an internship longer than 6 months during my education.

However, I am concerned that this university is not well recognised in my home country; which may affect my career path. Therefore I am also considering about taking another master's degree, preferably research, in other universities that are rated higher, like Cambridge or Oxford (Of course, only if I get in), so that I 

Enough with explaining the background. I am in process of decision making of which path to take, listed below; I cannot judge which one may be considered the best. I have been researching on this subject a lot, but also advices from who had experiences will greatly help me!
1.Do MEng only
2.Don't do MEng, and just go for other masters in other universities
3.Do MEng first, then do another masters in other universities.


TL;DR: 
Concerned with the choices right above this TL;DR. MEng offers me industrial placement which is a very good opportunity for me. However, I also want to do other masters at better university, because they are rated higher.

Looking at glassdoor.com and national salaries, its on the lower side. I told him it was low, I would need more and he stated that it was budgeted at the beginning of the year and it wasn't negotiable. 

My conundrum, I need more money to not have to work two jobs, I currently work in my family business and make over 39,000 a year even if it is long hours on my feet, bad quality of life, etc etc. 

Do I accept the offer for the sake of the big resume buff? Or do I roll the dice and decline the offer to see if I am offered an increased amount and keep looking?

I posted here for advice when I began my programming course, and you were all so helpful.  I took it all to heart and apply every chance I have. 

First, the only reason I'm allowing myself to post this question though it's been asked before, is that it's the time of year when I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking it.
I'm a month away from finishing college (taking advanced Web Dev and Programming) It signals a huge career change for me. I was the head chef in a restaurant prior to returning to school.

I have made a portfolio site, am currently developing a blog site from scratch, have a fully(mostly) functioning android app - with a companion web app that will be finished this week.

I have attended industry social events, and even presented at one.

I have a one month internship with a start-up that I am dying to work for. Everything that I have seen from the group and what they stand for, is something I can wholeheartedly get behind. The lead architect asked me to brush up on JavaScript and DOM manipulation prior to the internship. I have done my best (and am continuing to ) to work on JS as much as I can while finishing up school - though I feel pretty weak with it still. I know that the start-up is looking to expand by a few programmers this year, so it's not *impossible* that they would keep me on.

**So the question is:**
All things considered, what can/should I do/be doing, to help increases my chances of getting hired on at the end of the internship? Grab your sculptors tools and mould me.

After a while they learned that I knew computers and moved me into the office and made me a Revit Operator. While in the office I've managed to write a few macros and programs for different departments but nothing serious.

Recently I've started applying to different positions. Here comes the catch, I often get told that I don't have enough experience for a junior level position. When I apply to internships I get told that I'm too far out of college to be an intern.

I've built a website with a couple simple games in JavaScript and HTML5. I'm in the process of re-reading a design pattern book I saved from college and Cracking the Coding Interview. I'm designing the back end of a financial app. I've picked out a github repo that sounds interesting but when I try to browse the code I get hopelessly lost in a matter of minutes (any help on this in particular would be extremely welcome).

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vgyx38pvcrrsg99/Alridrin.pdf?dl=0) is my resume. I've spent a lot of time on it but any advice here would be great. To my main question. Am I not doing enough to break into the field? Have I waited too long and am now stuck in this path? If not how can I get past being too 'old' for an internship but too inexperienced for a junior position? Thank you for your time. 

TL;DR Too 'old' for an internship. Too inexperienced for a junior position. What do? "

I'm currently a second year undergraduate student majoring in Statistics, with a minor in Computer Science. I want to go into data science and analytics because simply put - it is freaking awesome, and I can't see myself as a developer typing lines and lines of pure software code the whole day.  However, I do love writing code and statistics, so thought this would be a great path for me. 

Right now, I do research in machine learning and am comfortable programming with R, Python (scipy, numpy, sci-kit learn), and MATLAB. I am also familiar with Java, Bash, and to a lesser extent, C++. I have done some network analysis and representations for exploratory data analysis. The exploratory data analysis has been represented in graphs such as clustergrams, dendrograms and spectrograms. I have taken classes in time series, applied regression analysis in R, bayesian statistics, models of applied statistics, mathematical statistics, intro to CS, data structures, and discrete structures. 

In order to get into analytics/data science, and ace interviews for internships next summer, what do you guys think I should be devoting my time to now? Should I start learning tools like Hadoop, Scala, SQL, MapReduce, etc? Also, what are some good university level courses I should look into taking?

Also, I want to do a data science oriented project over the summer to learn more and to showcase my talents to recruiters next year. Any ideas on what I could do, or where I could go to find a suitable topic?  "

34rv6j,0,2015-05-03,Should I transfer to UIC's engineering CS or UIUC's liberal arts &amp; sciences Math + CS?,hikzero,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/34rv6j/should_i_transfer_to_uics_engineering_cs_or_uiucs/,"I'm about to finish up my 2 years at Oakton Community College in Skokie, IL and have been accepted to those two programs.

While at Oakton I built a pretty tightly-knit circle of friends who are going to do engineering as well. I did not think I would actually get admitted to UIUC, so we all planned to get an apartment in the city together and tackle engineering at UIC together. 

Now that I got accepted to UIUC, despite it not being full blown engineering, I'm still finding that the curriculum is nearly identical. 

Given the following facts:

-They are both Bachelor of Science degrees

-The amount of financial would likely be a ton at both schools (not 100% sure on that, because I haven't received the award letter at from UIUC yet, but they want me to fill out the Illinois Promise Verification form -- only for students who need serious aid. So I think I'm going to get a ton of aid)

-I would still be able to get internships no matter which school I choose because every summer I'd come back to Chicago

-I would get a significant amount of additional job opportunities if I stay in Chicago, just because it is a major city

-The curriculums between the two programs are nearly identical, except UIUC's major seems like it requires a couple of bullshit LAS requirements, such as a foreign language class, as well as about 3 or so more math classes to satisfy the math portion of the major.

-I would have to provide/work for myself to support my share of an apartment at UIC if I go there (It's a commuter school, the dorms are mostly shit).


Should I leave my engineering buddies, who have also become some of my best personal friends, and pursue UIUC, or should I try to make working while going to UIC in Chicago work and let the opportunity go?"
34s1k3,2,2015-05-03,Third-year ECE student: assessment of prospects for top CompSci grad programs?,ChairmanWow94,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/34s1k3/thirdyear_ece_student_assessment_of_prospects_for/,"Hi all,

I’ve just finished my third year of an honours program in electrical / computer engineering at a well-known Canadian university. Machine learning, particularly insofar as it relates to proteomics, is a field that I’ve had a small amount of exposure to in my work as a research assistant, and I think I’d like to pursue the topic seriously in grad school - and like everyone else asking similar questions, I’d like to do my studies at the best school I’m able to get into. For now, let’s say it’s a PhD I’m interested in. (The idea of a coursework-based MS has also occurred to me, but I'll leave that question for another post.)

Some “ideal” schools would be MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Cambridge, ETHZ, UCSD, University of Washington, UofT. (My inquiry into this whole issue is pretty preliminary at this point, so I realize these might not be 100% informed selections, but these are names I’ve heard come up in relation to my area of interest.)

I’d appreciate an honest assessment of my prospects with respect to the aforementioned schools based on what I’ve done so far - and if anyone has any suggestions towards what I could do over this upcoming work term and my fourth year to improve my chances, those would be much appreciated as well. (There’s a couple of areas that I’m concerned might be liabilities, and I’d like to know whether my concern is justified.)

1) My cumulative GPA is a 3.80 (out of 4). I’ve seen this number cited a few times as a cutoff for top-ranked schools, so on the one hand I’m not unduly worried. My marks have seen a slight decline from second to third year though - not much of one, but there are a couple of B’s on my transcript this year whereas last year was straight A’s. Rounding pessimistically, this would put my ‘major GPA’ (having technically specialized in electrical / computer only this past year) thus far at a 3.7. I also received an A- in my algorithms course, which constitutes one of the few ‘serious’ CompSci courses I’ve taken thus far - I feel like that might stick out on my transcript. Is this a (serious) liability?

2) I’ve worked for two years continuously (summers and during classes) in a ChemEng research group as a scientific programmer. My work has been tangentially related to machine learning, clustering algorithms being a particular area of focus. I’ve co-authored a handful of peer-reviewed papers in this capacity, and I’m working on my own study at present, which will hopefully culminate in a lead-authored journal article. I believe I’ve gained valuable skills as a researcher from this; but as far as I can gather, the particular field (atmospheric chemistry) is kind of behind the curve quantitatively - compared to, say, proteomics - and I’m concerned that my work in this context might not necessarily impress a CompSci admissions committee. I hope I’m just being pessimistic here - any thoughts?

3) I’ve managed to secure a year-long internship as a programmer in a well-established corporate research lab, where I'll be developing data reduction methodologies for high-throughput proteomics. I’ve heard industrial experience isn’t something grad schools care particularly much about - does the fact it’s research change anything? (Looking at the company’s track record, I’m going to say there’s a small but nonzero chance of getting my name on a patent or research paper, if that helps at all.)

That pretty much summarizes it for now. If my concerns are unjustified (and I have seen some posts on here exhibiting a lack of self-awareness in that regard), please be direct. But I’d like some external perspective regardless, as I haven’t had much exposure to any CompSci academics who I could ask about the whole issue. Apologies for the long-windedness, and thanks for your time."

I am planning to move to Chicago, from Atlanta, in June with just $2000 in savings and a suitcase. 

 I lived in the city for a couple of months in Summer 2014 and, prior to my move, had things laid out! (Internship, a great place in South Loop, etc.)

However, I do not have much set up this go around; I have applied to numerous jobs within the city but no leads at the moment.

Any advice on getting myself started again in Chicago?

Any advice would be very much appreciated!

34sj8e,0,2015-05-04,Is this college's computer science curriculum acceptable?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34sj8e/is_this_colleges_computer_science_curriculum/,"I asked the head of the program some questions to get a feel for the program. Here are his answers. Can you please provide input on the strength of the curriculum?

1. What languages are the introductory CS classes taught in?

Our first-semester programming course is taught in javascript with the primary goal of teaching students how to program. The next two semesters are taught in Java, which forms the basis for our computer science degree.

2. What other languages does the department teach(Database languages included)?

The following languages are taught in required or elective CS courses regularly: SQL (in our database courses), VB.NET, php, asp, C, Android. In the Programming Languages course that some students take, a broad exposure to a variety of programs occurs.

3. What is the instructor to student ratio in the introductory CS classes?

The intro courses tend to have between 15 and 25 students. All of the courses in the department are capped at no more than 25 with most capped at no more than 22. All of our computer science courses are taught in a computer lab, and all but one of our labs has 24 machines. The largest lab has 27 machines. We always allow for problems with the computers, so we always try to keep the actual number of students in the room to be 2 under the number of machines, hence the 25 and 22 caps.

4. What technology companies actively recruit at your college?

Career and Employment Services handles most of the formal recruitment sessions, and I am unfamiliar with the list of companies that do formal recruitment visits to campus. However, I do receive a lot of job descriptions to share with the students, mostly from a variety of local companies, often sent in by alumni. See below for a list of where our students have ended up in recent times.

5. What technology companies have recent graduates from the program gone to work for?

Some of the companies that have hired multiple students from us over a period of years include Lockheed Martin, Vanguard, Accenture, Monetate, Department of Defense, and Sungard. Many other small local companies hire our students as well. 

6. What is the average salary for a graduate from this department for their first job?
We do not formally collect this information from students, but based on the few offers that have been shared with me in recent years, the range of starting salaries is between $50,000 and $70,000.

7. Do many students in the program work at development internships during the summer or part time during the school year?

Yes. Although it is not a requirement of the computer science students to do an internship, we do have a large number do internships. Often these occur in the summer. Occasionally, they receive academic credit for the internship. Some students are able to do development internships on campus with a variety of offices that need skilled developers. We have been working with a local start-up called Intern-U that helps our students find both internships and full-time jobs upon graduation. We also have a computer science advisory board comprised of IT and CS leaders from a variety of fields in the area, and this board has been very active over the last three years in helping students with career-related matters, including the providing of internships."
34sstx,3,2015-05-04,Need some advice/insight,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/34sstx/need_some_adviceinsight/,"Hi guys, 

Not realy sure if this is the right sub, but some advise or insight would be appreciated. I'm now in my second year of PhD. During this time, my SO has been actively looking for a PhD for himself, but unsuccessful so far.

He's applied to a lot of positions and sent so many mails, always showing interest and so, but they usually remain unanswered or come back saying no and good luck. He also tried asking not for a PhD but starting with smaller things such as internships and so, but yet the answers were not positive.

His field of expertise is Public Health and Epidemiology, in which he has 2 masters and some field work done. However, he started his studies as a physiotherapist, and maybe this is what is keeping him away of getting a PhD, I guess some people may consider medicine students more suitable for this?
Anyway, he's quite moody and down about this and is starting to think maybe he is not good enough or he should start considering a different future. I realy don't know what to tell him or how to cheer him up, considering there's little I can do regarding this matter, apart from helping him looking for options and writing mails and cover letters. 
So I was hoping maybe any of you guys could provide some different advice or perspective.

Thanks a lot!"

I love the company and love how small and hungry they are to succeed. My internship currently only pays $12/hr. I was hired to learn just the installation aspect but the company realized i have a variety of skills and quickly bumped me up to project coordinator. I've been given my own office, i do estimates, draw up contracts, and handle other aspects of sales. I'm also going to be updating and managing their website as well as increasing their presence in the community with various marketing strategies. On top of that I handle any computer issues they have and also participate in the physical installation of the photovoltaic and solar thermal jobs we sign. In the next few days I'll be having a meeting with the owner and i want to be prepared to negotiate my salary and potential commission or bonus additions to that. The company is fairly small. The owner also has a hard cider business, a magnetic business, and a spray foam insulation business all located on the same company campus. I know they don't have alot of money coming in, but i also know that I'm going to change that fairly drastically in the coming months. What do you guys think would be a fair wage to ask for? I'm debating maybe asking for 40k a year which doesn't seem like much but i know they aren't currently a major player in the game. I'll be working ten to twelve hours a day so maybe an hourly wage with commission or something would be more beneficial to me. Everyone's input would be super  helpful. Also, is there any other subs i should ask this to? Thanks!

With my qualifications, how much can I realistically request?",[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/34t2ih/the_company_has_posted_the_pay_range_in_the_job/,"So I'm interviewing for a job as a web editor and social media/community manager tomorrow. A friend of my husband  posted a little job ad on her Facebook and Twitter account, so he put me in touch with her. She forwarded my CV, cover letter, and two writing examples to her boss and he has granted me an interview. 

Main details:

* I really want this freaking job, it sounds awesome and I love writing. I am a creative person and I think that I will thrive in this position and atmosphere, as it was described to me.

* I live in Paris and this company is searching for an American or British web editor to manage and write for the website, as well as manage the social media accounts, in English (specifically the Queen's English). 

* I am American and I have been teaching British English (ESL) for the past four years so I am very familiar with differences between American and British English, including expressions, idioms, and spelling. My connection at the company told me that there is a possibility they will launch an American version of the website in the future, so hiring me over a British candidate could benefit them, as they would not feel the need to hire an American in the future (saving money). 

* I am 27 and I have been living abroad (and out of college) for four years. 

* I studied theatre for five years at university in the U.S., but did take a lot of creative writing courses, playwriting, dramaturgy (research), etc. In high school I wrote for the yearbook, the school newspaper, and won some regional and national contests in writing. Although I do not feel that my high school accomplishments and experience ""count"" for much, it is worth noting that I have a history of loving to write. 

* I don't have a Twitter account. I do have a Facebook account and a lot of my FB friends and family follow my posts and photos, even the ones I haven't talked to in years. I feel like this says something about my ability to entertain people and keep ""followers"", but since they're friends and family it is probably not worth noting in my interview or I'll sound like a dope.

* I studied theatre for a few months here in Paris this past fall/winter, but I quit because I felt that it was a repetition of my previous studies in the U.S. and because I was unhappy with the curriculum. The professor did not allow enough time to create quality work, and this was very bothersome to me, especially as someone interested in writing.

* My only real experience in this field was a 3-month summer internship (2012) with a very hip and cute online magazine in Paris (it still exists today). I was hired to assist with the launch of the English version of the website. I wrote some original blog articles on subjects like DIY, cuisine, fashion, etc. and helped to translate the old French blog articles to English. I also did research to find bloggers and contact them to ask them if they'd like to be a contributor to our magazine. Note: I have scoured the website and can no longer find any of my original blog posts, so I don't have any proof of my writing now, but if he were to contact the magazine editor, she would certainly remember me in a positive light.

* My background says that my main passion is theatre, but I love writing. Unfortunately I put writing on the back-burner and it is obvious in my CV. One of the main reasons for that shift in college was that the English department and creative writing courses at my university were weak. It has also been affected by the fact that I moved to France without speaking the language, and for four years I have been building my language skills and the only jobs really available to me were: nanny, English teacher, or student. I feel that this has damaged my CV. 

I discovered that the company posted a few Craigslist ads over the past month and they listed the pay range between 20,000 - 30,000. I have done some research and I found that the average beginner salary for this position is around 18,000 euros annually, but that it can range up to 26,000 for an entry-level position. 

I know I am getting ahead of myself here because I haven't even had an interview, but I'd like to prepare myself in any way possible, especially since this is my first interview for a salaried position. 

**Considering my history and qualifications, how much should I realistically shoot for if they do make me an offer or ask me what I'd like to make?**

If I request 30,000 are they going to laugh in my face and escort me to the door? 

Any other general advice would be very welcome and I appreciate any information you can offer. Thank you!"

34v7iz,2,2015-05-04,How to get off for four weeks of a Summer internship?,Tylerlee12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34v7iz/how_to_get_off_for_four_weeks_of_a_summer/,So I committed to a Summer internship with a large financial company as an application developer back in February.  An opportunity recently popped up that will allow me to go out of state to work on an interesting computational seismology project for 4 weeks.  Would asking for 4 weeks off hurt me in anyway?  Any advice on how I should phrase asking my intern coordinator to let me go 4 weeks early?  I'm aware my chances are slim but I'd still like to give it a shot.

So recently at my pharmacy where I do my internship, they had an internet outage. I'm pretty tech savvy but I wasn't sure how to make my Iphone's tethering give internet to the network.

I tried to plug my Iphone 5S into my laptop using a usb cable and turned on tethering on my phone. Then connected my laptop to their network using a normal LAN cable. Then in Windows I used a thing called 'ICS' Internet Connection Sharing. Which basically would allow my to share the internet connection of my phone via usb to the lan cable. But it still didn't work. I assume it has something to do with ip-addresses and the router being confused. But I'm not sure how to do this. 

The actual outage took about 30 minutes but I want to be able to be prepared in the future.

If you know a solution or just a better way to do this, please leave a comment.

PS. Please don't respond with ""just get a MiFi hotspot and use that"". I want to be able to use my phone.

Thanks in advance!"
34vj8r,0,2015-05-04,I get the nagging feeling that I'm not smart enough to pass tech interviews at top companies.,Thounumber1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34vj8r/i_get_the_nagging_feeling_that_im_not_smart/,"My goal right now is to graduate and work for a software company in san francisco like twitter or airbnb (ideally one of these two) or dropbox, maybe square, etc. From what I have seen however, the hiring bar for these companies is extremely high (even higher than big 4 companies) and I feel like someone has to have some sort of natural innate ability to excel at algorithmic problem solving to pass these interviews, and I honestly don't know if I have such a thing. I failed a google intern interview several months ago cause I completely flubbed one of the phone interviews (even though the other two went well), and this sort of killed my confidence. I do decent in my CS classes and stuff but being good at interviews seems like a completely different thing. Is this a thing that I can improve at or is it just something I will always suck at? I have a decent head on my shoulders but I'm no genius. 


 I am interning at amazon this summer and hopefully that will boost my resume, and I want to also spend my time preparing for intern interviews at the aforementioned companies. I found CtCI to be useless quite frankly, cause the difficulty doesn't seem to match what a lot of top companies ask, so I will instead use Elements of Programming Interviews, and also look at geeksforgeeks questions and take the stanford algorithms course on coursera. Would this be overkill? Does anyone have any experience interviewing with the companies I mentioned, and are the interviews really extremely difficult, or am I just completely blowing this out of proportion? I have a tendency to make things seem a lot harder in my head than they really are. 

What I'm really afraid of is that I'll graduate with a job lined up that is not the job I really want that I will be unsatisfied with. From what I've read and seen, it seems that the hiring in this industry is kind of unpredictable, and that even if you do really well in an interview you may not be offered the job, and that kind of scares me knowing that whatever the hell I do, I still may not land the job I want.

34w0kj,40,2015-05-04,AWLOBY 0: Eyes Narrowed,taylorgbh,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/34w0kj/awloby_0_eyes_narrowed/,"Just because he knew why he needed to be here, didn't make him *want* to be there. As one of the premier archeologists of the Faran, he had been given the assignment of the millennia: excavating and investigating the ruins of a Schism-era human Planet-Breaker; a near mythic class of battleships that had been said to be able to annihilate entire star systems. He didn't believe such rumors of time; he knew how susceptible the truth was to embellishment with age. But that did not make the wreck any less powerful. If he could find even the smallest functional ship system, he could retire his children's children early on the proceeds from patents related to the hyper-advanced tech.

It was the potential riches that kept him going, deeper into the ship. His team had spent nearly a week cutting open an entrance at the closest spot to the bridge that was above ground so that he could reach the front of the ship quickly. The diagram of this ship's model he'd been provided confirmed his assumption that the front of the ship is where the controls would be found. Humans liked to face their ships forward.

Interns trailing behind him in their clunky suits and heavy equipment, he descended deeper, relying on the artificial light provided by his light intern. Reaching what his diagram indicated as the door to the bridge, he beckoned for his drill interns to step forward. Each second it took them to hack, pry and clamp at the door increased his excitement, and anxiety. His tail was writhing in anticipation as first a small hole into the next room appeared, followed by a crevice, and then a sizeable opening. Telling them to stop a moment, he stepped forward, squeezing himself through the hole with the help of the drill interns and landing gently on the other side. The drill interns went back to widening the gap to allow the equipment to get brought through which gave him the opportunity to search the room while he waited.

Despite literally colliding with the planet's surface at terminal velocity and burying itself under the ground, the ship's bridge at completely survived impact. It spoke to their architectural prowess that even the glass that allowed an observer to normally look out into the void with nothing more than their eyes could handle such a hit without so much as a scratch. But he wasn't interested in window panes. He hurried over to what looked like a control panel; it certainly had all the designs of the few human models he'd been able to work on. Like the others, the panel was very uniform, and his knowledge of the human's language allowed him to attempt to turn on the system. The harsh screeching of bending metal and his annoyed huffs filled the room as he unsuccessfully tried to turn the computer on. It was probably too much to hope for that a 300+ year shipwreck would have the iota of power needed to start up.

Activating his suit's light, he scanned the room for something, anything, that would be working. His eyes landed on a small pod, tucked into the corner of the room. As he stepped forward, he made out more details like the large cord plugged into a panel that emitted a soft glow from a few displays and the belts and bolts used to keep the pod in place, as if it had been moved to this room from somewhere else on the ship. Standing next to it, he brushed off the thin coat of dust on the pod's visor but saw nothing; the visor was an opaque black. Looking over the display, he tried to find a dial to open the lid. Hearts racing, he pressed a large, green button marked 'RISE'. It'd been years since he'd taken Human in language school but he thought it was similar to 'open' or 'up'.

The pod began to pulse with light as energy from what he decided was a power cable streamed in. The onyx visor began to change transparent and looking down into the pod, he saw the sleeping figure of a human. His mind raced at the possibility, the likelihood of a being, even a human, surviving cryogenically for this long. After all, the power must have gone out centuries ago.

As he pondered this, he noticed the incremental twitch of an eyelid and his breath froze. The humans eyes slowly opened, staring back at him, and all of the information he remembered, useless background details at the time, rushed back to him. This had been a Purge-aligned ship during the Schism, not a Steward. Cold feared gripped him as the eyes looked him over, surveyed him, without emotion.

The eyes narrowed.

I'm writing this because I need advice about how to proceed after this summer.

I guess my main question is - Should I just work on getting an offer at the PWM firm I'm working at this summer and plan on pursuing an MBA/CFA and transferring later, or should I work on securing a more applicable job for after I graduate that could lead into one of the roles I want? Is it feasible for me to switch to IB or ER with only a PWM internship on my resume?

I took diffy &amp; calc 3 last semester and dropped both.  This semester I took diff, calc 3, &amp; stats and I'm honestly probably only going to pass diffy.

Through college, being an only child who finally got freedom, I partied and hung out with my friends a lot, which it only got progressively worse, and just stopped doing my work and eventually stopped going to class.  I've been trying to find motivation every way possible; from reading articles, youtube videos, morning routines, meditating, writing, you name it.

I'm a current college freshman, psychology major. I'm also 100% self-taught in Machine Learning and Computer Science including in algorithms, data structures and low-level workings. I've been doing this since I was a little kid starting with electronics and digital logic and eventually moving up to programming. I basically spent all of highschool pursuing this interest as well, not focusing *too much* on the actual highschool curriculum.

Long story short, after consulting for a few startups building recommendation systems, search engines, computer vision modules and other data-oriented projects I have a few long-term full-time offers on the table. All of them are in the six-figure range. Most of them want me to start straight after my summer internship this year.

____

* My thought was to take a year off of school and to go join one of these startups because I feel like I'd learn more than I would in the classroom at a faster rate. 

* I wanted to get people's opinions on taking time off of school and if pursuing a degree is even a logical move for someone in my situation. Being self-taught, I've had people in this industry frequently say ""You should just be looking for a job.""

* I'm the first person in my family to go to college, my background mostly being made up of dropout business owners so family doesn't have an informed viewpoint as to what the best course of action would be. Though they admit that they don't know this, they of course give the conservative answer. 


* The reason why I feel like it's a good idea to chase the job opportunities is because I'm not assembling WordPress templates or something, there's alot of CS Theory and practical engineering knowledge I'd be using and picking up from mentorship.

* I'm not looking to leave school because ""school sucks"", I feel like the classroom environment isn't where I excel though. I'm doing psychology and not CS because I feel like it will make me better rounded. I'm extremely reluctant to pursue a CS degree because I feel like I'm going to get stuck in Python 101. "
34ws2v,5,2015-05-05,"I'm a Geek Squad 'agent' and I want to get a real job, but I've hit a wall. Advice wanted (slightly long).",mySeraphy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/34ws2v/im_a_geek_squad_agent_and_i_want_to_get_a_real/,"**Should I post this in Career Guidance or another subreddit instead?**

I'd like some suggestions or recommendations from people who have been in a similar position because I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a hole that I'll never get out of. I don't have a degree. I don't have much money. I work at Geek Squad. I hate my job. I get yelled at by old people who say the same thing every single day: ""I'm computer illiterate!"" and ""I bought it here so fix it for free!"". I'm burned out on the customer-facing environment (really just the general public) and am looking for something in IT field but just different. I would love to do support for employees/co-workers.

I'm good with computers but I know nothing of programing, networking, coding, admin/systems stuff, etc. I know how to build them, I know windows, I think I'm pretty damn good at technical support (when not faced with an old man yelling at me because he didn't back up his pictures of his late wife after he got the CryptoLocker virus from an adult website).

I've been hunting for jobs for over a year now and everything, even the simplest entry level thing wants a 4-year degree in practically anything. However, I don't have the time or the money to go and get a bachelor's degree currently. I really want to, but my current job makes that nearly impossible. I've had multiple phone interviews but most places simply never call me back. I've turned down one position that was a sales call center with a company simply because it's not what I want to do.  I'm nearing thirty years old and I don't have a career. I have a job with a company who may go belly up at any point and it's becoming depressing. So...

Here's where I'd just like some help.

I want a new job. Badly. But I wont take just anything. I'm leaning towards technical support (or desktop support?) due to my level of patience and knowledge that has been built up over the past four years by the most unruly people who refuse to learn anything. I absolutely love it when I can fix something for someone and make them happy and feel like they learned something. I want a job that I can go back to school with, so I'm probably looking at something 9-5 (or maybe a night shift IT job?). I want to go to school, get my certificates (A+ and others?), get my degree and open up a thousand more doors. But I have to make the first step now. I don't think I can do an unpaid internship to learn things because I live alone and I'm just barely making ends meet. My work schedule is random and it makes things beyond difficult. There's tuition assitance/reimbursement via work but the pool of schools they support is incredibly tiny. I'm looking into financial aid and the reimbursement option currently.

Now that the backstory is out of the way, I have some questions:

* 1) Am I truly wasting my time trying to get/save up for an A+ Certification? People tell me A+ is a waste of time. I've been with Geek Squad for over 3 years as a Consultation Agent (sales/repair, very technical support and sales heavy). Would my job experience be a suitable replacement or should I try to get an A+ as well? I've seen some places request Certifications in MCSA, A+ Hardware/Software, N+ , CCNA, etc. I sometimes feel like listing my job when applying for a real IT job makes me seem like a joke, but maybe that's just the minor depression of never getting a call back most the time.

* 2) What skills (or even certifications) are absolutely *crucial* for getting an IT job? I know Windows, iOS, OSX, Android to an extent, I can build computers and have fairly extensive hardward and software knowledge. I'm just no engineer or coder. I feel like every job I've applied for wants someone who can build an entire medical database in MS Word.

* 3) Does a cover letter truly make the difference? I haven't supplied one with my resumes but after reading a lot of posts on here, it seems like most employers simply throw away any resume without a cover letter.

* 4) Based on my skills, what should I start with? I understand there's career guidance options but it doesn't hurt to ask. I hope there's someone who has been in my position with a success story who can give me a bit of hope to get out of this hole. Hell, how would I even list my skills? I'll list what I currently do...

I sell a lot. We have consultations where we sit down with the 'client' and look at their computer, discuss the problem and try to recreate it, we then diagnose it and recommend a 'solution' (sales package) and deal with collecting money, taking checks, processing credit card applications. I do a lot with education, teaching people and offering guidance/support. I remove viruses (via proprietary software)  I install hardware, software, dispatch field agents to homes, do a lot of correspondence between home, field, and remote agents, perform data backups/transfers and set up automated backups, etc.

How should I list these skills in a more...readable manner? Can I even call them skills? I unfortunately doubt myself a lot so I'm sure that'll be my downfall. I feel like with my job title 'Consultation Agent', Geek Squad, and my skills listed, that employers just look at my resume, laugh and throw it away and go 'Go try to be a REAL IT guy first'.

I'd just like a little help before I lose my mind. For anyone who actually bothered to read this and reply, thank you so very much for even bothering to help. I know I come off as jaded, cynical, upset and negative, but I truly appreciate even the smallest bit of advice.

**TL;DR - Work at Geek Squad (and previously as sales at best buy), need a new job, don't know how to list my skills (Item 4). Want to advance into the IT field but unsure where to start. Advice / Subreddits /  links are more than welcomed. I was going to post this in the repetitive questions thread but I had four separate questions that I felt would get no visibility whatsoever.**"

While I was on vacation someone in our office (SMB) ordered two copies of MS Office Home &amp; Business 2013 from Amazon (fulfilled by some marketplace seller) for the interns joining our office this summer. When I got back I was told that one of the copies wouldn't activate, and the individual had called Microsoft and had been informed that the license had already been activated.

I asked to see the copies and it was immediately clear to me that they were counterfeit. The COA stickers are fake, and the license key itself looks like someone took a cell phone photo of a real one and printed it on label printer, really bad quality.

Anyway, I have already contacted Amazon about sending the counterfeits back to them for a refund. I need advice on who to contact at Microsoft about the domain the counterfeiters are using to distribute a cracked version of Office 2013. It's a .com domain which is serving up version 15.0.4433.1508 of Office.

I uploaded setup.exe from the ISO to VirusTotal and it seems to be clean except for two false positives (or maybe that's the keygen code?). 

https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/3ba59aa51f0eb241f4184d479cf59d121ff86324c09ac5d9415c0e0adc7fc7b5/analysis/1430733445/

I'm thinking that Microsoft might be interested in a .com domain distributing a cracked ISO of Office 2013, but I'm not sure who to talk to. I already called our Office 365 rep, but he didn't have any suggestions for me other than to call the general support line, which I figure won't put me in touch with the people empowered to seize the domain or send a DMCA, etc...

The domain is protected by WHOIS, and the actual server IP is some VPS in the Netherlands. I figure I could contact dynadot and their VPS host, but it would have a lot more clout coming from someone at Microsoft.

I was recently offered an internship at a fortune 20 company and I am excited at the opportunity, but unfortunately it only lasts for the summer.  If the summer internship goes well they said almost all interns get a full time position after they graduate.  My only issue is as a commuter student I won't have a job from August- december(graduate in fall), and if I do it won't pay as much because I doubt my current job would take me back after leaving.  

Is sacrificing some pay and savings for an internship as a big corporation worth it in the long run, or should I try and maybe defer the offer to the spring time after I graduate.  Are big names really worth having on your resume

Additional info: current internship pays more, but new internship at big company is in desired field of data analytics"

Now it's the week before, and my request for time off was denied because they have a ton of work for me to do this week. 

I know it's considered bad form to walk out without giving 2 week notice, but I already have a job lined up and I think I'm going to look back and regret the time I spent sitting in a cube instead of enjoying my last week with the people I love. What should I do? 

Edit: This isn't PTO since the internship is paid hourly. 

Financially, this isn't a big deal for me. I could make some decent money in the time I'd be working, but I have enough savings for ~3 months of living expenses on top of a signing and relocation bonus from the new job. "

34xzra,0,2015-05-05,How would you rate my college's computer science program regionally?,xogradyx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/34xzra/how_would_you_rate_my_colleges_computer_science/,"http://www.lasalle.edu/math-computer-science/computer-science/course-descriptions/
http://www.lasalle.edu/math-computer-science/computer-science/requirements/

I also asked the chair of the program's questions that I thought would help me get a feel for the program as a whole. I'll post them below.

1. What languages are the introductory CS classes taught in?

Our first-semester programming course is taught in javascript with the primary goal of teaching students how to program. The next two semesters are taught in Java, which forms the basis for our computer science degree.

2. What other languages does the department teach(Database languages included)?

The following languages are taught in required or elective CS courses regularly: SQL (in our database courses), VB.NET, php, asp, C, Android. In the Programming Languages course that some students take, a broad exposure to a variety of programs occurs.

3. What is the instructor to student ratio in the introductory CS classes?

The intro courses tend to have between 15 and 25 students. All of the courses in the department are capped at no more than 25 with most capped at no more than 22. All of our computer science courses are taught in a computer lab, and all but one of our labs has 24 machines. The largest lab has 27 machines. We always allow for problems with the computers, so we always try to keep the actual number of students in the room to be 2 under the number of machines, hence the 25 and 22 caps.

4. What technology companies actively recruit at La Salle?

Career and Employment Services handles most of the formal recruitment sessions, and I am unfamiliar with the list of companies that do formal recruitment visits to campus. However, I do receive a lot of job descriptions to share with the students, mostly from a variety of local companies, often sent in by alumni. See below for a list of where our students have ended up in recent times.

5. What technology companies have recent graduates from the program gone to work for?

Some of the companies that have hired multiple students from us over a period of years include Lockheed Martin, Vanguard, Accenture, Monetate, Department of Defense, and Sungard. Many other small local companies hire our students as well. 

6. What is the average salary for a graduate from this department for their first job?

We do not formally collect this information from students, but based on the few offers that have been shared with me in recent years, the range of starting salaries is between $50,000 and $70,000.

7. Do many students in the program work at development internships during the summer or part time during the school year?

Yes. Although it is not a requirement of the computer science students to do an internship, we do have a large number do internships. Often these occur in the summer. Occasionally, they receive academic credit for the internship. Some students are able to do development internships on campus with a variety of offices that need skilled developers. We have been working with a local start-up called Intern-U that helps our students find both internships and full-time jobs upon graduation. We also have a computer science advisory board comprised of IT and CS leaders from a variety of fields in the area, and this board has been very active over the last three years in helping students with career-related matters, including the providing of internships."

So, I am actually a Senior about to graduate from a liberal arts college in a couple weeks. I have a degree that has nothing to do with computer science, its a history degree. However, in the last couple years, I realized my interest in programming/IT and started taking programming classes at my school. I've taken Computer Science 101, Intro to Java, Android Application Development(Java), and am currently in Data Structures and Algorithm analysis in Java. I started applying to developer and IT jobs and internship a few months ago just hoping that I could land an interview and just show how passionate I was for it and that I could learn everything I need to know and more. After a few months of emails returning saying that companies were ""proceeding with candidates with more suitable experience,"" I got discouraged and stopped applying. Just yesterday, I got a call and email from a company nearby and they want to interview me next week. How can I prepare properly and show them that I will work my ass off for them? Thanks!

His business is expanding and offered to do a mentoring kind of internship to help with the expansion. The nice thing about this is that the times are pretty much whatever I want, so I could still take the 2 classes.   
On the other hand, I was offered a internship at a household name, manufacturing company. It is also a industrial engineering focused internship. I would probably be able to do 1 class with this.   
I still have 2 more summers after this. Which one would you recommend? Is a nationally known company worth the sacrifice of a class? My next two semesters are pretty packed, so I was hoping to get two done this semester. "
34y9f5,58,2015-05-05,Something funny's happening in Beijing...,sleepyhollow_101,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/34y9f5/something_funnys_happening_in_beijing/,"It’s so hard to put this into words.  I keep hoping that as I examine and re-examine the facts, I’ll find that I’m just being crazy.  I’m praying there’s a loophole to this insanity, that there’s something I’m missing.  But the more I stare into the abyss, the darker it gets.  And now I don’t know what to do.

Background: I’m a Chinese major studying abroad in Beijing and Peking University, which will hereon be referred to as PKU.

It started yesterday when I got out of class.  On Tuesdays (it’s currently Wednesday in Beijing), I get out of class at noon.  Because I typically have the whole afternoon free, I usually go to a little café outside of campus.

For reference, here’s a quick layout of said café in relation to the campus.  In order to get to the café, you leave out of West Gate, which is the big official gate that all the tourists takes pictures at.  Straight across the street are a few rows of apartment complexes.  You weave in and out of them for about a quarter of a mile, eventually passing a small fruit market and a supermarket.  At this point, you’ll be spit back out on the street, facing a small waterway that is bordered by white stone barriers.  Turn left and you’ll immediately see a black fence almost completely covered by green vines.  There’s a small opening that is easy to miss, but if you see it, go in and there it is.

The Stoic Café.  Tiny and out of the way and absolutely perfect.

Stepping through that doorway is like stepping into another world.  I know it sounds cheesy and cliché, but it seems like something out of a fairytale.  There’s a tiny courtyard paved with cobblestones and surrounded by every color flower you can imagine.  I didn’t know that many flowers could coexist in such a small space.  To the right are a few small gazebo structures shading tables and chairs, beautiful and rustic.  They appear to be hand-carved and perfectly at home amongst the flowers.

Once you enter the café itself, time seems to stop.  It’s somewhat narrow, like a long hallway that opens occasionally to a variety of tiny rooms.  The walls are completely lined with books in every language and there’s always soothing, slow music drifting out of some hidden speakers.  A few cats laze around and if I’m lucky they’ll sit on my lap.  I usually sit towards the back of the café.  It’s a little dark as the overhead lighting is poor, but there’s a nice desk lamp and it offers me a quiet place to study for a few hours.

I’ve really only got one issue with my go-to café: it’s so warm.  Seriously, it’s like they’re constantly running the heat.  As a result, I get a little drowsy (particularly after I drink my regular hot chocolate).  

Yesterday I was studying in the café alone (it’s usually pretty dead since it’s sort of hidden) when a drowsy spell came on.  Usually I can fight through it, but apparently today it was a battle I was destined to lose because I woke up around six in the evening, groggy and disoriented and just a little dizzy.

Luckily, I’d finished as much homework as I needed to for the next day.  I paid my bill in a hurry and rushed out the door.  I wanted to get home in time for dinner with my host family at seven.

I turned right as I exited the café and took another right through the apartment complexes.  I passed the fruit stands and the supermarket.  I weaved in and out of the parking lots and gates.

I exited the final gate and stood on the street, but something was wrong.

I was standing in front of a restaurant. 

There wasn’t anything spectacular about it, just your average noodle shop, a tiny bit sketchy.  The main problem was that it shouldn’t be there.  I was supposed to be standing right in front of the PKU West Gate.

But I wasn’t.

I looked down the street, confused.  Had I somehow taken a wrong turn and gone out a different gate?  The apartment complexes were huge and all clustered together, so maybe I was just further down the street or something.  I scanned to the left and to the right.  An array of small restaurants and shops lined the opposite end of the street.  I turned around and faced the gate I’d just come out of.  Once again, I scanned left and right.  Everything looked the same as when I entered, the same black cab still parked to my left along with the same ridiculously giant restaurant that I’d always wanted to try.

What the fuck?

Well, obviously I’d made some mistake, no matter how familiar the area looked.  I carefully backtracked to Stoic, then wound my way through the maze of apartments again.

I ended up in the same place, facing the same stupid noodle restaurant.

I was beginning to get frustrated and just a little scared.  I HATE being lost.  In fact, it is my least favorite feeling in the world, and I don’t typically handle it very well.

As I stood puzzling and unsure of what to do, a taxi came down the street and I practically jumped in front of it.

As I got in, I brusquely requested he take me to PKU.

“Where?” He asked.

“You know, PKU.  Just take me to the East Gate.” Maybe I’d have better luck there.  It was closer to my bus stop, anyway.

“Sorry, I don’t know that place.”

I stared at him, speechless.  A cab driver who didn’t know where PKU was?  Are you kidding me?  No way, not possible.

“Um… just take me to the Zhongguancun subway station.” I could get home from there if I had to.

He took me to the subway station and I hopped on, transferring twice until I reached the Huilongguan subway station.  On the way, I found myself standing next to a guy who looked about my age.  His heavy backpack and defeated look suggested that he, too, was a college student.  I took the opportunity to ask if he was studying at PKU.

“Where?”

Well, what the hell are the odds that TWO BEIJINGERS don’t know China’s most famous school?  This wasn’t making any sense.

I got off at Huilongguan and jumped on the bus to my house.  As soon as I arrived, my host mom chirped up from the kitchen, “How was work today?”

But… I don’t work.  Not even an internship.  I was studying abroad.

I muttered that it was fine and I wasn’t feeling well.  I locked myself in my room and promptly succumbed to a panic attack that lasted about four minutes, although it felt like an hour.

Once I calmed down, I pulled out my American phone.  Although I can’t make any calls on it due to my lack of a Chinese SIM card, I can connect to the Internet.  I mostly use it for WeChat.  I opened up my WeChat and tried to message the other American students who were at PKU with me.

All their contacts were lost.

I yanked open my computer and waited impatiently for my VPN to connect.  Once I got onto Google (seriously, China? You block Google?) I searched “PKU.”  It came up empty.  Not a single hit.

I opened up iPhoto.  There I saw pictures of me and my friends, doing class presentations, hanging out at the bar, singing karaoke, taking pictures with random Chinese people… 

But our faces were all blurred.  And everything seemed to be in motion, like our bodies were fluid and trembling.

Then my computer shut down.  And when I opened it again, all my pictures were gone.

The university I’ve spent two months at is gone.  All of my classmates are gone.  I apparently have a job that I don’t even know about.  I haven’t yet succeeded in getting a hold of my parents, or anyone else from home, for that matter.  I have no idea what to do.

Has anything like this happened to anyone else?  Please, does anyone else out there know about PKU?  Am I just going crazy?

34ybds,3,2015-05-05,2nd year Engineering student: Will ROTC+Military hurt me in the long run.,3rassMonkey,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/34ybds/2nd_year_engineering_student_will_rotcmilitary/,"As the title says, I am a college student that is about half way through an engineering degree.

For a while now, I have been wanting to serve my nation and give back, and I wanted to enlist right out of high school, but I am glad I started college first. If I plan to serve after college, anyways, I might as well do ROTC to help financially.

**TL;DR** : If I take ROTC and receive a commission as an officer, will it hurt my engineering job opportunities in the future? If I go ROTC, I will likely not be able to do any summer internships, and 4-8 years after graduation, I will be getting out of the military and looking for a job with no engineering experience.

I'm a CS student at an ok school, with no prior relevant internships or jobs.

I would ideally like at least $15/hr, but it's already May and no other companies have gotten back to me. Applying online seems practically worthless.

I would like to get some real-world experience before I graduate and I feel like I don't really have any basis to negotiate. I'm unfamiliar with the stack, have no prior experience, and have no competing offers. The only basis would be salaries of other interns in the area.

Due to my current job (part-time) and location I’m look for remote only.

I’m looking for an internship or junior position over freelancing because I find working with a team more engaging and productive compared to working by myself.  As an intern or junior I’d expect to be able to contribute, while also continuing to learn. I believe that with modern tools a remote developers can work together just as well as developers in the same building, and I hope to find a position with a company that embraces this idea.

Most of the time I spend in either the Middle East or the UK, but I am always up late (it’s 2am here now as I post this) so I can also work teams in the USA, especially if they are in Central or Eastern time zones.

I have about one year experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I am also familiar with tools such as git, npm, bower, gulp, and yeoman.  Also, I’ve experimented with front-end frameworks, mostly KnockoutJS and Angular. I feel I’m actually quite knowledgeable about Angular, and I enjoy using it. Lastly, I do have some knowledge of PHP, Laravel, and Wordpress. I’m not as productive in this with these tools, but I can read backend code, and even pitch when needed.

Lastly I’m a good writer and communicator.  I’m coming for a field that is very customer service oriented, so I’ve been able to refine my soft skills over the years.

I know this might sound like your typical 'how do I learn to code' post. However, I am CS major finishing my junior year and will be starting a software internship at the end of the month, so I do know some stuff. The internship will probably be some sort of front end development -- sorry, I can't be more specific because even I don't know what I'll be doing yet.

The problem is I didn't take any CS classes last semester, and the semester before I only took theory-based CS classes. So essentially I haven't coded for almost an entire year now. I've never been the type that programs outside of classes because I've simply never been interested in doing my own projects. I know, I'm the worst type of CS major.

I need help with suggestions on what I can read about, tutorials I can do, languages to learn, programs to write -- basically anything I can do so I'm not so rusty. I only have 3 weeks and want to cover breadth rather than depth, so I'd prefer to avoid the obvious suggestion: think about something I'd like to make and just make it. I don't have the time for it, and it doesn't fit what I'm trying to do here. To be honest I don't know too much for a rising senior CS major. I know some python, some C++, some Java, some C, some Objective-C. Not much else, and I'm not really proficient in anything.

Should I focus on the stuff I learn in school, like data structures, sorting/searching algorithms, how to write good code, etc? Or should I just practice writing code in a specific language or two? Maybe both?

I'd really appreciate input from people working in software companies who take in interns and wish they would be more prepared in area x or area y."

It was not my intention to overhear the conversation as I was just sitting at my desk, but Jacob wasn't speaking quietly on the phone when he offered Aubrey the salary for the position.

Aubrey just graduated from college this past month and only has internship experience. He has the same degree I do from the same university. I was just out of school when I started with the company as well. I have been with the company now for a year and 8 months. Aubrey will be making 22%+ more than me right from the start. I started in another position in the same department when I came onboard.

My question is, what should I do at this point? I feel very negatively about the company right now, so I am tempted to look for another job. I want to bring it to my manager's - let's call her **Ashley** - attention (though Ashley is not Jacob's boss) that I overheard Jacob's conversation with Aubrey and believe Jacob should be reprimanded in some way for taking a call like that from his desk where others could hear. 

I also would like to have a conversation about getting a raise based on the work I do.
I just had an informal review on my performance with Ashley this past Friday, and she had nothing but good things to say about what I am doing.

I was held in a temp position for a year and 3 months when the company initially told me 3 months. From there, I was to be brought on permanently. I have been in my position now since December and was not really given a review and given a small raise when permanently hired.
    
Overall, I am happy where I am with the work I do and my coworkers and don't want to rock the boat, but this is just eating at me now. What would be my best option?

Without giving too much personal information, I graduated at an US university with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I got accepted into a masters in Computer Science at an European university.  

The thing is am not european or american, I am doing both as an international student. This fact made it very difficult for me to find any internships in the US because in the Midwest companies didn't seem to receptive to me. Not only that but frankly I was struggling with many things, adapting to life alone, culture, etc...All my energy went into being focused on classwork and little on internships.

In the end I was able to graduate with a 3.3 GPA but was so burned out from all of it that I decided to take a semester between undergrad and graduate school off, but now I wonder if I was right to do that.

I just wonder what I should be doing to be certain I can get a job, specially in Europe. The problem again is no citizenship, meaning a lot of places are not keen on hiring me (even tho doing so IS legal - I can work for a year after finishing my studies).

Also, going back to my country is not a huge attractive option. My country has high crime, low quality of life. I have been studying abroad in order to have a better life for myself. My gf is foreign but It sounds silly to me to marry for a visa. I would like to achieve something on my own.

Thanks for all the help and making this subreddit great!

When first started studying CS I was excited about it, but in the past couple of years I've realized that it'll never be my passion again. I still want to be great at what I do, but I won't be spending my free time coding, that's for sure.

I've lived in this country for almost all my life (I lived in the US as a kid for a short while and then came back). So pretty much all of my education has been here. I speak, additionally to my native language, English and German fluently (and a couple of other languages but not fluently enough to warrant a mention).

Anyway, I read this sub quite frequently and I always see posts of recent grads asking if they should take the 100k or the 80k USD job, or how their CV should look, or asking about internships. None of that is a reality here, and while it's fun to live vicariously, it's starting to affect me negatively.

I have about 2 years of experience (in mostly web development) and I was a TA in school for compiler and computer architecture classes, so I like to think I'm a well-rounded developer. I currently work from home for a company that's located in the first world and I get paid what I would earn by working for a local company, i.e. I'm not even close to hitting 50k a year.

Lately I've been starting to feel very bad about the hours I work and the money I make. Where my career is headed and what I can do about it... I'm really starting to think this subreddit is painting me a picture of something I can't reach.

Should I be shooting to get to a first world country? Is keeping my remote job a good choice? Are there any other third-world developers here who would like to share their experience?

At this point I'm just rambling so I'm just gonna stop writing."

I'll be working a mobile development internship this summer, so by Fall I expect to be pretty competent in Android or iOS or both.

I like Web Dev, and I'm not opposed to doing it for a living by any means, but I don't want to shut out other options. Some of my other interests are:
-Machine Learning
-Computational Linguistics
-Augmented Reality and other advanced interfaces

However, I am not 100% sure how those tie in with web development. I just wanted to know if there were any particular connections to be made in those fields, if I should start practicing in ""lower level"" languages to get a leg up in them, or if I should just focus on web development (its a pretty big field in and of itself).

Due to my current job (part-time) and location I’m look for remote only.

I’m looking for an internship or junior position over freelancing because I find working with a team more engaging and productive compared to working by myself.  As an intern or junior I’d expect to be able to contribute, while also continuing to learn. I believe that with modern tools a remote developers can work together just as well as developers in the same building, and I hope to find a position with a company that embraces this idea.

Most of the time I spend in either the Middle East or the UK, but I am always up late so I can also work teams in the USA, especially if they are in Central or Eastern time zones. Basically I'm able to adapt to any reasonable timezone.

I have about one year experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I am also familiar with tools such as git, npm, bower, gulp, and yeoman.  Also, I’ve experimented with front-end frameworks, mostly KnockoutJS and Angular. I feel I’m actually quite knowledgeable about Angular, and I enjoy using it. Lastly, I do have some knowledge of PHP, Laravel, and Wordpress. I’m not as productive in this with these tools, but I can read backend code, and even pitch when needed.

Lastly I’m a good writer and communicator.  I’m coming for a field that is very customer service oriented, so I’ve been able to refine my soft skills over the years.

Mrs. Hammonds morning shriek for morphine ricochets from wall to wall, and reverberates into my ears like a gunshot. My consensus being that her vocal cords must be made from medal which scratches, and clangs together to produce what she would call talking. 

She's been in my wing for 3 days now. I understand she has severe burns, and it is just about the only thing she ever talks about. I've never conversed with her myself, but it's hard not to hear her screeching at the nurses. The short sighted, and the needy disgust me. 

Her nail on a chalkboard vocals caused me to be cross with a young nurse. I was upset because I had informed all the nurses that one of them must be near Mrs. Hammonds room at all times to ensure that the other patients, and employees of the hospital don't have to deal with one old ladies short comings. Sadly the nurses are unreliable on this matter. The burn units is our most ignored unit, and it's due almost entirely to the annoyance, and frustration that comes with trying to help someone you can't touch.

I'll make a point to apologize to that young lady tomorrow morning. I was not mad at the nurse I simply had a momentary infuriation due to Mrs. Hammonds continuing selfishness.

Dr. Conroy stopped me in the hall as I've come to expect of him any time I should happen to be walking with in his range of view. As annoying as I find, Conroys over saturated charisma he does seem to think I'm worthy of admiration. Which I find to be a redeemable quality. 
Conroy informed me that Mr. Zimmer, a former patient of mine hasn't been seen for 3 days. Conroy made a rather obscene remark saying, and I quote ""Maybe we got lucky, and he went snorkeling alone this time."" 
He was of course referring to Mr. Zimmers encounter with a tiger shark only three months ago which resulted in the loss of his right arm. I chuckled, and agreed with Conroy. 

Zimmer handled being an amputee with an absolute lack of grace. He was pathetically reliant on the nurses for even the most one handed of tasks. There were even allegations he had begged one of the younger nurses for masturbatory assistance. claiming that he was incapable because he had been right handed. 
I shared that story with Conroy which got a sincere, but obnoxious laugh out of him. 

An eavesdropping nurse commented on how that was my third missing patient in four years. Jocularly claiming I was cursed, and asking doctor Conroy to work on her should she ever be hospitalized. 

Doctor Conroy made a defensive statement praising my reputation, and skill set. Saying he'd have me work on his own children before himself. 

I retorted to the nurse by saying ""while I don't believe in curses I also scarcely believe in coincidence, but I say that to say only that it isn't that coincidental. 
I'm certain you'd concede to the fact that all of those patients received hair cuts with some regularity. It's a somewhat small town id be willing to wager at least two of them have had their hair cut by the same beautician. Is it perhaps that the sheers used by that beautician are possessed by an evil spirit that kidnaps the clients whose hair it most fancies, or is it the much more probable deduction that missing people are just like anyone else, and have had encounters with many people before they went missing?""

Conroy actually answered my question by saying ""obviously it's just more common than one would think."" As if my question wasn't entirely rhetorical. 
The nurse had lost focus somewhere in my explanation, and responded with this very generic sentence ""You doctors are all so crazy!"" 

I smiled politely, wished Dr. Conroy luck with Mrs. Hammond, and was on my way. 

Conroy replied as I walked away ""I'm not sure luck can help. Her burns are so severe we've been unable to place an arterial catheter so we don't even have a heart monitor, and she's only been able to take drugs orally. She's a breathing miracle, or disaster depending on how you look at it.""

I found Conroys last sentence interesting.

My shift is off to a most exciting start! As I was making my rounds I heard the unmistakable horrid sounds that could only come from Mrs. Hammonds old dry throat. No nurses had noticed the pained consistent, coughs, but coughs are common in a hospital, and nightshift nurses rely almost solely on heartbeat monitors to determine emergencies being that most patients are asleep as they should be. I entered Mrs. Hammonds room, and closed the door behind me. She was asleep, but her brain was fighting a failing fight to clear her throat of what was likely a piece of her own wicked charred tongue. A far too painless way to go for such a wretched women in my assessment, but her entire body was raw disgusting, and absent of skin. She looked as if she had used a box jelly fish as body wash. The idea of touching her disgusted me so I was content just watching her choke. I was smiling so intensely as I watched that my teeth still hurt as I'm writing this account of the events. Each cough was a failure for her throat to clear space for air, and each cough was a victory for the halls of my hospital finally being clear of this screeching bat. When suddenly the bitch coughs up whatever she was choking on! She sits up holding her throat with her eyes now agape. I wouldn't dare risk her throat healing. I grabbed her pillow out from under her, and covered her face. She couldn't quite scream, and her ""fight"", or rather lack there of was easily controlled. Very little pressure was enough to cease her movements, and not leave any indication of harm. I bent over close to the pillow, and sang ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away, but a house fire ensures I'm gonna stay! An apple a day keeps the doctor away, but a house fire ensures I'm gonna stay!"" 
Playfully pushing down on the pillow harder when I said stay. Until at long last the self serving atrocity  was cured. 

I had to lift her scab covered head to put the pillow back under her. I regret that truly because I don't think anyone would have had a second thought about it. They just would have assumed it fell on the floor as she choked. 

In my official report, and to my colleagues I explained that I rushed to help her, but by the time I got to her door she had already stopped coughing.  All of my attempts to help failed. The burn unit isn't my area of expertise, and I wasn't equipped to attempt resuscitation on a person in such a state. An excuse that didn't even take much effort, and was perfectly believable.

then I went looking for remote jobs regarding Node  and different

Is That it ?, I'm practically screwed.

I keep reading blogs about people who changed careers and became developers and managed to become professional developers through internships.

Even my developing country is worst of developing country, I read about girl in Jordan who only learned HTML &amp; CSS and got internship in Google (to rub salt on the wound, she mentions that she failed interview at intel IT department because she didn't know Javascript).

even when I tried to look for freelancing in odesk and freelancer, I found Indian companies undercut all the competition.


Now, I'm at loss, is there no future for me? What should I do.

THE SITUATION.

In a month I'll be graduating my Master's degree in Linguistics in one of the best universities of Russia. 

I have an opportunity to work in a foreign embassy for 1-4 years with a decent starting salary ~ 3700$/month.

Problem is - I've completed an internship in the Russian embassy to one of the East Asia's countries and I didn't like it one bit. Everyone there acted like convicted who are serving their sentences. Nobody's happy with their profession and would gladly try some other field. But they have their contracts that require them to work for years and years to come. In a nutshell - they're hooked for life.

Whereas I have yet to sign any contract and I... I want to escape it all. 

I want to study abroad. I want to go the Netherlands or some other nice country and study my ass off (I'm turning 23 in a month) in either Linguistics, Pedagogics or Computer Programming.

THE PROBLEM.

I am scared of getting too old and not having a career - that's why I might take that embassy job, but in the end I will be miserable - I just know it. If I go and study, I'll be 27 something when I graduate with no connections in a completely foreign country (I've been abroad only to one country during one month internship).

I don't know what course should I take: I have worked as a simultaneous interpreter for 2 years now (I'm very good at it - even my own government hire me when they need to get things done), I was a teacher for 7 months and a tutor for 11 months and I loved it (because of a flexible timetable, I'd hate to be tied down to some school or university and work 9 to 5), whereas I don't know a first thing about Computer Programming but I always wanted to try it.

Important note: all my friends say that I need a creative job where I would have a total freedom over things. That's why I'm a successful interpreter - because I do what I want to do and get good results. Same goes for teaching/tutoring. Is programming the same thing? How creative can you get? Do you have a freedom of your project? Can you recommend any other fields relevant to my skills? (I know Russian, English and Spanish - these are my only skills, to be honest). 

I have three questions to you, dear Reddit:

1. Would you take up that job in an embassy? Mind you, they want to put my in Central Asia/Africa/South America

2. If not, what course would you take up: Linguistics/Pedagogics/Computer Programming? Can I earn something in Europe as a linguist or a tutor/teacher? What about programmer? 

3. In what country/university would you study and why? I really want to study somewhere in Europe because I could finally travel by bike and go green to the max. Budget is, of course, a sensitive issue.


You are my only hope. Literally. Everyone else thinks I should take that embassy job because ""money""."

[How easy was it for you to break into the games industry and how easy do you think it would be to do so today?... im currently doing a digital design major and i want to aim for a career in developing games.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr095cv?context=5)|I never planned for it myself. I just loved bulding levels for Quake and eventually I was approached by Jens Matthies (who I've been working side by side with my entire career) and Starbreeze. I think this still happens today - especially when it comes to getting into the business as an artist.
 |Design is a bit harder I think - mainly because companies usually require a lot of experience with a few titles in the portfolio. As I mentioned in a previous answer - i think the best approach nowadays is to go through a game development focused education and through school get an internship. We have some truly great schools here in Sweden and for a lot of the students that have done their internship at MachineGames - it has resulted in a full time employment.
[Is that your real name?  If so it is pretty awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0iu6b?context=5)|Yes it is! I was born in 1971 and times were a bit different back then. My mother came from a region in Sweden called Dalarna where the name Jerk at that time was, not very, but fairly common. It's a variation of the name Erik and my mother and father thought it was nice to use a name from my mothers region. And what it meant in english wasn't even something that anyone would think about at that time. I would lie if i would say that it hasn't bother me from time to time - of course it has, especially when i was younger and travelling to US or UK I was always embarrassed to show my passport or id. But I have never thought about changing it - I'm quite fine with it nowadays.
[What do you think is the best way to get into games programming? and what do you think are essential skills to develop for programmers and designers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07osu?context=5)|Hi Regygamer - nowadays, at least here in Sweden, we have really good schools that are specialized in game developing educations. This is usually what I recommend when young people ask me how to best get into the business. It was a lot different when I started. We didnt have these types of educations back then.  
[How did you come about adding in the Nightmare levels in the Old Blood? Was there any challenges getting the old levels to run on the new engine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr080jp?context=5)|Hi! The first Nightmare level that we added to The New Order was not planned from the beginning - it was something that our team did for fun during development and when they got it working we of course wanted to include it. We have a truly amazing and very creative team here at Machine Games. 
[Would you like to make a Wolfenstein game in another genre than the FPS? Which one? Platform, TPS, even a strategy game??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr08a49?context=5)|Hi zeppelinsw! I think I always will prefer first person. Whatever game we're developing. Its a great genre that allows you to truly be the character you play. This is and always will be extremely appealing to me. 
[I really enjoyed the New Order what floored me was the great acting went so well with the gameplay. so i was wondering what was the decision to bring that great acting to a over the top action game ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07yi2?context=5)|Thank you for your kind words! We feel that it's our responsibility to bring the best possible story to any game we develop. We are fortunate to work with  amazing actors for both The New Order and The Old Blood. 
[Thank you so much for your time in bringing back Wolfenstein to the main stream. I thought The Old Blood was incredible and just couldn't stop pinching myself going back to Castle Wolfenstein. How much joy and pressure did you and and your team feel with such a monumental task? My first Reddit post btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0d4uo?context=5)|Thank you Jyncks! A lot of joy and a lot of pressure, but having Bethesda and id Software by your side certainly removes some of the pressure - and adds a lot more joy!  Personally, being a huge id-fan, it was a dream come true to work with such a legendary ip.   
[What are your plans for the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07mcv?context=5)|Hi - unfortunately I'm not quite ready to talk about what we have planned for the future. We are just one day after launch!
[The Old Blood is bloody awesome as The New Order, thank you! Could you please give any ETA on The Old Blood soundtrack release? I'm really desperate to purchase it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr09eoz?context=5)|Thank You! I love the music as well. Mick Gordon is fantastic. The cover of The Partisan is so amazingly good. Unfortunately I dont have any information on a soundtrack release today.   
[ of all thanks for bringing back all those amazing memories from RTCW to The Old Blood. I am so happy to see it once again and being able to replay story, funny because i wrote to bethesda if you guys consider to relase some kind of RTCW remake (we still play RTCW\). Game is awesome. Please tell me if you are going to keep on doing great work and if you have got already plans for future connected with Wolfenstein? Also will you add some new products to bethesda store? Cant wait to get them all!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0b0on?context=5)|You're welcome! I'm also, as you may understand, a big fan of Return to Castle Wolfenstein - its a great game.  I'm pretty sure there will be more stuff coming to the store and while i'm sorry to say i dont have any solid informtion on whats coming I'm very happy to hear you want to get them all! Thank you! 
[Hello Sir Gustafsson!  I am a huge fan of your work. Every single one of your games are on my fav games list! So, I guess you are one of my game idols?  If I want to become a game designer/director, what is the best and most effective way, without the involvement of direct programming skills, to show my ideas to.. lets say.. you guys?  Are you guys satisfied with the ID Tech 5 engine? Us gamers, especially on PC, look at the engine as a living nightmare, especially since it's coming from Carmack :(. Barely any modding capabilities, terrible optimization (60 fps cap? really?\) and texture pop-ins, baked lighting techniques... etc. What are some future plans for this engine and if given opportunity, what engine would you like to use instead? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr09ioe?context=5)|Hello Sir! Very nice to hear you like our games!  I would recommend to keep a look out for open game design positions at developers that are of interest to you and then submit an application with your ideas.  Yes, I'm very satisfied with id tech. Whatever technology you're working with there will always be challenges, but considering that we now have delivered two games running at 60 fps/1080p - I'm definitely satisfied.
[Hello Mr. Gustafsson, I was 14 when I first played Chronicles of Riddick (yep I know that game was rated M but I really didn't care, haha\). That game was a part of my childhood and I've been a big fan of you guys until today. Wolfenstein: The New Order was AMAZING and I'm having a blast with The Old Blood right now.  What really amazed me was how brave MachineGames and Bethesda were for making Wolfenstein TNO, I mean it was 2014, most people ask for multiplayer for a 60 dollar FPS game or else they won't buy it, but no, you guys decided to take a risk and made a freaking triumphant! Did you guys expect Wolfenstein TNO to be successful after taking that risky move? Also will Neumond Recordings' songs appear in the next Wolf games? :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr086os?context=5)|Thank you! We have always been a single player focused team and it's truly amazing to work with Bethesda, who always encourage us to do what we want to do and feel really strong about - story driven first person action adventure experiences. I'm very happy that a lot of people enjoyed The New Order - it shows that there's still a market for the type of games we love to create.
[Hi Jerk! Just want to start off by saying I love the work you and the rest of Machine Games are doing with the Wolfenstein! What other kinds of games can we expect from you guys in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr07s42?context=5)|Thank you XKV22! The only thing I can say for sure is that you can expect games with a lot of action and heavy weapons!
[What are your favorite pizza toppings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr0950e?context=5)|Minced meat, egg and Tabasco!
[So first off, I wanted to thank you and the team for giving us both The New Order and The Old Blood, as well as all the great games you guys made at Starbreeze. I have a number of questions, so just answer as many or few as you want.  What is the canon status of the series? With TNO it was assumed that at least Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein 2009, and TNO were all one continuity, with Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny also possibly being connected. But The Old Blood's first part seems to be at somewhat of a re-imagining or retelling of the beginning of RtCW.   If the canon has been re-imagined, would there ever be a possibility of the return of Robo-Hitler, or some other form of him, or would you prefer to go forward?  The Wolfenstein games are interesting in that they feature an extremely limited health regeneration in favor of an old-school health/armor system, which is rare in modern shooters. Was this just for the sake of capturing the Wolfenstein feel, or can we expect classic mechanics in future non-Wolfenstein games from you guys?  With modern Wolfenstein games, it's kind of been a series where a developer puts out one great game and then passes the torch to the next developer, allowing them to give their own take on the franchise. I feel like this is part of what gives the series its charm, since no two games are the same and it keeps each game having a fresh perspective. Do you intend to keep going with the series, or is TNO/TOB your contribution? I wouldn't mind seeing more Wolfenstein from you guys since your current games are amazing, but I'd hate to see Wolfenstein become ""The Machine Games series"" or for you guys to become ""The Wolfenstein developers"".  If/When you do decide to move on from Wolfenstein, what would you like to be next? Is there any hope of returning to previous franchises like Riddick, The Darkness, or Syndicate?   Are you guys ""set in stone"" with id Tech 5, or are you open to other engines in games not published by Bethesda? Is there a chance of a successor to the Starbreeze Engine?  Wyatt or Fergus? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3525au/hey_riama_im_jerk_gustafsson_from_machinegames/cr08e8w?context=5)|Hello JocLayton! You're quite right, The Old Blood is very much inspired by RtCW (one of my favorite Wolfenstein games) - especially by the first two episodes.  I definitely would want to see the return of Robo-Hitler some day - who wouldn't? I really wanted a health system that involved the classic 100 health/100 armor, but at the same time gave the player some possibility of regeneration. Basically to avoid situations where players just stand behind a cover and wait for the health to regenerate and instead encourage players to move around more, while still not ending up stuck with extremely low health - we had a similar system in Riddick (but with cubes) and it's a system that, I think, works very well with the combat we want to have in our games.  I'm not yet ready to talk about what we have planned for the future, but I am very happy with what we have accomplished with both The New Order and The Old Blood.  Wyatt - mainly because I love J so much.

Also, i'm finding that i'm struggling in a lot of my CS classes and get around a steady 2.5 where my overall cumulative GPA is a 3.0. I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety recently because after working this summer i'm not sure how much I want to program in the future as a career.  And I feel like my degree is centered around that. Is CS a versatile major to move into different fields such as business? If so, where or what possible degrees could be pursued instead? I feel like this field isn't really for me but at the same time I love technology and want to work closely with it as a career."

I just got rejected yet again from an electronics test engineering position. From the sound of the job practically any EE could have done it. 

I don't have any internships only mediocre at best research on my resume also a 3.0 GPA which I will probably remove from my resume.

I have about 6 months before my first student loan payment is due. In the mean time I am thinking about investing some of the cash I have left on projects that can showcase my skills in electronics and embedded systems.


What I have in mind so far is:
DC-DC converter. (1 using all analog components and one using a microcontroller)

Alarm system with a keypad using a microcontroller.


Any other suggestions? What would you do in my shoes? Are these good enough? Criticism no matter how harsh is welcome.


Yes I have had people look over my resume I just don't look good compared to experienced candidates.

Open to any suggestions.

EDIT: Also the only programming languages that I know are C, C++, and Python. I worked with RISC and MIPS too. Any other languages I should learn?"

Well, this semester ended and I got a D in one course. I was doing well in it until the final, which I completely bombed. It didn't bring my GPA down too badly, I'll have a 3.4-3.5, and I'm typically a good student, but I'm debating on doing grade forgiveness. My minor in CS depended on taking one class this summer, but if I do grade forgiveness for this course, I can't take the other one since the times conflict. I don't want to take it next summer either because I want to get an internship.

I then thought that I could take a few CS classes my last couple years and go for a master's in CS, but looking at the courses many programs suggest taking, I know there's no way I can fit them in my schedule and stay sane. I also really don't want to spend an extra semester here because money. How important are those classes? Are some more crucial than others? Do I have a chance of getting in? Should I just keep the bad grade and keep the CS minor? I don't know if it's relevant, but I have CS related research lined up.

**TL;DR: I am a biomedical engineering major who can't fit a lot of computer science classes into my schedule. Is it possible to get into a CS master's program without a ton of experience?**

I see people on here getting internships 2 years into CS degrees, but 2 years in I'll have not a SINGLE CS or programming related class.  
  
My step brother goes to a different school in another state and they offer a CS associates (which he plans to transfer) and he is already taking programming classes.

354q58,4,2015-05-06,How beneficial are internships during the summer between semesters?,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/354q58/how_beneficial_are_internships_during_the_summer/,"Preface: this isn't a troll, I'm using a secondary burn account since I may be giving a little too much info. 

I'm a **computer science major**

Okay, so I'm in a situation where I could theoretically have internships lined up for 3 summers. One this summer is already decided for sure, it's a government agency comp sci internship. 

My other internships are possibly with Northrop Grumman. It's through their scholarship program where I am given a 2.5k scholarship each year and can renew it by interning for them two years. So that equates to pretty poor pay (technically unpaid but the scholarship obviously)


So, would these internships help my future job prospects? I hear that in comp sci your resume really doesn't matter nearly as much as other career fields. I'm going to a college where start ups are pretty common and the mediocre ones are always looking for cheap code monkeys. 

Considering the scholarships are low enough, do you think it'd be better to make more money working for a crappy start up? I feel like the start up would give me more intensive experience but the name of Northrop Grumman may also help in grabbing a future job?


I mean theoretically I could do this with my summers:

* Senior HS: Gov agency (paid) intern

* Frosh: NorthGrumm (unpaid) intern

* Soph: NorthGrumm (unpaid) intern

* Junior: Start up or research

Senior: graduating...


But that locks me out of either undergrad research or a start up over the summer. 


Okay some may say I'm over planning but I like planning ahead and it worked well for me in high school

it’s my first post on this forum although i’ve been lurking anonymously for a while and i made a throwaway account just to make this post so apologies for bad formatting etc. (still getting the hang of things)   this post is going to be pretty massive (even though ive tried my best to make sure it’s the “condensed” version) and im assuming pretty messy since there’s a tonne on my mind and i guess i just needed somewhere to let it out and someone to bounce ideas off so here i am.  i guess my issues might be “insignificant” compared to some of the others on this forum but to me, it’s still doing my head in so any responses at all would be really appreciated.

      
**please skip to TLDR at the end as necessary - thanks for reading and your help in advance!!**    


so i turned 21 in the middle of last year (2014) and ever since then my life has gone into crazy tornado mode.   although i presume change is pretty normal at this stage in my life (just turned 21, a recent college graduate etc) i’ve been faced with and am still facing some pretty difficult decisions which have and will directly and indirectly affect the rest of my life.  (or so it appears to me at least)

 


as mentioned, i recently graduated from my 4 year undergraduate college degree from my home country.  my family (parents and brother) moved overseas to the USA as soon as i started college in order to be closer to my other relatives and also to give my younger brother better college opportunities in the future (everyone knows that USA still has many of the top colleges in the world).  at the time, I could not move with them as i had just missed the college application deadlines and i did not want to wait another year before starting college when i could start straight away in my home country.  in addition, i had just been offered an internship with a large firm in my home country which i felt was a good opportunity at the time.  hence for the next 4 years i rented a place, paid for it myself with my internship money and completed my college degree.  during those 4 years of college i met my boyfriend of the time in the first semester of first year and we started dating since then and for the next three years.  

soon after we started dating, our two friendship groups merged into one and over the course of the next few years of college, everyone within the group became incredibly close (about 10 people with 1 or 2 joining and leaving over the years).  after my 21st birthday, one of the other guys in our group (lets call him C) and i became increasingly close as C’s best friend “L” had gone overseas for exchange so i guess C was just looking for someone to hangout with etc. absolutely no ill intentions from either of us.  my boyfriend at the time “B” (B for boyfriend) was a really chilled, trusting, easy going kind of guy but we had different interests.  i was the typical college party girl and i partied hard, he was social too but he didnt drink and preferred sober chilled outings/dinners with friends as opposed to the crazy party life but still he allowed me to do what i wanted with very few complaints.  he wasn’t the jealous type and would happily let me go out with other guys even 1 on 1 because he trusted me not to do anything that would hurt him.  unforunately his trust was misplaced.  one night C and I were out - B was actually there too it was the three of us for dinner but B had to go home early because he had an early start the next day but C and I didnt have much to do so we decided to stay out for a bit longer.  C and I had already started drinking (C was also the party type) while B was still with us but it wasnt until B left that we got drunk … and then it happened.  C and i shared a kiss.  

 i don’t need a lecture on this, im not proud of what happened and i realise what i allowed to happen was incredibly selfish, disrespectful and downright scum.  C and I both realised that so we decided to distance ourselves from each other.  I tried to save the relationship between B and I, reasoning not to tell him about the incident as it was a one off thing that would only hurt him and his trust if he knew.  But in truth, that was already the beginning of the end, once that line was crossed there was no return.  Although C and I both tried to distance ourselves, we would inevitably see each other in the same friendship circle etc.  We still got closer even though we tried to stay away and one night we ended up sleeping together.  (scum scum scum…) 

 Eventually B and I got into a pretty big argument over the declining state of our relationship in general. (inevitable considering what i had done)  At the same time C was giving me an ultimatum saying that he couldnt be “that guy” anymore.  I knew that there was no going back after what I had done to B and that it completely wasnt fair to B that I wasn’t 100% his anymore so after that big argument, after 3 years of dating, i broke things off with B without telling him the real reason for the break up in fear of hurting him and ruining his trusting nature forever.  I had no intention of getting with C at the time.  Even though C and I had a pretty good “connection” both physically and emotionally, we both knew that we could be nothing more than FWB at most because of the deception and lies from which our relationship was founded on.  we never thought about a future together but for the next few months after i broke up with B, C more or less served as my “rebound” (rebound in the sense that he was the person i was spending all my days with now) although in doing so C eventually confessed to me that he had been developing feelings and was ready to look past our history. eventually some time later, i realised and accepted these feelings as mutual.  

back to the point about my family now - so as i mentioned i just graduated, not long after C confessed his feelings, i took an extended leave from work (that internship that i was doing) in order to visit my family for 3 months.  now, my family was pressuring me to stay with them in the USA now that I had completed my degree.  although i didnt have a job in the USA, my family desperately wanted me to stay anyway to try either get employment with any small firm or even continue studying if that was possible.  this was all however unguaranteed as to whether or not i would be accepted into a grad school/masters degree (my marks were very subpar due to my party life… i know… shameful) or if i would be successful in gaining employment.  my family raised the point how even though i was working my internship (now turned full time graduate role after my graduation) back home, the cost of living (rent) would render me worse off than if i took up a role in the USA which paid even just HALF of what i was being paid at home.  although the internship back home was difficult (long hours for very basic pay) it was for a reputable company but the key thing was i wasnt sure it was something that i wanted to do for the rest of my life.  another point to consider though was my residency with the USA - if i chose to return to my home country to live and work, i would forgo my US “green card” residency which you may know is quite a valuable thing to have. (people marry into the US just to get this … )  

during my 3 month stay with my family in the USA (i’m still here at the moment actually) an interview opportunity presented itself back home in the form of a graduate program with another company which was in an industry that i objectively would have liked more than the current one i was in however, in light of multiple reasons such as the cost to change my air ticket to go back for an interview where the position wasn’t even guaranteed to be mine and the fact that i would have to start a fresh with younger graduates and have no “edge” gained through my internship work with the initial company etc. i decided with much difficulty and reluctance to forgo the interview opportunity back home and stay for the rest of the 3 months as intended.  

now that i am drawing closer to the end of my 3 months stay, the dilemma is becoming increasingly pressing as to whether i should go back home to continue my life in the internship/graduate job that i have done for a few years already although it is difficult and i dont love and dont intend on staying in the industry for the rest of my life (but im hoping there will be exit opportunities down the track to other industries etc), whether i should go back home to a guy with whom i have a messy history but i feel that i am truly compatible with, a guy who challenges me to grow as a person and as a couple but face the rest of our friendship group/my now ex (B) and forgo the opportunity of being with my family, watching my younger brother grow up, forgo the opportunity of the potential to find a better job in an industry which i like working in and also give up my residency status here in the US.   

it’s been a crazy 10 months or so for me but one way or another i’m glad that i’ll be over soon. 

thanks for reading, and any comments would be appreciated.  i just feel that theres so much uncertainty right now and i get that everybody’s choices are half chance but i guess any feedback would be appreciated as to my weird situation. THANK YOU!! 

**TL;DR -  should i move to a new country in order to be with my family or should i go back to my home country to a guy that i’m interested in having a relationship with? (career considerations also for both)**

**Home country:**

PROS:  

- guy im interested in pursuing a relationship with (although we have a complicated history)

  
- established job in large firm (although not in my preferred industry)

  
CONS: 

- living costs are incredibly expensive (close to 50% of my income)  

**USA:**  
PROS :

- my family

 
- green card residency status 

- no need to pay living expenses (rent)  

CONS: 


- unemployed (unsure if i can find a job or even if i could it may be in a much smaller firm with less career advancement opportunities) 

- having to start over (friends/network and connections etc)

I don't have an internship, so I'm kind of relying on side-projects to score interviews. A few days ago I set up a Github account, and went through all my projects and posted the better ones. Some of them are from 2 years ago and almost all of them have design flaws that happened from not planning ahead and taking shortcuts. Should I take them all down and get to work on something better?

PS: If anyone is willing to take a few minutes look at my github and let me know if it is up to standards or give me some tips on how to make it look better, I'd appreciate it very much. I don't mind at all if you tell me its crap and I should start over. PM me for the name."

A while back, I began an internship at a software company. They gave me and the other interns a short training period on the core concepts and technologies that they use, and then threw us in the deep end to start writing code, full stack web development. It was a blast! Recently, they hired me as a true employee.
  
I'm still in college, completing my CS degree, but I've found that as the semesters have passed since beginning with this company, my motivation in school has increasingly tanked. Assignments and content are no longer motivating and I find myself caring less and less about the degree. It feels like even the surliest of bugfixes bring a greater sense of accomplishment and joy than re-learning the same algorithms for the fourth semester in a row.  
  
I don't think this is a case of senioritis, as I had never felt this way up until programming professionally, but I feel like I'm really in a corner here. Do any of you have experience with this? Did you stay in school and complete the degree? If so, how did you keep yourself motivated? I really want to finish the degree, considering I'm already a senior (though I have one more year left), so any tips on motivation would be fantastic.

355mxd,1,2015-05-07,I want to work in IT. Need advice on how to take advantage of my current position.,SovietK,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/355mxd/i_want_to_work_in_it_need_advice_on_how_to_take/,"I currently work as a graphic designer in a small company (about 20 people).

We're running on a tight budget and are generally understaffed. We get by but there are many things that are just never taken care of. This combined with a very relaxed atmosphere means if someone wants to help out with anything they're generally allowed to do so regardless of their field.

This means I've basically become the IT guy (I even [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2vn9y5/i_speak_computer/) in /r/talesfromtechsupport). For now I've mostly been doing stuff to help myself (Cut my workload by 30% in the last year - pretty much the reason I have time for this as I have to be on site 37 hours a week), and fix stuff that was broken, but I thought there must be more I could do.

My contract expires in september and I don't know if it'll be renewed. If not I'll probably study IT - an education that requires a 4 year (paid) internship in my country. At least the route I plan on going.

**What can I do in my current workplace that would make me an a desirable intern?**

There is much to do here. Wonky computers, wifi, printers, a local server that could use some cleaning up. It sounds like a shitty place I know but the staff and the products are really awesome."
355tld,1,2015-05-07,Which path in life should I take?,anotherstudent11,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/355tld/which_path_in_life_should_i_take/,"Alright, hear me out.
THE SITUATION.
In a month I'll be graduating my Master's degree in Linguistics in one of the best universities of Russia.
I have an opportunity to work in a foreign embassy for 1-4 years with a decent starting salary ~ 3700$/month.
Problem is - I've completed an internship in the Russian embassy to one of the East Asia's countries and I didn't like it one bit. Everyone there acted like convicted who are serving their sentences. Nobody's happy with their profession and would gladly try some other field. But they have their contracts that require them to work for years and years to come. In a nutshell - they're hooked for life.
Whereas I have yet to sign any contract and I... I want to escape it all.
I want to study abroad. I want to go the Netherlands or some other nice country and study my ass off (I'm turning 23 in a month) in either Linguistics, Pedagogics or Computer Programming.

THE PROBLEM.
I am scared of getting too old and not having a career - that's why I might take that embassy job, but in the end I will be miserable - I just know it. If I go and study, I'll be 27 something when I graduate with no connections in a completely foreign country (I've been abroad only to one country during one month internship).
I don't know what course should I take: I have worked as a simultaneous interpreter for 2 years now (I'm very good at it - even my own government hire me when they need to get things done), I was a teacher for 7 months and a tutor for 11 months and I loved it (because of a flexible timetable, I'd hate to be tied down to some school or university and work 9 to 5), whereas I don't know a first thing about Computer Programming but I always wanted to try it.

Important note: all my friends say that I need a creative job where I would have a total freedom over things. That's why I'm a successful interpreter - because I do what I want to do and get good results. Same goes for teaching/tutoring. Is programming the same thing? How creative can you get? Do you have a freedom of your project? Can you recommend any other fields relevant to my skills? (I know Russian, English and Spanish - these are my only skills, to be honest).

I have three questions to you, dear Reddit:
1.Would you take up that job in an embassy? Mind you, they want to put my in Central Asia/Africa/South America

2.If not, what course would you take up: Linguistics/Pedagogics/Computer Programming? Can I earn something in Europe as a linguist or a tutor/teacher? What about programmer? OR RECOMMEND ME ANY OTHER COURSE THAT WOULD SUIT MY SKILLS AND NEEDS!

3.In what country/university would you study and why? I really want to study somewhere in Europe because I could finally travel by bike and go green to the max. Budget is, of course, a sensitive issue.




You are my only hope. Literally. Everyone else thinks I should take that embassy job because ""money"". But I'm really scared of moving anywhere on my own. And not having career by the time I turn 25. "

I applied to a bunch of the big names in the bay area and a couple in DC, though I think it's too late for most of them, and now I'm applying to jobs where I live.

The problem is that where I live (city of ~1m in the South), there aren't very many software companies. I'm going to apply to all of the decent-sized ones in my city, but I feel like I have slim odds since I'm a rising sophomore, it's already May, and none of them are very big.  I am 3 hours shy of senior standing though, so I have taken a decent amount of CS and math classes.

I do think there is a very good chance that I can get a job in IT / IT consulting / Systems Engineering in my city. Would this be an acceptable alternative to an actual software job considering it's my first summer of college? For what it's worth, I plan on making an app, website, and potentially setting up a server for the app on my own this summer, so I think I'll still be picking up some good coding experience. "

* I'm creative (with text). 
* I know a lot about computers (Windows mainly, I lack skills in actually putting one together though). 
* I have two degrees in Marketing (but I hate it, I know I should've figured that out sooner while I was getting my degrees). I just think it's boring work, and it's really something I don't want to do. 

My previous job had me working as a content specialist, where I'd create texts/descriptions for computers, videogames, toys, clothes, headsets, tablets, phones. Whatever, you name it. I got laid off on the 31st of December (contract wasn't extended). I then took a few months 'off' because of health issues. Now I'm fully back in my game, but I have no idea what I should do. 

I have the knowledge, interest and skills to do work with computers, but I don't have the neccessary papers to say 'hey, I'm good at this'. I could look for a data entry job (which I'd be very good and efficient at because of my typing), but it wouldn't pay a lot. I've looked into a bunch of content specialist jobs, but they also require me to update their social media channels. I've tried that in the past (as an internet marketing intern) and that didn't go so well. I'm kind of stuck, I'm hesitant. I'm nervous. One thing I do know is, I don't want to go back to school. Sure, I'd follow courses to be able to get further in life while gaining more skills, but I don't want to attend school for another 4 years.

I took java and database organization this spring semester. However, I'm already finishing a chemistry batchelors, and have a math minor. 

So my question is, of my options, I could graduate next summer with just a minor in computer science. Or stick it out and graduate the one after with a double major, or maybe a masters. The question is is it worth the time? I already took one semi worthless computer organization class also that was required for the degree. So I was wondering whether it wouldn't be better to just focus on learning this summer and through the next year, with an internship next summer and whether that's actually enough time provided I have projects to show off by then.  

Will I really need the full time to learn enough, getting the whole degree or should I focus on getting out faster? I'm old enough I should have been graduating already, but just starting with computer science now. So I don't want to spend more time then I have to.

**Other question:** is there some kind of list somewhere that contains a summary of every major term and concept to get acquainted with, as well as topics to learn? My brother said he graduated with a degree, and apparently didn't even know what an object was."

So one job I'm applying for is my current job that I have a good chance at (but is not promised, depends on who else applies) and I'm pretty sure I will get an interview for (around early June).I also applied for another job that I have no clue if I'll get an interview for that if I did would also be around early June. 

Lastly, I just had a phone interview today (for a job I applied to awhile back) and she said if I continue I would have an interview at one location and then another (that is far away). I would anticipate these interviews to be mid May through early June. 

My dilemma is if I get these 2-4 interviews during this 2 month time frame... how do I take all this time off? I'm hoping one I could manage on a lunch break but the one that is far away would definitely be a full day off. The job that has two interviews doesn't know I'm employed (just that I'm graduating in may). 

I just don't want to look bad to my internship that is only two months long and have to take off 2-3 days of work. Should I be honest and say what it's for? One of the jobs he knows I'm applying to but not the others.

356w48,46,2015-05-07,Summer nears... here's some advice for you soon-to-be interns!,propionate,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/356w48/summer_nears_heres_some_advice_for_you_soontobe/,"We’re almost there! For most, finals are either happening or about to begin… and that means internships and co-ops are just around the corner as well. I’ve been with my current company as an intern for a year and am moving across the country in two weeks to begin an internship elsewhere. The past months have taught me a few lessons that might be useful to others, so I figured I would share them. They may be obvious, but if anything they’ll serve as good reminders.



1. **Challenge authority with utmost care.** This holds true in any job, but even more so when you’re a new-hire/student. Regardless of how sure you are that someone is wrong – be they fellow intern, engineer, or supervisor – voice your opinion as a discussion point, not a correction. If you’re a characteristically sassy person, bury those tendencies deep inside of you until you know your coworkers well. Similarly, if you’re the one who always feels obligated to correct the professor or point out to others that centrifugal force doesn’t exist, just don’t be yourself for a few weeks. First impressions are important.

2.	**Google first, ask questions second.** You’re going to be confused at times. Acronyms won’t make sense, conversations will sound like another language, and tasks will have no apparent beginning point. Before bothering someone else, take two minutes to Google your questions. 50% of the time, it works every time. 

3.	**Take initiative, but do so without drama.** As you become more familiar with the work that you’re doing, you will begin to spot small jobs that can be done or things which could be improved. Regardless of what it is, confirm with your supervisor that you can do something about it, and then *just do it*. Don’t work in secret on something for weeks and then reveal it to your boss like a grand Christmas present. This will not endear you to anyone. Before spending any company time, ensure that your initiative is valuable. If it does end up being pretty neat, don’t flaunt it around the office. Pat yourself on the back and keep working. 

4.	**Coworkers can be friends too!** No matter how old or young, veteran or new-hire, all of your coworkers are potential pals. If you’re invited out to lunch or drinks, go! If people are discussing their weekends on a Monday morning, join in. 

5.	**Take notes.** Think you’re going to remember the model number your boss just told you? Or the specifications for the instrument you have to procure? You’re not. Write it down. WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN!

6.	**Take more notes.** Do. Not. Trust. Your. Memory.

7.	**Be honest.** Be honest about your understanding, your progress on assignments, your dog’s middle name, everything. The quickest way to lose the trust of your coworkers is to lie. (For the record, the second quickest way is to be a dick). 

------------------------

/u/Setruss 

8. Be nice and have a good attitude. People will like you more if you're generally cheery and take things in stride. Treat other coworkers with respect, no matter what.

9. Remember to be professional. Don't get too informal without first getting the ""feel"" of the company culture.

10. Don't spend all of your money too fast! I've saved ~30%-50% of my salary and I'm sure the early start on my 401k and Roth IRA will help me in the long run.


---------------

/u/vNaughtTcosTheta

1. Ask for more work.

2. Give input - most engineers are set in their ways. Last summer, a couple of my suggestions (that were totally unrelated to my project - I just liked to sit in on others' meetings) were considered and one was funded.

3. The most important thing is to look professional. No matter how good your work is, it will be ignored if it isn't clean and professional.

4. Go out drinking with the other interns every night.

5. Talk to your boss occasionally. Ask him how you're doing.

6. Talk to your mentor (if you're assigned one) more.

------------

/u/lastsecondescape

1. Get things done right. People will likely give you very simple tasks to start with. Make sure you do the small stuff perfectly, because then they will slowly build trust with you. Make a habit of checking everything before you turn it in.

2. Be social. if you are social it will shorten the time it takes to be ""one of the team"".

-------------

/u/cmeng 

1. Set up weekly meetings, ranging from 15-45 minutes. Usually these are quick progress meetings, held on Friday. What's discussed is: What I've done the past week; Areas where I think I need help; Areas where my supervisor thinks I am lagging behind; What is expected of me in over the next week. It is very important that your supervisor put this in their calendar... otherwise they'll forget, and it'll get pushed to next week, ad naseum.

2. Don't be the last person to show up to work. 2a) Don't be the first person to show up to work.

3. Don't ask for help until you've researched the problem. If you need help, make sure you're starting out like this, or something similar: ""I tried this method, but..."" or ""I couldn't get this to work, so I researched blah blah blah, and I still can't get it to work"". 3a) Don't ask your boss to do it for you. Ask them to ""give you advice"" or ""point you in the right direction""

4. Talk to people in other departments.

5. Get everyone's contact information / business cards before you leave.

6. Don't become facebook friends until after your internship is over (if at all, unless it feels appropriate to do so).

7. Write everyone you had direct contact with / reported to (should be no more than 5 or 6 people) a handwritten thank you card at the end of your internship. For everyone else, a warm email will suffice.

8. Always be nice to the Admin Assistant / Receptionist / Secretary.

9. If anyone says to you ""You fly I buy"" say yes. They're offering to buy you lunch if you pick up take out.


------------------

/u/StructEngBrah 

1. Ask for more work but within boundaries. Don't pester for work every 30 seconds.

2. Prepare for a presentation at the end of the summer, I always had to give one. Take screenshots of your work, scan hand calculations and keep these in a folder for later use. Nothing will get you a job faster than knowing how to present in front of an audience. I got two job offers after internships and was told it was because my presentation was good. I did very little work at one internship, so that job offer was 100% because of my presentation.


3. Go out drinking with your other coworkers too, not just interns! Industry is raunchy man. I get sloshed with some of my bosses at my first internship. Depends on company culture, some will not drink as much as others.

4. If you enjoyed it, make it known at the end of the summer if you want to work there. Say you enjoyed your summer and would love to work here full time.

If you have your own lessons to add, throw them in the comments and I'll put them up here as well :) Good luck to all!

Edit: Running out of room. I'll add stuff if it's new/extra good, but otherwise look to the comments for other users' input."

What I am attempting to do is to determine that average time per week that each intern actually works and from there, determine the ideal hours per a week for an intern to week by comparing the hours versus our graduation rate from our program. The problem I am running into is that our interns come in in groups of approximately 20 and most of the time start/end on a date that is not the beginning or end of a pay period and, therefore, when i run my weekly averages in excel the average is skewed since 20+ interns do not work a full period at the beginning or end internship. So, my initial question is this; what can I do in excel that will reflect the true average of hours per week each intern works instead of going through each individual interns hours and manually recording their pro-rata average?

I have always wanted to go to Davis, but after visiting UCI I really liked the campus and the engineering program. However I went on UCI Celebrate 50 years, so it was very busy. I've heard that UCI is ""boring"" on the weekends and there is not much to do in Irvine itself unless you drive to Newport Beach or LA . I am surprisingly now conflicted b/w UCI and UCD for Mechanical Engineering. I have until May 13 to decide if I want to go to Davis or UCI. In terms of engineering I have heard they are about the same ranking, but does anyone have any positive or negative experiences with any? Now for Davis, I really liked the college town feel and the campus, but does it ever get boring that there is not much around (unlike Irvine located in Orange County). Another thing I wanted to know is if companies are interested at these schools for jobs and internships. From what i've heard, UCI is better because it is located in Orange County (I could be wrong, I really don't know). I guess what I wanted to know is how the college life in both UC's and if anyone has any experiences with engineering at either school. Any feedback is helpful, I have less than one week to decide where I want to go to college. Thanks!"

I just finished my Junior year in Mechanical Engineering (3.4 GPA).  I haven't been able to secure an internship for the summer and I'm feeling pretty terrible about it.  I feel like missing out on internship experience this summer is a really big deal and I don't know what to do.  Luckily (kinda) I will be in school for 4.5 years so I still have next summer to intern, but I still feel like I really need to make something out of this summer, so I'm here for your advice: What should I do?  I've already had a hard time getting internships, so I'd like to do something to help me out career-wise.  I have the option of taking two tough classes (heat transfer and vibrations) in the first 7 weeks of summer, which will greatly reduce my load for next year, so I've thought about taking those classes and getting a part time job or something.  I'm really stressing about this, so I would appreciate any advice you guys can give! Thanks"

I had the choice of Princeton, Harvey Mudd, or Caltech. 

Both of my other options were probably better. All my financial aid offers were close enough to each other that it was negligible.


I had a panic attack while visiting caltech and I think that just left a bad taste in my mouth but I'm realizing now I gave up possibly the best college if I decided to go into research. 


Then Harvey Mudd is easily the best choice for going into industry, it's like the easiest way into SiValley and I gave that up because I was worried about moving so far away...


I'm looking at internships and prospects look so much better for HMC compsci majors...

I graduated 11 months ago with a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a GPA of 2.78 from a local state university.  I come from a impoverished family and I **really** struggled with my identity, our family finances, and depression and it affected me from performing well in my undergraduate studies.  I have no internship or technical work experience to speak of and so during these last 11 months I got hit with a huge dose of reality rejection after rejection.  As frustrating as it was, I still continue to learn from the past.  I've seen gotten my EIT, self-taught myself SolidWorks, picked up basic coding skills, etc.  Though it may not seem like much, it was most important because I got into a better mental state and rediscovered my passion in engineering.  I realized I was never incompetent or a bad student, *I just never asked for help when I needed it* -- my biggest regret.

So after learning a hard life lesson, I will hopefully soon start my first job as a technician at a big company and work my way up... wherever that may be.  I do have a strong desire to return to school very soon for a graduate degree to ""redeem"" myself and open more opportunities, but that's another story.

So my burning questions might sound crazy but I think it's reasonable.  

* **How can someone with a resume like me get an engineering position at companies such as the likes of Tesla Motors, Intel, Apple, SpaceX, NASA etc.?**

* **What should be my ""3-year plan"" in achieving my dream job?**

I want to learn a language over the summer, but I am not sure what I want to learn. My dad suggest I learn Asp because it is what he has been using and he might be able to get me an internship next summer if I learn it now (I just finished my freshman year so no company is looking at me right now)

While learning Asp seems like a good idea because I can get my dad's help learning it, it seems like I would narrow my audience because it isn't a super popular language, at least I don't think it is. **I currently only know C++ and Java,** and that is only on a basic level. 

Would it benefit me more if I were to learn basic web development like HTML, CSS, and Javascript beforehand or does it really matter? I understand HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, and Javascript makes it all move and function but how does Asp fit into the equation? Is it more geared towards manipulating a website built by someone else? Similar to scraping a website for data and then doing stuff based on that.

What do you suggest I learn over the summer? If it helps I am interested in the Cyber Security industry.

**TL;DR:** My dad suggest I learn ASP because he might be able to get me an internship next summer if I learn it. I only know C++ and Java. Should I learn ASP or other web development languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript? I am interested in cyber security if that helps with the decision. "

Some of my friends not in the CS world just went through some interviews for internships and were talking about sending thank you emails to their interviewers. Although, under their circumstances, they don't necessarily have different rounds of interviews that they go through.

It then occurred to me that I have never done such a thing. For some background, I just got my first internship this summer but I never had an in-person interview, just a Google Hangout interview (and all the rounds before that). So my question would be, when is it appropriate to say thank you to your interviewers? Do you say thanks after every round? The first HR round? The second technical phone call round? Or only after an in-person interview?

Thanks!

I understand that BMath students can take a CS plan in the second year.  Just wonder about the pros and cons of the two choices.

More specifically, for the regular BCS program:

1. Are ""regulars"" a minority in the BCS program?  Would they be looked upon as ""second-class""?

2. Do the majority of ""regulars"" manage to find internships or coops on their own, considering that there are many CS positions open each year?

For BMath coop,

1. How difficult is it to get ""a Cumulative Mathematics Average of at least 65% (calculated over all math and computer science courses) and a CS major average of at least 70%""?  (i.e. to satisfy the requirements for taking the BMath CS plan).  Someone mentioned that the average mark for a math course was around 65%-70%.  

2. The first coop job is usually the most difficult to get.  In the first year, would a BMath coop student be at a disadvantage in competition with a BCS coop student?

Would also appreciate insights into other aspects on a comparison between the two programs.

I'm a computer science major who was about to enter his senior year, having finished all my courses and all. However, disaster struck and long story short, my university decided to separate me from my program for a year on disciplinary grounds. The appeals have run their course and it really looks like the end of the line for me.

I have my junior year exams coming up and am trying to study for them, but this has left me severely depressed (that's saying something - I've rarely ever been depressed before; real optimist). I am now looking at 15 months of deadlock (year+summer) and honestly don't know what I will do... I've stopped looking for summer internships etc. and am starting to despair.

I'm not even sure whether i'll (be able to?/want to?) return to college after this long a hiatus. I'll really my miss friends and social circle, the community one tends to build while living in a place. Money is not an immediate concern as my parents are supporting me, so I don't have to get any job right now. 

What I do know is that i'll go mad id I sit around doing nothing for any length of time. I'm fair at programming, and have won a few competitive contests. I wasn't sure what I'd wanted to do after graduation anyways; grad school was a possibility and so was a good job, I also wanted to work on this start up idea I had. That was before though, now I'm not really sure.

Sorry for the really long and rambling post. I'd be really grateful if anyone has any comments/advice to share."

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

First build. In school for computer science and biochemistry. Will mostly be using the computer for League of Legends, programming assignments, word / spreadsheet processing, and eventually computational biology research, most likely using Python or MATLAB. I'm going to move around a bit (this summer for an internship, after the summer for uni, etc) and wanted a more portable desktop so this desktop is being built from some salvage parts from my current PC. I can't remember what my power supply is but it's somewhere between 500W and 650W. I'm planning to run a dual-boot with Linux and Windows 7 and I kind of wish I had just invested in a 500 gb SSD because currently my Windows partition is running lower on storage than I would prefer. Also not totally happy with the number of USB ports on the case but I think I will just get a USB multiport for that.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I mainly just play League (might try Hearthstone), max settings for those.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Between 400 and 500 (maybe up to 550).

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

My interviewer did mention that he really liked me and was going to fight to add more positions because he liked some of the other candidates as well.

I was about to call them today and confirm my suspicions that I didn't get the job, and to ask what I could do better  for future interviews when the woman who did the phone interview called me. She wanted to set up a final interview where I would be meeting with the head of IT and the CEO of the company. 

Does this sound like I got the job? I'm ridiculously excited for this opportunity and can't wait for the final interview.

This summer I plan to go through a few books to get ready for interviews in my final year for full time positions. The order I plan on going through them:

- CLRS Intro to Algorithms(w/ mit video lectures to accompany them.)

- Programming interviews exposed 

- Cracking the coding interview

- Elements of programming interviews. 

I just want to know if this is a good progression and how ready I will be for what the job market throws at me this fall/winter. 

I also want to know if it is realistic to be able to get through these in the 4 months I have until September. 

I hope this can help out other students who have summer vacation this year.

I'm currently a freshman CS major and I have to make this decision by Monday.  I have a summer internship offer from this small startup in the midwest.  The problem is, they only have one other developer, who has been programming for less than a year.  Their current code base has all been written in India and they recently made the decision to move development to the U.S.

I'm worried that if I take the internship, I won't be learning much, as their would be no mentoring or even experienced developers giving me guidance or critiquing my code.  The company also has very high expectations of me, and I'm worried that I don't have the experience necessary to be 50% of their development team.  And the pay is minimum wage, so is it even worth the stress?

Would it be better to just work on side projects/independent learning over the summer, or accept the offer and get the work experience?

Will not having an internship my freshman year impact my chances of getting a nice internship next year?

Thanks in advance for any advice."

In fact, I consider myself a much better programmer than 99% of the people who graduated alongside me, based on working with them in team projects.  I was president of a game-development club and have released several complete games of my own.

I've applied to quite a number of places, got three interviews and one job offer (which I turned down due to a number of red flags).  Frankly, I'm not yet sure what area of development I want to be in.  Most places are looking for JavaScript and database experience (both of which I have a sliver of experience in, but not enough to be confident in).  My experience is almost entirely Java and C# along with some C/C++, git, HTML, SQL, etc.  But not enough to write a database application during an interview question.  I can ace the programming trivia all day, but when it comes to practical things like web design or database linking, I'm clueless due to lack of experience.

I'm confident I can pick it up quickly and easily, though.  Learning has always been my biggest strength.  Do I just teach myself this stuff before trying for jobs, aim lower for experience, or find a place willing to work with me?"

* Country of purchase: The Netherlands

* Budget range: €1100 - €1500

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Both gaming and web/game/application development.

* Screen size preference: 15,6"", but I can live with 14"" or 13""

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows, but it doesn't have to be pre-installed as I can get it for free via Microsoft DreamSpark. I will also be running Linux on it. (no Mac, way to expensive and I don't need it).

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Payday 2 on max settings with 60fps would be great, but please check the bottom of this post for more info.

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): Web development (Sublime Text, PHPStorm, Databases etc., some game development (in Visual Studio) and app development (Android Studio). I also use Illustrator.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): I don't have great experiences with Acer machines, owned both a desktop and laptop, and a friend of mine had a laptop from them. They were all from the 'eMachine' series, but if you guys can convince me otherwise I don't really mind.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): The XPS 13 from Dell is a beautiful laptop, my brother has a MSI GS60 which I like for it's weight.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, two, or balanced)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: I'd rather have a lighter laptop because I have to carry it with me to school and my internship everyday. 

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: Having a good build quality is nice, but I'm willing to sacrifice on this.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Doesn't really matter

**Which features would you pay a premium for?**

* High resolution screen: 1920 x 1080 is good enough for me

* A great keyboard: Good keyboard is nice, although at home I have it connected to a mechanical keyboard

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: Good touchpad is required

* Great audio: Doesn't really matter. At school I wear headphones, at home I have great speakers.

**List any features that are critical:**
I'm still in doubt over one thing, which is, should I buy an expensive laptop that allows me to play games &amp; do my school work, or save some money on the laptop, and build a gaming pc? The problem is that I also have to save for my own future, and I don't make enough money for a good desktop pc within a year.

Also, for videocards, I prefer Nvidia cards, have had a really good experience with them so far, and I like and I'm used with the included software.

35f407,4,2015-05-09,"Bosses forcing me to work heavily in a support role as well as dev, what do I do?",DevTurnedSupport,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35f407/bosses_forcing_me_to_work_heavily_in_a_support/,"I'll try to keep this somewhat vague to keep anonymity, but it might be tough considering the specific situation. I'll give an overview so you guys can get an understanding of my mindset around the situation so far too.

So last spring I graduated from a small state school with a BS in Computer Science. Had about a 3.5 gpa, never went all out in school, but when I started job hunting I *really* cracked down on my data structures and algorithms, and actually became quite proficient with them. I'd say that knowing proper data structures to use in certain situations and problem solving is my biggest strength as a programmer, while organization and structuring my code is more of a weakness(so I'm great at interviews, haha).

I interviewed at a pretty large financial company shortly after graduation for a .NET developer role. They were looking for someone who they thought would be a good fit with the team and was willing to learn, so they asked me a few really simple data structures questions and whiteboard problems, and I was fairly enthusiastic in interviews so I got the job(they told me after among 20 other people which I was *very* surprised to hear).

So I've been working there for the past year, doing small, simple C# apps, working on an older asp.net app, stuff like that. It's been okay, but it hasn't been particularly challenging in terms of coding or the projects I face, but more of getting proper permissions, getting information from people about stuff I don't have knowledge about, getting people to respond to my freakin emails, stuff like that has been the most challenging.

Recently they told me that one of their contractors, a guy who has pretty much *all* of the knowledge around a process, is leaving this winter. This is more about overnight processes, all the data they get from other companies about transactions and stuff, how all that stuff happens. It's actually very complex with dozens and dozens of working parts. No one else around really has that knowledge, so it's imperative that he passes it on to someone, and apparently they want this someone to be me.

Now I'm fine with learning about how all this works, and even documenting it well for them so that people in the future can learn it faster, but I'm *not* okay with becoming their support guy. Basically if something goes wrong with these overnight processes, people offshores are the first line that sees if they can fix it, if they can't, they call this contractor. That will be me in about 6 months after I learn all this stuff. That's bullshit. I don't want to be contacted every weekend, or wake up in the middle of the night, to deal with this stuff. Like how much time out of the day do they want out of me? Is 8 hours not enough? Ridiculous.

This is not what I signed up for. I applied and accepted the job to become a developer. I had another job offer that I could have taken at the time as a .NET developer for the exact same salary, I chose this one because I felt I would learn more here. Now I'm getting the impression that they're trying to dupe me, and that they gave me these small simple projects to lure me in, and then now that I'm used to my salary, have an apartment, car, and a bunch of bills, and straight up leaving isn't an option, they turn me into their overnight support while doing dev on the side.

Now if these guys were assholes just leaving would be easy, but the problem is they're genuinely nice guys. We joke around, laugh, it's not a stiff work environment...but who fuckin knows what they say behind my back because I'm pretty sure they think I'm an idiot, they ask me all the time if I understand stuff that is *extremely* simple, like they didn't expect me to be able to pick it up in the first place. This isn't the case guys I swear I'm not an idiot lol. I'm also grateful because I didn't have any internships coming out of college, and the college I came from definitely would not have been heard of from pretty much anyone, so the opportunity has been essential to starting my career, at least now I can say I've worked somewhere for a year and have some experience under my belt. If I got a job elsewhere I feel like I would be betraying them a little bit, they took a risk on me and in the end it *didn't* pay off because I bailed on them.

Does anyone have any similar situations where a job like this tried to turn you into less of a developer and more of a general tech guy/support role? How did you handle it? What do you think I should do? Should I stick it out longer? If I'm planning to leave within the next year would leaving now be more of a favor to them so they can get someone that might stick around for some time? They've made it seem like they want me to learn this stuff so I can be in place doing this for a while. I honestly don't know what to do.

Edit - Thanks for the responses guys. I think I'm going to start looking for a new job. Seems risky to tell them straight out that I don't want to be support, because if that's *really* all they're looking for, then I don't want them to just find someone else and let me go. If I could afford to job hunt for a couple of months without working then maybe I would address the concerns, but I can't currently afford that. Maybe that will change in a couple months when I have a little more saved."

I've been getting a lot of initial phone interviews, but when I get in, I just blank on the simplest things and end up getting turned down. I've gone through CTCI and Programming Interviews Exposed several times, and have done a lot of problems on hackerrank, and I've shown myself over and over that I know my stuff, but interviews still rarely go well. Sometimes the interviewer will give me a hint that will have me saying ""duh!"" but often times, they just let me struggle then have me move on to something else or it's something that I need to solve a larger problem and it throws me off and I never find a solution and the interviewer ends up clearly displeased with my performance. Most often, as soon as the interview is over, the memory whatever I couldn't get virtually smacks me across the face before I can even look it up. The other day I got asked ""What is polymorphism?"" and even though I have gotten that question on every third interview I'd ever had, it was like I had never heard the term in my life. Not long before that, in a different interview, I blanked on a minor implementation detail of basic binary search and it threw off my entire solution to the bigger problem that I had gotten asked.

I thought it was just nerves, but this happens even when I go into the interview feeling fine. I already spend almost all of my time studying and working on problems because I only had one blowoff GenEd class this semester. What else can I do?

and FWIW I never used to have this issue. I got plenty of internship offers when I was in college, but even though my interviews now are basically the same as they were then, I've gotten turned down from every company I got an internship offer from, and then some. "

I'm currently doing a 12-month internship (Software development at a large telecom corporation) and will be finishing at the end of August. I have also done a 4-month internship at a Startup the previous summer (QA and a little development). 

Starting September, I'll be returning to school to complete my last year of my CS undergrad, which includes a final project as well.
My end goal is to work at one of the Big 4 or a company like Khan Academy (I'm very interested in their goal). I hear its better to get as much experience as an undergrad and that interviews will be easier than as a new graduate.

Here are my options:

1. Spread out my course load so I get another summer to do co-op through my school or find my own internship.
Fall 2015 - School =&gt;
Winter 2016 - School =&gt;
Summer 2016 - 3-4 month Internship =&gt;
Fall 2016 - School, do final project (Last semester) =&gt;
Graduate

2. Have really tough semesters and graduate right after my 2nd semester.
Fall 2015 - School =&gt;
Winter 2016 - School (do my final project, will be a really hard semester) =&gt;
Graduate

I don't know how much I should know and have no sense of whether what I did learn is even good enough for an internship or job.

My bachelors was in Finance and I saved up ( worked 3 years in finance and supply chain) and quit my job( was bored, wasn't creative/ problems weren't that interesting) to pursue CS or Web Dev and I am very interested in full stack web Dev or software engineering( more web Dev).

1) Get a replacement SS card, arrives in 2 weeks. Perfect except the email states ""original"". It won't be the original. Does this matter or am I overthinking it?

2) Get a copy of my birth certificate and submit that and/or use that to get an original SS card. Can do, but this probably won't happen before my internship starts( appx 2.5 weeks).

3) I was reading online and found this: http://www.ssa.gov/employer/SSNcard.htm and this: http://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnv.htm#a0=-1

I live in Quebec, Canada (Montreal area), and I recently graduated at 25 years old. Because of good internships and part-time working, I don't have any debts and even have around 10k sitting around that I could invest (not counting the money I keep for living and other short term investments).

I don't plan on buying a house any time soon since I'll probably move around a lot in the next years, but I want to start looking for long term investment plans. I am currently with CIBC, for my savings and chequing accounts, but their TFSA rates seem low (0.75% when there's no promotion while I have 0.8% on my savings account). I've been with CIBC since my parents opened an account for me when I was a child, so I never gave it any thought, but now that I'm ready to maximize my investments, I'm wondering if I should open an account at another place for my investments (probably a TFSA).

So, after looking at the RateSupermarket site, Peoples Trust seems like a good choice, but I don't know that bank and I would like to know if there's a better choice overall for my money.

I'm of course not limited to TFSA, but I'm quite a newbie in personal finance, so I would like to have your advice on what's the better way to start investing, knowing that I already have 10k to start with.

Thanks"

So I'm a 20 y.o. french guy, about to graduate a bachelor in software development (sandwich degree, so I got a whole year of work experience in a startup at the same time).

I went to Montreal, QC, Canada last year for a three-month internship, so I used this time to travel to the Unites States a few times, and I absolutely loved it.  I've been wanting to move there even before that but it absolutely confirmed it.

I'm not actually bad at what I do, but since I'm just graduating, I don't have a lot of work experience, even if I already have some, and I have a good reactivity in the work field (working in a startup helps for that). Also I'm good at english.

Now that I'm about to graduate, I'd like to gather more information about how I should proceed.  I'm not in a hurry since I'm going to stay in my current company for at least a whole year, but I'd like to go to the USA as soon as possible.

From what I've gathered so far, I know that:

* I need to find a company that will sponsor my Green Card
* It may take up to more than a year for the Green Card to actually be ready

I don't actually know much more so far.  I don't really know how to look for companies, how to proceed for any of that in the USA.

Is there anything I need to know about all of that process, how I should proceed to make it go smoothly?  Anything that could make it easier for me?

Thank you very much for helping out!"

I've had 3 job since then in a variety of sized companies and they've all  drained my enthusiasm a little bit further.

I struggle to put my finger on what's bugging me the most about the industry or whether it's the industry in general that's not suited to me.

**Brainstorming wise, the following things popped up:**

* The competitive nature of engineers in these smaller environments, we no longer seem to want to cooperate to produce a product, we fight to get our own bit of code completed and then defend it to the death. It doesn't matter if the product is late as long as my area is done.
* The lack of Engineering process. Everyone's heard of Agile these days saying how great it is to minimize (Avoid) documentation and designs but at the same time they've taken it as a free pass to be lazy and sloppy often resulting in no system architecture or system breakdown. In my last 3 companies I've not seen a single design document.
* Avoidance of accountability,  it's strange to me that so many companies seem to disrespect their customers so badly, I worked in a top class Scientific Instrument company who's policy was that things don't count as bugs until the customer finds them. You see so many developers who don't believe testing is their responsibility.
* The Not Invented Here principle and failing to understand the value of following best practices. It's hard for me to understand just how far people are willing to go to reinvent the wheel. 
* [Expert Beginner syndrome](http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner) hurting the future generations of engineers. Try working for a boss who thinks he knows it all, even worse, a boss who's responsible for 3 interns who thinks he knows it all. He read about the Factory pattern so now he teaches the interns that EVERY class should have an Interface, a concrete implementation and a Factory class to instantiate it.


 

I think the worst of all for me though is the idea that you stay with a company until your mistakes catch up with you, so many people seem to have this approach these days.

I, naturally, want to major in computer science once I get to college, so I've been trying to attain an internship in this field for the summer. I managed to get to one internship fair, but I live in Atlanta so Georgia Tech students make me a low tiered candidate. Also, online and at that fair, college students were/are highly preferred, understandably so. I've found one company that I'm going to apply to today, but I'm not super hopeful. I have the option to develop an app or something alone this summer instead of an internship and I'm thinking about just doing that. It would be a good experience, as I've yet to do anything like that. Should I search harder for internships or develop on my own? Personally, I think I would enjoy the internship more, as it would give me real insight into the career, but working on my own seems to be the realistic option.

While this was not my dream career path I am pretty happy making 60k in my early 20s.

Lately I have been feeling like QA is a very pigeonholed career path sort of speak. This makes me nervous because I do not LOVE QA. I have hopes in transitioning to a more business oriented IT position.

I'm working in the gvt in accounting in a role that usually requires a degree (I got lucky and obviously want to into consulting/ finance).

I applied everywhere this summer for finance/ consulting internships and came out of it with a pile of rejections and not a single interview. My school isn't all that prestigious and the connections are really limited so there's nothing that can be done on that front. Obviously I know that it's an uphill battle but I was wondering if you guys had any advice as to what to do/ what skills I should learn to set myself up for graduation

I also really want a internship during the summer of my 3rd year and obviously don't want to have this summer repeat itself again. As for what I want to do once I graduate, I'd like to go into either consulting, IB or trading, but am not really sure. Ideally in the summer, I get something in those three areas, but again, I'm just desperate to get my foot in the door.

I even asked and used a few professors as references (it's easy for me to have professors like me).

I had a few phone interviews but ultimately they went south because of my disability which makes it hard to understand verbal communication. 

As an IE I have no idea what I could do over the summer. My GPA is a 3.1 which hasn't been an issue. I also ran for a few officer positions at clubs I am a part of but lost to ""better"" candidates. I haven't heard from the last 2 positions I ran for yet. Luckily the president of one club actually really likes me and wanted to appoint me for one of the extra officer position, but even that must be voted on by the officers so it isn't guaranteed.

I've gotten many many interviews, and a lot of times I'll make it to the final round, but I can't seem to get the offer. At this point, I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. 

I get contacted by big name companies quite frequently that I would LOVE to work for. I talk to them, go through phone/ Skype/ in-person interviews, but can't seem to get that final offer. I usually ask the hiring manager or the recruiter why I didn't get the offer (of course I put it in nicer terms), and they typically respond with the same thing: you were a great candidate and we were impressed, but the applicant pool was extremely competitive. How do I make myself more competitive?

On a side not, I'm more on the shy side. I try to be more outgoing during interviews, but I'm just introverted by nature. My experiences have been in Human Resources so I've been applying and interviewing for HR Coordinator/ Recruiting Coordinator type positions."

My CS classes are very hard and extremely time consuming, and I've never had a formal job before in my life (never needed one).

I thought I wanted to do CS because I am very creative and enjoy creating things. I've written songs, stories, and plays, but this was one of my first years seriously writing code (largely in C++ if you're curious). I actually enjoyed it at first. My first two introductory classes were enjoyable for the most part, and I learned a lot. Then came the third introductory class and things took off to a whole new level and I began to struggle hard.

One of the few relevant things going for me is the possibility of an internship this summer for a data company, but if I do take the job, I won't enjoy it. I'll sit by myself at a keyboard for hours on end, while I try to keep up with content I haven't seen or worked with before in a language I don't really understand. The boss told me himself that they expect their interns and employees to pick up things very quickly and adapt to whatever the circumstances may be at a moment's notice. If the level of adaptability needed is anything like what my third class is like, I'll have more gray hairs than Jay Leno by 30.

My mom is very insistent that I finish at least two years of CS and to pursue this opportunity because she thinks I'm lazy and spoiled and have nothing else to do with my life at this point.

Option 2- Rent a room near work for the summer, go home on weekends. The cheapest I can find is around $500 a month, and I would probably still have to commute a couple weeks because the only things available short term are summer sublets that end when students come back.

Hello everyone! I'm currently a Junior in High School and as the end of this school year gets closer, the stress of getting into college is starting. I'm 100% sure that I will be applying for Film/Video major wherever I go. 1st on my list of schools,  is Berkeley. I know the film program there isn't that great, but I love the environment and I love Film theory (what their school focuses on).

As anxious as I am, I decided to ask you all what my chances of getting into Berkeley are (or any UC) and what I can do to improve my chances. 

Before I provide information, I would like to note that I have chronic depression and generalized anxiety that I have to take medication for everyday . You'll understand why I bring this up as you look at the information I'll be providing.

As you can see my grades took a sudden drop sophomore year. That's when my depression and anxiety that was passed onto me from my mom, really kicked in and became apparent. Again, I'm applying to the film program at Berkeley. I wouldn't have a chance at all of getting into Berkeley if I was applying for business. People Say that art majors have a higher chance of getting in, so that's why I’m actually trying to get into Berkeley. But then again that can be a lie and I don't really have a chance at all. 

So Reddit community. Thank you for reading this. If you can, please leave information below regarding my chances of getting in and what I can do to improve them. Thank you again.

Three students in my research group (myself included) are all finished with our classes and ready to take our preliminary exams so we can go ABD. Normally we would schedule our examinations for next Fall, and take them at that point and move forward, but to save the cost of our tuition our professor wants us to take them during the summer examination session available in August. This means we're effectively taking our exams a semester earlier than our schools graduate student handbook recommends.

I'm not really wild about front loading my exams, but I understand the financial benefit and why my professor finds it desirable. The catch comes in that to do our prelims over the summer, we have to register for 2 credits and pay an extra $1000 over the summer. When we asked our professor if he would pay this cost, he very firmly told us he would not. 

This has put us all in a bit of a financial quandary. Beyond the extra cost, our income over the summer tanks as our professor keeps us around on hourly wage, with an income just barely enough to keep us afloat until the fall semester funding starts up again in August. On top of this, I was at least personally told that if I took an internship offer I had this summer (which would actually have given me the financial means needed to pay for this crap) that I would be looked on unfavorably by my committee at prelims. The department is small enough that if he told the committee he wanted me out, they would fail me just so he didn't have to have another reason to remove me.



Thus far I've been bitching, but what I'm looking for is some advice on how to politic this one out.

My frustration is compounded by the belief that in spite of a certain number of misgivings I have about a in how my professor manipulates my program, I'm far enough into my degree and my research that moving schools/advisors isn't something I'd like to attempt. Long term I still thinking riding out the bumps my relationship is a worthwhile hurdle in pursuing my research and my degree. The question becomes then, what is the best way to go about getting some help for this one, without totally pissing off my professor in the process?

tl;dr Prof wants me to pay $1000+ now, so he can save $10,000+ later. Looking for advice on how to handle it without pissing him off to much."

35mpdz,5,2015-05-11,The Mask Must Come Off,[deleted],socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/35mpdz/the_mask_must_come_off/,"Hello Reddit, I am 21 years old and just finished my junior year of college. I'm now back in my childhood home, and these last two days have been the worst in my life. My past is full of nothing but regret, bad decisions, and pain. The future looks desolate and bleak. I try to stay present and mindful, but it's fucking hard. I am constantly meditating, doing yoga, lifting weights, cooking and eating clean, but they're only temporary distractions from the absolute dread I feel in the pit of my stomach that creeps into my heart. I'm frozen with fear, and I can't stop these anxious thoughts from rummaging through my mind even though I know they're not real and my brain is lying to me. 

My entire life I've been running from my problems, and avoiding people out of fear of judgement. Now I'm out of places to run and hide and have no choice, but to face my problems head on. I don't know if I can do it, I don't know if I'm strong enough. It all started in 6th grade when I found out the girl I had a huge crush on liked me too. Even though I was ecstatic and liked her a lot too, I was so nervous about asking her out even though I knew she was going to say yes, that it took five of her friends goading me to eventually ask her out. Great, my first girlfriend. The only problem was that I had no idea no to talk to a girl. I still don't. So what did I do? Did I ask my parents for advice? No. Did I at least try to talk to her no matter how awkward and forced? No. I fucking ignored her for 2 or 3 months straight until one of her friend informed me that we were broken up. I was devastated, but utterly helpless to do anything about because little did I know I had social anxiety. This is the biggest regret of my life because it is the first time I can remember that my anxiety had a negative impact of my life, and I believe it is the catalyst for a series of events that led to me missing out on the formative years in my life. 

Looking back, I can't believe some of the shit I used to do. I hid in the bathroom during lunch, I avoided people I knew in the hallway, alienated people who liked me and wanted to be my friend, I would drive around in my car for hours on the weekends so my parents thought I had friends. Also, here's the real kicker. I've had a cellphone since I was in sixth grade, but didn't start using it until I was a freshman in college. I was always too scared to ask people for their numbers and the thought of talking on the phone or texting someone terrified me. Also, when people would ask me for my number I would tell them I didn't have a phone because I was afraid they would look at my contacts and think I was a loser for having nothing in there. In retrospect, people thinking you don't have a phone when you're in high school is way worse, but somehow my anxious brain thought this was the best way to protect myself.

Oddly enough, even though I had no real friends, I was never picked on in middle school or high school. Maybe, it was because I'm a pretty big kid who has a fair amount of muscle, or maybe people just felt bad for me. Sports was the only real social interaction I had in high school, and at the time I felt like it was enough. Even so, high school was the worst years of my life and I felt a great relief when it was finally over.

For me, college was a chance to start over and reinvent myself. I was going to a place where nobody knew me and I felt like the possibilities were endless. I would like to think over the last three years I've gotten a lot better socially. I've been lucky enough to make some great friends, and being immersed in that environment forced me to face a lot of my problems. However, there's been many a day where I've struggled to leave my dorm, go to class, go to parties, and meet new people. I've gotten better at talking to girls (thanks alcohol), but I'm still a virgin despite having a lot, a lot, a lot of opportunities to lose it, and that's is probably the thing that bothers me the most. Looking back, there's been so many times when it was obvious that a girl was into me and wanted to sleep with me, but I got too nervous, too anxious, or was just oblivious until later on. Also, I'm kinda scared to sleep with a girl because I don't want her to know I'm a virgin, or not be able to please her, or finish too early. Now, I'm going to be a senior and if I don't lose it next year, I just know it's going to be nearly impossible to lose it after I graduate. But honestly, I don't even think being a virgin really bothers me that bad deep down. It's the stigma of being a virgin and people judging me that makes me feel depressed. What I really desire the most is a relationship and the intimacy that comes with it, but I don't really even know if I'm capable of that.

Anyways, the thing that's causing me the most anxiety right now is trying to find a job. I'm 21 and I've never had a job before. How fucking pathetic is that. It's not that haven't wanted a job in the past either. It's that I'm fucking scared to go apply, or that I won't be able to do the job, or that I'll mess up and get fired because of my fucked up brain that makes it impossible to think clearly and talk to people. The past two summers I've feigned looking for a job. I lied to my father about applying to places and never hearing back, blaming the economy and poor job market. An internship is out of the question too because my grades are shit and I have no experience. I know I should be getting better grades in school, but I go through periods of depression that make it hard to function and can't study, and I get terrible test anxiety even if I know the material.

Somethings gotta give. This time next year, I will be entering into the real world. If I don't get a job this summer, and a girlfriend this year, I feel like I never will. Right now I feel like a spoiled, entitled piece of shit living of my parents hard earned money. I want to do more to help out, but right now everyday is a struggle for me mentally. Every mundane task feels like climbing a mountain. I love my father for everything he does for me. He is the glue holding my fragile family together right now, but I don't think he has any clue that I even suffer from any form of anxiety. I guess I do a good job of hiding it. Mental illness runs on my mothers side of the family. Both my brother and mother have anxiety. My brother who is 24 is able to hold down a job and has had multiple girlfriends despite it, even though he self medicates with marijuana, and is currently going to therapy to painkiller addiction. My mother on the other hand has been suffering from dementia for the last five years at only 55. I don't wan't to be anymore of a burden to my father, and my problems definitely pale in comparison to my mothers, but I feel like I need help too. I just don't know how to reach out or have anyone to talk too.       

I've been lying to myself for a long time, and I wish nothing more than to be able to go back and time and get help sooner, but I can't. Denial is the most powerful defense mechanism in the human mind, and because of it I've been wearing a mask for the longest time, but now the mask must come off, and I must face my true self. If I don't quell my anxiety soon, my problems will never be solved.

I have so much potential, so much love to give, I'm smart, I'm attractive, I'm fit, and goddammit people like me. I just wish I could convince myself it was true. I want to help everyone else who feels like me. Give them a hug and tell them it's going to be ok, but I can't until I get better first. I need help.

The other problem is that I'm not particularly fond of coding for myself. After all the programming and studying I do for school, I really don't want to do that much outside of it. I like working on projects for others, but I don't really have many friends that need applications built, and there's no one I know that needs system programming done. I'm currently seeking an internship as a developer so that I can code for rent (right now I work for one of the IT giants as a backup specialist), but until then, it's difficult for me to find the drive to code outside of class/work unless it's for someone else. Do I have a future as a programmer, or should I start considering alternatives for a career?

Just a note: It's not that I don't find coding enjoyable, but at the end of the day, I would much rather indulge myself in one of my other hobbies like cooking than code more."

**The Meat** (Sorry for the length. I just want to give as much detail as possible in order to get the most help as possible)

I'm 21 and just finished my junior year of college, studying to get a BS in Economics. My dream is to start my own business at some point, a software company probably. In January, I really wanted an internship to gain some experience, and so I googled for tech startups in my area and sent out cold emails to the ones I found interesting. I romanticized the startup environment, and since they were smaller, I felt that I would be able to move horizontally through the company and learn as much as possible. Eventually, the CEO of one emailed me back and I landed an internship with a startup cyber security company. I've been here since February.

The Chief Business Officer for this company is a ""CEO Mentor"" by profession. Mentoring is his job and what he loves to do, as he also mentors younger CEO's in the area starting their first business. He has really taken a liking to me and wants to help me. 

This is where the title comes in. I'm not really doing much with my internship. I basically get paid $10/hr to browse the internet. I've sent out a couple company-wide emails telling people that I'd love to help them with any projects they have, and sometimes the CBO will find somethings for me. These normally consist of going through spreadsheets and finding contact info for potential customers, but other than that I don't do much.

Him and I have weekly, 1-on-1 meetings because he wants to know how he can really help me the most, but I'm not sure what questions to ask or in what way he can help me. I'm very grateful for this opportunity and  want to take full advantage of it, but I'm not sure how."

Most proficient language is C++, as its what was taught at university.  With the knowledge gained in the course new languages could be picked up quickly.  Familiar with Python, Javascript, Java, HTML5, CSS, Git, Bootstrap, QT, CMake, and few others.  Very confident in my knowledge of the underlying concepts of CS, particularly OOP.  

My interest about the technical side of computers and how they worked began at an early age, 7th grade.  Gifted books on Linux, HTML, and Visual Basic by my grandfather who was a programmer at honeywell, I followed the books step by step, created the sample programs, and got familiar with the concepts.  Triple booting my Macintosh in 9th grade, writing small programs to automate homework tasks.  I created websites to access content, games, and proxy servers that my school banned.  That familiarity and the knowledge gained through high school helped me excel in my college courses, receiving an A in both CS1 and CS2.  Many of my peers would ask me to tutor them, which helped solidify all the concepts.  

I’ve always prided myself on how I approach problems.  Many people tend to think in one way but i’ve always seen them from many angles, which help me solve them better and faster than committing to one way.  I love puzzles and get extremely dedicated - borderline obsessed - with solving a problem after its been started. 

I have a resume ready to go but would rather not post it publicly on reddit.  Please PM with me for a copy or to ask any question, technical or personal.  

I would love to relocate somewhere beautiful, preferably the west coast, but everything will be considered.  I love to code but would also consider any position in the field.  I feel I would bring a great young energy to your team.  I am an easy going guy and love new experiences! "

I had fucked up an unpaid internship with the state parks department during the summer of 2014. I had a internship with a museum that focused on 19th century interpretation. I was in the background, working in the archives.

One day, I decided to go to the museum. I made a remark about something the interpreters were eating for lunch. I was curious about what I saw there, because I didn't know they had that food item for the time period. (The museum has a period kitchen that actually works.) One woman got very offended, and it snowballed into an almost-fight. Not quite there, but very tense. She felt like I was being rude to her by questioning what she had, while I was mad because I felt like she was being rude to me because I was genuinely curious about the history of food. It's not something I've studied. But in any event, I should've handled that better.

The directory of my internship basically ""fired"" me (I was never an actual employee) over the phone two weeks later. No one ever approached me about it. He didn't just vacate me from the internship- he made some incredible personal remarks to me. See, I was a volunteer at the same museum 10 years ago, when I was in high school. I got bounced because they thought I was distractedly rude and disruptive to the interpreters. But in the mean time, I had undergone four successful internships, so that's what I put on my resume, not my high school volunteer work from a decade ago. 

But he basically called me a liar for not bringing this up (even though, again, it was high school), and then he brought up all this various gossip that people have had about me going back to say 2004-2007. He then kept repeatedly telling me that I have a bad pattern of behavior that I keep repeating, and told me that people find me ""off putting"" and ""creepy"". 

It was batshit insane how he went off on me, especially because the guy was going off of second-hand gossip from memories that were a decade old when I was in HIGH SCHOOL that he wasn't around for, and the feeling was that because I ""harassed the volunteers"" that day it meant that I was same ol' me, i.e. basically the Devil.  

Then he basically told me all these complaints that my supervisor had for me- that I thought I was too good for the internship, that I rolled my eyes at having to do basic tasks, and that I wasn't working hard enough. This after I had basically cleaned from top to bottom the entire archives, wrote a 12-page cleaning manual for said archives, handcounted 5000 slides, etc. My supervisor was a nice chick to my face, but apparently couldn't tell me that she wasn't happy with my performance because she said maybe three critical comments to my face the entire time I was there.

Then he basically told me that ""my reputation"" proceeds me, and that it's a small job field in a small state, and since then I've basically felt like the only way I can do anything professionally in my field I have to leave the state. I'm essentially blacklisted by the state parks department.

Since then I've volunteered with a small historical society to keep my degree relevant, while working odd jobs to pay the bills. I'm actually pretty well-loved by them, and they trust me enough to have a key and open and close the museum. 

As for ""lessons"", I think the biggest thing I took from this is that I was pretty arrogant going into this. I thought that because I had 4 successful internships, this would be a piece of cake, and I also thought they wanted my feedback about how things could be run because I did have some very positive volunteer/intern experience. I also thought that because my original fuck-up with the museum was ancient history- 10 years ago- they were over it, and I was VERY much wrong, and I got the feeling that the administration felt like I had ""conned"" my way into the internship and were therefore looking for any kind of slip-up to justify ""canning"" me. Finally, at the end of the day, if you feel a co-worker is being rude to you, don't be defensive and rude back and just walk away.

In hindsight, it was just an unpaid internship...but it does mean that I can't get considered for any position in the State Parks department, and I feel paranoid that if I try to apply for a position in a department that's related to State Parks and this director finds out about it, he'll try to talk them out of hiring me.

I'm upset about it still, but I feel like I got some pretty good lessons out of it. It's made me much less trusting of people, though.

35oj32,1,2015-05-12,My new job isn't what I expected.,Telulu,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/35oj32/my_new_job_isnt_what_i_expected/,"Some background- I just started my first fulltime job. The way this company's computer department works is you interview you and if they hire you, they decide which team to put you on after they clear you. (As opposed to applying for a DB Admin position or Web Developer position specifically.)

My resume includes various mobile apps, usability studies, and interactive technology. In a placement meeting, I spoke with a member of the mobile team who seemed to like me enough to 
give me his contact info. I was pretty happy but didn't hear anything about my placement after that. 

When I walked in my first day, I expected to be somewhere on that mobile team. (""They were the only team 
I spoke with so where else would I go?"" is what I thought.) Instead they put me on a database project. 

While I did study basic database stuff and worked a little with some on my internships, it was not something I took interest 
in or looked into further. I don't know what it was that screamed database on my resume and in my interviews, but I'm afraid it's so out of my comfort zone and skill set that I'll do a bad job. I just got sucked into a lease and have school loans to pay 
off, so quitting is not an option for me. 

I feel self-conscious talking to my manager and mentor about it because a) they don't know anything about me and my resume (and have told me as such) and b) apparently I'm replacing 
someone who left in a hurry and they ""really need me to fill in for him,"" so I feel guilty for even having these thoughts.

I also have reason to believe I was already placed on this team even before my placement meeting (completely defeating the purpose of the meeting imo.)

tl;dr- New job, placed on team I don't know much about and don't think I'm suited for, afraid I'll do poorly, current team 
was short a member and I'm expected to fill some big shoes = guilt trip

So my plea for advice- Should I talk to HR who arranged the placement meeting and see what happened about that meeting? Or talk with my manager? Should I contact the mobile guy to let him know that I still have an interest in his team? Should I just suck it up, stop whining, and settle with my position because ""it's a job"" and I really need it?"

Experience vs. Early Money?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35optl/advice_on_job_offer_experience_vs_early_money/,"I was given an offer a few days ago for an entry level web development job at exactly 50k. I have absolutely no professional experience other than a few internships I've completed during college. To be completely honest, I'm not very confident in my technical interview skills, or my GPA, but the company really liked my passion and drive. I don't want to divulge too much information, but I can tell you that the position is located in Southern California. The research I've done is a little all over the place in terms of median salary for my experience and position, and I'm not sure how to really interpret it. I'll be living at home for a couple of years so the salary seems reasonable to me, seeing as I'll be getting some much needed experience in the field. I'm also young, single, and have no kids. I really like the other aspects of the company in terms of health insurance, paid time off, work/life balance etc... 

I really like what the company has to offer, and I feel it's a place I can get some much needed experience from, and grow as a developer. I'm eager to learn more about their framework and work with the primary language they use.  Is it naive of me to think I can just take the offer at possibly a little less than market rate, gain as much experience as possible, and then move on if I'm unhappy? I'm leaning towards accepting it and getting down to business, but I wanted advice from some of you more experienced programmers. I would appreciate any insight!"

I am looking at a career in finance and am in need of a lot of advice on the path I should take.

Background: I am from a city in South India, finished my schooling studying Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and Math. After this I graduated with a BA in Corporate Economics from a fairly well reputed university. Throughout I have excellent scores in math, statistics and econometrics (average of 99%) and an overall score of 8.2/10. I was ranked third in my uni. 

I went on to do an internship for a year with EY in corporate tax consulting. I was pretty good, worked directly with my senior manager and learnt a lot. 

Since my BA was not much I started doing Cost and Management Accounting from the Institute in India, which I later realised was a fairly misguided choice. However, I didn't ditch it, and am scheduled to complete this June. My experience makes me fairly sure I will finish.

In the mean time, I had to move to Dubai last year and have had NO LUCK finding a job. I am now doing my ACCA as my CMA is hardly valued here. 6 papers down, 8 to go. Cleared everything so far in one attempt so hopefully I will stay on track and finish in 3 more exam terms.

Since my move here (due to family reasons) I have had NO LUCK finding a job. I have recently interviewed at 2 big national banks for risk analyst/ data analyst positions, cleared technical interviews and then been told I didn't get approved by senior management due to lack of experience. 

My problems are just that I have not much experience and more importantly ZERO contacts. Its very brutal for people in my place here with an Indian passport. I have been told this on my face. 

I need a network. For this reason, I would like to go to a really good school. I also went to a well rated but shitty school back in India (All other qualifications have come/will come through studying from home) and really really would like to experience what it is like to go to a really good school and build a network. 

Since I don't have the experience for an MBA, and am very good at math, I am looking at Masters in Finance, Business Analytics, Risk Management, etc. And ideally 1 year courses. I would like to look at schools in the UK and have short listed the following. 

LSE, LBS, Oxford, Bath, Warwick, Manchester.

My CV I would like to think is fairly good - lot of volunteer work, excellent grades, lot of extra curricular activities. I will take the GMAT and go forward only if I score around 700. 

My questions:

1. Is this a good idea? Aside from the qualitative reason that would like the experience once in my life of going to a good school. Or is it so stupid, that I somehow get a job, stick to it for a few years and then do an MBA.

2. Any schools I have missed? In the UK.

3. As someone with an Indian passport, from Dubai, would it be likely that I can land a job post graduation there? Assuming I do really well in the course and complete my ACCA by then? Also would the starting salary be enough to support my SO until he finds a job. (Hoping it won't be too bad as he did his masters there and has a good job here now so he will be experienced, but thinking worst case here.)

I know the usual question here is what my goal is, but the problem is Im not restricted to one specific thing as I haven't seen everything there is. I was good at tax consulting, I've done a little internal control and liked it. But I am leaning towards risk management and audit type of work.

In the mean time, yes Im still looking for jobs, even internships.

Thanks a lot in advance."

I went through a series of interviews with this recruiter, then with their client -- finally, last week, I had a series of face-to-face interviews, on-site, with the client.

Now, the recruiter has been calling me back several times, with the assumption that if the job is offered to me, I will take it. I said *I will have to think about it*, and they seemed really put off, to the point where it was uncomfortable on the phone. 

On my end -- this job isn't exactly what I want to be doing, but it is a company I would like to work for, in the geographic area I want to live in. And I still really don't know if I will take the job if offered. I am worried I am came off, to the recruiter, in our conversations, as if I would take the job, for sure. But when I pushed back on that, as I said above, it seemed like they were very taken aback. 

So -- how do I deal with this, exactly? I tried to leave at...*If the salary is right, I will take it...*, but I'm not even sure that is really true. I just got flustered on our last call, because, in my opinion (and I have been working in the defense industry, with former military/current Service members and have been brow-beaten, yelled at, and raked back and forth over the coals), the recruiter was really putting pressure on me to make a split-second decision and wasn't  giving me any time to think.

1. I was wondering if anyone here from NYC that can tell me more about the data science scene there. I'm really looking into finance of things rather than the technology. Perhaps use data science as strategic way of research and analysis. I'm still in undergrad, and I was wondering if they provide lots of internships there. I can't think of any other place than NYC for finance data science. SF,LA,SD,Boston,? Maybe Chicago but I'm still not familiar with that scene.  
2.How do I get my masters paid for? I know most data science jobs need masters or phd, and I don' get why people would do that without even getting the experience. That's why I'm a little worried by internships as I plan to make it into a full time job through internship. Do companies pay for your Data Science education? I know some are offered online i.e. Berkeley. So it maybe a good investment just to intern at one specific company that I like for a long time. I don't know if I want to get a PhD at all to be honest. Well, at least not for awhile. Thanks guys for the inputs! "

Since we just recently celebrated VE day, and with memorial day just around the corner... I figured I would provide an exciting tale involving WWII vet's wife.

For reference to this woman's origin:
https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/30dlcf/the_tale_of_the_awesome_wwii_vet/

**Our cast includes:**

Me - Shisno / Me

Jimmy - Our ever faithful busy times helper / intern.

Cheryl - The WWII vet's wife


It was the middle of the summer.  Sweltering hot, humid ninety plus degree days almost the entire week.  I had begun running a few service calls for the day.  After which, back in the store to wrap up the last four hours.

I arrived at the shop around lunch time.  I had already done around $1,100 worth of business for the day; I was feeling rather satisfied with myself.  I pulled into the store, spotting Cheryl's van immediately.

&gt; ""Oh shit, Jimmy's all alone in there!""

I race inside, and sure enough Jimmy is nowhere to be *seen*.  Instead I find Cheryl, beating on the bathroom door and screaming obscenities.

&gt; Cheryl (screaming): ""NYARGUGH MAKKA SHAKKA TELEKU!!!!""

&gt; Me: ""Cheryl, what's going on?""

&gt; Cheryl: ""Oh, Shisno_!  I'm glad you're here.  This little moron was supposed to clean my computer.  But, he ruined it instead!""

I had been to her house a few times at this point, and she had begun warming up to me.  Over time, I had begun to understand her clipped, guttural dialect of ""English"".

&gt; Me: ""Cheryl, is that your computer on the bench?""

*nods*

&gt; Me: ""Ok, let's take a look...""

I then proceed to open the case and very quickly discover that Jimmy had left the P4 connector unplugged from the motherboard.  I plug the cable back into the motherboard, and test boot the computer.  Of course, it loads right into windows.

&gt; Cheryl: ""This is why I only want you touching our computer when I bring it here!""

&gt; Me: ""I assure you, it's a mistake I made a few times as a rookie.""

&gt; Cheryl: ""BULABAL MIKTASH""

&gt; Me: ""No, really!  But, thank you for the vote of confidence.""

I then carry the computer out to the van, and chat Cheryl down from her rage high...

&gt; Inner Monologue: *Was that?  No... he couldn't be so foolish.  Yes, there it is, movement in the blinds!  The poor little bastard is watching us!  Oh god, no!  Cheryl noticed too!*

&gt;Cheryl: ""HAGABADLA! NYUK MONDUR TINESHUUN!!!!""

*honk honk honnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnk! goes the van's horn...*

&gt; Me: ""Don't worry, Cheryl... I'll be ripping him a new one once you're gone.""

&gt; Cheryl: ""Ok, Shisno_!  Have a good day!

Smug satisfaction is apparent on her face, armed with the knowledge that I will be finishing the dirty job of murdering Jimmy in her stead.  Finally, she practically peels out of our driveway and heads for home.  I make my way into the store, to find Jimmy waiting for me; tears were streaming liberally down his pimply teenage face.

&gt; Jimmy: ""That woman is a monster!  She threw boss` plastic coffee mug at me!""

&gt;Me: ""Yeah, she can be a bit coarse at times.""

&gt; Jimmy: ""Coarse!?  She was trying to beat down the bathroom door!""

&gt;Me: ""Yeah, you can't show her fear.  Otherwise, she will strike for sure.""

With that, I coached Jimmy on double checking his connections when he gets done cleaning a PC.  Afterward, vet stopped by to make an apology to the kid.  I had to intercede when the flask made an appearance, and took the kid's shot for him.  Sometimes, you just have to take one for the team, I guess.

**TL;DR** Moral of the story: Don't leave the intern alone when one of your more *demanding* customers is expected to visit."

I am currently a senior with a major in accounting graduating this June from a non-target UC school (undergrad). The whole year I've been focusing on recruitment for audit positions at Big4/mid tiers - I am happy to say that I've been able to lock in a few full-time offers :)

However, after starting a pro-bono consulting organization for non-profits at my school last quarter, as well as speaking to a few of my friends currently in consulting...my interests are definitely shifting. To keep things short, the work just seems so much more interesting -- more substantial than the type of work I'd be doing in audit. Working for non-profits has been such a rewarding experience and I want to shift my professional focus towards consulting.

The partner at one of the Big4 (Gay Magazine) has mentioned that I would need to stay in Audit for about three years before making a shift into their advisory practice (I've heard that this service line is particularly weak as well). Of course I would need to finish up units and obtain my CPA too, something that I don't think aligns with my long term goals anymore.

My question is, would it be a bad idea to basically reassess everything and try for actual consulting firms again in the Fall? Do firms typically reject recent graduates? Currently I have an internship at a boutique executive transition/search firm, and I plan on practicing cases/coding/learning excel throughout the Summer, so it's not like I'd be sitting at home doing nothing. My GPA is not too strong (Cum ~3.4 Accounting ~3.6), but I do have a lot of self-start experiences, relevant publications, and leadership experiences that I feel makes me at least a competitive candidate. 

Or should I just take the Audit position and tank the three years? I could really use any advice and appreciate anyone who takes the time to read and help.

Thanks so much.

I am twenty-six years old and attending graduate school in Atlanta. I have had mental problems my entire life, and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, severe depression, insomnia, and mild psychosis when I was thirteen. I have come to be able to manage my depression decently, as I am so familiar with how it feels that I am able to separate it from myself as a whole, and having a bad day is more akin to being physically ill than anything else. My anxiety, however, is crippling, and continues to get worse every day.

I cannot adequately express in words the abject horror I feel when behind the wheel of a car. Most other everyday activities that involve leaving my home are also exceedingly difficult. I feel like I am going to pass out every time I go to the grocery store. It can take days for me to get myself to make even an important email or phone call. I do not trust any of my decisions or perceptions because of how much anxiety distorts the way in which I engage with the world, and often end up doing things that seem very irrational to anyone else. 

I also have problems with my back – I was diagnosed with a herniated disc in my neck when I was sixteen, and in the past six months have developed excruciating pain beneath my right shoulder blade that occurs any time I am working with my hands/arms. Because I am in graduate school for art, this has made doing schoolwork very, very difficult. I am actually taking this quarter off because I simply do not have the physical ability to work on art right now. I can't even do something like wash the dishes without ending up doubled over in pain. 

What further complicates all this is that when I went off of my father's insurance when I turned 26 last August, I did not understand anything about how insurance worked (and still don't understand much). I could have signed up for Obamacare but was led to believe that getting insurance through my school was a better option. It was not; it's fixed indemnity insurance and it's fucking terrible. It hardly pays for anything, and it doesn't even count as insurance under the new guidelines. The only reason I didn't have to pay a penalty on my income taxes is because I don't make enough money to have to file them. I get a dispensation from a trust fund that my grandparents set up of about $460 a month, and this is what I live on because I can hardly complete my schoolwork, much less hold down a job. 

Once I got my “insurance,” I visited an orthopedist who for about $500 did not even really examine me, and completely blew me off due to my age. He did refer me to a physical therapy clinic, where I racked up $1,000 worth of bills for six sessions that did nothing. I would not have continued to visit them after the first time if I had realized it was that expensive, but I misunderstood what the people at the front desk told me, and though that the amount my plan gave me to spend per session was covering the entirety of the sessions. This is a recurring theme here. I am an intelligent person, but my anxiety causes me to feel overwhelmed and baffled by most situations in which I have to get and process information from people. I got the orthopedist's assistant to issue me a new prescription for physical therapy, (and it was only at this point that anyone mentioned that the place they'd referred me to was a specialty clinic and therefore more expensive than most) but I have no idea how to find a physical therapist that I can afford. Every time I try to call doctors, they will never tell me how much it is going to cost. I do not understand how to explain my insurance to them. I called the insurance representative and have repeated exactly what she said to tell them and they still have no idea what I mean. I am also extremely limited in what doctors I can go to, because I am simply not able to drive any significant distance within the city.

This is basically the same problem I am having with finding a mental therapist. During my previous quarter of school, I was seeing a counseling intern at my school who was of very little help. If anything, she made things worse overall, because I would tell her about all my problems and she would have no concrete suggestions for me, basically just sympathy, so it made me feel that much more powerless. I tried to request that I be allowed to see one of their actual therapists, but they are making me see her at least one last time in spite of the fact that I explained that it would be a very stressful experience for me to have to explain to a counselor why I do not want to see them anymore, and also that I would rather not use up another one of my limited number of sessions with her. Well, I've got an appointment with her for the 19th, so hopefully things can at least move forward from there. But once I use up my free sessions with the school, I'm in the same position there that I am regarding a medical doctor – I have no idea how to find someone who is close by and can provide me with the services I need at a price I can afford. To add to this, I am transgender, so I also need to find doctors/therapists who will treat me like a human being and not chalk my problems up to that, because I have been on hormone replacement therapy for three years now and so it is not negatively affecting my mental state any longer. It is, however, just another thing I have to pay for.

Regarding medication, I was on Lexapro of varying dosages from the age of fifteen until last December – I had tapered down to 5 mg already, but I couldn't afford it any longer once I turned 26 and was no longer on my father's insurance. Frankly, I also didn't feel like it was helping. It may have helped my depression a bit, but as I have said, I am much more capable of managing that. My anxiety was terrible regardless. I believe I need to get on some kind of anti-anxiety medication, but that is such a daunting prospect not just because of the issues of doctors and finances, but because of how much trial and error it might take to find something that works. I fear I'm going to spend months cycling through various things that either make me worse or turn me into a zombie when I am at a point in my life where I really, really need to be as functional as possible. I have just started an internship at a gallery, and I am hoping to do my thesis show in the fall. I think that my situation will improve a lot once I have graduated, because I won't need to be near the school and can perhaps move to a suburb where it will be less expensive to live and driving will be less awful. However, for that to happen I need to actually be able to make it through this last stretch of school. This time period was supposed to be my recovery period; my opportunity to get myself in order physically and mentally. But it's been a month and half now, and nothing has improved. 

There is now, in fact, an additional problem! About a month ago I started to get occasional mild chest pain and sometimes a sort of shuddering sensation. This has now developed into heart palpitations. It's put my anxiety into overdrive, and it's also made me unable to do my hormone shots because I'm just too freaked out and I don't think I can do it without passing out. I also, after a period of a couple weeks where my right eye was constantly twitching, developed a weird feeling of pressure in my right temple, and a bulging vein there. I have also been having strange pains on the right side of my head. I know that all of this is stuff that can be caused by anxiety, but I don't understand why it would happen now when my anxiety's been consistently terrible for quite some time. It also seems to occur at times when I am calm and my mind is occupied, not just at times when I am freaking out. So, of course, even if it is just caused by anxiety, it's not going to get better until I get reassurance that there's nothing physically wrong. After more terrible experiences trying to find doctors and making nerve-wracking phone calls, I've just made an appointment for Thursday with the closest possible one. So there's me spending more money I don't really have on a doctor I'm not confident will take me seriously at all.

I wonder if maybe I am eligible for Medicaid, or if maybe I can get on Obamacare under one of their exceptions for special circumstances, but again, no idea how any of that works, and no luck thus far trying to figure it out. I tried to put in an application for it and said that I thought I might qualify as disabled, but it was automatically rejected. And of course, another catch – I am still a legal resident of Florida, my home state. I maintained residency at my family's home because Florida laws allowed me to change the gender marker on my license without having had surgery. I also have just moved so many times since coming here for school. I don't know if I need to switch my residency, or who I need to talk to, or...anything. That's the tl;dr of this, basically. I need help and I have no idea what I'm doing.

Plan thus far:

- Visit doctor on Thursday and try to get these recent physical things sorted out. See if maybe he has a suggestion for a physical therapist?

- Try to call a few physical therapy places, as unpleasant and confusing as it is. Maybe get myself to do one a day.

- Try my very best, in spite of how much I resent having to do it, to explain to my counselor (and hopefully her superior) what I need out of counseling and what I need help with. Try to figure out what is within their power to help me with, and who they might be able to point me to to help with the other stuff. Hopefully, I can work on getting medication through them, or they can help me find someone who can get me started on that.

But I still have no idea what to do about insurance and money, or about being a functional human being in the short term. I really appreciate if you've read all this, and would be even more appreciative if you have any kind of feedback or suggestions."
35rpxa,0,2015-05-12,Senior Project: Red Harbinger Build,JesseDieToll,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/35rpxa/senior_project_red_harbinger_build/,"I am starting my senior project early, currently I am in the 11th grade.
 
I have always thought it would be amazing  to have a computer put into a desk with a glass case. I am currently a junior at Dubiski Career high school (I'll go into depth on my school and pathway a little later). Despite the cost I have decided to do something I've only had dreams about.
This image has had the largest influences on my current design
 
Accompanied by four pumps, the reservoirs will separate cold water and the warm to take the heat away from the components. I still feel that the PC should have airflow so that that PC doesn’t rely on one or the other (but the water cooled will be the ""primary"" cooling system if you will)
The PC it's self

The parts I use depend on the funding I get from GoFundMe, money I’m able to put into it and the school district puts into it.
CPU: AMD FX-9590 4.7GHz 8-Core
GPU:  R9 295 x2 8GB 
MB: Asus Crosshair V Formula-Z ATX AM3+
RAM: 16 Gbs 
Storage: 2tbs SSD/ 4tbs Hybrid

The computer will also have other features, such as a wifi hotspot and the monitors will raise and lower on a track.
My school

I go to Dubiski Career High School. At Dubiski there are different pathways, Engineering, IT, Health Science, Media Tech, Architecture, Business, and Auto Tech. I am in the Information Technology pathway, and for the past three years I have been learning how to build and repair computers, however as silly as it sounds our pathway has been influenced heavily on gaming. We have studied the effects of PC and console gaming on information technology as a whole, and it has had a larger influence than you'd think.
Senior Projects

Each student is required to complete a ""senior project in order to graduate. The senior project is a representation of all you have learned in your pathway over the last four years. My teacher and I have worked together over the last two weeks to come up with this, we are both really excited, and however money is a major issue. 

But Why are you starting so early?
I want to take the computer to competitions in December. These competitions are watched by tech corporations and colleges alike, another one of my goals is to get noticed for some scholarships.

So you expect us to just pay for a PC and us get nothing out of it?
Well I wouldn’t even get to use it for maybe a year, and even then I have agreed to let the school use it for showcases and advertising. But in the end I would get it, however I am planning on releasing all of my drawing and designs for the desk so anyone and everyone can modify or build their own. But short answer, I would most likely get the PC in the end. But I'm not claiming to revolutionize the PC industry just to have an amazing project so I can graduate.
It benefits more than me

 My school hosts the ""GPISD Experience"" where students show off projects and the district can show off their new (7 years) shiny school. This project would take part in this showcase, advertising my pathway. Students in middle school could see my work and be inspired to join a pathway and do better than me, and they will. At state competitions tech companies will see this project and sponsor my pathway, 10,000 can go a long way for a lot of people in the IT pathway even leading to internships. This may seem like big dreams for a small project but it’s happened in auto tech when they rebuild a tractor, it can happen to IT. 

Here is the part I wish I didnt have to post, Im not asking for it but I am giving you the option of donating to this (its expensive) every little bit helps. But even if you just read everything thank you. here is the option http://www.gofundme.com/u9f76ep8 if you so choose. Thank you for your time"

I understand the material great, but with small children, a job, etc. I've only managed a ~3.15 GPA in my major. On top of that by the time I recognized the importance of database experience (after unsuccessful internship interviews) it was too late to take a class. So I'm planning on getting a MCSA cert. The professors I've asked are confident I can do it myself. Can anyone recommend materials/programs? My current plan is to just order materials from Microsoft, as it appears I can do, and use Amazon EC2 servers for practice. Is that a reasonable approach with no experience? I know there are intensive programs you can take, but they seem like they're more for corporations to train up someone in house fast, but for a hefty price for an individual to pay."

My dream is to be able to play GTA V, DA:I, The Witcher 3 all at 1080p, 60fps. 

What I have below has left me with a few extra bucks for peripherals later. After this price point for the CPU/GPU I'm not convinced the extra money is worth it. (I'm not entirely convinced the extra $70 for the i7 instead of the i5 is worth it). 

**My main concerns**

* Will this be able to play the games I want to play at 1080x60fps?
* Are there any red flags with the case, motherboard, or PSU?
* Will I have overheating issues with the stock CPU heatsink/fan?

I can get Windows through my University for free, since I'm a Computer Science student, and right now I have a 1080p monitor, and a keyboard. I might look into another keyboard just for this computer later, but I won't be buying one now.

Thanks ahead of time, I really appreciate having a second pair of eyes to look at this.

35skoi,2,2015-05-12,College Student - not sure what to do in my life,NoMotivationGuy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/35skoi/college_student_not_sure_what_to_do_in_my_life/,"So a few months back I was academically dismissed from my college, and then reinstated for this current quarter (my college runs on a quarter system).

I felt like I was a different person. I had newfound motivation and have been studying harder this term than I ever had in previous terms. I've been doing well on all of my assignments and labs, and even well in my math classes that I struggle in.

However, the amount of stress that I've been under these past few weeks has been immense. It's been so bad that I've actually begun to have suicidal thoughts. I kinda realized it the other day that I actually was thinking about the different ways I could take my life. I was thinking about how I would do it, the pain I would feel, and how life around me would go on after I was gone, and I know I don't want to think like this. It scares me. I don't think I could ever go through with this, because I know how devastated my family would be if I were to (especially my sister), but it's still very scary for me to be thinking like this.

Honestly, I think what I really want to do is withdraw from all of my classes for this term, and just take a break from classes. I don't think I'm ready for it yet. Ever since my grandfather passed away last November, I've been a different person. It was a very sudden death and the first real family death that I've been old enough to really understand, so it's really impacted me in a difficult way. My mind hasn't been in the right place and I've just been thinking and living completely differently from how I was previously. It was the main reason that I was academically dismissed last term. I *thought* that I was over it, and that's why I attempted this term, but I was completely wrong. I'm not. I'm nervous to tell my parents about this, because I really don't want to disappoint them and I know that me getting dismissed last term was very hard for them to deal with. They want me to go to college and be successful, but I don't think I'm ready enough to finish my degree yet. 

The last day to withdraw from classes is this Friday, and I'm unsure of what to do. If I were to stay in my classes I probably would do alright, but there's no guarantee. I really think I want to withdraw from my classes and take a break, but I'm not sure how to really tell my parents this. The other big issue is that if I were to take a term off, I would likely be staying home instead of at my apartment by my college, which would mean that I would either need to find a person to sublet my lease for the summer, or just keep paying the rent for the months that I wouldn't be there. Finding someone this close to summer term would probably be near impossible, so I would be forced to pay my rent, which actually means my parents would be paying rent, even though I'm not even going to be living there. I mean, this actually would be cheaper than paying for a college semester and having it wasted, but still.

And also, I don't know what I would even do over the summer if I were to take a break. I want to get a job, but it's likely that most jobs would be taken by now by the highschool students there. I MAY be able to get an internship at my parents work, which is where I worked already during my freshman summer (freshman year we don't have classes during the summer term). But at the same time, I'm not sure if work is what I really need right now. I really want to spend the summer getting myself back together. I want to lose weight and get back into shape. I want to eat better. I want to get my drivers license (I was always putting it off in high school, and never have the time to do it now especially since I don't have a car at college to practice driving). I know that my parents are probably going to tell me to take a course at the community college over the summer, so maybe that would be a good idea.

So yeah. I honestly don't know what I'm looking for by posting here. I just needed to write this all down and let it all out somewhere. I guess I'm actually asking quite a few questions here:

Should I withdraw or should I stay(definitely leaning towards the withdraw though)? How should I tell my parents if I choose to withdraw? What should I do with my free time if I do withdraw?

In my first rotation, I was a Business Analyst - business requirements gathering, business process analysis, documentation, etc. In my current rotation, I am an Application Developer (in DevOps). I have two more rotations following this technical one, but I am set on finding a new job.

I graduated from a business school in May 2014, majoring in Corporate Finance and Accounting and (unofficially) Computer Information Systems. I had work study jobs as a Help Desk Consultant, Software Analyst/Hardware Technician, and Website Designer.

I moved to another stated around this time and I didn't actually enroll again until the summer of 2012.

Last semester I took 3 classes and ended up having to drop one and then this semester I took another 3 and it honestly looks like I might have to retake them all. Half way through I just completely lost interest. There was one day in particular where I went to school to drop everything, but my girlfriend talked me out of it.

Now it feels wet. What the hell. Being a warm night, I assume it is sweat and try to go to sleep. 

Soon, my ankle is soaked. I get up and stumble to the bathroom. I switch the light on and notice a ketchup stain on the wall. ""how the fuck did that get there?"" I wonder. 

I look down and my ankle and foot are COVERED in blood. What's worse is the fact that my ankle is *pissing out a fucking horizontal stream of blood*. I proceed to plug the hole with one finger, and call my girlfriend, all whilst acting like a wounded soldier on Omaha beach. I roll on to my back, bawling on the phone to my girlfriend, and realize my apartment looks like a murder scene. My pressure hose ankle has sprayed blood all over my white walls.

I lay on my back for a good 15 mins, trying to get the blood to stop. Legit thought I had somehow contracted haemophilia and this was the end. But naturally, the bleeding eventually subsided and I cleaned all the goddamn blood off my walls.


Now, with my ankle covered in bandaids and a big ass sock, I'm trying to get back to sleep and feeling like a buffoon for scaring the crap out of my poor girlfriend.

Now I can't decide if I should reapply again now that the cooldown period has actually passed. 

-------

I interned for one of the smaller top companies last summer. At the end of the summer I wasn't extended a return offer, and my mentor told me that I would probably be a better fit at one of the bigger, older companies because they move more slowly and allow their new grads more time to grow.

I agreed with him, and so decided I probably wouldn't reapply once the company's 6 month cooldown period after my internship was over. BUT about a month after I left, my school's recruiter contacted me and offered me an interview. I took the interview, though I was surprised as they told me they strictly didn't reinterview interns so soon after their internship, and afterwards talked to my mentor who'd told me he had negotiated an early interview for me, *even though* he had said that thought I would be better off elsewhere. I can't decide if he changed his mind or just really hoped that he was wrong.

I was so nervous about the interview that I failed it, and I've passed the 6 month cooldown period since that interview without finding a job. Should I reapply again and hope he was wrong if I do get the job, or do I run the risk of losing credibility at the company?"

I only recently (last 6 months) discovered that I enjoy cs exponentially more than EE.

How should I approach interviews this fall? Should I apply to all places as any normal CS student would do? I think some places have policies in place that don't allow you to reapply for like 6 or 8 months. Should I disregard that, and continue as usual? I don't want to get stopped form applying to cool places when/if I'm more prepared in spring..

Or should I apply to for specific internship positions, like front-end web dev, or ux design, or sth I can master on my own?

35uq15,1,2015-05-13,[Vent] Incredibly disappointed in myself,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/35uq15/vent_incredibly_disappointed_in_myself/,"It all started to go downhill about a week ago. A girl that I had been crushing on for half the semester drunkenly let me know that she had had a crush on me for about 70% of the semester, but now she was over me. It wasn't a big deal because I don't plan on dating at all during college nor do I feel like I have the time to invest in relationships.

My finals were from the 8th until yesterday. I had started studying on the 26th and was pretty gung-ho about all my exams except Physics E&amp;M as my professor had tried to cover six chapters of material in six classes (since he was gone for four weeks at the beginning of the semester), which obviously didn't work out. Anyhow, he expected us to know all of it and I just did not understand any of it. However, I didn't go to office hours or recitation because none of the TAs (this is not an exaggeration) are good at teaching. Come the final, I thought I had everything down, I had gone through all of the homework, the exams, practice exams, labs, everything and was at about 90% proficiency. Boy, was I wrong. The final fucking wrecked me, I was hoping for a 75 at that point. Guess what I got: a 50. I needed a 55 for a B, but I now have a C+.

Same with my Mass &amp; Energy exam. I needed a 76 to get a B, I got a 73. I had also gone through all the practice exams and exams and homework, roughly 30 hours of studying. I had felt relatively confident about the exam, but I was wrong yet again.

Then there was my general engineering exam that I thought I had done well, but apparently for the programming practical, I had submitted the wrong final, so my max grade on the final would be an 83. I know this was 100% my fault and I had shown my teacher my code as he wanted to know that I understood the coding material. He saw that it was perfect and congratulated, but I didn't ask for a grade change nor would he have been willing to give one for good reason.

So now here I am, with maybe a 2.6 GPA my second semester of college. I'm in a few organizations, but I'm not active in any of them because I spend all my time doing homework or chilling out with my friends and I didn't think much about not being active until I spoke with my brother yesterday. I also plan on graduating in three years and a yearlong coop, so I need to get a coop opportunity in the fall, but with my shitty GPA, I know I won't. My people skills can be spectacular, but I know I'll end up being anxious about my shortcomings.

This summer I'm taking classes at a college in the city, which is putting me in even more debt, but it's still better than paying for another two semesters at my university. I've applied to hundreds of jobs and internships, but none of them have hired me. I almost got hired at two, but their peak times of operation are when I'm going to be in class (9 AM - 1 PM). I've tried applying to  be a volunteer at a ton of machine shops, bike coops, and other mechanical related places, but they either ignore me or reject me.

Last of all, I've consistently been wondering throughout the semester if I even have what it takes to be a chemical engineering and now I'm starting to think that I don't. If I'm failing in the beginner's courses, then I sure as hell won't be able to get through this program. Actually, my school does a general engineering program then after your first year, you switch into your intended major if you have a 3.0. At this point, I may not be able to even get into ChemE because of my GPA. My peers and friends are ultra-competitive and think I'm dumb, which infuriates me because I won regional and national academic awards in high school, got a 2340 on my SAT without studying, and have a treasure trove of knowledge and common sense that allows me to quickly remedy problems in a domestic situation.

I know my parents think I'm a failure because they told me that yesterday when I came home. They think that I'm digging myself into a deep hole because I'm taking out loans to do something that I suck at. I should be mindful of their advice since my dad's an engineer and my mom's a chemist and they know what I'm going through.

I think my choices have put me in a shithole that I won't be able to trudge out of. I think that I'm on a path that may make me unemployable. I don't know what to do, but the one thing I will not do is quit. I can't take time off of college and nor do I have the means to take a year off."
35utpx,3,2015-05-13,Advice required M.Math Computer Science(Thesis) at UofWaterloo vs MSc Applied Computing at UofToronto,adstarrock,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/35utpx/advice_required_mmath_computer_sciencethesis_at/,"Hello every one,  
I would like to have some opinion for graduate studies in the field of  data mining and machine learning.
I have secured admits in the following two courses in Canada.    
* M.Math Computer Science at University of Waterloo  
* MSc Applied Computing at University of Toronto.  

As far as courses are concerned the one at Waterloo is research oriented and the one at Toronto is aimed towards working professionals like myself (3 years software development experience in an unrelated field)  

From what i have researched on the internet, Waterloo is very well respected for its undergraduate course in computer science, but I was not able to find any feedback for the Masters course.
MSc in Applied Computing is relatively a newer course which includes an internship, although the companies involved for internships are mostly startups.  

I intend to return back to the software industry after the master's degree and would really be aiming towards working for the top companies in the field (likes of Google, Apple and MS). Any advice/resources to help me with the decision would really be appreciated."

I have 2 years left of my (BSc) Biology undergrad. After finishing I will apply for an MSc Computer Science conversion course. 

At the moment, I have some fairly basic projects up on Github, and an internship where I used MATLAB to design some psychophysics experiments.

I'm planning on adding more projects to Github, getting a bit more programming experience (internships etc), and continue learning programming, mathematics, and CS to prepare for the masters course. 



What are your experiences fresh out of uni and looking for a job in the UK? Is it really as bad as I hear? What other things could I be doing to stand out from the crowd?

I'm thinking about moving to Edinburgh or Cambridge, any other areas that are especially nice for software engineers?

35uzuc,26,2015-05-13,"""The Conduit"" (NSFW - Graphic Violence)",mb2000inc,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/35uzuc/the_conduit_nsfw_graphic_violence/,"I've never been a stranger to the paranormal.  I've always been receptive to the strange goings on from the other side.  I never really knew what it was about me that brought them, but I just knew that they've always come.  Most of the time, it was at those inopportune moments when I was a teenager - on a date.... or worse, when I was alone... and on a ""date"".

Some folks speculated that it was my awkward teen emotional states, and quite possibly my raging hormones that brought them.  Kinda like I was giving off that type of energy that they needed to manifest themselves.  I always thought I'd grow out of it once I reached adulthood.

Boy, was I wrong.  I'm forty-two, now.  I've been experiencing these manifestations since I was able to understand what was real and what I thought was not.  Since my first incident, I'd been in and out of therapy, hooked up to monitors - hell, I'd even been studied by, so called, paranormal experts.  No one could really explain what it was that was going on, or even how I was able to bring about the presence of individuals from beyond.

Since I was twenty-three, I'd been residing at The Rhine Research Center for Parapsychology Research in North Carolina.  On a daily basis, they would put me through stress tests of all sorts - to see what it was that might actually trigger any kind of paranormal interactions between this world and the next.  

Though a small part of me really just wanted to go home and get on with my life, I was truly dedicated to finding out what it was about me that made me a portal... or ""conduit"", if you will, to bring about these entities.

Throughout the last nineteen years, I was able to manifest one hundred and twenty-two occurrences - each being more intense than the previous.  In most cases, things got broken or tossed around.  However, there were those few times that someone got hurt, or worse - as in the case of yesterday's incident that put the whole complex on red alert and brought in the federal government.

After that, the doctors told me to sit back and take a breather from my daily routines until the higher ups are through with their investigation on the matter.  I was told, at some point in my time here, to write a journal.  Though, I'd never been big on written expression and writing down my ""feelings"".

I usually remember all of my encounters.  A gift, a curse?  Call it what you will, but it stays with me for the longest time.  Take, for instance, the time I was thirteen years old (yeah, lucky thirteen).  I had the worst nightmare ever recorded in the history of nightmares.  You know those things that you know are there but you can't see them?  Yeah.  Those.  Hands clawing at me from the inside - forces pulling me from the outside, it was a mess.  I woke up, and I can still see the spots on my arms and chest where the scratches used to be.

But that's nothing compared to this latest incident.  

So, after taking the advice of my new doctor, I decided, this is it.  This is my chance to recount yesterday's happenings in all their glory - as it were.

It started off like any other day, though admittedly, I felt the usual uneasiness that accompanied an oncoming episode.  Though, as the day progressed, nothing happened, but the uneasiness kept growing inside me.  When my final session came about, I was so unnerved and fidgety that I was getting upset.  My stomach felt like it was in knots.  As Doctor Shaw asked his usual questions, I couldn't help but get angrier and angrier.  Nothing was happening.  Nothing ever happened when he asked the questions... I just wanted the day to be over with and I'd reached my boiling point.

And that's when it happened.

I tried to warn Doctor Shaw, that it was coming.  He ignored my comment and made a quick glance at the window where the interns usually looked on and monitored the activities from the next room, but they did nothing.  They just sat there, smirking.

It started with a low hum; the kind of electrical hum from a florescent light with a bad ballast.  I could feel the vibrations of everything in the room.  as the vibrations got more intense, everything in the room started to shake.  Books fell off the shelves, pens flew off the desk and that's only the beginning.

I yelled at Doctor Shaw to get out, but he just froze - looking around the room in awe.  I yelled again, but he still sat there; frozen.

As quickly as it started, it stopped.  But I knew it wasn't over.  The uneasiness was still there.  I could still hear the humming and the vibrations made me light headed - it was coming.

I looked around the room, and then back to Doctor Shaw.  He was sitting there, wide-eyed - but not with the same awe that he'd had before.  This time, it was a look of fear - fear of me.  No, he wasn't looking at me.  He was looking PAST me.  

I could feel it.  It was behind me.  I glanced at the window, noticing the same look of fear on the interns' faces.  One of them had stood up with her hands on her head in shock.  No.  It wasn't shock.  It was something else, entirely.  It was a look of pain.

She looked like she'd begun to cry, only they were tears of crimson, as a shadow emerged from behind me, and in a flash, had moved around the room in one swift motion - shattering the glass window between the interns and us.

The other intern flew backwards, smashing against the brick wall behind him, leaving a red streak on the wall behind his head as he slid down to the floor.  The other, still standing had glass, now embedded in her skin.  Her arms dropped to her sides as she stood there for a moment before succumbing to her hastened demise and falling to the floor.

I got up out of my chair and backed against the wall.  I wanted to scream in terror, but I couldn't form the sounds.  I looked back to Doctor Shaw who was still sitting in his chair, wide-eyed at what just happened, but something else was wrong.  Entirely too wrong.

The shadow was no longer in the room.  No.  Yes.  Yes it was, but it wasn't where it should be.  It was inside Doctor Shaw.  I could see his aura fading from its usual vibrant color - to black.

It wasn't Doctor Shaw any more.  His eyes were now glazed over in a shiny gray-ish tone with hints of bloodshot veins, just under the surface. His face had run pale.  The entity inside him, craned his neck and head in my direction and stared at me momentarily, before smiling at me in the creepiest fashion, I could have ever (never) dreamed.

This thing.  This being.  This entity who had taken over the body of Doctor Shaw, craned his head around the room and began to stand up - as if being pulled up by it's chest.  Once upright, he... IT turned to face me - opening his stolen body's mouth to form words.  But, instead, smiled at me again - as if it knew something; something that only other entities would need to know.

It's smile faded - right before the body of Doctor Shaw began to creak, and things internally began to snap. The entity's body started folding in on itself - contorting in a fashion that no HUMAN could ever do; bones breaking and cracking, skin tearing, and blood flowing - until there was nothing but a crumpled mess of bodily remains on the floor, no longer resembling the man I knew, just five minutes ago.

The world around me faded and swirled as I fell to my knees.  I was tired and drained.  The last thing I remembered was four more doctors standing over me - shining a pen light in my eyes.  I was cold.

Everything went black.

3. Wanting to possibly finish a bachelors, am all enrolled and admitted in university, all credit transfers, and am in a position to be able to not work much and finish 4yr.

We did a large project, was very monotonous, am very burnt out and not challenged @ this corporate location
(edited for anonymity :P)
Was told a position opened up at this same business on the helpdesk (not devops/netops) that supports all of these  

I am pretty luke warm about this position. Location is Midwest (not chicago)  and position is 40k with 2 weeks PTO, 401k. Hours are rotating on call with a shimmy swing schedule. 

My boss at this internship (director) is very pro me not going to finish 4yr and humping hard into a sysadmin/engineer/systems role somewhere else. His comments were ""you don't need a degree"" and ""you wouldnt like this job in helpdesk, your skillset is too far up for it"" and ""you don't need a starter job"".... But he also offered it as a possibilty when he learned I hadn't got any promising offers yet. I am a little worried about getting Siloed from the rest of devops/admin world by focusing on Point of sale.

I am burnt out from full time school and fulltime internship w/ a part time job. 

I have three choices: 

1. Finish internship, and cycle all summer with money saved up. **Start bachelors in fall** and not work or part time.
2. Gun for this position on this helpdesk i am not super enthusiastic about.
3. Go full time 4yr while working fulltime at this position.
(not going to happen I would hate my life)

For context, I had some marks on my background a long time ago. This company i intern for took a shot on me, and I will get a good reference either way. Am I commiting career suicide by continuing on for a nother 2 yrs without continual IT employment and the networking that comes from it.

35v9ut,81,2015-05-13,Lost my first data science job very quickly - how discouraged should I feel?,csds_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35v9ut/lost_my_first_data_science_job_very_quickly_how/,"Background: I'll be finishing my PhD in economics in the coming months. Along the way I had developed some proficiency in R and Python and figured that my background in econometrics could position me decently for some sort of data science position. I mean, a research position in academia would've been ideal but I wasn't going to get a good offer here, and I figured this would be comparable in desirability to a post-doc or liberal arts position.

There was an opening at a startup locally (in D.C.) that I seemed well-matched for (it asked for familiarity with several of the packages I had used in R, as well as some additional research tools), so I sent in my resume. Their software test was simple enough, although the senior dev at the firm who graded it noted that my code was functional but inefficient. Keep in mind that I was self-taught in these languages and had largely developed software for my own research and not really for a production environment. In any case, I had a couple of interviews subsequent to this, I felt that I had hit it off with the senior dev and cofounder who would become my boss, and so they made me an offer.

Since the job was local, I expressed an interest in working part time while finishing my dissertation work, moving to full time at around June 1st. I figured this would just be a nice way to ""hit the ground running"" and be familiarized with their code base and workflow at that time. Initially they made me an offer with a part-time hourly wage with the details being sketchy beyond that, but I stressed the importance that if I accepted the job, I would see it as a real commitment (the academic labor market is pretty seasonal and accepting this offer would mean forgoing other opportunities that would not exist later) and they came back with a salaried offer that would just give me partial pay while I was doing part-time work. Great. I accepted. Turned down some other places that had expressed interest (some academic, some not.)

The job: To skip ahead, I only ended up working there for about 13 days, or 3 days a week for 4 weeks with their dismissing me on the 5th week. The 1st week was more or less an orientation, and the 2nd I got put on a project to develop code to improve their main predictive model. Great. But it was obvious pretty quickly that the cofounder thought that this job should not take very long to implement, and although I was making steady progress and adding in new features to test a variety of models, my code was not well-optimized (partially because I was focusing on testing and evaluating new models rather than making the code pretty) and he expressed disappointment with the speed of its development as well as its complexity. It was repeatedly implied that the senior dev - who struck me as something of a fucking wizard, a very talented guy with elegant code but who also had the advantage of having built the entire current workflow - could have probably completed this project in a couple days, and therefore that my taking weeks (or more like 5+ days) was a problem.

I wasn't expecting this to lead to my getting dismissed, however, but it did. Despite their being apologetic about things not working out, I felt used. Looking back, I can see some activity in their hiring records indicating that they started looking for new data scientists about a week before my dismissal, which to me indicates that there must have been a judgement made very soon after they saw my code to look into replacing me, and initiated this process right afterwards. I'd like to imagine I'm being paranoid here, but the bottom line is that it seems like despite my expressing the importance of the offer representing a mutual commitment before accepting it, they ultimately viewed my time there as a trial period that I had failed within a matter of days.

Questions/thoughts:

- When they told me I was being fired, I was pretty surprised, and I said that I understood that I wasn't as good as the senior developer they had but I believed I would get there. Importantly, the level of sophistication/elegance required by their code base was far beyond anything in their relatively-simple test. So I said that they should probably develop a harder test.

- Maybe I sound incompetent. Maybe I am. Like I said, I have a familiarity with a variety of tools in R and I was able to approach the tasks given, but not with the speed/elegance that was expected of me. I'm not sure if this means that I should give up on a data science or a software career at the moment (it's difficult to convey my absolute level of competence here), or if I should just try to find a more... supportive environment, where I'll be able to develop a more-professional style through practice. This wasn't a particularly-lucrative senior development position or anything, and it makes me worry that there just might not good positions for people like me who have decent data background and also some experience with whatever software tools. I'd prefer not to end up with an internship or something that's super entry-level.

- Is this sort of thing pretty par for the course in the industry? I'd imagine in a larger firm I would've had more slack. Part of my frustration was that I was being told to expand my code to do new stuff but that it also had to be nicely-optimized and look like their production code at pretty much every stage of the process. I figured I'd just built in all the features first, then when we've decided on what models work best I'd optimize the code to integrate into the current base. Was this just a bad idea? Am I bad programmer for seeing a tradeoff here at all, or perhaps I was unwise to not try to communicate my concerns better?

I don't know. Ultimately I'm shocked and I feel somewhat incompetent right now. But I also don't feel like I was given the chance I needed to demonstrate value and pick up some of the habits that would allow me to consistently generate high-quality code. Maybe I shouldn't expect to get a job that allows me that.

**tl;dr version**: Accepted a job offer as a data scientist based on my R and Python experience on my own projects. Got fired after working for 13 days because the code for my first project was insufficiently polished. Not sure if I should just interpret this as indicating that data science won't work out for me, or if this particular firm had unreasonable expectations of me."

[How does environmental health affect me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7xnjl?context=5)|There is a reciprocal relationship between you and your environment. Think about it, you likely woke up indoors where the air you breathed was cleaned by an HVAC filter, presumably flushed body wastes down the toilet, you washed (I hope!) in bacteria-free water, made coffee with safe drinking water, ate breakfast that was safe and free from contaminants. In the absence of a safe and healthy environment, your life expectancy drops dramatically.
[Dr. Dyjack, thank you for taking the time to do this AMA.  I have the opportunity to work in Beijing for a few years. I'm 33 and healthy.  What sort of health complications might I expect from living there? Is there anything I can do to minimize them? Is it okay to jog outdoors during 'good' smog days? Do you expect the pollution to decline in the coming years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr85nal?context=5)|Hi, I spent a summer in China a few years ago, and the air quality in urban areas is poor. Generally speaking, consider exercising indoors any time of year. poor air quality will be an issue for the foreseeable future. Also, you should anticipate food and water related disturbances to your GI tract, which can be minimized by preparing your own meals or eating street food which can be observed being cooked. But don't be paranoid.Having said that, I am jealous, Beijing is one of the great tourist cities on the planet. Be safe.
[Serious question; should I recycle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7ssma?context=5)|Serious answer, it is better to ""reduce"" than ""recycle"". Recycling can generate its own set of environmental challenges, which are absent if we live thoughtful lives. For example, bottled water. We can recycle those plastic bottles although it would be better for the environment and more cost efficient to simply drink tap water from a reusable container.
[Why is it that Maine has relatively good air quality but one of highest rates of asthma? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7xesb?context=5)|Asthma is a complicated multi-factoral disease. Asthma episodes can be brought on by stress, physical activity as well as air contaminants, including cockroach, mite, cat dander and other irritants associated with the indoor environment. So, the short answer is that that indoor air quality, lifestyle, and other mediating factors can be associated with asthma.
[Mr. Dyjack; as someone who likely will never become a vegetarian (except by necessity\), is spending my food dollars on sustainably/ethically raised animal products actually impactful in any meaningful way? Or is it simply an industry pacifier that I'm fortunate enough to pay for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7sx0v?context=5)|You guys are asking some tough questions. I believe there is a ""normal"" distribution of ethics among the producers. I am not vegetarian, and at the same time try to eat a plant-based diet when ever I can control myself, and consume ethically harvested and raised animal products. An ideal approach is to be a ""locavore"", eat food raised locally, then you will know for certain the practices of the growers.
[I recently graduated with a Bachelors degree in Public Health from an accredited university and am having trouble finding a job. The environmental courses that I took were some of the most intriguing and were definitely some of my favorite parts of the curriculum. How did you get your career started in this field, and what advice do you have for someone who is wanting to get his or her foot in the door for this line of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7uahw?context=5)|Thanks for the opportunity to address this question. I do have recommendations. First, consider work at a local health department. Virtually every health department has an environmental health program, and health officials have told me they are having trouble recruiting a qualified workforce. Consider relocating to mid-America for a while (away from the coastal states). Finally, consider the CDC PHAP program, designed for individuals who have bachelors degree and want to gain experience.
[Hi Dave! Thanks for doing this! I've always been interested in environmental health and especially food safety and sustainable food processes. What tips could you give someone who is looking to start working in this field? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7wosc?context=5)|Hi - there is plenty of opportunity in the EH field, as long as you are willing to move to a new state or community. Think outside your local region. If you are in school, intern with an employer that you might desire to work for in the future. Finally, attend local professional meetings as they often announce job opportunities after the meal.
[What advice do you have for someone graduating in Environmental, Health and Safety soon? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7sodl?context=5)|Thanks for your question. While you need to be technically proficient, ensure your writing and presentation skills are top shelf. Consider being active in the local chapter of your professional association, and secure certification in your chosen professional domain.
[Hello, how has the environment changed over the last 20 or so years? and where do you see things go into the future? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7t3p6?context=5)|We are headed into an era of ecosystem fragmentation, which will give rise to the next generation of zoonotic and vectorborne diseases, such as Ebola and Lyme disease. I encourage readers to familiarize themselves with the 1-Health movement.
[Hi Mr. Dyjack, I would first like to say thank you so much for doing this AMA. Awareness regarding the links between environmental health and human health is so, so important. Which leads me to my questions...   How do you go about inspiring people to champion environmental health? And how do you show people that standing up for the environment isn't just for the whales and the trees, but it's for our entire society? For example, when I tell my roommate or some friends that I study Sustainability, I am often met with infuriatingly patronizing responses along the lines of ""oh, that's cute"" or ""that's nice, but how will that be useful, ever?"" People just don't get that literally everything in their lives depends upon a healthy environment. Even more concerning is that I'm getting these responses in the world of academia, where people are generally more informed.   Do you think apathy or lack of understanding that human health is very tightly linked to environmental health in the general public is a legitimate issue? Have you seen it throughout your working career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr801e0?context=5)|I have strong opinions on your questions, and would be delighted to weigh in. EH professionals have fallen prey to the ""evidence based decision making"" agenda at the expense of our mission. EH is a profoundly local issue, and ""intimate"" issue. We should frame our work and results in personal terms. For example, what is more intimate than the food we place in our children's mouths? The water we bathe them in? The mosquitoes that fly around us at night? I will be speaking at the NEHA Annual conference in July on this issue, and will introduce a metaphor and new way of speaking about us and our profession, which I hope will provide a path forward and enhance our visibility and influence.
[If you had to pick one thing that each person could do in their every day lives to make an impact towards a healthier environment, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7qtyi?context=5)|I believe it is an attitude versus a specific thing. Having said that, eating lower on the food chain, that is, primarily a vegetarian diet, is very helpful all around in that less fossil fuels, antibiotics and waste products are produced.
[Hi Dave! A friend of mine argues that individuals reducing their use of resources pales in comparison to companies and corporations, and therefore it is not worth an individual's efforts.  My question is, what do you think is most needed, individuals reducing their impact (and if so- how should we go about encouraging this\) or larger corporations reducing their impact?  Thanks so much for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7xb7i?context=5)|Companies and corporations respond to you the consumer. Vote with your pocketbook and use your purchasing ""vote"" by supporting companies that are aligned with your values. Companies are sensitive to ""wasted"" resources, and are always looking to reduce their exposure to bad press and cost of inefficiency.
[I live in the great lakes area and graduated with a biology degree. My girlfriend (from California\) is constantly harassing me for wasting water when we live in the country and have well/septic fields. She even bothers me about it when it's raining. Can you explain that being concerned about *saving* water in Michigan is like being concerned about *saving* sand in a desert. In my opinion it's more about keeping it clean and usable, not over using unless I am totally missing something about the water cycle and that its not all going to the same place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/35tvz7/im_david_dyjack_executive_director_of_the/cr7yroc?context=5)|Mark Twain once said ""Whiskey is for Drinking and Water is for fighting over"". I side with your girlfriend. Just because a resource is in abundant supply, that should not translate in capricious consumption. Water is indeed the new oil (not my quote), we should use each drop wisely, irrespective of its relative abundance. My two cents.

She has applied for a EDA card back in March; however it still hasn't arrived yet

She is worried that she will not be able to work at all without getting the card.

She already has contacted her university and Big4 company; however - is there anything she can do while waiting for a reply.

35wb28,2,2015-05-13,Canceling on-site interview for internship?,program_null,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35wb28/canceling_onsite_interview_for_internship/,"Hey everyone. I searched a bit but my situation isn't exactly like any example posts I could find, so please bear with me.

I have an internship interview scheduled in the next couple days. The main problem is final exams begin Friday and one professor in particular changed his office hours so they take place during the interview. Not only that, but travel each way to this place's location would take about 2 hours, which is a lot of time considering the interview length would be at least 1.5 hours and possibly longer.

I wanted to interview, but beside the mentioned problems, it's also an internship for a position that I'm not prepared for much, if at all. It's not really software engineering, though it's CS-related. I looked up interview questions, like on Glassdoor, and I just feel like I'd be wasting the interviewers' time.

It's very last-minute and I wouldn't normally cancel like this, but altogether I'm just not sure if it's a good idea to do it.

Would this ""burn bridges"" or if they wanted me enough to invite me for an on-site, do you think they'd consider postponing a week?

I feel guilty about it. It's an awesome company and I don't want to be disrespectful.

Thanks in advance."

35y3zn,0,2015-05-14,"Junior in college (econ major), take the work study on campus job or gamble with future internship interviews this summer?",pewwpeww12,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/35y3zn/junior_in_college_econ_major_take_the_work_study/,"Hi everyone!        

I am a 3rd year economics student at a top public school in CA. This summer I've been meaning to find an internship, in the business field . I'm not exactly sure what I want to do in the future yet, hopefully go into entrepreneurship one day, since it's really exciting for me!    

I go to a pretty competitive school, so everyone is getting (or has gotten) internships locked down for this summer. I feel kind of like I'm lagging behind since I've gone through a couple of interviews with no success.    

With that being said, the semester is almost over (next week actually). I applied to a work study job on campus last week (part time) for the summer, which pays pretty okay, and I got an offer for it today. They want me to accept by tomorrow. It has to do with financial grants and a little bit of accounting.
However, I got a huge influx of emails from various companies that I applied to a few weeks ago inviting me in for interviews for next week.. last minute hiring I suppose. I'm assuming they'd pay a decent amount IF I'm able to actually even secure one...not sure how likely that would be. :/ I'm not sure what to do in this position. I feel like junior summer is the most important year for experience/internships. Will this on campus job be of any help? It's a 3 month summer PT position that pays 20/hr.    

I am also unsure if I'll even be able to land an internship if I forgo this campus job. Which would leave me kind of screwed. Also, most of the internships are full time positions that will likely have many many rounds of interviews, so I don't think it'd be possible to take the PT campus job AND then interview for the internships after. Should I take the gamble and not take the campus job? Or what should I do? In terms of future prospects, what is better? I'm really lost right now...any words of wisdom? It's really giving me anxiety since my fellow peers have everything locked down in terms of summer plans and I'm here scrambling to find SOMETHING. I'm afraid to be unemployed after I graduate :("
35y5v0,3,2015-05-14,I want to get off the help desk but unsure how to prepare myself,Stimpson_J_Cat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35y5v0/i_want_to_get_off_the_help_desk_but_unsure_how_to/,"I landed my first help desk job last October. First, they had me only supporting their iPad app, a month ago they moved me to the main help desk. It's been a month of trial by fire- trying to learn as I go on the phones. I have no previous tech support skills or knowledge and so far I am learning how little I know about computers/networks/etc. However, I am currently in my second semester for a Computer Networking AAS with a concentration in security. I'm aiming for a network admin job. Its sounds like a mix of all I want, sorta hands on working with some hardware and some security thrown in. I don't want to be confined to a desk all day and I don't want to have a phone strapped to my head all day either. 



Help desk has been a plethora of learning but I feel already burned out with it. I like fixing problems but I'm struggling to tolerate the customers.  Along side the help desk, I still support the iPad app which is used by truck drivers. The drivers are mostly unpleasant and pissed off. They hate the iPads and love to tell me how bad they are (9/10 problems I encounter are user error though). I also am struggling with the fact that I am available for calls for 9 hours straight- calls about literally anything. I'm huge noob but I'm already bored. I either get simple calls to unlock accounts or really complicated stuff I have to escalate to T2 or beyond. So on a regular basis I am bored or frustrated, not really much between. I have really grown a passion for technology in general in this position and am really letting my geek out, but to get off the phones I'll have to be promoted to tier 2 or above. I don't know if I want to set that as a goal or just learn all I can while I'm here but focus on networking over all.  Luckily the company I work for is really good with letting people intern in areas of interest with a high rate of internal hires. 



At this point I am already attempting to plan my escape. I want to be able to put at least a year of help desk on my resume but I want to be ready to intern with the network guys (what department would this specifically be called?) ASAP. I'm interested in learning on my own, I've bought a couple books about the basics to start with and I am open to building a home lab to play with.  Plus schooling, but I'm not scheduled to graduate until 2018.  Also, I am interested in certs however I don't know how they work. Are they something I can just study for or do I need to go in to them with prior ""advanced"" knowledge?



I guess I'm just looking for advice or insight, I'm going to guess my situation is not very unique. I'm prepared to be told I have to work my way through the help desk tiers. In that case I'd learn more about operating systems and applications.

35y75w,117,2015-05-14,"It's two weeks before graduation, I've applied to literally hundreds of companies but I don't have any offers. I don't know what to do.",MusaTheRedGuard,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/35y75w/its_two_weeks_before_graduation_ive_applied_to/,"Hey guys,
So I'm a computer engineering student at a state college in New York with a mediocre GPA. I've posted my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tye56q542pvl31h/Anonymous%20Resume.pdf?dl=0) on here multiple times and have tweaked it to reflect the advice I've been given. 

I decided to take the shotgun approach to applying and I applied(mostly online) to hundreds of jobs in many different industries(big tech companies, biotech, finance, web development, consulting etc). I even got interviews at some pretty awesome places including Bank of America, Google and some trading shops. 

The problem is that I have literally no offers. Zero. Every single place I've applied to has either ghosted on me or rejected me. About half the time I make it to the phone interview stage and rarely I make it to the in person interview. 

I don't think I'm the *worst* programmer in the world, though I certainly could be better. I've had a couple of internships. I've read cracking the coding interview and Skiena's Algorithm design manual. I have(well, had) a few side projects. I go to hackathons to learn and to network. 

It's just hard seeing people talk about multiple 6 figure offers and hearing everyone talk about how there are all these jobs in CS and no one to fill them. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong and the rejections are beginning to get to me. I've started thinking of switching careers or something."
35y7f3,0,2015-05-14,What sort of questions should I absolutely prepare for?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/35y7f3/what_sort_of_questions_should_i_absolutely/,"Sorry, got on a rant, just a little nervous about this.

TL;DR;
I work in desktop support right now, out of the blue the team lead for our LAN admin department called and said there is a position open and he had heard good things so I should apply. Feeling a little overwhelmed about the inevitable interview.



""Environment includes Novell e-Directory, Microsoft Active Directory, and Microsoft Server products utilizing Hewlett Packard blade hardware and EMC storage arrays"" and ""Novell e-Directory, MS Active Directory, Linux, Microsoft server products including IIS and SQL, Veritas Enterprise Backup, Citrix, VMware, and HP blade servers, chassis, and switches""

I finished college 5 years ago, I did an internship during my last year of college, followed by about 4 months of an ""official"" internship. Both involved a lot of active directory work, I still understand the structure, group policy, and fell I can speak knowledgeably on these subjects. Since then though I took a PC support job not finding anything in networking/systems, spent 4 months with a horrible company, found a better paying PC support job after that with a great company and have been doing that for 4/5 years.

I've picked up more responsibility over that time. I manage our squid proxy server. I'm no Linux expert, initially I was just adding sites to the allowed sites config. Since then though the guy that built and managed it quite, and no one else knew anything about it. So I've learned how log rotations work (we had an incident with them filling up) started editing the ACL, learned some basic commands like grep, tail, df, learned out to pipe things together to actually make them useful. I also did most of our MDT config and assist with managing images.

The fact is, I'm under qualified for this, I know it, the interviewer knows it. Only reason I'm applying is because the team lead for this position called me out of the blue and said my name had been brought up for it a couple of times. I even told him on the phone ""I'd love the job and think it would be great but my server knowledge is rusty"" he responded with ""I don't care about that, I'm more worried about your fit with my team, I can teach you anything you don't know""

 Knowing that helps but the last thing I want to do is go in over confident. 

I haven't been looking for a job, I am bored with PC support sometimes but my boss is awesome, and the extra responsibility here and there is enough to keep content. So this is my first interview in 4 or 5 years. I'm in the process of going through my resume right now making sure I can still speak at least semi intelligently and elaborate on every word of it during the interview. "

You really want to know more about what I'm going through?  Fine, but don't come crawling to me asking me to take it all back.  I can't.  As much as I wish I could, I can't.  Just remember, you asked me to keep you updated on my situation.

I think the sedative they gave me (""benzodiazepine"" - whatever that means) is still in my bloodstream.  I can't sleep, but I'm still SO so tired.  So, I apologize to you, if my ramblings seem nonsensical at times - or if I jump around a bit while I try to make sense of everything.

 
I think they may have moved me while I was out of it.  When I woke up a little bit ago, I wasn't in my room.  Well, by my room, I mean the room I've been in for the last nineteen years.  The room that I've had no choice but to call home.  This room was different.  None of my artwork was hanging on the walls.  I don't have a mirror anymore, and there are no windows.  You can imagine the shock of waking up with to light in the room, save the light that shone through the gap between the door and the floor.  I was kind of wigged out at that, and it almost sent me into a panic attack; had it not been for the nurse that came in to check on me.
 

When I tried to sit up, I couldn't.  I couldn't move at all.  They'd restrained me to the bed.  I struggled for a moment to get loose, but the nurse quickly came to my side to relax me a bit.
 

When I asked what was going on, she explained to me that I had to be restrained.  Apparently, throughout the night, I'd been thrashing about so badly, that I'd completely destroyed my other room.  The mirror was broken, the furniture was disrupted, and it was just a wholly mess.  I had cuts, burns, scratches and bruises all over my body.  They assumed that I did it.  But, I'm pretty sure I didn't.  I think I know who - or WHAT did.
 

After she let me out of my straps, I needed to take a minute to gather my thoughts.  She'd said I'd been in and out of sleep for nearly twenty-three hours.  A whole day?  Everything was so intense.  I didn't know what to make of any of it.  The dreams were so vivid.

 
I remember the dreams, clearly.  Please just bear with me while I try to process everything.  You are my pillars of support and I look to you to help me through this.  I know. I'm rambling.  I blame the sedative - and my high stress levels - and the fact that I haven't been laid since I was a teenager.

 
The dreams - get back on track... the dreams.
 

The first dream started off great.  I remember thinking to myself, I really needed this after the day I was having.  Have you ever done that? Consciously had thoughts within a dream?  Anyway, I was flirting with the one intern who'd often monitored my sessions with Doctor Shaw.  Sure, she was literally half my age, but she was legal - and adorably cute.  Though, after a few minutes of flirting and watching her smile fade, everything changed.  She started to rub her forehead a little, as if she had a headache, but then it got worse.  The blood tears streamed from her eyes, and both hands reached for her head as if to squeeze the pain away.
 

When she stumbled, I reached out to help her - I turned to look for another doctor to help, but no one was around.  When I looked back, she was standing upright with both hands on her head, and glass embedded in her skin.  I remember my heart felt like it sank deep in my chest as I watched her fall to the floor, dead, for the second time.
 

I dropped to my knees looking down at her to see if there was anything I could do to save her this time.  But there was nothing.  Before I could stand back up, to turn to face my demon that I knew was responsible, I was grabbed by the arm, and she stared at me.  No.  She stared INTO me.

 
I struggled to break free from her grasp, but she wasn't letting go.  She dug her nails into my arm as the pain shot through my body.  But, it wasn't the normal pain you'd feel.  It burned.  Literally BURNED.  The smell of my burning flesh from the puncture wounds filled my nostrils and I remember my eyes beginning to water.
 

I looked back at her, and she had those eyes; those gray-glazed eyes.  Her face, now a pale gray with sunken features, peered into me.  That's when I heard the voices - whispering my name repeatedly and out of sync.  As they got louder, her nails - now claws, dug deeper into my arm.  My veins began to show through my skin; painfully pulsating and turning colors that I didn't think were possible.
 

As I screamed out in pain, I remember waking up dripping with sweat.  I reached for my arm.  It was warm and wet.  I was afraid to look - but I knew.  I knew all too well.

 
I flopped back on my pillow to try to catch my breath.  I must have fallen asleep again, because the next dream came almost instantly.
 

It was great to see Doctor Shaw again, alive and counseling me in his usual fashion, but I wasn't me.  I was looking at me.  I knew it was me, because I know what I look like.  Though, never from this point of view.  I was in the monitoring room, on the other side of the glass.  I looked around the room and noticed all of the monitoring equipment, the blinking lights, the video feed, my intern counterpart.  She looked good - even from this angle.
 

I noticed myself - my other self, getting impatient and irritated with Doctor Shaw.  He glanced my way for a moment, and back to the other me, sitting and fidgeting in that seat.  I remember the feeling I got when everything culminated to that point when everything just... happened.

 
This was the moment.  But something seemed a little off.  It was as if everything had slowed down, and I was watching an instant replay of some sporting event.  I remember imagining a scoreboard at the top of the room: Home - 0 , Demons - 1, then 2, then 3, then 10, and so on.
 

Everything from that moment on was exactly as it had happened, but this time, I could see ""everything"".  In the split seconds, I watched the room begin to vibrate as colors began to bleed and run together, books falling off the shelf - everything as it happened before.
 

But this time, I finally saw him... the root cause of all this commotion.  I watched the other me's aura change from a deep blue, to a dark purple, and then red - slowly, I watched something pass through the other me and manifest itself behind me, pulling the red aura from my other body with it.  And that was the key.  They DID feed off my energy.
 

As he began to take form, he was HUGE, but he was still a blur, and I could almost make out the features of his ill-shaped body.

 
In slow motion, I watched this blur pass around the room, stopping momentarily in front of the window and pointing to me.  I could feel this pressure building up inside my chest, as if it were about to explode - but with a wave of his hand the window slowly cracked in every square inch and began to pull inward toward us - the interns.  I could see the glass begin to make it's way toward my face and I felt myself being pulled backward as the demon kept moving around the room and back toward the other me, but instead of returning to the other me, he pushed forward and entered Doctor Shaw.

 
The glass finally made contact with my body, as I felt the solid wall behind me. I remember everything fading to white as Doctor Shaw began contorting into that folded mess on the floor.
 

When I woke back up, briefly,  my body was in pain, all over.  The nurses must have bandaged me up.  I could see someone clearing a path through the mess in my room.  I looked up at the nurse who was administering an IV, and then I went black.

 
I don't think I can take much more of this.  I know, now, that I have to keep going - but to what end?  When does it stop?  When I'm dead?  When I've brought about the apocalypse?  How many other people are going through what I am?  Have they reached that point where the only option left is to put a bullet in their mouth?  Or will their inner demon ultimately rip them to shreds?
 

If that's the case, will they even know it's happened?
 

Everything about this last dream was wrong on so many levels.  I can't even begin to describe everything I saw.  It was too graphic, even for me to try to explain it to you.  But I'm going to do my best.  I just hope that my story finds it's way to the right people.  I can't do this alone.
 

I know.  I'm rambling again.  And, I'm sorry.
 

So, yeah.  This last dream.  While I can't explain every gory detail, I will try to stick with as much as I can without making anyone as uneasy as I am, trying to recount it.
 

I found myself in a dimly lit hallway.  What lights were on, were flickering and buzzing with each flicker.  In the distance, I could hear a sort of tapping sound - maybe it was more of a clicking - echoing down the hallway.  I turned to walk away, maybe back to my new room, where I knew I could wake up and be somewhat safe, but there was no where to go.  Behind me was a concrete wall.

 
I knew what was waiting for me in the other direction; him.  Sadly, I had no choice but to move forward.  Up ahead, I could barely make out what looked like bodies strewn across the floor.  As I got closer, I could tell they were the bodies of several security guards; some of them, I knew.  Their bodies were twisted and mangled, broken and bleeding.

 
I carefully stepped over them - out of respect for the dead, and for fear of one of them grabbing on to me like that intern.  I don't think I could have taken another encounter like that, again.

 
The clicking sound in the hallway was getting louder as I got closer to the end of the hallway.  It sounded like... a clock.  As I reached the end of the hallway, I confirmed - that it was, indeed, a clock; a wall-mounted clock with a cage covering it's glass face.  It read 3:23 before it stopped.  It just stopped.  And, now, there was silence, save the electrical buzzing sounds that coincided with the flickering of the lights.
 

I turned around to see the distance I'd walked, which appeared to look like miles, but I know it was only a few hundred feet - as it only took me a few moments to reach the end.  When I turned back around, that's where I met him.

 
Finally, we were face to face for the first time.  I was frozen with fear and he knew it.  Those gray-glazed eyes stared at me with delight, as if he was happy to see me - like we were long lost friends and he'd been searching for me for centuries.  His ill-shaped body lurched at me with an outstretched hand.

 
I jumped back, almost stumbling over my own feet.  His hand... his claw caught me by my shirt and just barely grabbed the skin underneath.  It burned.  Much like that of the intern's grip, it burned a lot.  But it did not pierce my skin.  Instead, it stretched my skin to match that of my shirt.  MY GOD! HE HAD ME BY THE SKIN OF MY CHEST!
 

He wrapped his fingers tightly around it, as he did with my shirt.  The burning pain was intense - feeling the stretching of my skin around his fingers. He pulled me closer; dragging me by the chest until we were again, face to face.  I could feel his hot breath on my face.  He sneered at me.  His misshapen lips curled upward in a tight smile.  The same smile that he gave me when he possessed Doctor Shaw.  I felt nauseous.  I wanted to vomit.
 

I thought this was it.  I thought this was how I was going to die; facing my demon.  I struggled to get free, but it only caused him to tighten his grip on me.  He hoisted me up and held me out at arms length, as I was just dangling there - helpless gripping his forearm tightly with both hands; still trying to break free.
 

The demon.  MY demon, reached up with his other hand and placed it on my forehead.  I was expecting the same burning sensation, but instead, it was cool to the touch.  That moment of relief only lasted for a fraction of a second - as a new type of pain pulsed through my body.  A flood of visions entangled my brain, as I saw everything; everything from my childhood, my teen years, and every encounter I've had with other entities, places I've never been, but places I never wanted to ever see - I saw others like HIM, and what they once were - human.
 

I saw pain and suffering.  I saw others; like me.  Conduits.  Gateways.  I saw hell.  I saw the end.

 
I felt a flood of emotions, pain, and tears.  Before I could react, he removed his hand from my head and dropped me on the floor.  I collapsed, instantly - when I looked up to see my adversary again, he'd vanished.  And I woke up; restrained to the bed, until my nurse friend came to set me free... free.
 

And, now, here I am trying to make heads or tails of all this.  I don't think I can do this anymore.  I need to leave before they find me, before anyone else gets hurt.  I need to GO!"
35zbzr,9,2015-05-14,Unsure about my undergrad experience so far.,oakles,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/35zbzr/unsure_about_my_undergrad_experience_so_far/,"I just finished up my 2nd year as a CS undergrad at CU Boulder and overall I can definitely say that I've been enjoying my time learning CS. Programming itself is really fun to learn and with the conclusion of my most recent classes, I also love learning about CS related concepts outside of coding.

As these 2 years have gone by I've managed to get A's in all CS courses I've taken: Intro to Programming, Data Structures, Discreet Structures, and Computer Systems (assembly/concepts about memory/etc.). That being said, I have a feeling that I don't *really* know what I'm doing. I can do well on tests and assignments but if given some abstract project with little to no instruction I feel like I wouldn't even know where to start.

Is this a normal feeling for a student at this point in their undergrad? I'm starting at a software development internship next week so I'm hoping that can provide me with some more confidence as a programmer and give me a feel of what CS is like outside of university. Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

35zton,5,2015-05-14,Go back to university for a second Bachelor's Degree or chuff it out in the job market?,thoreauaway2,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/35zton/go_back_to_university_for_a_second_bachelors/,"Okay, here's an overview. I currently have a Bachelor's Degree in Education with a major in Social Studies out of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I am a 23-year old man with a girlfriend who I live with (and two cats, if that helps). I'm debating going back to school to get a 3-year Bachelor of Computer Science degree.

My Bachelor's Degree has taken me 5 years to get. I took two semesters off because I was exhausted, and really having doubts about my major. The first year of university was absolutely awesome, and I loved courses like Anthropology and Sociology. One of my friends died before the start of the second year, and I was quite depressed. I broke up with my girlfriend, did a bunch of drugs, and we got back together. Although my personal life got back on track, I realized that I wasn't a huge fan of my university path (Education).

I basically spent the last few years of my degree just trying my best to get through it so that ""at the very least I would have a degree"". To be honest, this plan hasn't panned out very well, and, six months after finishing the program, I'm just as lost as I was when I finished.

I tried working in a more trades-type job (a dangerous goods hauler), but I didn't like the hours or the treatement there. It paid alright, but I felt it was degrading my mental health, so I quit. Currently, I have an internship with a company unrelated to my degree, which is just about to end.

I've been interested in pursuing a Computer Science degree, however. I talked to a representative at the university, and she said it would probably be really difficult for me to come back, seeing as how they mostly accept new students instead of students with a second degree.

I've set myself a schedule of studying programming concepts for the next four months, but have been kind of losing motivation because of my confusion over how I should proceed. 

Here are some of the positives of my position:       
1. I know that I don't need a particular career to be happy. I have my girlfriend, and my cats, and a handful of good friends and family. I'm very grateful for the people I have in my life.            
2. I know that many people go back to school in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, so it is not an immediate necessity for me to ""figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life"".      
3. I have enough money coming in for next month's rent, which gives me time to go apply to a temp agency if I am still having troubles.      

Here are some of the negatives of my position:
1. I currently have 20k in Student debt. It is not a ton, but it is still enough to be hanging over my head. 
2. Time is ticking, and I feel like I have to make a decision to go back to school quickly before my loans kick in (which should be in about a month, if I decide not to go back).

I basically have two options:
**Go into teaching**
1. I would basically have to slog through being a substitute, as I am unable to move outside of our crowded city with so many teachers. The real jobs are in the country, but it doesn't interest me to move.     

2. It might take me a long time to get an actual dedicated teaching position, but the drop-out rate for teachers is that 50% leave in the first 5 years. Do I want to put in all this effort into something I don't really want to wake up and do for the rest of my life?

3. I was a really good teacher (I think), and finally got my groove in the classroom. The pay is pretty good as well, if you stick it out (I met two teachers maxed out at 100k). That is pretty fantastic pay, really, and might excuse the general awfulness that comes with teaching. 

4. I don't like the ""hoo-rah!"" over-exaggerated nature of teaching. I'm much more of a university-style teacher. I like to stay in my classroom as my little den, and teach in my style. I'm not too into putting in tons of effort on top of the effort that comes with my lesson-planning. 

**Computer Science**
1. It's something new, and I don't hate it. At the very least, I love being in university, and I would enjoy the next few years of studying instead of working. Things like infinite recursion are fascinating to me-- I love [Gödel, Escher, and Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach). I initially was into programming in my teens as a hobby video game maker, but every kid and his dog want to become video game designers, so it seems to be an extremely competitive market. 

2. It seems like this is a very lucrative career choice with, what I've heard, to be more jobs than there are people to fill them. I don't think I'd really mind Network Administrator or general programmer at all, although I lean towards the programming side. 

3. I really don't have a hell of a lot of experience with computers, and still have basic layman problems. I could probably move past this, but I fear that this career choice is just a diversion away from facing the real world.    

**Tl; dr: 
my question to you is, do you think I should pursue teaching with my existing degree, or go for one in Computer Science?**

360h7e,3,2015-05-14,Thinking of turning down a seemingly amazing job offer. Am I a complete idiot?,RunThePack,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/360h7e/thinking_of_turning_down_a_seemingly_amazing_job/,"I decided to leave my current job to pursue some specialty training in my field (veterinary medicine). This training does not require a residency per se but does require a year or two of hands-on experience and certification through specialty institutions.

I've been offered two positions. Both will provide me with the opportunity to achieve my professional goals. I'm struggling with my gut instinct to take the one that pays less and is at a lower-profile (but still excellent) clinic, and need someone to either tell me that yes I'm being an idiot and should take the ""amazing"" option, or no, I should trust my gut on this and stick with my decision. Here are the basics of the two offers:

One is an internship at a small clinic in a small town. Clinic feels like a home, not a hospital. Support staff work their tail off and are very proactive and great with clients. I pretty much want to BE the owner/head vet - she's amazing. She is an adjunct prof at local vet school as well so I feel confident that she can mentor - her associate (who is fantastic too!) also has great things to say about owner and their team relationship. The hours are very reasonable. The pay would be a huge pay cut. HUGE. But just for 1 year, then there's the option to move on, or come on board as a full time associate with full time salary. I am allowed &amp; encouraged to pick up emergency shifts locally to make extra $ and see different types of cases to complement what they can teach me. Town is 20 mins from the beach and 30-40 mins from a city ranked in the top 75 ""cities to start a career in"" by Forbes magazine. Cost of living is next to nothing and I can walk or bike to work if I live in town (I currently commute 70-100 miles a day!!!)

Second option is in a big sprawling city (ranked in the low 100s on the Forbes list I just mentioned). I would split my time between a superb emergency clinic where I would be salaried as a part time employee but have to work 12 hour shifts including a proportion of overnight graveyard shifts. The other part time would be in a clinic doing my specialty training, initially on an hourly wage, transitioning to full time in the specialty clinic on an appropriate salary/wage as I complete my certifications and improve my hands-on skills. In 1.5-2 years they would put me in charge of my own specialty clinic at one of their satellite locations across the country, likely in a SoCal town where I have a large social circle. I really like one of the Drs at the specialty clinic but did not get along great with the other. The ER clinic is incredible and I would learn a ton there and in particular have a great surgery mentoring program. This would require a long-term commitment up front to the company, and I'd have to be willing to move wherever they needed me in a couple of years (hopefully CA but not set in stone). The cost of living would be somewhat more than the first clinic but the money would be proportionally higher and a full benefits package included. It seems like the company takes VERY good care of their employees and the majority of them seemed happy to be working there.

This second offer feels like a ""Lean In,"" power-career move, in the sense that I would be around a lot of high-powered people and it would end up with me heading my own satellite clinic... And I'm genuinely considering turning it down in favor of the first. Part of it is commitment-phobia. Part of it is not knowing for sure where they would send me. Part of it is this deep desire to have the chance to SLOW DOWN and live very simply and work on my personal and ""spiritual"" development for a while, but still have the opportunity to accomplish my professional goals. I've gone through a LOT of turmoil in my personal life in the last 5 years and I really want less chaos, not more. I'm not convinced that living in a big, crazy city is conducive to that. Part of it is just that I'm not really in love with the big city clinic, even though I think it would be a great career move and learning opportunity.

Am I being an idiot? Please advise.

FWIW: I have one person in each location who is very very dear to my heart, so I would have emotional support and a friendly face no matter where I ended up. I have lived 3k miles away from my parents since 1999 and both options will put me much closer to them in areas with great airports."
360q8g,2,2015-05-14,Do I drop out of yoga teacher training?,bestofbatman,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/360q8g/do_i_drop_out_of_yoga_teacher_training/,"**TLDR** I'm in a yoga teacher training program that is not enjoyable and is sucking out all of my time, but if I drop out my parents lose their money and I become a quitter

A little background:

I'm eighteen and just finished classes at my high school. At my school, every senior finishes classes the first week of May and spends the rest of the month completing an independent study project until we graduate in June. For my ISP I wanted to become a certified yoga teacher. However, the program that my studio offers was only on weekends so I decided to intern with my yoga teacher (who owns the studio) on the weekdays in May. I have been practicing for two years and it's helped me relieve stress and increase my strength and flexibility. Needless to say, I LOVE yoga. Also, this is my last summer with my high school friends. We're so close that they're basically like a second family and I want to spend as much time this summer with them as physically possible. Furthermore, I am rarely a quitter. I am a very ""when the going gets tough the tough gets going"" kind of person and have always been very determined.



The Problem:

The yoga teacher training program that my studio offers was originally supposed to be every other weekend from 10-4 on Saturday and Sunday. However, there was a problem with scheduling and it was condensed to every weekend (with the exception of a few holidays). The program started in mid April and after the first couple of weekends, I realized that I may have bit off more than I could chew. I found the teacher training sessions to be a bit boring and they were extremely time consuming. My mother, who financed this teacher training, said that I should at least stick it out until the end of May so that my yoga teacher will still let me work with her on the weekdays. I thought this was a great plan and I have been sticking it out, but the end of May is coming up quickly so now I have to make a decision.

My reasons to drop out:

* it is extremely time consuming
* this is my last summer with my high school friends and boyfriend but I can't spend any time with them because my weekends are full from teacher training (my boyfriend recently got mad at me because I don't have much time for him due to this teacher training)
*   I DREAD going to these sessions. I am miserable just thinking about them
* Because I don't like the sessions, I've partially lost my love for yoga 
* I can always complete another teacher training program when I'm older and have less going on
* I will be working full time over summer so I won't have much time on the weekdays for anything
* I can still be a yoga fanatic without being a teacher
* After my ISP is over there are still 2 more months of this training

My reasons to stick with the training:

* My parents will not get their money back (my mom said that she's fine with it if it's what I really want, but still)
* I wouldn't be a quitter
* I love the idea of being able to spread yoga to other people
* Yoga teachers are some of the coolest people I know
* My certification would never expire so I would never have to do this again
* It is something that always wows people when I tell them that I'm becoming a certified yoga teacher
* It is something different and interesting to put on my resume   
* After my ISP is over there are only 8 more weekends in the training  


I would really appreciate any and all advice! Thanks!"

Here's a bit of my story.

**Education:** In high school, I attended a military academy, and was involved with Army JROTC as well as a program known as the Civil Air Patrol, a civilian auxiliary of the USAF.

I was on a good track to attend West Point, but decided to halt my application process during the end of my junior year for personal reasons. At the beginning of my junior year I became the manager and head instructor at a martial arts studio. After recovering from a back injury and graduating high school with a 4.4 GPA, I was employed as a manager and head instructor of another studio in my city. I focused on teaching for two years before another back injury slowed me down, when I started attending the local community college. I continued to teach when I was physically able to and graduated with an AS in Business Administration and a 3.85 GPA.

After community college, I transferred to the University of Florida to study finance. During my time there I joined a coed business fraternity (Delta Sigma Pi), helped launch a leadership development and education program under the business college's Center for Career and Leadership Development (CCLD), became a mentor for another CCLD program, and founded an organization to help new transfer students acclimate to life at UF. I also took classes in both German and Mandarin Chinese, because I love learning languages and studying different cultures.

Unfortunately, a mixture of lots of extracurricular involvement and test anxiety that I developed during my first semester, I graduated with only a 3.15 GPA, with my major GPA being a 3.3.

I know that I am more capable than my UF GPA would have employers and B schools believe, as I am able to apply the knowledge gained in my major coursework as well as or better than my peers in the finance program.

**Professional:** I have completed two internships with a wealth management firm, where I primarily worked as a data analyst who helped recommend improvements to both domestic and foreign business operations. I have accepted an offer with the firm and will be working as a market forecaster and sales material writer for their institutional investing group.

**Future:** I have plans to take the level 1 CFA exam in December (if funds permit), and am continuing to study Mandarin Chinese in my free time. I've toyed with the idea of pursuing the Certificate Program in Finance online at UC Berkeley, but I'm not sure about that yet. I'm also planning on getting involved with the Civil Air Patrol again as an adult, and am currently working on developing a program for leadership education and development geared toward high school students. In 2-3 years, I also plan on looking for a job in Shanghai so that I can have a chance to gain exposure to Mandarin in everyday life.

**Questions:**

1) I know my UF GPA is very low (3.15 overall, 3.3 major), would either passing the CFA level 1 and 2 exams, or completing the Certificate in Finance from UC Berkeley help me show greater academic capability? What can I do to overcome this? Also, will B schools look at both GPAs from UF and my community college?

2) Are there any additional things that I should consider involving myself with to make myself a more attractive candidate for B schools?

3) I've not really considered B school until recently, so should I take the GMAT sooner rather than later? Or does it not matter *when* I take it, so long as I get a competitive score?


Any help would be appreciated! Go Gators!"

361wli,37,2015-05-15,Australian moving to Augsburg,Turville,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/361wli/australian_moving_to_augsburg/,"Guten tag!

I'm an engineering student moving to Augsburg for at least a year for an internship at at Fujitsu. I'm moving out from my parents place in Victoria and have so many questions and concerns, but i'm very excited to leave. I don't have a specific question just a giant lack of information that I would love anyone and everyone to help me be more prepared for the big move. As I said I am moving out from home so even if your advice is general and not specifically related to Germany its still very appreciated!

Some areas of concern are:

* Clothes. My wardrobe sucks, should I buy before I leave or buy there? What basics do I need to have.
* Accommodation. I have a place recommended for around 260 euro a month, although there's no photos. Its really hard to decide where I would like to live in Augsburg, especially when there isn't google street view in most of Germany. I will be earning under 1000 euro a month, and I assume I would want to have a room alone, but I feel I may get lonely, as I'm not super outgoing and don't have a lot of physical hobbies. 
* What to bring? Obviously clothes, phone, laptop. I'm a nerd and have a good gaming computer, I don't really want to ship it as it will be annoying and costly, I've considered packing the vital and expensive parts in my luggage and buying the big parts in Germany and rebuilding it.

Thanks heaps for you input and information!

EDIT: Wow this received heaps more attention than I was hoping for, thanks everyone for your comments, you're all so very helpful! I feel a lot more comfortable about the move already :D"

-Can't access SMB share from Finder on Max OS X 10

-Error Message:

There was a problem connecting to the server ""Tower"". The server may not exist or it is unavailable at this time. Check the server name or IP address, check your network connection, and try again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Steps Leading Up to the Problem**

-Previously was using UnRaid v5.06 trial. Filled my 2nd data drive so Pro key it is.

-Might as well ""update"" to v6.0b, formatted flash &amp; loaded v6.0b &amp; Pro.key to it

-SMB was working fine on same flash drive each time

-Started &amp; finished transferring in data from a 4 TB network drive

-Shutdown etc to insert freshly precleared 6 TB WD Red

-Now unable to get SMB working. No apparent errors from UnRaid server. Always get these errors in Finder
[error 1](http://i.imgur.com/c7LeKxK.jpg)
[error 2](http://i.imgur.com/AsfxSFY.png)

-Next drive (2 TB) was NTFS-formatted, so I shutdown/etc and mounted with SNAP

-Still unable to get SMB working. Same deal

-Did internal copy via SNAP

-Shutdown/etc to remove 2 TB drive, start up, nothing.

-All sorts of SMB/NFS/AFP configuration attempts. 

-Currently AFP is working, but I can't see individual drives. Just the Share as a whole. Is this a bug/feature of AFP?

**Attempted Solutions**

-Connect via root/(blank), test user test/testa, Mac OS X username/password (registered user)

-smb://Tower/

-smb://Tower/Media

-smb://192.168.1.100

4 TB WD Green (UnRaid disk3)

6 TB WD Red (UnRaid disk4)

4 TB WD Green (UnRaid disk5)

*note this drive is weird. 3-4 years ago I was trying to format the 250 GB WD Blue above for my old Xbox and selected this drive by mistake. It physically has 2 TB of storage, but the program I used really, really messed the drive up at a super low level, so it now only reports as 250 GB. No amount of wiping, partitioning, new volumes, etc has fixed it. The IT guy at my old internship was even stumped. Shouldn't matter here, but full disclosure I guess.

36229e,3,2015-05-15,Didn't get the internship I wanted- now what?,5DollarLunchSpecial,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/36229e/didnt_get_the_internship_i_wanted_now_what/,"Hey guys.

I'm a 3rd year student, about to be my fourth and final year in the fall. Finance is my major. I go to a small local university kind of in the middle of nowhere, accredited business program, but not really well known at all. I switched to finance my second year and wish that I had pursued more internships in that field. My resume is rather all over the place, with only one internship at a major company. I am fairly passionate about finance, mostly investment banking, but specifically micro-financing. I studied international finance in Spain for a semester as well.

This past semester (Spring 2015) I applied to various places to be a summer intern at, roughly 20, all in the major city near me (Philadelphia) so I have a good amount of competition with other students who go to more well known Universities.

Out of the places I applied, two got back to me and they were the two that I actually really wanted in the first place. I believe I interview really well, I have an ok suit, a padfolio full of notes about the company and the people interviewing me, and overall a good attitude. I shook hands with everyone and sent a follow up email thanking them for their time.

A week and a half have gone by and I haven't gotten back from either of them, pretty much calling it that I didn't get it.

I'm pretty devastated about it, as I was really counting on these internships to improve my career and increase my skill sets, especially because Junior going into Senior year summer is most important for internships. I have always gotten jobs I've interviewed for and ultimately that mindset was my downfall.

So now I'm not sure what to do. I really want to make the most of this summer as far as furthering my career. What should I do? Most summer internships have already been filled.

I work a crappy retail job right now that I have been working at through school just to pay the bills. I have an internship at a large financial service firm as a wealth consultant intern in the Fall, am a Level 1 CFA candidate, and am taking a financial modeling course through Wall Street Prep. But I feel that those things won't be enough to compete well in this industry once I graduate in June 2016. Which is why I am asking what kind of things should I do this summer, to improve my career path? Is there anything you guys would personally recommend?

I recently interviewed for a big company and was excited to hear that they offered me a year long internship for a development position. They mentioned at the end of the interview that I would be put into automated testing to understand the product and once I am able to do that job, will be given development work. I was ok with that as I would still be able to learn a lot. 

Now, I know I have been here only a short time (~2 weeks) but I am starting to get the feeling that they may of not been completely truthful. The interns that are currently here said they were given some coding work after ~8-9 months of testing but it was small bug fixes here and there. This got me a little worried because I decided to take a year long internship so I could learn and know more about the field that I want to do. So far, its just been me being trained on how to do the testing work. What really got me worried/sad however was when yesterday, my supervisor told me that they think I would be perfect to work with the clients as a customer support, this way I can better learn the product. My heart sunk here, it made me feel like all that I am doing is a mistake and will waste a year of my life. 

I tried talking to my coop office at school but they just told me I signed a contract and leaving early would leave a bad reputation for the school at the job.

I would like ask for some some advice from people that have went through a similar situation or someone that can offer some insight on what they think I should do.

 Should I try looking for another internship for the fall/next year? or is leaving early going to look bad to future employers.
 
 Should I wait a while before talking to my manager or should I let them know my concerns now (even though I have only been here for 2 weeks)

 or any advice really would be amazing. 

Thanks for all the help anyone can offer

There are now 2 positions available that go along the lines of my internship. Should I wait for them to say something about it, or should I bring it up?

My question is, what do I tell the CEO that i'm interested? How do I starting this conversation? Should I mention anything now or wait till it's closer to the end of my internship? Also, I do feel like my co-workers like me and want me to stay. It feels like a good fit. It's not just hopeful thinking.
Before I came here I was working in IT. So since i've been interning here, i've made a lot of upgrades changes to co-workers PCs/Laptops and they were very appreciative. Also helped a lot with troubleshooting issues with other things.... i.e. printer, wifi, network, pc issues. This is not my main responsibility as an intern, but definitely helps. So I know co-workers are appreciative of me.
How do I bring up the subject of transitioning into full time with my CEO? or should I talk to my supervisor before bring it up with the CEO?

It is .NET development in C# which has been fun but can get boring at times. I always had a passion for embedded systems software and working with microcontrollers,VHDL, assembly and such in labs when I was in school. My favorite classes were always the digital electronics courses like Digital Systems Design with Programmable Logic and theory of digital systems, and especially Microprocessor Systems (I did not enjoy much of the analog courses). My salary is in the mid 60k range which I feel is rather low, even though the area has a pretty low cost of living and I feel like with my degree I should be able to earn much more. I really want to gain experience in the embedded systems area that would help land a job in that field some time down the line. I am not in a hurry since I have a stable, stress free job and like the people I work with, but I would like to take advantage of the free time I have now so that when I am ready to start looking for something new I have something to talk about besides the more high level software experience I am gaining at my current position. I did not have any internship experience but I worked through college (unrelated field) and had an opportunity come up that allowed me to very briefly work with .NET which helped me land my current job.
I feel like while I am learning at my current position it is not as fulfilling as I would like, and that is important to me. I have an arduino, a rasp pi, I have some digital and analog components lying around but I have never worked on a meaningful project. I feel like I should invest in an embedded systems dev kit but I don’t know what I would do with it. What could I build and use? and have fun with? To sum things up, I feel like I learned a lot in school and I would like to exercise what I have learned in the real world to help me transition over to something closer to CompE (what I majored in) rather than continue the CompSci/Software Dev route.

I'll be going into my 3rd year after the summer, DIT Computer Science. Looking for a company to internship with over the summer before I start back, if anyone here is looking or interested shoot me a mail. I've looked at jobs.ie and the like, got to the interview stage with Google but no luck this time. Will try again in a few months. Doesn't have to be paid, only return is providing knowledge. I was selected by DIT to develop the brand new college app on iOS and Android with 4 other guys. I'm on the Android side of the team. Will be doing that over the summer so project wise I'm good. An internship would be a great addition. Don't waste my time, serious only; no web stuff. Cheers."

Only a couple months ago I finally got over my anxiety and began applying for software development positions. I recently got an offer for the summer for a company that will remain nameless. its not a top company like microsoft, etc, but its a well established company doing work that i think is pretty cool.

The thing is, they're offering 12$ an hour which feels like a slap in the face. I know students with half of my course work getting paid triple that, and even though I got an offer it feels like I failed.

I'd like to continue looking for internships, and even had lined up an interview for a couple weeks from now before hearing back today, but I also really want to have *something* this summer, which means I may just have to accept this one anyway.

Should I just accept it? Is the experience gained going to be so valuable that I shouldn't really worry too much?

Will this affect my ability to get a high paying job out of undergrad?"
3648o4,91,2015-05-15,Spare Change,powerhawkmash,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3648o4/spare_change/,"This is a true story. I know they're all true, but this one actually happened to me. 

I used to work at a gas station in Pennsylvania. Even posted a story about it a while back on /r/nosleep. Different night. 

It was a very rural area, maybe ten minutes from the West Virginia border. A lot of hicks came through. The people were all rednecks, minus the odd guy in a suit. The better dressed you were, the more out of place you looked. But they were pretty nice for the most part. I got to know a lot of the regulars, and it was the type of town where if someone left you with a bag of change to pay for their cigarettes, and said, ""It's all there,"" you didn't have to make them wait around while you counted it. Honest, hard working people.

There were a couple guys riding around knocking off liquor stores and gas stations a couple towns over. Nothing crazy, no one got killed or anything. These things just happened from time to time and I knew they would get caught over some dumb mistake like they always did. It was far enough away that I didn't really worry about it, even working nights alone.

Around the same time, a kid went missing. When I say kid, I mean about my age. I was 19 or 20 at the time I think. Stuff like that happened too. Not that you expected it or that it wasn't tragic, but it happened. A lot of drugs came through that town, and sometimes young people would try to step up and be people they weren't, and they'd get caught up in stuff that led to them being found in the river. It wasn't common, maybe once a year or so, but it wasn't unheard of. This kid's name was Adam. I didn't know him, never heard of him until I saw him on the news. Didn't really give him much thought after either. 

Anyway, it was a hot night in the summer. I was home from college on break, not having found an internship to make my pending English degree look a little less laughable. It was a slow night. One of the regulars came in, Miss Rhonda. Older lady, huge and obese, very kind and loved to talk. Since it was slow we chatted. Just everyday stuff, small talk about the weather and the new municipal building they were going to put in next to the high school.

She mentioned the kid Adam, but I didn't really have a whole lot to say about him. ""Yeah, it's a shame kids still mess with that stuff,"" I said as I grabbed her a pack of reds. Like I said, we all figured he got behind on a package of heroin or lost a couple bottles of vicodin that belonged to the wrong guy. Really not much to say beyond that.

Miss Rhonda left me a plastic bag full of change mixed with a couple gold Sacagaweas. I never needed to count her change, it was always right. I don't know why she didn't roll it at the bank, would have made it easier on her and me. She could have left and I would have cut the bag open later and put it in the register. She was poor, but she knew how to count out $6.35 and she never missed. Since it was slow she stayed and I counted it right there.

""Damn shame how they let the drugs get so out of control around here. Probably save a lot of lives if the cops would do their damn jobs."" She wasn't dropping it, but it didn't really bother me. She just wanted someone to talk to on her smoke run. I counted up the change and for the first time ever, she was off. An extra gold dollar somehow found its way into the bag and I handed it back to her.

""Oh you keep it, honey, you don't know when you might need it,"" she said. There was a kind of dark tone to her voice, very uncharacteristic. She seemed to suddenly be in a rush and left.

It wasn't uncommon for people to tell me to keep the change. Even give me tips from time to time. It was usually a couple bucks when they won their scratch offs. At another job I might have taken it as an insult, a dollar tip. But these people didn't have much, and honestly me grabbing her a pack of cigarettes didn't really warrant a tip in the first place, so I put it in my pocket without a second thought.

The rest of the night went by normally. I sold cigarettes, lottery tickets, and gas. There were no break ins, no thefts, really nothing for me to do but wait until ten o'clock.

The sun set and I waited around. It was unusually slow, but some nights were just like that. By the time closing came, I was more than ready to get out of there.

Part of the job was counting up the registers and doing some basic accounting for my shift. I added everything up, and it really had been a slow night. We did like $800 in sales while I was there, which if you've never worked at a gas station, is nothing. I counted the safe drops, added them up, then started on the register, which if you're doing your drops right, should be less than $100. It came out to $79, just short of the $80 or so the accounting sheet showed I should have.

""Goddamnit"" I muttered to myself. I was usually right on. The managers honestly didn't care if you were a couple bucks off. Really anything less than $20 was considered something they could figure out in the morning. But I was always picky about it. Especially on such a slow night, there's no reason I should have been off at all. 

I remembered the gold dollar Miss Rhonda told me to keep, and I figured it would only be right to throw it in with the rest, since I didn't really earn it anyway. 

I pulled out the coin and just as I realized it wasn't a Sacagawea, four cop cars rushed into the parking lot, lights and sirens on, surrounding the place.

My first thought was, ""Fuck, I triggered the alarm."" I had already closed up and the lights were off, so that had to be it. But the cops got out, guns drawn, and swarmed the back of the building. Didn't even glance in the window at me as far as I could tell. I just stood rooted to the spot, too scared to even duck down in case they started shooting.

I must have stood in place for a solid five minutes, not moving. I guess I was just waiting for something to happen. When the shock wore off, I started around the counter, to go out front and talk to the one or two that were still left in their cars, when I saw them.

The cops were leading two guys from around back, handcuffed. They had long hair that looked like it could use a wash, one of them had a bandana. Their shirts were dirty and torn beyond what you end up with from being shoved face down in the dirt. One of them looked up at me before returning his eyes to to the ground. I'd been around long enough to recognize what gave him that face though. Pillheads, probably longtime users. 

I still just kind of stood there, not really sure what had happened.  The police started taping up the area before I could even ask my first question. One of the off duty cops brought me aside with a notepad and must have asked me for a personal history on every single person I saw that night. They brought an ambulance and for some reason, one of the EMTs tried to me in a blanket like I was the victim of a catastrophe. It was literally like ninety degrees outside so I pushed it off me and spit it out. ""What's going on here?""

The cop looked at his partner and they both kind of shook their heads, dead serious like you see cops act before they give someone bad news. They explained to me that the guys they picked up out back were the ones who they'd been looking for in connection with all the robberies. They got a tip that they were spotted in town and someone saw them pull in here. They assumed I was the one they talked to earlier but I didn't know what they were talking about. Whoever had called was right, they sent a couple patrol cars by and saw them parked out back, just behind my car. There was no employee parking lot, we just left our cars out back by the dumpster. It was dead black with no view of the road. They were back there waiting for me to get off.

But the fucked up part wasn't that these guys were going to jump me and bring me back inside to get the safe. Like I said, these robberies hadn't been the kind where anyone got hurt. I almost wanted to laugh when I thought of how little there would have been to take. That's when the cop looked at me and said, ""You know the kid Adam Galloway from the news?""

The robbers had been on a bender that must have lasted a couple days. Pills mostly, but a little meth thrown in because, why not, we're out here with a bunch of rednecks, they were probably just smoking what they could get. We were all right about Adam, he had fallen in with a bad crowd. But they never found him in the river. The car they'd been driving belonged to Adam. He met up with them a day or two before and tried to join, but these idiots were so delusional from all the chemicals they ended up calling narc and killing him. The cops found his body in the trunk. He'd been strangled, and they found the clothesline that was used in one of the robber's pockets.

I sat down on the asphalt and told the EMT I thought I'd take that blanket after all. When you hear people use the word ""chilling"" you think it's just a metaphor or figure of speech, but I promise you it's not. They all kind of stood around and watched me, and that's when I realized I still had the coin in my hand.

[This is the coin Miss Rhonda gave me a few hours earlier.](http://imgur.com/y1PTati) 

I'm not superstitious. I'm not religious. I don't believe in guardian angels or divine intervention or any of that shit. But to this day, I don't know who called the cops. I would have been done for the night, out the back door in ten minutes, and I don't know why they came when they did. I don't know what would have happened if they hadn't, but I have a pretty nasty guess. 

I haven't seen Miss Rhonda since. Or more accurately, I didn't see her for the next month I worked there before I quit. Maybe she called the cops, I thought for a while, but if that was true, that would have meant that she saw them pull around back of the building, and there's absolutely no way that could have happened. She lived a few miles outside town, which I knew from the small talk we made over the course of that summer.

I went to her house about a year later. Couldn't shake what happened that night I guess. In hindsight, maybe I should have seen a therapist about it or something. But I was about to graduate college and move out of state, so I wanted to stop by and ask her about it. I had to know if she heard.

The house was empty, and I figured she must have moved. Almost being murdered has a way of nagging at your mind though, so I stopped by the neighbors' to see if they knew where she went. They told me no one had lived there for five years. 

I still keep the coin on me to this day, tucked in my wallet behind my drivers license. I live in Jersey now, in a part where you don't really walk around by yourself when the streetlights come on. When I'm walking home from the bar at night and I hear footsteps behind me, I still reach for my back pocket, into my wallet, and touch it. 

I'm still not superstitious. I'm still not religious. I still don't believe in guardian angels or divine intervention. That's what I tell myself anyway."

I have gotten two offers. 

One offer is an 8 week full-time internship during the summer that pays $18 an hour. It is a company called DST systems. After the internship, I don't know if they are offering a co-op/part time position if they like me. The technologies I will be using will be most likely Java, SQL, and Unix. Keep in mind also that I will be graduating in Spring 2016 (one year from now). So I feel like this would be risky if I would take this offer. If I do not get an extended offer, I will be finding another job to work during the school year.

My second offer is from the government, the department of child services. They are offering full-time during the whole summer, and are even offering me part-time during the school year. However, they are only paying 12 an hour. I like this route as I feel it is a more safer, secure and flexible option, since I'll be there for a longer time and if they like me, I'll be able to get a full time offer and will be able to switch departments if I want to. This department uses technologies such as php, sql, .net, and vb.net.

well this time im just tired about complaining to the university and in my website or other social networks, i think i wanna drop out and start over but this time studying computer science 100% in a serious university or if its posible online!

i do realize that i need a degree to make my chances of getting a good job better but i dont know what to do.

What would you do if you had to spend  6000 usd each semester in a country where the minimum wage per day is 8 dlls(i live in mexico) were all your classes looked like a bad bad joke, all your colleagues were more interested in fixing computers or in a help desk(with a IT major) than in coding itself and all the other public schools were completely horrible and worst most of the times?

3652g3,1,2015-05-16,My roommate is trying to blackmail me (tx),[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3652g3/my_roommate_is_trying_to_blackmail_me_tx/,"So my current roommate and me are in the middle of a dispute regarding who gets the apartment we share next year. Anyway, my problem involves (1) the apartment dispute, and (2) threats from him (blackmail?) to tell the school I use/offer drugs to other students.

**Apartment Dispute**
Some background info: we're both students. Our apartment is part of a low-income housing program, so we pay much less than other comparable units in the area. It's so cheap that I can actually afford the whole thing by myself. We're both on the lease, we found it together, and have been here the same amount of time.

When our lease ends in August, he wants to move one of his friends into my room. Up until he told me about his plans earlier this week, I was planning on staying and renewing the lease with him. We had discussed it briefly last fall. I told him that since I figured we both have equal right to the apartment, I was going to stay, and that if he wanted to live with his friend he could do that elsewhere or get bunk beds. We've both talked to the leasing office separately, and they're not going to get in the middle of this, although I qualify to rent the apartment separately. There's another unit in the same program that might open up, and if it does, I'm going to that one.

Up until this morning, he was saying he lined up a new roommate because I'd been asking around school about another roommate for next year (I wasn't, not that it matters).

**Blackmail?**
This morning, I get a long text from him claiming (a) I've been asking for and offering marijuana/cocaine/ketamine(seriously) to other students, (b) the school is doing some kind of investigation into this because I pissed off someone who snitched, (c) the school has been asking him what he knows about it, and (d) if I don't move out peacefully, he'll tell the school about everything on Monday.

I emailed the dean of students, asking if there was an investigation into me and saying I think my roommate is threatening to accuse me of being some kind of drug dealer. She said she didn't know of any investigation against me. I haven't responded to the text or the response from the dean. I told the apartment management that I'm anticipating he'll try and make the same claim to them.

There's some truth to what he's saying, I've smoked weed and used cocaine in the apartment in the past year, after asking whether he was comfortable with it. I actually have done both with him, smoking with him semi-frequently. I don't think I'm less discrete about it than other students. 

I stopped a month ago in order to test clean for an internship, and I tested clean on a home test today. I have no paraphernalia in the apartment.

Other than that, he's been giving me adderall off his prescription pretty frequently. I also made some stupid jokes when I found out that K is shorthand for contract as well as ketamine.

Now, I'm going to my internship out of town on Sunday. My roommate is not here and won't be back until Monday, so I'm not going to see him until August. I'm taking all my valuables out of the apartment, and I'll be able to move out all the rest and my furniture Monday (someone else would be doing it) if that's a good idea. Whatever happens, I'm not living with him next year. I'm talking to an attorney tomorrow about all this, so advice or perspective are helpful.

**My questions:** 

1. Is there any hope for me to keep the apartment next year alone?

2. Can I remove him from the apartment due to the threat now?

3. Do I have any recourse against him? Civil, Criminal, or through the school?

4. What is my liability in the drug accusations?

5. I'm not going to lie, but I really don't want to volunteer more of this than I have to to the school or apartment. I'm telling the lawyer tomorrow everything."

But I think the pay for this work is lower than standards and I am  being offered almost 1.8x basic salary somewhere else to work as a  software dev (compared to data engineer right now).

I really enjoy my work and there is a lot of learning, but I have financial responsibilities back home.

How do I negotiate a fulltime offer given to me months back when I was an intern? How should I go ahead with the conversation? How do I ask for a better pay on fulltime than the one I was offered back when I was still in university? It's a little awkward because it will be face to face this time and I have been working with them since the last 4 months as an intern. How should I go ahead with this?

Back story, skip this paragraph if you don't care. So, I knew there wasn't going to be a local programming job in my small town but I tried anyway. I have been hired for a position that is basically a paid internship with a pseudo promise it will go full time if everyone is happy a few months from now. Important part to me is to get some form of job experience while continuing to learn coding in my own time. Plus the people seem really cool and chill, so the work environment probably/hopefully wont suck. 

So I am talking to the guy about my job responsibilities and it boils down to two things. General hardware help. Making sure things are working properly or attempting to fix them if not. A roaming IT person. But my question is on the second thing. **I'm going to be helping with a Microsoft based domain register and setting up computers with their own domain addresses.** I think I understand the concept but I'd really like to study or read up more about it specifically before I get to the work site. I'm having a hard time finding the proper set of keywords to punch in, or I don't know what I'm looking for and have found it. **Would anyone who has a similar job be willing to point me in the right direction for online self study and maybe describe their daily routine?** I've been told I'll be taught everything I need to know but I've heard plenty of horror stories about that exact line and I prefer to rely on my employer as little as possible.

If given a chance to start again I would avoid the mistakes and work hard to achieve better grades.

My low GPA is mainly due to choosing wrong subjects and not performing in those up to the required level.

My question is, can I get admitted as transfer student to decent university and where can I get more information about the procedure?

Also I have another option of changing the department from Mechanical to Industrial (or some other) but my previous education and experience as well as my interest is mainly in Mechanical Engineering

I am really confused and need help

There is this simple release that comes from watching the blood trickle from a fresh wound. It's like all of the bad thoughts and negative emotions are waiting just below the surface and this holy straight razor is cleansing my body of all the terrible things I endure throughout the day. Don't mistake my self-destructive behavior as suicidal intention or masochism. There is a spot on my thigh that I cut from time to time, but you'll find no scars on my arms or anywhere you'd see in daily life. This habit, it is almost a compulsion. It is like my blood is this foreign liquid that must be purged from my body. 

I work as a floor supervisor for a suicide hotline. The irony of a cutter working in such a place isn't lost on me. The volunteers sit at their phones while I walk the floor listening in on the calls and keeping notes on the call activity. It says something about how fucked up the world is that we actually have a quota. This quota is simple. If you call making a suicidal threat, we are to call the police and having you apprehended for a seventy-two hour hold. The charity that pays our bills is funded almost entirely by three different local psychiatric hospitals. If you call because life seems like it isn't worth living, chances are you'll help us meet our quota when we refer you for a psychiatric evaluation. 

When I am not walking the floor or training new volunteers you can find me holed up in my office browsing various internet forums. I think its fair to say I have an unhealthy fascination with death. From an early age I've been unable to accept that eighty or so years of consciousness is some meaningless interval that begins abruptly and ends in an instant. My obsession with death has more to do with discovering what, if anything comes after it. While the plebs on the floor are answering calls from morose motherfuckers sad about their lives I'm reading accounts of near death experiences and messaging people who claim to have had contact with supernatural forces. 

Most of my inquiries don't pan out. 

The vast majority of the people who claim to have contact with otherworldly forces are either liars, lunatics, or both. In nearly fifteen years of searching, I've seldom found more than misinterpreted coincidence and uncorroborated claims. Well, there is one girl who stands out, but I'll get to her later. For now, I'll just say that most of what you read on the internet is bullshit. One of my favorite quotes goes like this. 

*“Don't trust everything you read on the internet.""*

Pisha is a woman I met in an IRC chatroom over on freenode IRC. The room I had searched the active room list and found a room titled #Ouroboros. There were twenty users in the room, but she was the one that messaged me as soon as I entered. I saved the chatlog of our initial conversation. I'll display it below. 

&gt; Pisha216: You shouldn't be here.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Where should I be if not here?
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: I suppose you think you are clever?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Perhaps.
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: Cleverness &amp; Curiosity can get you killed.
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: Go back to whatever room you came from. 
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Suppose that I am curious and clever, what's the worst that could happen?
&gt; 
&gt; Pisha216: I'll send you an email later. For now, I'm booting you from the room. 
&gt; 
&gt; (User Pisha216 has kicked you from #Ouroboros, Reason: Uninvited)

It was an odd encounter, but not uncommon. A lot of those rooms are set up for private groups and I had stumbled in without knowing exactly what to say or do while there. A few days later I was checking my email at work when I received an email from Pisha216@hell(dot)com. It had been a while since I had seen an email from that domain. From what I understood, the mail server went offline back in 2010. Even still, there was an email with an attachment. 

It read:

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; The Temple of Ouroboros is not currently accepting new pledges. If you would be so kind as to explain how you entered the room without the appropriate password it would be appreciated. My name is Pisha Maxwell, but you may refer to me as Pisha. I am an apprentice with the Temple of Ouroboros. My superiors have tasked me with vetting you and figuring out your intent. Should you prove to be a worthy candidate, my superiors may allow further contact in a manner they see fitting.
&gt; 
&gt; — Second Level Apprentice Pisha Marie Maxwell

I replied:

&gt; Pisha,
&gt; 
&gt; There was no password prompt when I joined the channel. My intent was one of curiosity. I was completely unaware that your organization existed. Please forgive my intrusion. It was just one of my late night internet binges where I went looking for something spooky. Sorry to disturb you. 
&gt; 
&gt; — (Name Removed)

Several weeks passed and I received no response. I figured it was just some group of weirdos heavy into role play or some sort of kinky sex stuff. I was walking the floor and listening to a caller who identified themselves as Pisha. It's a rather uncommon name. Sometimes I would take over a call if it seemed like the volunteer was floundering. I made some excuse about protocol and had the call transferred to my office. 

I picked up the receiver and a timid female voice said, *“I'm sorry to bother you. I hope I didn't get the other guy in trouble.”* I responded, *“No ma'am, sometimes with special cases I step in and handle the calls personally. My name is (removed). How can I help you?”* From there, our conversation when as such. 

Pisha said, *“I'm up for review with this umm... internship I've taken up. I don't think I'll be selected for advancement. My next review won't be for another year. I don't know if I can take another year at this level of service. Most apprentices who fail their second review kill themselves. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live with the shame of being passed over.”*

I interjected, *“Why do you think you'll be rejected for advancement Pisha?”*

She continued, *“I was tasked with vetting a potential newcomer. His story checked out, but I set up my mail client to delete messages on the server after I downloaded them. My laptop fried and I didn't have a backup of his contact information. If I returned to my superiors to ask for it, they would have marked me unfavorably. I have two days to find someone and properly vet someone and I don't even know how to get a hold of them.”*

I sat back in my office chair and contemplated my next words carefully. It violated pretty much every ethical standard of my position to even take the call. But to identify myself could get me fired. I had to be careful, but I didn't want her to off herself.

I replied back, *“The Temple of Ouroboros sounds like a pretty hardcore organization. I don't know who this potential newcomer is, but if I were a betting man I'd say he could be found at the Book &amp; Bean off of 2nd &amp; Porter in (Town Removed) tomorrow at around five.”*

Pisha responded in a hushed tone, *“This is twice now you've inexplicably appeared. Someone will be there. Thank you. Thank you so very much.”*

Pisha assured me that she wouldn't harm herself and I ended the call. After filling out the appropriate forms I logged the call and then logged into the quality control system and ensured that the audio had been marked reviewed and approved. It was an abuse of my position, but there was something about her voice that seemed so familiar. I clocked out at eleven o'clock and I was home and in bed by midnight. 

I was anxious about my meeting with Pisha later in the day and overwhelmed with guilt from abusing my position at work. I was a bit more hurried than normal when I pulled the straight razor from my pocket and made an incision in my left thigh. I cut a little deeper than normal and ended up having to give myself stitches. After more than fifteen years of self-harm, I had become fairly adept at patching myself up. I winced with pain with each stroke of the needle moving through my flesh. After some cleanup and some fresh gauze I pulled my Tripp pants and a Social Distortion t-shirt from my closet and headed to the Book &amp; Bean.

A confused girl in an ankle length slim gray lace dress wondered into the coffee shop a little bit before five o'clock. She was carrying an attache case and wore black horn rimmed glasses that rested on a slender face that was partially hidden by jet black hair. I looked at her for a moment and marveled at how she was an almost classic beauty. Her eyes locked with mine and she made her way over to my table. She extended a tiny hand that I shook firmly. She introduced herself in a timid voice, *“My name is Pisha Maxwell and I represent The Temple of Ouroboros, I take it you're (removed.)”*

I nodded.

She continued, *“Do you believe in fate? I don't mean some hokey sense of predestination, but rather that from the first spark of the big bang that all of these random atoms collided into one another just so that two people could meet? Twice now you've inexplicably appeared when I needed you the most. I don't believe in coincidence.”*

I took a sip from my latte and responded, *“I don't buy into fate. As much as I'd like to think of a few girls weaving the circumstances of our lives with golden looms I'm a skeptic and a pragmatist. Things happen. Any meaning behind them is purely subjective. That being said, it is a pleasure to finally meet you Pisha.”*

A barista approached our table and took Pisha's order. She motioned for some more comfortable chairs in the back of the room and by the time we had moved over to the vinyl easy chairs the barista returned with a warm Earl Grey tea with a wedge of orange. Sat on a love seat and motioned for me to join her there. She sipped her tea and placed it on the table next to her. A single finger moved the hair out of her eyes and we locked into a gaze where I could have fallen into those cold brown eyes. 

She looked away quickly and said, *“It's strange. We've just met and I feel like I've known you my whole life.”*

Still looking where her eyes had just been I responded, *“I hope I'm not being too forward when I say this, as I'm sure it wasn't your intention when you came here, but I haven't been able to take my eyes off of you since you walked in the room. It's not something I saw often, but you are simply captivating.”*

She smiled and turned her feet inward as she tried to deflect the compliment and my advance saying, *“As much as I'd enjoy taking you back to my hotel room and removing your clothes with my teeth, this is purely a business meeting Mr. (removed.)”*

I scooted towards the arm a bit to try and give her some space and she put a hand on my shoulder saying, *“Don't get me wrong. I'm flattered, in any other circumstance you would have just sealed the deal, but I have some more questions you need answered and a 7 AM flight in the morning.”* Then she leaned up and kissed me on the cheek. Her timid voice seemed a bit more bold with that declaration. 

She asked a new question, *“What do you know about Ouroboros? What would you assume about an organization that treats the figure like a deity?”*

I responded, *“I know about a much as anyone else that shows up to a coffee shop with a triskelion tattoo on his wrist in full goth attire. I always saw it as an eternal cycle like that biologically immortal jellyfish in Japan that lives for a million or so years. I imagine a religion centered around such a figure would be focused on eternal life through perpetual rebirth.”*

She smirked, *“I pegged you as clever in our first encounter, but that was eerily insightful. You're right. The Temple of Ouroboros is a religious sect that is centered around the belief that death can be averted through rebirth. Membership is incredibly exclusive. There are only fifty members operating in the United States and that includes apprentices and neonates. You have gained the attention of my direct superior. If you pass this interview, it is likely that we will fly you to the temple for the initiation process, if that is what you desire.”*

I took a long sip from my latte and stared off into the distance saying, *“It might sound strange, but I'm not even sure such a thing would make sense for me. I've spent my whole life looking for meaning in death, the idea of averting it altogether seems almost cheap. I don't know why your superiors are so interested in me. I'm a thirty-three year old slacker in a dead end job that spends his free time looking for answers online. At this point I'm not even sure where I'm going in life, much less that I'd want to live forever.”*

Pisha leaned over and put her head on my shoulder as her arms wrapped around me in a warm embrace I recognized as the first intimate human contact I had experienced in the better part of eight months. She brought her lips so close to my ear that I could feel her warm breath against my skin. In that moment she said, *“I'm at the Marriott, room 734. You bent the rules for me, allow me to bend the rules for you.”*

We went through another hour of question and answer from that point, but I can't remember most of it. There was something about her that was so uncanny and out of place. I was completely enthralled, but wary of her frequent transition between timid and bold. There was something off about her, but as the interview ended I kissed her hand and she caught a cab. I walked back to the car debating whether or not I should take her up on her offer. 

Several months prior to this I got about this far with a girl but when it came time to do the deed she saw the scars on my thigh and a fresh incision that left her uncomfortable. That was the last I saw that girl. She stopped volunteering at the call center and I ended up in a performance review where my boss explained that while they had no problems employing someone with a mental illness, that I would need a note from a doctor stating that I wasn't a danger to myself of others. I had to go to three months of therapy just to keep my job. If they found out about this, I'd be fired. That is the main reason I continue to remove any of my personal information from this account of the past few months. 

I was about halfway to my apartment when I received a text from Pisha. We traded contact information before leaving the coffee shop. It read, *“Don't be ashamed of your scars. I'm not ashamed of mine.”* I never mentioned the cutting. It was a little eerie that she picked up on it, but then I pushed on my thigh for reassurance and realized I had popped a stitch at one point and my black denim pants were wet with blood. I turned my car around and made it to the Marriott around eight in the evening. 

---


I stood outside of room 734 pacing back and forth as I tried to decide whether or not to knock. As much as I wanted to know the woman, I had an overwhelming sense of dread creeping up and my hand slid into my pocket as I ran my fingers across the straight razor. As I turned to leave, Pisha opened the door and pulled me inside. She was wearing the same outfit as before. She led me to the bed and I sat there on the edge as she asked, *“Can I see it? The cut on your leg?”*

A surge of anxiety welled up from somewhere inside and I started to panic. I was about to bolt for the door when she sat next to me and put a hand on me leg. She leaned in and said, *“Lemme show you something.”* She stood up and turned away from me saying, *“Would you mind unzipping my dress?”* I pulled the small zipper down and almost instantly caught sight of ridges of scar tissue on her back. She dropped the dress to her ankles and revealed in a slow twirl that most of her torso and upper legs were covered in scar tissue.

She sat across from me on the dresser and said, *“When I was a little girl my father caught me kissing a neighbor boy. It wasn't anything major, just a peck on the lips. The old man lost it. He dragged me into the living room and bent me over his knee screaming about how no daughter of his was going to behave like a harlot. He was spanking so hard that I stopped feeling it after the second or third swat and as I struggled to get away I ended up tripping on the rug and falling in the fireplace. By the time he pulled me out I had burns on sixty percent of my body.”*

She lit a cigarette and took a long drag as I responded, *“That's terrible. I don't even...”*

She interrupted, *“Some would call it disfiguring, but your expression hasn't changed since you entered the room. I can tell that it is meaningless to you. I can smell the blood on your leg. Judging by your anxiety and shame, I'd say you were a cutter. I did that for a while.”* She spread her legs and pointed to her inner thigh where I could make out numerous linear scars in about the same location as mine. 

I unbuckled my belt and let wriggled my pants to the floor to expose the incision on my thigh. I scooted back on the bed and lit my own cigarette and we sat there in silence staring at each other as the embers on the ends of our cigarettes approached the filters. She finished her cigarette and came over to the bed and snuggled up next to me. We sat there in silence holding each other in that moment of perfect desperation for an unknown amount of time before I drifted off to sleep. 

My dreams were fitful and violent. Flashes of red shapes that bore sharp teeth tore at me as I fought to wake and found myself violently throwing myself on the floor. Pisha mumbled in her sleep as I climbed back on the bed. I moved over the table in the corner and sat there in the dark smoking a cigarette as she laid there sleeping. I contemplated sneaking out but found my legs unwilling to comply with the instinct to flee. She rolled over and slid her arm across the empty space in the bed only to sit up and look around. 

She called out, *“(removed) are you still here?”*

I responded softly, *“I had a nightmare, decided to get up and smoke.”*

She came over and sat in my lap as she pulled a cig from my pack and lit it off of my cherry. With her head leaned against my shoulder she said, *“I feel so safe with you.”*

I pet her hair as we sat there. After a few minutes she started talking. I had zoned out but when I started paying attention she was mid-sentence, *“-ing and what not. I don't know anymore. At first I joined because I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself. Fraternization between apprentices and neonates is strictly forbidden. If you join, we wouldn't be able to do this again for the better part of a year and that is only if you make apprentice. It would almost be worth it to fail the review and say you didn't pan out. I like this. I've never had this before.”* 

I put my cigarette out in the ashtray as I responded, *“I've lived thirty-three years without you, I can wait a year. It would be worth it just to be a part of your life.”*
She leaned up and kissed me on the cheek before walking over to her suitcase and getting dress. She tossed me my pants and shoes and we were both dressed within a couple of minutes. I kissed her on the forehead before heading to the door. I turned back towards her and said in a soft tone, *“Thank you for the best night of my life.”* She smiled from ear to ear and said, *“I hope to change that one day.”*

For the next several weeks I worked the floor and monitored calls and exchanged the occasional secret texts with Pisha. She wasn't allowed to interact with me during the review process, but she couldn't help herself, nor could I. It was around the first week of March when I received a package at work with  an Ouroboros logo in the upper right-hand corner of the label. Contained within was a plane ticket and a thirty page questionnaire I was to have filled out perfectly by the time I landed in Maine three days later. I completed the multiple choice section of the questionnaire in just a few hours but decided to track down a typewriter for the essay portions. Three days later I was on a plane to Bangor, Maine. 

A car met me outside the airport and for the next three hours I rode with an ill-tempered man in the backseat of an SUV to a mansion on the shore of Flagstaff Lake. What little conversation I had with my fellow passenger came from his repeated dismissals of my worthiness and that only one of us would be selected to join. He boasted a degree in ancient literature and an internship at the Smithsonian. I was a slacker with an associates of general studies from a community college and a dead-end job that I fell into because no one else wanted it. 

The two of us were brought into the foyer and asked to sit. The ill-tempered man I had rode with was called first and I sat on the bench going over my questionnaire one last time. I saw Pisha walk past one of the doorways in a crimson robe with white and yellow trim. She didn't look at me directly, but a smile crossed her face. I sat up slightly less concerned with my fate. About an hour passed and the ill-tempered man came back to the bench with a smug look on his face. He said under his breath, *“I've got this in the bag, fucking scrub.”*

I was called back through a long narrow hallway. An ornate door at the end led to a study where an elderly woman with thick glasses sat in a crimson robe with white and black trim staring over an old mahogany desk. *“Please sit Mr. (removed.)”* There were three chairs set in front of the desk. The were lined up perfectly, but one was ever so slightly off center. It was on the right of center, a wooden chair with a soft velvet cushion. The middle chair was an ornate leather upholstered chair with brass tacks running along the edges. The chair on the left was a simple wooden chair that seemed out of place in the otherwise ornate study. It is where I sat.

The woman gave an introduction, *“Mr. (removed), I am Adeline Devonshire. At one-hundred and three years old I am the matriarch of this temple. All applicants require my approval. Why did you sit in that chair?”*

I sat up a little more and responded, *“It seemed the least comfortable. I wanted to pay attention and I thought the others would be too distracting.”*

She nodded her head and wrote some notes before asking, *“What do you hope to gain from this order?”
*
I paused for a moment and gave it some thought before saying, *“Pisha. What I mean is that I could give you some story about finding meaning or rebirth, but it is so much a part of her identity that I'm willing to be a part of it to have the chance of spending time with her, even if it it means waiting a year just to be able to talk to her again.”*

Adeline's jaw dropped a little, *“Are you even taking this seriously?”*

I swallowed some spit that had been collecting in my mouth and responded, *“Yes, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out my utter skepticism on the primary tenets of this order. Everything I gathered by the nature of the questions you had me answer in this folder I am holding points towards wanting honesty and candor. Maybe I'm wrong, but I have a feeling you are looking for quality of character over qualifications.”*

The elderly woman stood up and walked slowly over to a bookshelf where she pulled back a thick tome and tucked it under her arm as she moved back to the desk. She turned through several pages before stopping and running her finger across the text and saying, *“Pisha said that you were clever, and sometimes eerily insightful. Am I to understand you spent an entire evening in her hotel room without even attempting to fornicate with her?”*

Without hesitation I responded, *“I felt it would have cheapened the experience. It was a pure moment that would have only been sullied by giving in to such urges. I would have loved to, but I couldn't bring myself to even suggest it.”*

Adeline nodded and then said, *“One last question. Why the triskelion tattoo on the back of your wrist?”*

I replied, *“It's to remind me that there are three separate and altogether opposing sides of my mind that are in constant conflict, but still the components that make up my whole being.”*

Adeline looked down at the book in front of her and without looking back up she said, *“Leave your questionnaire on my desk and go back to the bench in the foyer.”*

I stood and before turning I placed the folder on her desk and said, *“Thank you for your consideration.”*

The ill-tempered gentleman on the bench commented on my return, “I was in there for more than an hour, you were barely gone ten minutes. I think we both know who is staying and who is going home.” I thought about punching him in his smug face but opted to sit there silent. Nearly an hour had passed and no one had come by. The ill-tempered man got up and wandered off. I sat there on the bench for a while longer as Adeline and Pisha walked past without so much as looking at me. 

The ill-tempered man returned just as an attendant appeared and said, “You are both invited to the main dining hall for a meal prepared especially for you.”

We sat at a small table in the back of the room as the rest of the apprentices and neonates gathered around a dining table that was longer that my apartment and covered in gourmet dishes and fine china. The ill-tempered man and I were both brought covered platters. His was a fine cut steak cooked medium-rare with asparagus and a Gruyere sauce. Mine had an empty plate. He was given a goblet of wine and I was given a glass of water. 

The man in front of me smirked. Adeline stood at the end of the table and announced to the room, *“After some deliberation with the elders via Skype and scouring The Book of Ouroboros I have come to a decision on which supplicant will be allowed to complete the trials of initiation. We sit in front of this table of luxury with a feast set out before us. Our plates are empty, but we know that we will take part in the pleasures afforded to us by this celebration. As such, one supplicant has been given a fine meal which he will eat in peace before leaving never to return. The other supplicant has been given an empty plate, because he will join us in the feast we hold in his honor.”*

The smug look fell from the man's face as a smirk came across mine. He stood up in protest and shouted, *“I spent years studying the ancient texts of the old world just to find mention of your order and then spent six months preparing for this. How does this philistine warrant an invitation in the first place? Look at him!”* 

Adeline shot a look to a large man standing by the door who removed the ill-tempered man from the dining hall. She then turned her gaze to me and said, *“Please tell the attendant what dishes you wish to sample, you may join in the feast but to join our table you must first pass the trials.”* I sat alone at my table dining for the next couple of hours before being led to the rather posh guest suite. My carry-on bag sat next to the bed and there were fresh silk pajamas in my size on the dresser. After a shower and some reflection I laid down and drifted off to sleep. 

---

I woke to laughter and darkness. Robed figures in porcelain masks dragged me by my feet through a narrow stone corridor. The rough stone floor tore at my pajamas and scraped my skin bloody as I slid across it. I tried to struggle, but I couldn't shake my legs free, much less pull myself up off the stone floor. The narrow hallway widened to a large candlelit room with light brown stone walls and strange symbols carved into the rock. In the center of the room stood a rack with leather straps tied to the top and bottom I was stood up and tied as a masked figure emerged from the shadows and said, *“Welcome to the first trial of initiation. This is a test of willpower and endurance. This can end at anytime. Simply ask us to stop and you will be set free and sent home.”*

A small rubber mouth guard was shoved in my mouth and the masked figure stepped back. Hanging there on the rack I winced at the sight of the whip in the hands of a large figure I assumed to be Adeline's enforcer from the dining hall. The first crack of the whip against my back caused me to violently pull at my restraints. I bit down on the mouth guard a bit more each time the leather sliced into my back twenty lashes in he stopped and the masked figured returned saying, *""There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain. Why do you endure this pain?”* With the mouth guard in, I could only speak in vowels. 

It was pulled my mouth and a repeated, *“Pisha.”*

The mouth guard was put back and the man went back to his lashing. Ten more lashes and I was all but convinced by the cold throbbing pain that there was exposed bone. I could see blood pooling on the floor. Eventually the lashing stopped and the masked figure returned saying, *“To endure such pain for love is admirable, but this is not a romantic order. We are embody a proud tradition of esoteric study and discipline. It takes more than willpower and determination to advance in this study. Your wounds will be tended to and you will be returned to your room.""*

An hour of stitches and bandaging later I was led to my room. I sat up on the bed not wanting to lay on my back. In the darkness of the room and the pale glow the moonlight I could see a figure standing in the corned of the room. Pisha spoke up, *“I'm beyond flattered that you would do this to be near me, but it isn't necessary. Just give up, I'll leave with you.”* I responded flatly, *“You went through this for your own reasons, what kind of man would I be to reject a pain you lived through willingly?”* She walked forward and kissed me on the cheek before leaving. 

A few days of resting and healing later I was brought to a small room with metal chair. I was given a cup of a bitter tasting tea. An attendant brought in another chair and a few moments later Adeline entered and sat across from me, and the attendant tied my wrists to the arms of the chair. Adeline spoke up saying, *“You were just given a powerful hallucinogen. It will eat away at the walls in your mind and you will have no way of knowing what is real and what isn't. Your innermost thoughts will escape from your mouth and you'll be completely unable to hold anything back. I am going to show you some pictures and you are going to tell me what you think. It is here that we will come to know you as you really are in your heart of hearts.”*

It was about that moment that the walls began to melt and the words coming from Adeline's mouth echoed through the room on an infinite loop. It became in possible to focus on anything, Her facial features twisted and distorted as she spoke on and on about the pictures she was showing me. I lost all connection to the world around me. My mind drifted to my straight razor and I entertained the thought of bleeding the poison in my head through that sacred spot on my thigh. I drifted further and further away from myself only to be jerked back time and again when cold water was splashed in my face. 

Time lost all meaning as this interval became eternal. Violent images consumed my thoughts. Ancient soldiers marching with spears and shields converged on small villages killing everyone in sight. Women and children fled in terror as soldiers chased them down and did unspeakable things. I tried to look away but it was everywhere in my field of vision. The scenes changed but the carnage remained constant. Around the time that I lost anything resembling awareness of myself I was crying out that it stop, that the inhuman violence was too much, that I didn't want to see one more unspeakable act. Then I faded into the carnage and became one with the ever-increasing violence as I lost myself to the torrent of blood washing through the towns and villages I saw in my mind's eye. 

I woke in the guest room an inordinate amount of time later with Pisha standing over me. She brought a damp cloth across my forehead as she looked in my eyes singing under her breath in a language I didn't recognize. She stopped for a moment and whispered in my ear, *“I'm so proud of you.”* I drifted back to sleep.

---


The next morning I was brought to Adeline's study. She sat at her desk and barely took notice of me as she said, *“Grab a book and read your third trial is tomorrow.”* I went for the huge tome she call The Book of Ouroboros. The thick tome was a leather bound book with thick yellowed pages printed in an old typeset. 

A printed engraving on the first page showed a slender woman standing with a sword over a caricature of a Shah. The title at the bottom read, *“The Lady Is The Victor.”* I read the story of Parisa, the youngest daughter of a Persian Merchant in the late Zand Dynasty. Her father punished her as a young girl by tossing her in a fire. She spent the next ten years in waiting for a suitor, but each would learn of her disfigurement and break off the betrothal. She was nineteen years of age with the oldest son of the general of the Shah's army took her as a wife. He was a cruel man and a vicious drunk nearly twice her age. One night while he slept she poisoned his wine. The next morning as he drew from the bottle he began to convulse. 

She was tried and found guilty of the murder of her husband and sentenced to death. In the dungeons she was subjected to all manner of unspeakable act by the guards before being sent to the chopping block. It was cloudy on the day of her execution. Battered and bruised, she led to the chopping block where the executioner sharpened his blade. Just as the blade made contact with her neck, a bolt of lightning struck the blade and Parisa disappeared in the flash. 

---


The next morning I was led to a chamber where Adeline stood at the foot of a throne. A veiled figure sat on the ornate chair and Adeline bowed before her. One by one, each member of the order filed through and knelt before the throne. I was brought to the throne and pushed to my knees. Adeline stood over me with a sword saying, *“It would be better for you to run on this sword than enter this order with fear in your heart.”* She kissed the sword and presented it to the woman on the throne. 

The woman stood and revealed herself to be Pisha. Pisha put the sword to my throat and said, *“In this incarnation I am Pisha Maxwell. I have also been known as Parisa Al-Fath and Lady Marie Lizet. Twice you found me when I was looking for one to stand by my side. You have shown great character and strength. It is for this reason and the connection we share that I believe you to be Azir Al-Fahad, my dead lover reborn. I live eternal, like the jellyfish you mentioned when we first met. In each lifetime I regress to a child like state only to grow again into my position as Priestess.”*

She removed the sword from my throat and continued, *“Adeline was the first of my converts. A transfusion of my blood and a sufficient electric shock and her body reverted as mine had so many times before. Each apprentice and neonate serves in hopes of my gift. You on the other hand simply endured the trials for a chance at another night in my presence. What say you, of my offer to break the cycle of death and rebirth as I offer you my gift?”*

Now, I don't know what exactly went through my mind before I said this, but there was a deep feeling of betrayal as she revealed this to me. I fell for a woman that didn't exist. Pisha the apprentice was a lie. I looked up in defiance and said, *“Pisha the apprentice held my love and devotion. I do not know the woman in front of me.”* 

The sword returned to my throat. 

Pisha said in a stern tone, *“You fought for a vulnerable young girl, and thus you are worthy of a queen. Why do you seem so distraught at this revelation?”*

I cleared my throat and then put a finger to the blade pushing it away as I stood up. I turned my back to her and started pacing as I ranted, *“I don't know what kind of sick game you're playing but I made myself vulnerable to you. I gave myself to you. But I didn't. I gave myself to a lie. And now you're talking about immortality and conversions. Fuck that. I hated being a kid. All this time you've been saying that I'm free to leave at anytime. Well, I'm out. If I ever see Pisha the Apprentice again I'll give her my love, but this is ten kinds of bullshit.”*

Pisha shrieked and two men grabbed me at the shoulders and dragged me to an antechamber of the main hall where I was strapped to a chair. All manner of tubes and needles were inserted into my arms and chest. I struggled as best I could, but it was to no avail. Two pads were brought towards my face and past my field of vision to my temples and with a sharp pain, I passed out. 

---


I woke at home and in my own bed. I don't even remember flying back. I called the human resources office to inform them that I was back from my extended vacation and asked if my position was still available. Over the next few weeks I fell back into the routine of working nights listening to calls and spending my down time searching the internet. Only now instead of searching for clues of otherworldly origin I became with The Temple of Ouroboros. 

A few weeks of research returned very little if any results. It was only when discussing my experiences in a deep web chat room for paranormal discussion that someone sent me a private message that read, *“I knew you were a scrub. You couldn't of been worthy of the gift.”* I replied, *“You're that smug asshole that kicked out aren't you?”* He replied, *“The name is Kenneth.”* I typed out a response, *“Actually, I refused the gift and after a scene from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest with electric shock and all manner of needles I woke at home in my bed.”
*
Kenneth responded, *“Bullshit, there's no way she gave you the gift. Pisha was my beloved, how could you have been worthy. I was supposed to be the reincarnation of Azir Al-Fahad.”* I replied, *“Yeah, she sold me that line too. I've been considering going to the doctor and getting some tests done to see what they shot me up with. I've had a wicked headache since I've been back and I can't seem to sleep comfortably.”*

Kenneth sent me one last message, *“It's not fair. Why do you get to live forever?""*

---


I got an email from Pisha216@hell(dot)com last night. It simply read, *“Should you ever change your mind, your place is by my side.”*

 I added the address to my block list. It's been a crazy past few months. I met the most amazing girl only to find out she was some insane cult leader. I had the most amazingly intimate night of my life and then endured the kind of torture that leaves men broken and rambling. All in all I'd say it evened out. 

The major improvement in my life as a result of this is that I haven't felt the urge to cut myself since I've been back. In fact, I feel more alive that I have before. I remember reading somewhere about people surviving tragedies and seizing life by the horns afterward. I like to think that's what's going on here. Heck, prior to this whole ordeal I was starting to get laugh lines on my face and gray hairs in my beard, but both are gone. All the stress in my old life seems meaningless when looking back at those damned trials. 

The only thing that has me concerned lately is the how thirsty I get sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I've lost nearly ten pounds and my skin is tightening up wonderfully, but sometimes I'll drink a gallon of water at a time and still feel thirsty. I talked to my doctor about it and he told me to take it easy on the hydration and gave me a pill that makes it a little more tolerable. I'll miss the Pisha I fell for and curse the one who tricked me. Maybe one day I'll decide to look her crazy ass up. 

Until then, I feel great. It's like I'm getting younger every day.

I was a chemistry major for the past 4 years, and have some research experience. I had completed my chemistry major but I then decided a career in chemistry or research wasn't for me. I decided to spend an extra year at school to complete a computer science major. I hope to have a career in software development.

Once I had made this decision I tried my hardest to get an internship. However, I had no success whatsoever. I rarely get past the stage where I am asked for my resume. The one time I got an interview it seemed like it went great but I have yet to receive a response months later.

At this point I have decided it's likely I won't be able to find an internship for the summer. This is worrisome because I need to be able to find a job in a year when I do finally graduate. I realize I should be working on side projects this summer, but is this enough for a graduate with no internship experience?"

Any opinions = helpful,bottleofTrexpee,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/366pof/quarterlife_crisis_i_cant_sort_out_my/,"I'm going to do my very best to make this as coherent as possible, but I'm an emotional wreck right now on the verge of another panic attack, so bear with me.


The main problem is this: I'm 24 years old. I have an Associates degree in Biology and Natural Sciences and a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice with a Forensic Science Concentration. The goal was to become a Forensic Lab Tech focusing on DNA/Serology. I was very, very interested in this. I loved all my coursework and lab work. As a requirement for graduation I had to do a massive (almost 400 hours) internship with a local agency. I applied and interviewed for a position at a local forensic laboratory but was denied. The one space open for that internship was filled by a man in the military who knew people who worked in tandem with the lab (I heard from him later on). I was discouraged, but found another agency, a police agency to intern with. During this internship I stared steadily losing my drive to work in the Forensic science field. Crippled by anxiety and intoxicated at the thought of finally graduating, I ignored my second thoughts and graduated December 2014 with honors.


Then I began looking for work in the field and found that I was pathetically underqualified for any lab work. I was misled by my academic advisor (who actually moved to a different school 2/3 the way through my undergrad work) in regards to how easy it'd be to get into the field. My mistake--I know that--for trusting so much in someone else and not doing my own personal research. I was naive and I know how dumb that was. 


Anyway, after searching for two months and hating my current retail job, I got a second job in retail. I decided that I'd work two jobs, save up for grad school and moving out, and figure things out a bit later.  


While working and talking with my boyfriend, trying to figure out where we're both headed in life, I came to the realization that I don't want to work anywhere near the criminal justice field. I'm just not interested. I have no faith in the system. And my ultimate goal in life is to help/educate people. Things just aren't jiving. 


Cue the first panic attack. I'm no stranger to anxiety, so I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything, but I was wrecked for three days trying to recover and missed a lot of work. Every time I thought about the fact that I don't know what I'm doing with my life I'd start crying and hyperventilating. 


From a very young age I wanted to be a Palaeontologist, which--evidence from my Associate degree choice--was the plan. Last week I was trying to think of the point where Palaeontology turned into Forensics. I knew how to explain it to people that have known me my whole life: ""I just didn't want to have to go into teaching full time with only being able to go on digs once in every long while. So instead of working with prehistoric animals and fauna, I'd work with dead, dying, missing people."" That's how I'd explain it to people. So I had all that, but no clue when it changed. 


And then it hit me that the decision wasn't mine. Back in 2009 after I had a brain surgery to remove a fucking tumor, I went out to visit my grandparents (who live a small town away from where I got my Bachelor's from). We toured the campus then and got a catalogue. I remember sitting down to dinner and my grandfather (the abusive patriarch of the family) explaining how great Forensics would be.


**Boom!** 


It wasn't my fucking decision. I, being the stupid sheep I am, went along with someone else's plan for me. 


He has dreams of me working for the CIA or the FBI or GBI, all these big name agencies. He wants me to make tons of money and still, despite me moving out, micromanages my life. 


Well now I've wasted 2.5 years of my life, about 30k of my father's money (who made too much for me to get any financial aid, but barely enough to support himself and pay for my schooling), and have a degree that I can't/don't want to use. I'm so mad and I hate myself for letting this happen. I have no passion, absolutely none for Forensics. It's an interest of mine. And that's the big problem. I have so many goddamn interests. I am interested in just about anything, can find anything fascinating, and love learning. But I'm only passionate about a few things. 


So I've been doing research but I have no idea what to do. Every time I start thinking about things regarding what I'm doing with my life or when someone brings up me doing Forensic work I start panicking.


I'm lost and have no idea what to do with myself. "
367l3d,7,2015-05-16,"I was a great CS student, but a terrible employee. Not sure where to go from here...",DownOnCareer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/367l3d/i_was_a_great_cs_student_but_a_terrible_employee/,"**Background**

From grade school through high school, I had a way of getting things done and it worked. Throughout the day, I would exhaust my daydreaming nature by spending the majority of class time in my own world and then learn by doing the homework at night (often having to self-teach the material due to not paying attention in class). Although also chronic procrastinator, I would not go to bed until my assignments due the next day were complete. Because I always met the deadlines, my grades were very high and I graduated at the top of my class in HS. This strategy did come at a high price; however, as it required significantly more time to get work done. As a result, I was not part of any extra curricular activities and didn't really have friends past school hours.

Moving into college, I chose computer science because I loved working on computers and had taught myself some C programming. Moreover, I saw the impact that computers were having on society and I wanted to be part of it. 

Coursework in college was more rigorous than in high school and led to even more massive amounts of time being dedicated to learning things outside of class (I still spent the majority of lectures daydreaming with the intention of learning from notes later). While the projects got bigger, they were still self-contained and I was able to get them done on time. Since I was always able to hand in decent work and be a great test taker, I graduated with honors and moved on to grad school.

In grad school, I should've recognized that I had a problem. I was on full fellowship so that I could pursue whatever research I wanted under a really great professor. The problem was that I floundered without direction. I have no sense of drive for accomplishing things and really am only good at meeting deadlines. After a year of zero progress, I switched off of the thesis track and moved to a project-based MS degree. Since the project track came with mini-milestones (imposed by a professor), I was able to finish my degree.

As a side-note, I had a couple of internships in college/grad school where I did poorly. In both cases, my boss gave me a project and expected that I would take the initiative to get things done on a timely basis. While most employees dream of a boss that gives you creative freedom and just a general timetable (i.e. end of the internship), I struggled to complete anything significant. Since I was graduating after my second internship, the company extended an offer but it was literally sheer luck. In that case, my primary boss was on a month-long trip to India so his boss just asked everyone in the office if they liked working with me (he had zero insight into what I accomplished). 

Back to post-grad life where I started a professional career; I was offered a six figure job at a top company on the west coast. They were impressed with my quick thinking in the interviews and my ability to be both technical and personable. For that reason, they put me in a product role where I was to design a variety of UX features. My friends and coworkers at this company all really liked me but every manager recognized that I was not accomplishing anything. My reviews were consistently terrible but other managers kept hiring me because they believed I had just been mismanaged. After the fifth manager, I was told to again look for another team but I decided that I wanted out (cursing for four straight minutes in frustration before getting out of bed every morning simply didn't seem healthy). In retrospect, I'm still mixed on this decision. 

**Other Struggles**

Writing itself is a significant struggle for me. It's not that I don't understand how to structure sentences or communicate a thought, it's just that I take a very long time to complete whatever I'm writing. For instance, I may take upwards of 10 minutes just to send a two line email while someone else would spend &lt; 1 minute to do the same. Even things like posting on FB and writing text messages tend to take me roughly double what I've observed my friends doing. Since almost every skilled job a decent amount of writing, I find it very hard to work in a timely manner.

Ambiguous and difficult problems are also things I've struggled to handle. It is when these arise that I tend to start daydreaming and not solve anything. Since professionally these come up a lot, I often shut down and didn't have a deadline to force me into acting.

**The Future**

I feel like my issues are going to seriously hinder me from any future careers in the tech industry. All of the industry problems are very open-ended and I struggle to work on them without direction. While it's still a field I love, I don't know how to work in it any longer. Does anyone have advice for unmotivated (but curious) people like me in tech? 

**TL;DR - Chronic procrastination and laziness got me through school, but it's getting me into serious trouble in the workplace.**"

This year I am returning but this time interning at Amazon's Lab 126 in California.  Both times I am a SDE Intern.  For the Lab126 internship on my resume, should I put ""Amazon"" or ""Amazon Lab126""?  Which sounds better to the recruiters and interviewers?  

Argument for ""Amazon Lab126""

* I will put ""Amazon"" for my previous Seattle internship, so maybe ""Amazon Lab126"" sounds better because it seems like a different place with new experiences.
* Lab126 could be more selective since there's fewer positions compared to in HQ.
* I will probably mention Lab126 during interviews anyway.

Argument for just ""Amazon""

* just ""Amazon"" is more simple and recognizable.
* Lab126 seems more hardware-focused, whereas I'm in software.

What do you think?"
367n91,1,2015-05-16,Should I take an offer in the middle of a project?,Saiyurika,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/367n91/should_i_take_an_offer_in_the_middle_of_a_project/,"I work for a small company owned by a large corporation.  I started as an intern on a short several-month contract, when it was up I was moved to a team with a large project made up of almost entire fresh inexperienced contractors, where I did the same work as them for half the pay (as they left my title as intern; my boss even said I was promoted to the level of the contractors, but the HR refused to promote me so I kept the same title and pay of intern.  After about a year I finally got officially promoted to their level because my manager put in a word for me, but was still classed as a temp employee (so were all of them.)  I worked very hard regardless of the fact I felt that was unfair.  

Now, we are starting a new project, in which I and one other contractor have been basically put in charge. we have been flown alone to talk to other outsourcing companies and have a greater responsibility than all of the other contractors, However, again there has been no title changes or pay rises to speak of. I was fine with that, except it did make things difficult when we were told to delegate work to people the same level as us.  Finally, my old manager stepped in and promoted one of the laziest contractors to a management role, and everyone on the team became bitter, and weeks later the same HR lady sent out an email to everyone on my project saying we will be extended until the end of the project, but nothing else is lined up for us to do, so it seems like they are getting ready to cut the whole team.  our company's higher-ups and non-contract does not seem to care about the project but corporate and the other companies involved are seriously relying on it.

As I mentioned before, me and this other person are the only ones who can support certain aspects of this.  But as you can see, I have become fed up with the situation and have started putting out applications. Some of them seem to be seriously considering and I already have an interview coming up, but its still uncertain.  Regardless of all of the drama I still like the company a lot, and the people, but the money is small for the type of job and the only rewards many of us have ever seen is simply getting to keep our jobs, there is no upward mobility and I have never seen a salaried employee get hired in my 2 years here. 

My question is, Should I finish out the project and just look when I go on unemployment? I can make that work.  Or, should I continue to put out applications and take any offer that pays more and/or keeps me employed longer than the term my current company is threatening us with?  that seems liek the obvious choice - But I just don't know if its appropriate to leave in the middle of a project I'm carrying so much weight in.  I'm worried that will burn the bridge I have with my current job or managers, but I have heard its normal for employees to quit to take better offers, especially temps, I don't see how they could not expect us to look for other work if we are temps.

TLDR; company dumps more and more responsibility on me without any raise or title increase, and has no guarantee that they will keep us at the end of the project in a few months.  I have applied to several places and have an interview Monday, should I take it or will that damage my standing with my current company?"

I'm in a bit of a weird position. I intended on graduating this month, but I failed a class and have to do some make-up work. Right now I'm unsure if I will be able to make it up in the summer or if I will have to wait until the fall (I should know on Monday). I have a poor GPA and no internships, so I doubt I'll find an engineering job right away, and I feel like I need to be primarily focused on getting something nearby as soon as possible while I search for an Engineering job in the long term. Couple questions:

* What's the best way to phrase that I'm missing a class but otherwise graduated?
* How should I change the formatting/grammar? I feel like the phrasing, periods, wording etc are not totally correct, but I'm not sure what best way to do it is. 
* Should I keep the HS info? Should I add my HS job (Best Buy Computer Sales)
* Should I list my GPA? I ended with a 2.45. Some people have said don't include it because it doesn't reflect that well, some people say not including it is worse than them seeing it because its ""standard info"" and very suspicious when missing. 
* Any other suggestions?
* Are there any tweaks I should do to this when applying for engineering jobs vs non-engineering?

Thanks for the help."

For my ENTIRE LIFE, my mother has been fixated on the idea that I will someday, no matter what, become a doctor (or ""at least a PA""--which is condescending towards a very respectable profession.) This post is exactly what it is: a chunk of anger, sadness, pity, and disgust all packed in one--tl;dr provided.**

To my mother, I am a very expensively-kept treasure of 17.5 years. My success story is the focal point of her life, and she lives vicariously through my academic achievements. Her life has been a hard one-- single parent of 2 divorces, continental migration, cultural shocks, relatives' deaths, self-abnegation, miscarriage, countless sacrifices... At this point, she is almost 50, and is incredibly disillusioned about life.

I pity her, but also feel a tinge of *hatred.* My opinions are always, *without exception,* tossed aside because I haven't experienced as much as she has. Her beliefs are so warped by the torrential negativity of her past that she no longer holds an ounce of faith in taking chances and enjoying life.

Around midnight yesterday my mother came in to give me some snacks, and she noticed that I seemed to be crying. (*eyes red, sniffing nose, etc.*) She asked me why I cried, and I told her that I was just thinking about stuff. She pushed to know more, so I ended up telling her, ""*Y'know, I was just having some doubt about becoming a doctor. I'm not **sure** if I want to be one.*""

And she freaked the fck out. It was *1 A.M.* in apartment complex.

*You don't know anything*, she screamed. *You've never gone through what adults go through. You're JUST a kid. You've never experienced divorce, job hunts, poverty. You've never had to raise  kids alone because your husband was a fking abusive gambler/alcoholic!*

She tells me I'm just a stupid teenager, so I shouldn't complain about potential hardships/loss of experiences during med school or residency. Fck. Then she goes on and says she *loves* me, and wants the best for me.... I don't know what to say to that. She wants to give me financial stability. But **never**, not even once, has she tried to listen to my thoughts or tried to give me advice BASED on my desires. Her obstinacy to keep propping up that framed dream of my financial security fails to include the most important part---*my* feelings. These are some very cringe-inducing angst-filled teenager words, but I said, ""I'm the one who knows myself the best"", no? 

But she denies even this--claiming that a she knows me best. She, a mother who barely talks to her daughter at all except about academic achievements, somehow understands me more than I do.

There is just no. Fcking. Way. That is true.

I wasn't even raised by her from birth. I only came to the US 6 years ago, and that was via her manipulation and deceit. She has always been so sure of my life, somehow, that she readily refuse that I, a human being, might have other priorities in life other than a huge stack of money sitting in my bank. This will undoubtedly sound naiive to many of you, but I want to experience the *world* as a young adult. I want to begin rock climbing, weight-lifting, hiking, mall-shopping... Getting a boyfriend, going out with friends on the weekends, having time for self reflection and perhaps even harmless stupidity... 

But I doubt I can do everything if I have to spend 8 years of my life after college to study something i don't even know if I'm interested in. I was feeling unsure, insecure, and scared... and she shot my worries down without any regard of my feelings. (and she tried to crush my optimism, too) Is it so wrong to desire adventure, life, and new experiences in my twenties? To relax? To embrace ambiguity? She probably cannot even comprehend me. The two of us are citizens of different worlds, and our hearts speak different languages.

Yes, I may be full of a young girl's naivete and slight stupidity. But I want to enjoy this feeling while it is still here. I haven't yet been crushed by the many realities others now live with, but does that really make my opinions *any* less real than an adult's? 

Oh, yeah. When I say I want to go out and experience the world, I don't mean that I want to go full hippie. I just want life in moderation, a balanced amount of fun and investment for future. But she only wants the latter.

There HAS to be some median by which I can travel/have fun but also invest in the me decades from now. But she refuses to believe anything except becoming a physician. *""They all work only 3 days a week,"" she tells me. *""It's hard getting there, but how can you be so lazy? Nothing in life is easy!""

^Notice how she immediately jumps to criticizing me, without trying to truly understand my position.

Right now, she is so intent on protecting me from the horrors of the real world that I have become a fcking **fragile, sheltered, and empty vase** that she locks within a trophy cabinet. To her, I am that beautiful but so easily broken vase that just cannot possibly do anything without her. The suffocating vase that remains empty, that thirsts for sunlight and fresh air. I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT BREAKABLE/EXPENSIVE VASE--I'd be much happier as a cheap rubber bowl that children toss around while playing outside in the parks. Why doesn't she understand that?

We are two totally different people, and I just want to explore potential careers. I'm only 17, but at this rate time will pass and I might hate my job as a doctor---I might hate medical school, residency, and internship. I don't want to become that douchebag doctor who doesn't truly care for patients or staff...

Why is this woman so obsessed with doctors? What the hell? Is a physician the only freaking respectable job out there? (*it's not, i know*) Why can't I question my own future? Don't I have that right?? How can she refuse to even TRY accommodating my personality and feelings? My initial uncertainty was twisted out of proportion into an indication of my rotten character: lazy, naive, &amp; inept. 

**I wish I was joking, but she is the living portraiture of the woman who sang ""Mother Knows Best"" in Tangled. She is the reason that the Disney movie made me cry so many freaking times--embarrassingly in front of friends!** 

Every time I say something she disagrees with, my words are dismissed as stupid gibberish. She forces her ideals down my throat every time we are in the car, and berates me for not being a good daughter. *look who is talking...*

Also, while I understand that some ppl can't pay for college (parents have tradition of not paying or not rich enough...etc)... I understand that, and I sympathize with them. But... BUT. How can a mother ever even THINK to THREATEN her own child about not paying for her college tuition after reassuring her for 5+ years not to worry?

HOW can she call herself a mother while threatening me in every argument with inheritance, college loans, or shelter availability? She may want the best for me, and she may do all this with the best intentions.. but the effects of her actions do NOT correlate with her love.

To me, she is no longer family. I cannot call her ""mother"" without cringing inside. She has become a disagreeable employer who refuse to compromise her opinions/beliefs, *ever.* This is sounding very dramatic, but I am truly shocked &amp; angered by her outward immaturity. She is a smart woman, but why must she treat me with such fickle ... I can't.... Never mind.

I am not perfect either... I shut myself in my room often, and I some times lose my temper. But there is a reason I have always been so aloof to both of my parents....I know she sees me as the most important thing in her life, but I just can't bring myself to love her. Only a bitter taste ever surfaces... Is it pity, sadness, hatred? I don't even know anymore. 

For the past few hours, I've decided to treat her as though I'm in a work setting. Fake smiles, head nods, and ""enthusiastic"" agreements are all I've been doing. I've concealed my true thoughts, but the anger is slowly boiling over. 

I got so angry that I ended up punching the jagged end of my desk... now I have a bleeding and bruised dominant hand. The anger is still there.

I feel better now after I've let this all out on Reddit. Sorry for the long post, but know that you've saved someone from committing something much worse just by reading this. Thank you.

**Tl;dr: Mother has midnight freak session when I said i'm not sure about becoming a doctor. Proceeds to state (calmly) that she would not pay for a penny of my college if I don't major in ""pre-med."" I am disgusted, and can no longer call her mother sincerely without wanting to punch someone or something. Ashamed to be her daughter, and now bleeding from right hand.**

368yf2,0,2015-05-17,22 - I don't know what to do with my life,justletmecreateanacc,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/368yf2/22_i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"Up until I was 14 I was just a normal kid. Kindergarten, elementary school and middle school. No problem, same path for everybody. After that I had to make a decision. I could have gone to high school to get my diploma. Or I could have gone to a ""professional school"" to get schooling on a specific area, for example electrical engineer. I should mention that I live in Italy.

I chose to attend the IT classes. More specifically application development. I made my degree on that 3 years ago, but it doesn't interest me at all. Not one bit. I hate programming. I can see why people love doing it, but it's just not for me. So why did I attend those classes? My father has an IT background and I was a stupid 14 year old kid without any guidance. 

1 year ago the ""professional maturity certificate"" was introduced. Basically you are allowed to catch up on your high school diploma, if you have the degree I made. The hook is: you have to pass an entry exam, which determines if you are allowed to attend this class. I wrote the exam yesterday and I have a bad feeling about it. So what I need is a plan B, in case I failed.

It feels like I wasted the last 3 years, because I was so deep in personal problems like depression and anxiety. At least I have that under control now, but I don't have any skills that would be useful on the job market. My degree isn't really worth anything, since I haven't coded in years. I live with my dad and I hate to feel dependent on him. I'm willing to work hard, but I need to figure out where to start.

I could move to Germany to start an apprenticeship. I could wait another year to do the entry exam again (in case it failed) and go to university after that. I could do an internship and hope they school and keep me. But the bottom line is: It feels like I'm running out of time and people around me expect me to finally amount to something. I guess I am my biggest enemy, since I pressure myself a lot. 

**tl;dr:** How did you figure out what you wanted to do with your life? How did you achieve it? How did you deal with the pressure?

I'm from the UK and about to graduate with a computer science degree (excellent grades and a number of side projects). I've done a couple of internships and have a part-time software related job, so I have a good amount of previous experience to offer.

My previous roles include software development for industrial optical sorting machines, dev work at a crowd-funded startup in the space sector and (currently) system administration / IT support for a midsize upscale business.

I want to relocate to the US to start off my career in the software industry there, preferably under a J1 visa. I'm open to offers anywhere in the continental US, the right job is more important than the location for me.

My particular interest is embedded software (particularly Linux based systems) although I'm also very capable with desktop application development, sysadmin and web backend work. I do a lot of freelance work in my spare time and really enjoy software development. 

I'd say my strength is in my versatility, with good to excellent knowledge of C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, PHP, shell scripting and more.

It's difficult breaking into the industry when there are so many excellent US-based candidates, so I'm turning to the people of Reddit for help. I believe I would be an exceptional candidate for an entry level position and I'm just looking for a company that is willing to give me a chance.

If anyone is interested I'd be happy to send you my resume, just send me a PM.

Thanks and have a great day!"

**Chapter 2: Profiling**

**Date point: 4y 10m 3w 2d AV**

“Age?”

“Seventy years.”

“Height and weight?”

“153 pounds, at least according to my bathroom scale. Almost 5’ 10”.”

“So 5’9” then. Any pre-existing conditions?”

“…Diabetes. Type 2.”

“…Alright. Profession?”

“Pharmacist. Retired.” 

“Any other professions in your life?”

“I was a truck driver back in the army. Went to Vietnam same as anyone else. Didn’t last long though.”

“Were you injured? It doesn’t mention your service in your file.”

“Didn’t think you wanted back that far. But yeah, took some shrapnel to the head. Nothing really serious though. It healed fine after a while. Still, I was gonna need to wear bandages for a while, so they sent me home. Hence not being a truck driver for too long.”

The woman behind the large desk had started typing every time he had answered a question. Ominously, she’d typed for rather a long time when he’d told her he was diabetic. Much longer than was necessary to type in a three word answer. He wasn’t sure why these questions were necessary either, he’d answered all of them on the application she had in a folder right in front of her.

For the first time since the questions began, the middle-aged woman behind the desk, named Ms. Ericson, if the door placard was to be believed, looked at him and stopped typing.

“You know that you can’t possibly be a candidate for work on Cimbrean, don’t you? Your diabetes *alone* disqualifies you from participation in Scotch Creek’s program, as well as pretty much every company currently operating in any space capacity, including ours. It says in your application that you’d applied to most of those places as well. So, why bother?”

“Better chance of getting into space than if I never applied at all.” Frank replied.

“True. Still not much of a chance though…” 

Ms. Ericson seemed to be appraising him before speaking further.

“You don’t qualify for any of our programs Mr. Clark. The application has a list right on page 4, at least half a page long of disqualifying ailments. Diabetes is the third one down. You can’t have missed it.”

Again, she gave him that same appraising look. For a brief moment, despite what she had just said, Frank thought she might be about to offer him a job.

“Why did you apply here?”

“Same reason I just told you about Scotch Creek and all the other corporations.” Frank replied, inwardly exasperated.

“No, you misunderstand my question. Why do you want to go into space? And why are you so desperate to go?”

It wasn’t a question he’d expected to be asked, even though he had some vague ideas bubbling under the surface of his thoughts. He’d written that he wanted to be a colonist, start a new life on another world, but that wasn’t really the truth. It was all he could think that these companies might want to hear, so he’d written it.

“…I dunno… Can I have a second to collect my thoughts, please?”

“Take your time.”

Frank mulled it over, aware that despite her claims that he was unqualified, his answer might actually buy his ticket through a wormhole.

“You remember me telling you I was in Vietnam right?”

“Yes.” 

“I never got a shot off. That explosion that put shrapnel in my head? It was my 10th day in Vietnam. Just driving in a convoy, bright flash, sharp pain, and then I was in a hospital bed three days later. Never even saw the guy who shot at me. Don’t even know what it was he shot my truck with. I always regretted never getting a shot off; not making a difference.”

“You want to go into space because you think you’ll be able to take your shot? To kill for humanity?” 

Her tone was flat; unreadable. 

“God no, it was that I never got to *help!*” 

“I don’t follow.”

Frustrated, Frank reorganized his thought process.

“See, I didn’t get drafted. I volunteered straight out of high school. I wanted to help, y’know? All the posters, the ads, the stories on the radio of the Korean war when I was a kid? I wanted to do my part, even though I didn’t wanna kill people. So I joined. We played army for a bit, and then they stuck me on a plane over the Pacific with my rifle and a duffle bag. I was fucking terrified. When that plane landed, a few of the draft guys refused point-blank to get out. They got dragged off to some brig or something, but not me. I stood up, legs shaking like a baby taking his first steps; ready to go do what I said I’d do for my country and my brothers.”

A pained look crossed Frank’s face, making him look even older than he felt in that moment.

“But just ten days in, before I’d even seen the enemy, and just driving a truck with nothing more exciting in it than some dirty uniforms being taken to the laundry, I see a bright flash, a bang, and wake up with bandages covering half my head…”

Frank looked down, unable to look the woman in the eyes any longer. He’d only ever told this story to one other person, because of how deeply it shamed him.

“I never got to help.”

“…I see.”

Ms. Ericson didn’t laugh or give a pitying look, or give him an amused expression that told him he was too late in life for a second chance like this. She just looked at him, expressionless, studying his face, like she was trying to look past it and see deeper into his intentions.

“Do you think you deserve the second chance?”

Startled, Frank again made eye contact with the woman.

“Deserve? I don’t know that I *deserve* anything. But I’m damn well gonna *try* for my second chance as hard as I can before I let anyone tell me it won’t ever happen.”

Ms. Ericson raised her eyebrows at this, but didn’t comment. Sitting in silence she began to type again on her keyboard. Frank sat motionless, afraid he’d just blown it, but not wanting to risk any more words in case he was wrong. She grabbed the folder with his application in it and added a few papers from one of her drawers. Then, after printing off several pages from her computer, added these to the folder as well.

She stood up from her desk, and, manners ingrained into him by his mother, Frank heaved forward onto his feet as well, earning him a small smile from Ms. Ericson, which he apprehensively returned.

“You don’t need to stand Mr. Clark. Wait here please.”

Then she left, leaving Frank to wonder if he’d ruined the interview somehow.

Minutes passed in silence in the office, with the nervous occupant fidgeting slightly. Frank sat, trying to keep his nagging thoughts at bay. “You’re too old to be of any use and you know it.” “Imagine if you went into diabetic shock up there. You’d be a liability.” “What possible use could they have for you in the future? You still listen to music on a record player; hardly a member of the future of humanity.”

After what felt like an hour, there was a knock on the door, and a young man poked his head in through the door; too young to be anyone of importance in the company. Ah, Frank thought, here’s an intern to tell me, “Sorry sir, you’re not quite the man were looking for. But thanks for coming in.”

But the kid, barely 19 from the looks of him, said, “Ms. Ericson sent me to take you upstairs, would you follow me please?”

Clamping down on the sharp stab of hope that shot through him, and instead assuming what he hoped was a dignified walk, Frank followed the kid down a hallway and around a few turns until they reached an elevator. The kid seemed to be a bit excited, based off of how he kept shifting from side to side in front of the door. 

“I never get to use this elevator.” He said, nervously. He produced an ID badge and held it near the elevator 
doors, which slid open.

Frank followed, wordlessly into the elevator. He felt the subtle shift of the elevator that meant they were moving, and quickly too. The ride took about a minute, and Frank felt both his ears pop before the doors opened to show a man sitting behind a much larger desk than Ms. Ericson’s, who happened to be sitting in a chair near the man.

“Ah, how’s it going Frank? Heard a lot about you from my psych-profiler, Jennifer!” He said, while pointing at Ms. Ericson. “Anyways, Frank, my name is Moses Byron. I’d like to offer you a job.”

36bjzi,7,2015-05-17,"Life seems to be going to shit, and I don't know where to turn.",throwaway89999998,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/36bjzi/life_seems_to_be_going_to_shit_and_i_dont_know/,"I don't know what to do anymore. I had a great vision for my life back in 2011, when I went off to college. I was going to be in the biology field, doing what I really felt compelled to do. But a year into it things weren't looking great in grades, and everyone around me told me I wasn't good for anything except editing and writing essays, and that I should just give up on trying to do anything scienc-y since I wasn't smart enough for it. So I panicked, dropped Biology and took up English, and just...decided that was it.  Graduated last May with an English degree, tried being optimistic, but being denied for every job that is ""in your degree field"" (so far) takes its toll. Was stuck in the same retail job I had in college, with nothing changing for the year and a half I was there. I quit my job (had a lot saved up) because I was going crazy and they were treating me badly, and used the free time to really start applying. Worked hard as hell on my resume. Got a few interviews, but the common trend is that if I'm not denied due to ""not having enough experience in the field,"" then it is because ""I don't seem like an upbeat fellow"" or ""you don't seem like you have the spirit to survive at our company."" 

It has always been like that, for the year I've been applying. Even in retail jobs. I've been denied promotions due to ""not having the [insert company name] spirit"" or because the managers have blatantly told me they despise me. I can never figure out why, they just do. Can't hold a job for long (year and a half was the longest one) because the managers make it a living hell for me, and I just give up. 

After getting over a bad bout of depression, I decided to go back to school and pursue Biology. I always regretted not sticking with it, and even with the massive amount of debt I have I feel like this is the right decision. There's a guaranteed internship which is nice and could lead to a job...but people in my life had berated me for being an ""idiot,"" that it's a waste of money, that I already have a degree and that I've ""dug my hole."" On top of the college telling me that I should have made a better decision and that I'm only allowed financial aid for 2 years due to Post-Baccalaureate status (and that's by law, so I understand, it's just upsetting). 

I don't have a job, paying rent with the money I have saved, and I refuse to go back to retail unless some circumstances compel me to...but I look for jobs every day that could accommodate a school schedule. Roommates constantly dirty the house, tell me it's my job to clean it since I'm a ""dead beat"" who sits at home all day, and they are just ""too busy actually having a life and not being shit"" to clean and that I should be the maid. That I'm ""good for nothing"" and I'm lucky that the landlord doesn't kick me out. Also tell me I'm not good enough for a science degree. All this while I try to look for more jobs in my original degree field.

Family tells me that it's a waste to go back to school and that I'm being a ""dumb ass"" and I should just focus on temporary hiring agencies and to ""at least get money"" even if it's ""not what you want to do,"" and that it's immature to want to strive for something better at the moment. 

I know this is long, I know I've ranted, and I suppose I really do give a shit if I went through the trouble to make a separate account to post this, but I have too many people IRL who know my reddit name and I don't want it to be associated with it...but I'm seriously sitting here getting drunk, locked in my room, crying, and contemplating giving up permanently. I just...really need advice from people who don't know me. I'm tired of being berated by the people in my life when I ask for advice.

I honestly don't know what to do with myself or my life anymore."

36blwe,2,2015-05-17,Give a recent grad career insight?,ValuingPotential,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/36blwe/give_a_recent_grad_career_insight/,"First off I want to thank everyone who takes the time to read this post and write a response. Your time is valuable and I appreciate it. 

Next I'd like too give a little about my education and work history. I was home-schooled through grade school, got excelled marks on my standardized tests, and was accepted into colleges' honors programs with academic scholarships. I chose a state university and chose class a curriculum that would hopefully lead me into the field of genetics. I took an assistant job in the biology research lab, and was prepared to take on the world. In my second semester, Chemistry II slapped that idea to the ground, my gpa suffered and I no longer qualified to be in the honors program, but otherwise I was able to get my science pre-reqs out of the way.

No worries, the honors-only entrepreneurship class made me realize I only wanted to get into genetics so I could one day direct futuristic research labs anyway. I changed my major to communications with a minor in business focusing on marketing (In hindsight I see that I should have switched my major to general business and done discovery courses, but I'm bad at asking for help from my advisers). 

My communications and marketing classes were a breeze, I had joined a Fraternity, and I was able to spend most of my time socializing. That all changed when I took an intro to world politics class taught by a seasoned war vet. Suddenly my paltry marketing quizzes became 30+ page, single spaced essays and hundreds of pages of reading. By the end of my Junior year I had switched my major to Political Science focusing on classes in international political economics. I dreamed of working for Goldman Sachs or a hedge fund, managing multinational firms and millions in assets, jet setting the globe.

In this time I assisted in starting a local humanitarian non-profit (which has been very successful and I now sit on the board), I obtained two internships in marketing, one at a popular regional music hall and the second at a crowd sourcing design start up, and I performed freelance marketing services for multiple small business (primarily through social media).

Because I was financing my own education, because I was feeling under a lot of pressure, and because I was still behind on degree credits; I took a year off. I worked as a server, continued my freelance work, stayed involved at the non-profit and thought about what to do next. Finally in the Fall of 2013 I graduated with a BA in Political Science and quickly found a part-time job at an international humanitarian aid office doing marketing. Because of the take-home pay at that job, I also worked in sales at a hip new vapor shop on campus.

Out of the blue I met a woman who had just started a one-woman consulting business for small clients, was looking for someone with my talents, and wanted me to start right away. Cut me a check for two weeks pay on the spot. I eagerly hopped on board and left my other jobs without doing my due-diligence and getting the right paperwork in order. I got caught up in her extravagant Rolodex. For one reason or another we dissolved our arrangement, with me feeling like I had not been fully recompensed. C'est la vie.

With all that being said, I still like the idea of jet setting and having lots of assets at my disposal. I'd like to eventually run entrepreneurial projects from the small scale in the arts to the large scale in technology and philanthropy. People like Richard Branson and Elon Musk inspire me. I read the economist, Inc, and The New Yorker, I listen daily to podcasts on current events, I have a strong interest in international business and politics, finance and investment, arts and culture, emerging markets and technology. I could see myself working for an investment firm or fund, a think tank, or any multinational.

Since January I have been doing ""extremely well,"" as a GNC Salesperson, according to my manager. I have entertained the idea of doing sales as a career in the past, but foolishly thought I needed something that challenged me more. I was listening to a guest on Bloomberg's Masters In Business podcast who said his life turned around after he did the job he was well suited for, rather than going after the ""sexy"" job. I have been earning my own money since I was 16 and have years of customer service and sales experience under my belt. Perhaps sales and account management is the path for me?

However, I still want some opinions. 
I'm in Toronto. I applied to a few Life Science programs and a few Engineering programs. I do not know why I did not apply to CS. People ask me that a lot. Anyways, I am interested in neuroscience, cs (ofc), robotics, biomedical engineering, computers, etc etc. I've also recently stumbled upon neural networks and am starting to read computer science related books and will probably do something cool once school ends.

So the problem is, I didn't make it into a good engineering school (Waterloo and Toronto). However, I did make it into UofT and Ryerson University Biomedical Engineering, which is not as reputed. I might switch to ECE there instead of doing biomed.
I may attempt to switch into U of T CS, or double major in Neurosci/CS. It may be hard to do this. Their internship program is pretty good. My friend is also ditching eng and going to CS, he says UofT is in top 10 or 20 in the world for CS. Meanwhile it's going to be hard to get any internships for engineering, as it is overshadowed by UofT in the same city and the job market isn't quite good for engineering here. I may go to grad school, and definitely aim high, so I don't know where that will lead me to. I also don't want to end up in a random codemonkey job.

But I am also thinking of going to UofT Life Sci and switching into CS or double majoring CS/Neurosci. Is there a chance I will be stuck in Life Sci? Will CS courses will up quickly? How would I go about doing this? I do some CS courses this year and then apply for a subject POST in CS? Also, I do not want to pass up on UofT, considering it is one of the top places in the world for CS. And I do enjoy neuroscience too. From what I've heard, PEY &gt; Rye IIP.

After receiving offers from 2 different companies I declined the one that I not only didn't want to work at but was also offered nearly minimum wage as my payment ($10/hr). When I declined the offer the CEO (small company) asked what my deciding factor was.To let her save face I told her that I couldn't accept her wages because I didn't want to tell her that I don't care for her company culture and the way she treated me during the interview process. Its not my place to tell her what kind of human being to be after all. She then emails me back ripping into me and how I barely deserve their offer and how they were taking a chance on me. Do you put this sort of thing on any website so other developers know about this or what would you do exactly? I don't want anyone to go through this because it was quite immature and unnecessary. 

EDIT: Thanks so much for all the advice you guys/gals! Lots of support coming from all of you feels good I have to admit. I'd like to clear two things up. 1) I will not be replying to her in any fashion. Nothing I can say from here on out will have any positive impact on the situation. 2) I'm actually a CS Minor with a Bachelor's degree in saxophone performance. The only reason I know $10 is too little is because my last internship paid me $20 to do web programming when I have never even written a single line of HTML/CSS/Javascript. They could take I just work hard and care I guess. Also, the average for our area is $16 so I knew I was getting undercut. Thanks again though guys.

I'm not really sure what I'm trying to get out of this but I just need to tell someone. This other person and I live in 2 different states, I'm in NY and he's in MI, we're both 24 years old guys. I've been best friends with him for 4-5 years, we met on playing a game on xbox live and it eventually lead to us talking and texting everyday where we would talk about basically everything in our lives, it was always fun and I always looked forward to talking to him. Now I’m a very shy and quiet person so I don’t really have any friends where I live so this summer I was going to move to Michigan if I could get an internship there to be near him and permanently move there after I had graduated from college this fall. So I did end up getting an internship and was planning to move there this week until today where he suddenly said he didn't want to talk to me anymore.

I guess I'll list some events so you can get a better understanding of the situation. 

Last summer he said that he was thinking about going to New Jersey to see a concert with his gf around New Years and since I was in much better financial standing than he was so I got both of them tickets to the concert so he would come to NJ.

In November I had free time so I went and visited him in Michigan but his gf had an attitude the entire weekend I was there and threw a fit one day because she thought she wouldn't be seeing him for the entire day even though she was going to be hanging out with us so I was stuck in a hotel room for 6 hours while he calmed her down but despite this it felt like we both had a good time and I ended up dismissing his gf's attitude as maybe she was having a bad couple of days.

Then when New Years was approaching my friend tells me that we wouldn't see each other when he came to NJ because his gf wasn't ok with us hanging out for reasons I still don't know. So it felt pretty obvious to me that his gf just hates me so I told my friend that I didn't want to pay for her ticket anymore because of her attitude she had when I visited in MI and saying she didn’t want me and my friend to hangout in NJ but we ending up arguing and he took it as I was trying to ruin his entire vacation and ended up buying new tickets to the concert even though I never said I cancelled the tickets I bought or got them refunded. So we weren't talking, they came and went and we didn't hangout or anything.

The week after they got back I went to Michigan again to try and talk to him to try and fix things. We met up for dinner and talked things out and he said he forgave me, we were friends again and still wanted me to move to Michigan. Between then and now we talked sporadically every couple of weeks but it definitely didn't feel the same to how we used to talk so I ended up asking every couple of times we talked if he still wanted me to move and he always said yes.

So a month ago I tell him I was able to get an internship in Michigan and I would be going there the week before Memorial Day to which he responded ok great that sounds cool. Then a week after I told him this he stops responding to any of my texts and phone calls up until this morning when he tells me that he doesn't want to talk to me anymore, that he doesn't forgive me for the NJ thing. He said he was trying to tell me this months ago but I still have all the texts and he didn't do any of that especially since every time I had asked if he still wanted me to move there he said yea. I tried pleading with him to just talk to me so we could figure this thing out but he didn't want to and now has blocked me on all social media sites. 

I just haven't been able to stop crying all of today, I'm just completely lost and I don't any idea what to do or think right now.

I want to relocate to England from eastern Europe (please don't hate me) and I found out that it is extremely hard to get to the first interview because of lack of degree ;(


I actually finished 2,5 years of University where i learned a lot about programming but then quit due to economic situation and started full time job (not software development but related). Recently I finished my 6-months developer internship (really good one, where i was developing popular web application, bug fixing, supporting etc.).


Because my country is not a nicest place to live I don't want to start a new job here. Unfortunately it seems that person like me have no chance to get a job in UK. I would get over it if not the fact that I'm not even invited for interviews so I can't really show what I can do. I'm rejected right away.

Interned last summer with a small-mid sized software company with around 150 people, 7 years. The whole time was devoted to a django financial app, developed entirely by the other intern and me. Very positive experience, performance and relationships were developed. 

**Problem:** Since I've left they have hired an on-board technical recruiter and an official apprenticeship program (3-6 months) which sounds nearly identical to my past experience working with them, except I'll be paired with another developer instead of intern. I'm interviewing with them in a few days and am expecting an offer of $20-25 an hour (medium cost of living) because it's an ""apprenticeship"".  

**Current Situation:** In the meantime, I have been applying to many different data scientist, economist, and software engineering roles that my high level math background qualifies me for. I'm also fortunate to have both parents highly successful executives which has allowed me to send my CV and resume directly to the right hands of several companies and CEO's. Responses so far have been quick and more than encouraging. 

**Questions:** My current plan is to take the interview as normal but defer a decision for whatever time we determine reasonable. However it's unlikely I will take the offer at all, instead just buying time to come back with other concrete offers and make the case that I want either a job or to be compensated competitively. 

1. Is this a reasonable course of action? Am I burning bridges by asking for a job after the fact?

2. How much time should I expect to defer a decision?

2. Would I be limiting my future opportunities/networking by moving to a northern big, but not tech focused city instead of say Boston, Chicago or Los Angeles?

* I was in an abusive relationship for about 2 years, the relationship itself latest 5 years, but didn't become abusive until the last two. During that time he stole money from me, verbally assaulted me, made me feel like I was a crazy person (gaslighting), made me feel like everything was my fault. He would physically get rough with me (grabbing, shoving, pushing me), he was an alcoholic as well so he would even throw empty beer bottles at me. He sexually abused me, he would walk in on me taking a shower to look at me, or he would grab me sexually and wouldn't stop when I said no. He would force  sex on me when we were in bed together, I'd try to say no, pretend to be asleep or not move but he would continue. Eventually he would get extremely angry when I said no, so I just stopped saying no and just lied there. This happened to me on more occasions that I can recall (I'd guess in between 20-30 times). I felt suicidal during this time in my life, and just frequently imagined and hoped that I wouldn't wake up the next day. Ironically, I feared that he would eventually killed me or put me in the hospital if I stayed with him. I even tried to break up with him multiple times, and he wouldn't leave. I had to lie about the lease on the place we were living in in order to trick him to move out. After that relationship ended I experienced what I now know was PTSD. I would have frequent nightmares about him, I would relive the same horrible situations over and over and over and over again in my head. The emotions I felt from simply remembering those times were just as strong, if not stronger, than the actual experience. I went into a deep depression and lived my parents for two years. I slept all day during the day, and stayed up all night drinking or screwing around on the internet. I ended up gaining about 50 lbs and I didn't really work during this time. I had some internships and volunteered at places every now and then, but it was really just to keep up a facade of being a normal person. So when people asked me ""so, what did you do this day/week?,"" instead of saying the truth ""I cried myself to sleep around 6am in the morning after staying up all night playing video game, slept till 4pm in the afternoon and then ate a shit ton of unhealthy food because 'fuck it.'"" I could say instead ""Well, I'm taking this class right now and we get to volunteer at a local non profit to learn how it works. So I've been going to this non profit and learning about X,Y,Z."" I just started to do things to make myself look normal to my friends and family...which didn't take a lot of effort. Since that relationship ended I've been a lot more guarded with my emotions, I'm use to my thoughts and feelings being used as a weapon against me. It has been 8 years since that relationship and I can say that I've made great strides in the past  2 years to improve my life. I still have nightmares, but they are not as frequent. There are still some memories I have of that relationship that I've thought about every single day, and I hate it. 

* I have two male cousins (brothers), one a year younger and one a year older. I am female, and in the middle. When the 3 of us were very young my older cousin would have us expose our genitalia to one other, or touch each other. I guess to some extent this is normal for very young children who are curious. However, as we aged my younger cousin and I didn't want to do this anymore, but the older one kept pressing us to things we were uncomfortable with. The older cousin threatened us by saying he would tell our parents and that we would get in trouble. Every time I would visit my grandparents my older cousin would want to see, touch and would be rough with my genitalia. He would make me touch him too. I remember being old enough to know this was wrong, but I didn't know how to respond. Eventually I just started to ignore him, or make sure the 3 of us were never alone and the instances stopped. No one knows about this, my parents and my cousins parents don't know. I haven't spoken to this at all with my younger cousin, and I'm sure he remembers. 

* I have another sexual memory that I'm not even sure is true or not. I may have been around 4-5 years old, and a man is attempting to trick me to get me to touch his penis. He has a cloth or something wrapped around him, and his penis coming through a hole. He is tell me that this is some sort of animal he found, like a worm that can grow. He tells me to pet it and watch it move around and grow. I honestly can't tell if this is just a fabricated memory from childhood, or something I've repressed. If it is true, I can't remember who it was, I just know I'm related to this person. 

Here are some non sexual things, that aren't as bad but still suck: 

* I suffered from severe asthma as a child. There have been multiple times in my life where I just stopped breathing and thought I was going to die. Not sure if this is something that could affect your mental health, but it's a big part of my life regardless. 

* I was the poorest kid in a private religious school. My mom worked two jobs so she could give me a good education. Which sounds great in theory... except when you are told that you and your family are going to hell on a regular basis because you don't go to church. Or how the teachers treat you as an idiot because you accept evolution. I felt either scared about going to hell or like I was a crazy person for understanding evolution all throughout elementary school. 

* I've been in two long term relationships where the other person broke up with me by using the no contact method. Basically one day after a year and half they drop off the face of the earth. They don't pick up your calls, they don't return texts, and just ignore any private messages sent to them. In both instances I felt like I was going crazy, I thought I had done something wrong, or they were cheating, or they were angry at me, etc. I got no answers, no closure. 

The only thing that has kept me going is the notion of ""keeping up appearances."" I needed to make my life look as normal as possible - I needed to get a job - once I got that, I moved out of my parents. Once I moved out I need to be activate and lose weight, so I lost the 50 lbs I gained. I needed to make more money, I got promoted. My lowest point was 8 years ago when I ended the abusive relationship, after that ended I didn't see myself as a person anymore. I felt like I was robbed of my humanity and I was just a shell of a person. I've done a lot in the past 8 years to build a pretty good life for myself, but I've only gotten this far because I've just wanted to look normal. I don't know what to do with that. Eight years ago I started to develop a mental checklist of what it takes to be a person, and I've checked off all of the tics. I have improved a lot, but I'm still so angry, bitter and sometimes jealous of others who haven't been through as much pain as me. I still feel a lot of regret and sadness for myself. I think about how it could have been better, I think about how much further a long in life I would be right now. I know something isn't right in regards to my mental health, I just don't know what it is. "

As the title eluded to, I am currently a rising senior in the BS program at a small private liberal arts college with a locally respected CS program.

A little about myself: I am older than most of my peers (just turned 25), since I left college after my Freshman year due to family issues and deciding to join the Army. I did very well my first semester of freshman year (3.7 gpa) but flunked all my Spring classes because I just didn't show up. I left to join the Army and after getting out and returning to school in 2013 (4 years later) I have maintained a 3.9 overall with a 4.0 in my major CS classes. By the time I am ready to apply I will have two strong internships under my belt (1 already completed, one beginning June 1st) as well as research experience with one of my professors. I don't have many personal projects, aside from a few websites I did for clients and some substantial academic projects. Basically, what I would like to know is what you all may think my prospects of getting into a top tier masters program would be? Is it worth it at this point in my life to continue with school and not enter the industry until I'm 27 or graduate next year and just enter the work force? Thanks for your responses in advance!"

Currently 23 years old with no real obligations and an intense desire to escape the mundanity of the midwest and move back to the country of my ancestry. I've researched this move religiously for months now and I still haven't been able to hash out a plan I am comfortable with so I was hoping to receive some input from you all. 

Some background on my skills. I graduated from a large public university with a degree in Information Systems and Russian Language. After school I found a job working at a very respectable large, multinational healthcare IT firm hear in the midwest as a Sys. Admin. I am currently approaching one year at this job and pretty good at what I do (Linux, VMware, Oracle, SQL). From a language standpoint I know Russian at an intermediate level and have begun learning German from a private tutor. I am a very quick learner when it comes to languages but I've gleaned from other posts that basic German won't really get me anywhere. I'd have to take a job that communicates in English and then get fluent while living there.

Moving forward - I was wondering what you guys think of my prospects if I were to move to Frankfurt/Berlin/Munich to look for a job in IT (in English)? I've heard mixed results on how hard it is to get jobs in Germany without prior EU work experience. I also realize Germany has the special Blau Karte program for people with ""special skills"" but I don't really know what they mean by special? Do my IT skills quialify? Are there ways to land an internship there? I frequently visit toytowngermany.com and they have jobs in English but I feel as if my chances are poor since I currently live in the USA, essentially requiring me to move there for any real shot at a job. I'd be willing to look for work outside of my field as an English teacher but I've read recently that that field is becoming saturated. Would getting a language certificate increase my chances? 

I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty and bust my ass to make it there, but lately I've been wondering if it is indeed possible? I look forward to hearing your comments, help and criticism.

The company is very nice, everyone I've met has been great and it pays great, but in my first month I feel very under worked amongst people who seem very busy. The small tasks I've been given have taken me no more than a couple days and usually I get them done even faster. My boss seems very happy with my work so far and has even complimented me on being able to learn fast. However, once I'm done, he usually just says ""Okay just stay busy"".... I'd like to know what that means to you guys... Especially those of you in management. 

I've tried learning some new CS stuff, but youtube is blocked and thats where most of my favorite resources are. I also don't want to just goof around online because it seems like everyone else is working hard! And don't want to bug my manager too much for stuff to do because after all, I'm an intern and I'm sure hes got better things to do than worry about keeping me busy. 

Overall, I just don't want to feel lazy! So has anyone else been in this position and what did you do? Also for people who manage interns and engineers, what would you want me to do if I haven't been assigned a project."

I was hired by my school that I had my senior internship at because they enjoyed me as a member of the staff, but at the end of this year I was told I was not going to be renewed. 

It has always been a dream of mine to go overseas and teach English in other countries, namely Korea. I have always been in love with the culture, respect for teachers, and general enthusiasm for life there. I have two good friends who work teaching English in Korea and they both absolutely love it. 

I'm worried though. I'm out of a job in three weeks and I am on the hunt for a new position, but in my heart I know I truly want to teach in Korea and follow my dream while I am still young, unsettled, and able. I'm afraid that I won't have the opportunity when I am older.

But I'm also afraid of how this could affect my chances of being hired again once I return. Will leaving to teach overseas result in my degree being a waste of time? What if I stay for 5 years and come back and have an expired teaching license? I am really at a loss and torn between what I should do.

Where can I go from here?,campbbre,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/36gp7c/i_have_a_strong_feeling_my_summer_internship/,"Bear with me here: Bit of background. I am a University student studying aerospace engineering and physics and I just finished my junior year. As we all know, this summer's internship is an important step in determining your career path. It also looks pretty awful if you are unemployed the summer before you begin to look for full time positions. Now my situation: I was offered an internship with a company (fairly small) via email in mid April after interviewing and yadayada. Since then I have been trying to get information out of anyone that I can about compensation, start-date, end-date, etc. Literally anything. I really wanted to work for this company, so I stopped looking for jobs once they extended this offer. May have been naive, but I guess I thought an offer was binding, especially a written offer. Like I said before, I have tried getting hold of anyone for about a month and occasionally an email was answered with something along the lines of ""yes, we are meeting to talk about said questions this week."" This happened 3 times. I finally got one of them on the phone last Friday and he seemed to be a bit confused about why I was calling, saying they had hired their six interns for the summer already. I explained I was one of them, but to no avail. I requested to speak with the CEO (interviewed me and offered me the position, again remember smallish company), but he was in a meeting. I immediately sent him an email requesting he call me, but surprise! No call. I plan on calling him again tomorrow, but now I am concerned that they somehow screwed me over and I am not sure what I can do about it. Is an email offer binding (by all moral and professional means)? How do I approach the phone call? If he does renege, what options do I have? I have a personal project I am working on, but I feel like we are conditioned to believe a junior year internship is the end all be all. Can someone please reassure me and guide me in the right direction?"

I've been applying to a lot of places but not too many calls or emails back about interviews. Today, I did get an email an email about an interview and I was excited. I started to read about the company and I drove out to make sure I knew the place. 

Out of curiosity, I looked up employee reviews and read something that made me uncomfortable. Wages were cut in half after a couple of months because they didn't like the results from the lab. The person writing the review said that their position was a research assistant (the position I'm applying for), but they were treated and classified as interns. Management only appreciate results that work in their favor and anything that doesn't is the fault of the one who did the experiment. Overall, the reviewer said that no one has left on good terms with the company and rated the experience with 1 star.

I don't want to copy and paste the review because I don't want this coming back to me somehow. I could only find one review for the company online so maybe I could brush this off as ""the *one* bad experience* or something. I'm not sure how I should take this. If it turns out that I do the interview, get accepted, and everything the reviewer says is true, I'm going to feel bad knowing that I knew this before hand and was in a position to decline. However, I need a job soon and I haven't heard back from any other places yet. How should I be approaching all of this?"

She said she barely wants to ever get out of bed and wants to just be alone. I am the only person she will spend any amount of time with. She does nothing all day, begs me to come over when I get home from work, and then just pulls me into bed she she can cuddle up next to me and rest. It has been hard emotionally to see her like this. In a few weeks, however, she is headed to Hawaii for an internship, and I am really worried that she will sink into an even more intensive depression, despite the fact that she says that she thinks it will help her ""find herself."" She also agreed to begin taking her medicine again.

In order for her to focus on getting better, we agreed that taking a  break over the summer would be best. Even if we don't end up together, I will be alright with it. She isn't just a girl I care about romantically; she is also a very good friend, and I want to help in any way that I can, but I don't know how to.

36jelv,3,2015-05-19,Scripting/Macro help,CptComputer,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/36jelv/scriptingmacro_help/,"Hey everyone,

This is my first post here, but I've been lurking for a while now and I think this is the best place to get some help with my question. So here's the explanation of the situation and what I'm looking for:

I am an intern at the local community college, as part of my internship I have been tasked with the exportation and archiving of class data off of blackboard (if anyone is familiar with BB I am not sure, but its used a lot for online classes and many other things). The task is straightforward enough, yet going to be very monotonous going through and individually clicking to archive well over 1000 classes. So I'm looking for some way to automate, click the class, click archive/export, and wait for an email informing me that the task is complete. Then I need to transfer the archived data to an external hard drive. I would also like to account for possible delay in page loads by incorporating short waits before clicks as well.

Naturally, not wanting to get carpal tunnel, I started thinking and researching my options to automate this.

From my research so far, which I will admit has not been very in depth at this stage, it appears that a macro recording program may be my best option. I found one from a company called jitbit, its $39 for the basic version of their software and that's not a terrible price, but I'd like to do this for free or at least as cheaply as possible. 

So my questions are: is this my best option, or are there other viable ways of achieving my goal? I have very little scripting or coding experience, but I am willing to learn, would it be possible? Does anyone have any experience using jitbit or any other similar software for a task such as this?

I am open to any and all opinions or advice with this. Thanks to everyone here in advance."

I accepted an internship out of town for this summer. I was a Freshman at a good state school with a pretty good GPA. Now I've graduated my freshman year.

I've been learning some from the other developers but so much of what they are saying goes RIGHT over my head. Many times I'm so completely lost I just want to quit and go back home (I can't). I don't think I can learn all of these technologies in time to do any meaningful work in 12 short weeks.

Warning, this isn't really a TIFU I guess but I just thought if do this. Sorry if anyone gets mad or upset. 

So this TIFU actually happened today.
I am I junior in high school and I'm planning my future like most kids do. I have decided to become a nurse which I'm very excited for. I have an intern job over the summer at one of the local nursing homes. For me to actually get into it and do it, I needed a physical. Now off topic, I have a girlfriend  that I've been with for about 4-5 months, during these months we have has some sexual activities that were great. Now back to the story. I'm 17 and since I'm not 18 I can't go into the office without a parent. I told my mom to get me signed up for a physical and it happened to be today.

We arrive at my doctors office, sign in and wait. I was well aware of the questions that would be asked but never knew when. We walk into the office after the nurse checks my height.(6'1) we sit down and the normal procedure starts. 

Fast forward about 10 minutes in. The great sexual questions pop in. I sat in the chair without my shoes on for a while then decides to put them on. My mother, sitting across from me is answering the family questions is ""kids"" don't know about. So I'm tying my shoes. Then out of nowhere she asks me THE question us men hate to answer in front of our parents, "" Are you sexually active?"" My face turns bright red, but luckily my fave was down so I can see my shoe. There was a pause which seemed to go on forever. I panicked and said the wrong answer. I said ""yes"".  I mean I'm being honest but my mom was right there. 

Fast forward to about 4:30 pm, est. I come home from school and my aunt is there. My mom, at work. My aunt tells me to talk with her about ""sex"". Ugh great just what I want. She tells me that my mom isn't upset but she thinks I broke her heart. And being the guy I am, I would like to always have my mom be happy. 

Now I don't know what to do. My mom and I haven't talked all day   i don't want it to become awkward and us never talk, because like most kids, I love my mom.I told my mom I was sorry but I don't think that fixes anything. If anyone, ANYONE, had about the same experience happen, tell me what I should do.

Any input would be awesome.   Here's my situation:

I've been accepted to both USC's Marshall and Univ. of Texas' McCombs full-time programs.  Scholarships played out so when factoring cost of living, its pretty much a wash between the two schools, so I can eliminate that from the equation.  
My goals: I'd like to start a business eventually, and am planning on using the various entrepreneurial resources at whichever schools to test out some ideas.  Both programs seem to be very strong in entrepreneurship.  If whatever ideas take off while in school, I'll run with it, if not, no sweat, I'll learn from the experience.  While that's going on in the background, I'll be focusing on technology, aiming to get an internship / full-time job at a high-tech firm doing product development, project management, or strategy, depending on the company.  I currently live in San Diego, and love southern California.  I've lived a lot of places but never Texas, however Austin seems like a great place.  Socially I have a ton of friends in LA and only 1 or 2 in Austin.  
Texas seems to be the higher ranked school in most categories, and USC has been on a bit of a skid in rankings but seem to be righting the ship.  USC is known for its Alumni, and that would be key for starting a business.  
Texas seems to have a strong foothold in the tech sector, but USC is capitalizing on ""Silicon Beach"".

I'd say the 5 cities I could most see myself living in post-MBA would be: San Diego, Denver, LA, San Fran, and Phoenix.

I'm a front-end dev with 2 years of experience (excluding internships) and I'd like to know how you guys can spot a good or 'bad' front-end developer. Why am I asking? Because I'm currently working at a web agency company where there was only one front-end developer before I started there. That front-end dev has 10 years of experience and is said to be a 'good developer' by colleagues. I am almost certain that he's considered a good developer because the websites he makes look nice. Does that make someone a good front-end dev? Because when I check his code I can see so many things that (I think) could be better. I started at the company because I want to improve and become a better (maybe the best!) front-end developer. And I'm wondering if I'm at the right place.

For example he has never heard of the term BEM before. What kind of front-end dev has not heard of this and is not using this? Also sometimes he makes stylesheets with ALL styles in 1 file. He says he does it so he can work faster and he will (or will not) divide them into partials later on. Now he doesn't do that anymore after I told him though. He only recently started using preprocessors. He seems the be behind on some things. More importantly he has alot of indented code. Some selectors can be like .class li a .child strong. Also code reusability is a biggy. I always try to make things as modular as possible. So if you move that same element somewhere else you expect it will work in the same way. But he adds layout styles to the modular class itself. For example a button which always has margin-top: 20px;. What if you re-use that same button somewhere else? If I point it out to him he does change it. But I shouldn't have to do this right? He should know this.

Don't take me wrong, he makes good looking websites and is pretty good at js and webdesign as well. I just expected more. I expected someone who is a master at html/css/js.

So I'm wondering if this is how a front end dev with 10 years of experience operates. Are there any other people with similar experiences? I sometimes feel like I know things better but he has more experience so 'he should know the better way'."

I was handling two projects (which is a lot, since they involve community work, coordination with several people involved, monitoring and doing reports) and I was fine with the work load since I really like challenges and learning new things.

This year, a shiny new project appeared and while I was not initially involved, I'm good with that particular subject and slowly I began to get more and more involved. That specific project needs an obsessive attention to detail (which is an skill I don't have) and I have made several mistakes, not too big, but still. To make things worse, that project is taking a lot of my time, since I need to focus more for those tiny details and I'm neglecting my main projects, which are the base for my work evaluation. And it was less than stellar last year.

I've told my boss several times to resign from the task but we can't hire a new person right now, so basically I was told to keep at it. We have a young guy as an intern doing some of the more routine tasks but he also goes to university so his help is limited. The other guy who is responsible of this project is also very busy with other tasks related to his project and to other projects. So, if it isn't me, nobody else can do that.

I'm at my limit. Aside from the two projects I had last year, I have this new project, and a new one (related to those two I handle) has came up. Oh and also I'm expected to do yet another project. So that makes 5 projects and that's a lot for a single person to handle. I'm also studying for a master's degree and seriously I don't know how I've managed to keep my sanity up to this point. I'm an Aspie and I have been VERY close to have a full meltdown at the office. Thankfully I have had those under control but one of this days I know I'm going to blow up and things are not going to be so good since my meltdowns involve a lot of sarcasm, shouting at people and crying. No good at all. 

So, how can I tell my boss that I can't handle all of that before I explode? I really don't want to disclose being an Aspie. I'm not from US or Europe and disability aids are non-existing here and autism is still not well understood. "
36n3sg,7,2015-05-20,Getting first programming job as a recent grad in Kansas City,BenMcLean,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36n3sg/getting_first_programming_job_as_a_recent_grad_in/,"I am in somewhat of a unique and seemingly disadvantageous situation here and could really use some advice as to my next move. I've looked at some of the FAQs and they seem to be telling people to do stuff that it's too late for me to have done at this point.

I love programming. Always have. It's something I'm good at, and probably better at than most of my classmates in college -- although not as good as people with real professional experience I'm sure. But my point is that I really want to do some programming, not IT or academic research.

I have a visual disability ([congenital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder) [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus)) so that my vision is bad enough that I cannot obtain a driver's license, but good enough that I can't seem to qualify for aid to the blind. In 2008, I found it was impossible to get started in any professional job without a degree.

So I worked very hard over the past 6 years to make it through college mostly on student loans. Last week, I graduated from UMKC with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a second full Bachelors of Arts in Philosophy. I took up the philosophy because I needed something that would be easy (easy for me anyway) to space out the more difficult math courses (I had to take Calculus II three times before I passed it) so that I didn't have to take them on all at once. And then it was just one more semester's worth of classes to turn it into a full Bachelors so I went with that.

I had to be enrolled full time to keep my college apartment (since as a non-driver, living on campus was mandatory for my situation, not optional) and work-study job and I couldn't get into any internships because getting transportation to the internship and back to the college in time for classes every day just wouldn't work for a non-driver. So I was struggling to pass those last few classes right up until finals week. I made it! And so I'm starting my jobs search only now, in late May.

Unfortunately, I seem to be finding that most, if not all employers expect you to have either experience from an internship or else at least a 3.0 GPA to get started as a developer and I have neither. My major GPA is 3.0, but my cumulative GPA's pretty pathetic. (2.3) Although I'm looking at a few grade replacements the college should have done that might bump it up a bit, it's not gonna be a 3.0.

So how does someone in this situation find work? It seems like a really daunting task. I'm nervous as hell talking to employers, and that comes out as talking way too much. But I have come up with a [decent looking resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N0Wsa2RfejpCZMTgrDndLLlzLMDjiyQuTquaXRIpQas/edit?usp=sharing). I am confident that if I can get into a place that's willing to train me in how to use their tools, I can contribute and succeed. But getting that first start is the trouble. Any suggestions?

What kind of companies should I be looking for and where should I be looking for them?

What salary should I be asking for?

Is there anything I can do ***at this point*** to improve my chances of reaching my goal? (I don't want to hear about stuff I should have done while I was in college. It's too late for that)"
36n522,2,2015-05-20,"Mechatronical engineering, advice please?",BadBrooder,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/36n522/mechatronical_engineering_advice_please/,"Welcome r/EngineeringStudents, I come to you seeking answers and help.
*Little backstory:* I'm currently studying mechatronical engineering at one of the polish Technical Universities. For those who are not aware what mechatronics is (don't feel bad, by my experience few people are), it's a mix of different fields consisting of mechanics, electronics and IT. 
This is my fourth semester so far and in 3 years I should be looking for a job. When I began my studies there were 120 of us, now we're closing on to 30.


*Why am I here?*
 I'm not writing this to whine, even if I cursed my choice on more than one occasion, I'm generally quite pleased. If this subreddit teached me something important about getting a degree it's that engineering is usually not an easy career choice and if you are studying it, complaining comes naturally with it. 

The simple facts are, by studying a synergic subject as complex as mine, you can't hope to learn everything there is to know about mechanics or electronics, therefore I have some question to those more advanced in their studies or simply wiser than me.

 1. Should I focus on some aspect of mechatronics rather than the whole?

 2. What are the probable career paths for someone like me around the world?

 3. Is internship at Nokia or other software based company a good choice? (I've had courses on C, C++, C# &amp; Assembler)

 4. Should I consider switching fields if the current one shows little promise or is it too late? (In poland we get first degree in 3,5 years so, I'm rather close.)

 5. For european students: do you recommend mechatronical engineering in your University? Yes/no, why, where? Should I think about going there for a semester or two?

I will be 25 at the time of graduating.  I did a 1 year internship but that was in 2012 (I took some ""personal"" time off from school and work due to a DWI I needed to fight) in software dev with a state agency.  I then did 1 year jr sysadmin/help desk work for another state agency, then another 1 year end user support for a different agency.  All jobs were internship/temp but I definitely received good training which made me an all around better ""tech"" employee, and good references.  Now, application development is my passion and I definitely want to steer my career in that direction.  I have a ton of sample code and spent a good majority of my teenage years coding (starting from age 12).  I would consider myself a mid level JEE developer and a mid level PHP5 dev (with a VERY strong knowledge of SQL and PL/SQL), I just don't have the enterprise experience behind me.  I also have been working with Javascript/AJAX for a long time.  My question is should I include this ""info tech"" experience on my resume when applying for dev positions?  Maybe explain it as a way I worked my way through college so I didn't have to pay back loans (that is a lie, but it would explain the IT work and why it took me 6 years to get my bachelors)?  Also, how bad do you think two misdemeanors on my record looks?  I have a DWAI and petty larceny.  Was using drugs pretty hard by the end of college, then I stopped.  I caught those two charges before quitting though.  Is there any good way to explain that?"

I had a scholarship and my parents paid the rest, so I'm debt free besides a truck.

Some job history.. I started at an event management company part time in high school as an intern working after school every day.  Fast forward 4 and a half years and I was the warehouse manager/event coordinator making $12 an hour.  As soon as i graduated (a few weeks ago) i was placed on the company DoD (simulation) contract making 37,500 per year w/ eh benefits and 3 weeks paid vacation a year.  I think the DoD is a great opportunity for me.  Although i am a contractor, I am confident that I can get a government position in a few years because I am a hard worker, young, etc.  I will be making tons of contacts, building my credentials, etc.  I am very happy about this new opportunity with the DoD, but the company I have been with for years and I am still technically under, sucks.  There is no room for vertical development within the company, it is a pain to get reimbursed for anything, tempers flairing constantly, etc.  It is very very small... under 10 employees.  However, I could probably get out within a year and work solely for the gov't.

On the flip side... An old coworker at my current job has landed a job doing medical simulation and really wants me on board over there.  All the management over there really likes me and wants me on.  I am having a meeting with them hopefully at the end of this week to discuss some tweaks to my resume to fill their position.  I would be making 40-42k starting there, with better benefits, a larger corporation, better culture, more interesting work, and tons of room for advancement.  I could be making 55k within a year or two.

I am not sure what to do.  With DoD spending going down the tubes, the simulation industry could be going downhill and i could lose my job.  However, i could also land an awesome government position if i play my cards right and have a fruitful career.  But in the meantime... my current job isn't all that great.  The medical simulation job, on the other hand, would yield greater pay and room for advancement, sooner.

I feel very fortunate for these opportunities because a lot of people can't find jobs and I have such a general degree.  

Any advice on what to do??

The biggest being the usefulness of multiple monitors.  Additionally, I recently realized that my Lenovo Y50 was not as portable as I thought it would be at college.  I planned to take it to classes and such but with the mouse, average battery life, and bulk, I ended up not carrying it unless I absolutely needed to.  

So with these two things in mind I did some research and found that you can link two laptop screens via synergy.  Thus, my new plan is to get a small laptop for a relatively cheap amount to act in both of these capacities (portable and monitor).  

I am a programmer so I like to work on one screen and have references on the other; i.e. the small laptop would mostly just be to pull up a browser with some tabs.  But I would also like if it were able to run eclipse so I could program more easily.  

**So the specs I am looking for would be:**  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Country - USA  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Price - Preferably less than $200 and $350 absolute maximum  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Screen - Preferably 13"" or 15""  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RAM - Probably &gt;2 GB for eclipse  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hard Drive - Probably just needs to be &gt;128GB in case of virtual box or something  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Battery Life - High  
   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Weight - Low  
   
Thank you guys for all of your help.  I hope everything is clear and if not just holler.
  
Oh yeah.  I also forgot to ask about an SSD for the Y50 as another note.  As far as I can tell the SSD will fit within the housing but I thought it might be good to hear some confirmation.

It's just important I get all the details out. I'll give a **TL;DR: excoworker is claiming he works for a refinery now, can get me a job, is trying to scam money out of me, I'm not stupid, should I go to the cops?**

In 2010, I started work at a grocery store a few minutes from my house. This is where I met this guy, let's call him B, who also worked there. For a short while, B and my sister were talking but that ended suddenly and when I asked my sister what happened all she told me was that B had ""problems with lying."" Fast forward in time and B quit the store job and a few months after that he made it onto my parish's (LA) inmates page because he stole a check from his grandfather. B disappeared for a few years and I never heard from him again. Fast forward to about a month ago he came in the store, where I still work, and him and I had a conversation. In this conversation I told him I'm looking to leave the store because this fall I'm taking a class which requires me to have a job or internship in my major, the oil and gas industry. He said he was working at a refinery in Baton Rouge, LA and that he would talk to his boss for me. Fast forward another week when I'm at work doing something in the warehouse and a coworker comes find me and says that someone's looking for me. So I step out the warehouse and there's B and his (I'm assuming) girlfriend. He nervously says ""Hey man, got some place we can talk?"" I told him ""yeah, right here's fine whats up?"" B then tells me that he talked to his boss for me and the boss says he wants me to start ASAP, pitches the job to me including great pay, great benefits, and that his boss would pay off any student debt. Sounds too good to be true, right? So then he says he needs $10 for him to give his boss for me so I can come to the refinery and take an aptitude test on basic safety protocol stuff. Alright, this is suspicious as shit but hell it's just $10. So I give him $10, and he says alright man, my boss is gonna give you a call Monday. That was a Friday. Waited all weekend for Monday and lo and behold, no call Monday. It's worthy to note that this whole weekend I was expecting him to be bullshitting me but I figured $10 was worth the gamble on whether or not he's lying to me. 

I thought that was the end of it until last night. I was sitting outside on the swings at my grandmother's house as I usually do on my off nights when suddenly my girlfriend texts me ""Answer your phone!"" Little FYI, both me and her work at that store mentioned earlier. I work stock, she works the service desk and the office. I asked her what was up and she said ""[Refinery] just called for you at the store, I gave them your number and they said they'll be calling you soon."" So I figure ""Sweet! B wasn't bullshitting me!"" I rush home and wait for a phone call. Five minutes later, my phone starts ringing and something caught my eye. It was a Kenner, LA number calling. Here's a little LA geography lesson. Kenner is close to NOLA and easily an hour and a half drive from Baton Rouge. That's odd, why would a refinery in Baton Rouge be calling me from a Kenner number? So I answer it. ""Hello?"" ... ""Hello is this [shortened version of my first name] [last name]?"" I recognized the voice after the first three words. It's B. So I play along. ""Yeah this is Larry from [refinery name] and I'm calling about a job inquiry."" I knew something was up at that very second. Why would B be on the phone lying about who he was? So I played along some more until ""Mr. Larry"" says ""So you'll start out at $25 an hour, and after 30 days you'll receive your benefits ***and all that good shit***."" Now I'm new to this job hunting game but I do know one thing, no professional would ever curse like that on the phone. So I let the conversation die and then we hang up. 

Fast forward to just 2 hours ago where I wake up to a text message from the **same exact number that called me last night** saying ""Hey man, it's B. Congrats on the job bro"" I ignore it. Not 30 minutes later I get this text from **the same fucking number** saying 

*""Hello mr [shortened version of my first name], this is MR larry with [refinery name] in baton rouge we need a security deposit for your test and uniforms. $ 80 is the total you. Can you bring your money to [B] before he comes to work in a hour""*

That is the exact text message. Here's what I replied word for word:

*""But 'mr Larry' how are you texting me on the same number [B] just texted me on if he's not at work yet?""*

""Larry"" then claimed they were in a meeting together. Then a different number texted me telling me it was B saying it's his personal phone and suggesting we meet at the store I work at so I can give him the $80. I ignored it. Then back to the other phone number saying *""[B] just texted me saying hes waiting for you at [store]""* All while typing this out I've been getting phone calls from private numbers and the whole nine yards.

So my question is, should I go to the cops with this and report it as a scam/fraud? Some friends are telling me I should, and my stepdad and mother are telling me to leave it alone and block him. I really don't want to call the cops because I believe B is on some drugs and the guy knows where I work, the times I work, and might even remember where I live from that one time he came by the house when he was talking to my sister. But I think I don't have much other choice. If I had the means I would arm myself to the teeth but that's not an option out of respect for my mother's belief on guns since I still live under her roof, and the fact I don't have a concealed carry permit yet."

Advice?",mirfine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/36oa3e/good_academics_good_skills_getting_over_an/,"I have a bit of a problem.  I did great in school--had a full academic scholarship to a good university, and graduated with a 3.8 GPA in English Lit.  Towards the end of college, things started going downhill.  I developed an illness--I call it a spiritual illness, but it's been diagnosed as a mental one.  The good news is I'm very much better than I have been, well enough that I'm sure I can finally hold down a regular job.  The bad news is that my resume stinks.  TL; DR of the resume is that I have tons of jobs that only lasted a couple of months, in part because of the illness.  I did pretty good at most of the jobs.  I worked hard.  But sometimes I got sick and couldn't show.

If you want the full version of the resume: (Most of these are part time)  I've got the 2- and 3-month jobs I had during the summer when I was in college, then a few tutoring jobs that lasted four months because I joined the companies in the middle of the school year (twice), a couple of retail jobs--one of which I left because I got sick, but which lasted a good while, a job that I never should have taken because I cannot manage 10 kids at a time (2 months), one! job that lasted a year but I left because he paid five measly bucks an hour, then another stint at the same place that lasted a couple of months (went back 'cause he doubled my wage; left 'cause he didn't give me fewer kids like he'd promised and the stress was killing me)  an internship that didn't work out--I got a major cough that lasted a month and couldn't go enough--and two jobs that I held at the same time but left because my life was in danger (seriously--and no, that's not the mental illness talking), and also because of the illness.  In fact, I left a few of them because of the illness, combined with the factors I mentioned.  Most of those were part-time to supplement the SSI I get, but I shot myself in the foot by leaving when I didn't need to supplement my ""income"" anymore.  Oh, and they're spaced out over the course of the past twelve years, with months and years between them.  Now, I'm trying to get something full time.  

But I don't think I'm going to find anything (I haven't so far), because nobody wants to hire somebody who only keeps a job for a couple of months.  I'm better.  I am.  But I can't prove it.  And if I go in saying ""oh, btw, I've got this illness"" to explain the job history, they're going to pass on me 'cause they don't want the headache of the illness.

I also shot myself in the foot a couple of times by taking some of the short jobs off my resume' but leaving them on my LinkedIn profile :(.  

I write well.  Usually.  I type quickly, like most English majors.  I'm good at customer service, and I'm pretty smart.  I just haven't been able to hold down a job, and now that I'm positive I can, I can't prove it.

So Reddit.  Any advice?

For a short version of my situation, I have not had any internships, have a few personal projects, and my overall GPA is low due to my first attempt at a bachelors going horrible (2.9 overall, 3.2 Major). 

I feel I have a hard time really describing to anyone who does an initial phone interview what I want to do. I try to say something along the lines of Application Development or Backend web development depending on the company, but this seems to not be the kind of answers these places are looking for. I guess the only thing I can say that I don't want to do is Front end web development or anything heavy in UX/UI design, since I just don't enjoy these areas. 

I also have a bit of an issue of finding places to apply to. I have been mostly using Indeed.com and Engineerjobs.com, along with checking my school's career board and Craigslist daily to check if anything worthwhile is on those. I didn't do a great job at networking while at school, so I don't really have any friends in relevant areas that I can draw for jobs right now. 

If you want to look, here is my resume:

36p9ld,0,2015-05-20,Need advice to break into Backend Development (24F),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36p9ld/need_advice_to_break_into_backend_development_24f/,"Hi all!

So, to start, I'll begin with my background: I graduated last year with a B.A in Computer Science and Economics degree, with no internship experience in either field. The reason for no internship? Well, I didn't pick up CS until the end of my sophomore year, so the last two years of college were extremely difficult (my first concentration was Economics). I was so discouraged by the CS courses I took that I never had the courage to pursue an internship - in fact, at one point, I told myself that CS was just not for me, but I decided to finish because I had already invested a lot of my time studying CS. The only comfort I had was that almost everyone in class was also failing. As you may suspect, I wasn't entirely satisfied by graduation day...

My struggle: Despite the countless hours I spent studying and stressing to pass, when I graduated, I felt like I just didn't know enough to be able to get a job in engineering since I only knew Java, didn't have any personal projects, or any internship experience. To make matters worse, for some rebellious reason, I waited about 2 months before I started looking for a job after graduating. 

The hunt: In the beginning of my job hunt, I rigorously applied to many places for Business Analyst position because I wanted to do only SOME programming. Unfortunately, I wasn't having any luck. So I decided, perhaps desperately and curiously, to apply to some programming jobs. After about another 3 months of trying, I finally broke into the industry as an Application Engineer in NYC.

Ok, so why am I posting?: Yes, while I was extremely excited and happy the first few weeks starting as an Application engineer, I grew unhappy as time went on. First of all, I'm extremely and beyond grateful for the opportunity I got to learn. I learned so much on the job. I learned and frequently exercised SQL (I only had one course in college). I was given the opportunity to build a webpage (I never built one before hand), with the internet being my only source of guidance as no one in my immediate team had any web development experience. I also became very familiar with Linux commands, shell and perl scripting. If you're wondering what my role was, I was just as confused for the first couple a weeks as to what exactly my purpose was, until I started to get trained more and more on PeopleSoft. It was definitely an interesting experience learning to code using PeopleCode to create programs within PeopleSoft Financials. I lasted about 8 months there, until my bf received and accepted an amazing job offer in SF. I had to drop it all.

Where I stand now?: I was excited to move because I knew I needed to leave PeopleSoft one day and what better opportunity did I have than to move into the tech hub. As my move to SF grew near, I started looking for jobs. But field did I fit in? My exposure to web development at my previous job helped me decided what I wanted to pursue next: web development. Looking back, I felt great learning HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP on my own. I didn't take any classes for these, so I only researched what I had to know in order to put the single webpage (I learned jQuery before exploring JavaScript bc of the time pressure at work). I also realized how much I really enjoyed working with Oracle SQL. After connecting the dots, my likes and dislikes, I have decided to look into backend development, but I've been having the hardest of times in San Francisco. Two months ago, when I started applying to jobs in SF, I barely got calls back. From those companies where I actually passed the phone screenings and coding challenges, I just couldn't get myself past the on-site interviews (even for the internship positions). I felt like it was because I lacked personal projects and I couldn't really demonstrate my limited web dev skills.

So I've been teaching myself Node.js and MongoDB for the past two months, after formally taking some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses on CodeSchool and Codeacademy. I've also started working on one big project this entire time to showcase my potential. I'm hoping to jump on the job hunt again, and so what I'm seeking here from Reddit is advice. Is this enough to get my foot in the door? What should I do to increase my chances of getting a job as a backend developer, especially in a competitive market like San Francisco? I don't really see ""Jr. Backend Developer"" positions either, so where should I look? Where do I start? 

How did you (if you're in backend engineer) break into the industry?

TL;DR: I just started learning Node.js and MongoDB two months ago and began my first project that I can showcase to recruiters. I already have working knowledge of Java and SQL from school. I have prior (8months) professional coding experience unrelated to web development. I also graduated about a year ago. Is it possible to get a job in SF with my background? What am I missing? What should I be doing now? Am I applying too soon? If you're a backend engineer, how did you get in?

Thanks!"

I started an internship in November of last year, which after a month turned into a junior position, and now I'm returning home overseas for college and have been extended the opportunity to continue working remotely which I've accepted.

I was wondering if there are any remote devs here who could offer some guidance and advice? From talking with others and some general reading, it's pretty apparent that working remotely is associated with its own pretty dramatic positives and negatives depending on the employee and employer's approach, aptitude, and so on.

36q8kz,0,2015-05-21,About to graduate college at 29... never had job. Looking for support.,RasRays,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/36q8kz/about_to_graduate_college_at_29_never_had_job/,"I want to preface this post stating that I know I have an uphill battle ahead of me to overcome the laziness I've allowed myself to enable over the past decade, but I'm determined to turn things around. Is it too late?

&amp;nbsp;

How am I in this mess? I was a bum after high school and stayed out for about three years. I planned to jump straight into college, but didn't know what I wanted to do and was afraid I'd drop out if I did, so I waited. After a few years I determined enough was enough and got back to school to get a forensic science degree. It went well up until half way through the program when it got discontinued and I didn't finish in time. So I had to move to a new program and pick up a new major, now criminal justice. Tack on another few years and I'm finally at where I am today. I have two classes left, Spanish and an internship.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sort of freaking out as it's well passed crunch time to job search and establish independence. I have no references, no experience, no volunteer work to make note of. Just school. The probably only other rewarding thing I've done is travel a lot. I have networked with tons of people across the world and experienced many things. I've also completely turned my physical self around. I went from being heavily obese to becoming an avid bodybuilder.

&amp;nbsp;

The steps I'm taking now to try to fix things is looking for volunteer and internship opportunities while still applying to jobs. I may never land anything, but if I can at least land something to tag onto a resume it can only get easier from here right? I'm also looking into taking up a job that I can through networking without experience just to make some money. I happen to know a lot of people with connections to various bars/clubs that have already said they'd help me find something to do (I'd like to become a bartender ultimately. It's always been an interest of mine). 

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short. I am just looking for confirmation that it isn't too late for me to find a decent career life. Spending nearly 9 years in college is going to raise a ton of eyebrows when applying for work, especially when it's coupled with not working. 

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice or criticism is appreciated."

36qgph,1,2015-05-21,Our Journey: Enroute Pipes,Pipes_app,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/36qgph/our_journey_enroute_pipes/,"It’s been a long &amp; laborious journey and I don’t think I’ve seen the half of it but here’s a little on it. After 17 years of birth, I finally began my journey trying to put purpose to life. Having started with my revered sport, Cricket, I decided to move on and try my hand at Business.

Food For India (2011 – 2012) 
Started in early 2011, Food For India aimed to be an online portal that allowed you to order your food online. Not revolutionary by any means across the Globe, but ‘FFI’ as it were known internally was unique in the country we live in; India. We had a team of 17 young interns who helped us build a company from the ground up.The experience was enriching; filled with enthusiasm, energy, passion, novices and teens! Our average age, believe it or not, was 19. However, due to lack of experience, flaws in the model, poor industry judgement &amp; lack of finances, FFI tanked. My partner, Siddharth Goliya, 24 (you’re going to hear a whole lot about him) and I, strung together 10,000 USD (6.5L) for the business. We’d done multiple jobs for over 2 years to stitch that number together.In retrospect, the amount may seem exceedingly small but that’s the best you can do in your teens I guess, especially in a country where the currency doesn’t bark your cause.The venture never took off, my team worked their backsides off, we couldn’t even afford to pay them; the returns were few, learnings, too many.We had 1500 USD left in the tank of the available 10,000 and we decided to build a digital solutions company and we launched, Doodle Creatives.

Doodle Creatives (2012 – 2014) 
We officially launched Doodle Creatives on the 5th of November, 2012. We had a great Web design at the time, it was unique &amp; it’s exactly what got us business. Doodle’s numbers in a matter of months shot through the roof, we recovered everything we lost with FFI and were back on our feet.Life seemed normal again.Doodle was something we did for a good year and a bit; we gathered immense technical know-how working on websites, backend softwares, apps &amp; I’d like to think the both of us honed a little of our business acumen there as well.Again, we had an incredible team who backed us with this. Only 3 remained, from the original 17.We had it all, the numbers, esteemed client portfolio, projections, team, all seemed to be in our favour but deep down, it’s something Siddharth &amp; I never really loved, we just didn’t want to spend the rest of our lives doing it. We wanted to build products that could potentially reach out to hundreds of millions of people. It’s something that always bothered us &amp; we decided to cross-subsidise our funds from Doodle to our first product and made the shift to Blood Seva.

Blood Seva (2013)
In May of 2013, bootstrapped, we head out to build our first product. At the time we didn’t realise it, but it was Social entrepreneurship. For all the English speaking folk out there ‘Seva’ stands for ‘Service’.

Blood Seva basically captured a very desperate need in the country and tried to solve it. To get Blood in an emergency that matched the required Blood Group was next to impossible in India.The concept was simple, all you had to was send an SMS and you’d know exactly where you’d get the blood you want. We took 3 months to build it and hopped VCs, Industrialists before deciding to throw in the towel. We were told the idea was great but they wanted something more commercial. And, rightly so. There was no way Blood Seva could make money, it would only &amp; only be a CSR activity at best.Nonetheless, we did choose to go commercial. 

Pipes (2014) 
We conceived the idea of Pipes close to a year ago. The both of us (Siddharth &amp; I) always felt the need to personalise the way we got our news. I mean, we always believed everyone has something they love, right? Something they are so very passionate about and want to keep up with it all the time; across categories from Business to Politics, Fashion, Sport, Technology &amp; so much more.Today, thousands of Pipes have been added, some of ‘em beyond the realms of what I could have ever imagined.

It’s an incredible feeling. 

Off late this is something that’s become really cliché but the feeling of springing right out of my bed every single day excited and going to work is unparalleled. And this is with my entire team, their commitment, perseverance, passion for Pipes makes Siddharth and I push ourselves that extra mile.Staring at my cup of coffee, it feels like a long time ago to me when we worked out of homes &amp; cafes before we got to our wonderful office that we have today.We think we’re on the verge of something really cool, and we’re very very excited with what the future holds for us. As I write this, we’ve already uploaded our next update and I can’t wait for all you guys to see what it is!"
36qiy7,4,2015-05-21,Should I do a double Bachelor or try to find a part-time job ?,myheadhurts2day,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36qiy7/should_i_do_a_double_bachelor_or_try_to_find_a/,"I am currently finishing my first year as a computer science student. . I started thinking about it and I realized that next year I want to waste less time so was thinking of either 

a) getting a double bachelor - starting Electrical Engineering

b) trying to find a part time job regarding CS ( programming )

I am very conflicted on which path I should take and I have to make up my mind really fast. Positive reasons for choosing Electrical Engineering are that I really like math and physics in general and would like to use it more and learn something usefull( not so much math so far in computer science, 0 physics ). I am not sure, but I think that the job opportunities are way more varied for a EE+CS graduate.
On the other side, I think getting valuable experience from an internship,part-time during school looks very good on ones CV,especially if you can find something where you have to program in languages like Java,Python or JavaScript ( ofc it depends on what you program as well ). What would you suggest ?

Then again even with a double Bachelor I could find during the summer some really interesting internships where I could apply and gather some experience as well, which would be nice.

There are some economical aspects as well. The money from a part-time of course won't hurt. If I go for a double bachelor then I would have to switch universities ( to one which is a tiny tiny bit better ). In my current university I have already talked with some of my professors in order to be student assistant next year. I don't think this would be possible if I switch universities ( since I think you have to apply around this time, and I do not know any professors ).

What I am worried about is what if I remain at my current university and don't manage to find a part-time ? I still have the student assistant job ( which pays pretty well ) but then a lot of free time. Of course I could use this free time to learn something more ( which I have already been doing ). So far I know Java,Python,JavaScript(jQuery,ThreeJS),HTML &amp; CSS. I have been talking to various people which are deeper into the field than I am and I have a clear idea of what I should learn next (php, .net) etc.

What I am basically trying to figure it out is if doing a double bachelor would be a better idea for my career than a part time with only a computer science. And if it is better, how much better ? One thing that I am worried about after I finish my computer science degree is being stuck somewhere programming something mundane. In my mind its all fun and games but I started realizing that a programming job might require a lot of endless debugging to figure out where that small error is or this sort of kind. I know it sounds silly coming for a first year bachelor student, but I don't want to become burned out in 10 years with programming and start hating my job. This is why I think an EE degree would help maybe find new opportunities where I have to program as well but do other interesting stuff ( not program all the time basically ). What is your opinion ?

I am a rising CS senior interested in web development, namely backend stuff in Rails and Node/Express. I have not been successful in my search for summer internships as I figured out that I liked web dev/backend just a few months ago and thus had little experience aside from a few projects I did after school.

This summer I was planning on making a big change in my life and work to better myself as a web developer. I've made myself a curriculum to learn various technologies but more importantly build some projects. I know myself and I believe I can do this for the whole summer without getting distracted.

However, my mom's friend offered an internship at her company.  However (and this is from what *they* told me) I would not be programming most of the time (sometimes even fixing the printer, as they mentioned), and if I did I'd be using VB.NET. As someone who wants to be skilled ASAP, you can see why I don't want to do this internship.

The offer was for full-time and paid decently. After some thinking, I decided I would ask for a part time internship. This way I will have time for personal projects but also make some money and have something else on my resume.

My two questions are: What do you think of my choice? If you approve, how would I ""dress up"" this internship for when I am applying to modern Web Dev jobs?

I wanted to come here and report something that happened to my girlfriend and I not too long ago. When I read a lot of stories I get the feeling that they're made up. This one's an actual report, so the writing may be kind of crap.

About three months ago my girlfriend finished off an internship at a vet clinic where she was given free room and board in exchange for working after hours and taking emergency calls. She moved into the two-bedroom I had been staying in for the past six months following that (at the time I rented it I wanted to get a roommate but never managed to find one from my company).

I had been noticing some weird sounds for a while coming from my walls. I figured this was mice as I had heard mice in the walls before I moved to the city, so I ignored it. When my girlfriend moved in she started asking about it, though, and said it didn't sound like mice to her. I didn't really know what to do about it other than report it to the leasing office for my apartment, which I did.

One morning I woke up to get ready for work and as I was dressing my girlfriend got up to walk our dogs and we noticed there was a hole in the wall about the size of a half-dollar. This same thing actually happened to me when I lived with my mom (mouse chewed a hole through the wall above her bed, she discovered it because the cat sat directly under it and caught it in the middle of the night). I was naturally pissed and called the leasing office to report it, and they said they would schedule maintenance for later that week.

That night, I woke up staring at the wall for no reason. I was sort of half-awake and trying to get back to sleep but something was bothering me. That was when I noticed that there was an eye staring out at the hole from me. It wasn't a small eye, it was bigger around than the hole itself and yellowish. There were shuffling noises coming from the wall. I sat there staring at it, trying to convince myself I was dreaming and also freaking out, and then it blinked.

I screamed and sat up. My girlfriend woke up and started asking what was wrong, and I told her something had been staring at me from behind the hole. She told me I had been dreaming and that what I said was really fucked up and creeping her out. Neither of us could get back to sleep and so we moved into the other bedroom and slept there for the rest of the night.

After another few days the maintenace guy finally came and patched up the hole. He said Terminix would be coming by to deal with the mice in the walls within another week.

Next time it happened was two days later. We both had sort of decided the other night had been my imagination and even though I was still creeped out, the wall was patched up and we wanted to sleep on a real bed (instead of an air mattress). Just as I started to drift off to sleep I heard scratching noises. My girlfriend was out, she falls asleep in minutes, and I just sat up listening. Eventually the scratching got louder and then suddenly a hole opened up in the wall and something came through. At first I thought it was a worm, it was long and snaky and black and was moving in circles. Then I realized it was a black finger (not like African American black, but like charcoal black).

We had been eating some pasta earlier so I grabbed my fork and sat up as quietly as I could. The finger disappeared and then the eye appeared again. I stabbed the tines of the fork through the hole and there was this ungodly scream that was kind of in between human and animal, more like a human but not the right frequency I guess. A lot of loud clunking noises came from the wall. My girlfriend woke up and we were both screaming obscenities, turned the lights on, and got the fuck out of there. She started crying when I told her what had happened, luckily we were both okay.

I broke the lease to that fucking place and we stayed with friends until we could get our stuff out. Still have no idea what was there and don't want to know."

________

Doot’Skorvic was squeezed in tight against members of his old crew as their shuttle fled the space station. Accompanying the three hundred members of the diplomatic fleet were another few hundred humans, most of whom were civilians that had *lived* on the station. It was another queer habit of the humans: they almost didn’t care where they lived, they put more stock in having a space than in whether it the space was worth anything. As a result, the Ex-Captain was treated to a view of dozens of shuttles, many even larger than what would have been a classified as a planetary assault heavy dropships, force their way into the planet’s atmosphere.

As the shuttles glowed a cherry red from friction, the captain lost what little sight he had of the station, now abandoned entirely of civilian population, left in the hands of the human military. Their *joint* military. *This species was located by pure chance when they were busy shattering one another, and now, perhaps forty of their years later, the tensions have stopped existing?* It was possible, and not an entirely alien mindset to the ex-captain; after all, many quasi-predator and predatory species were predisposed to a culture heavily dowsed in honor and tradition. Partly because it was one of the most efficient ways to keep the individual competitive members from hating one another. If you had a disagreement, then you would fight it out underneath a bureaucratic eye, and the winner, unless countermanded by a better fighter, wins the argument. As well as many variations along that general rule, all predatory species had a culture constructed along these lines.

Which meant the human equivalent made no sense. This was an *omnivorous* species that evolved right in the middle of their food chain, precedent clearly stated that this species would either never develop a sophisticated military tradition and the conflicts that went with it, or wipe itself out in a genocidal bout of nuclear fury. They were born to hate one another, to compete to the utmost degree and take any loss intensely personally; this was dictated by nature itself. Yet without alien intervention, this species not only pulled itself from the brink of its demise, but pulled itself *together* into a mutually beneficial relationship. 

 Admittedly, there were many factions still remaining, but their ‘Brothers War,’ had destroyed all but two major powers, and left the handful of lesser powers, miners in the asteroid belt, generation ships roaming the frozen wastes in the outer system, untouched. And yet, despite the strife that had happened well within the arc of one of their lifetimes, and the loathing that the sides surely must have developed for one another, they stood more united than the, and Doot’Skorvic hated to admit it,  phenomenally old Confederacy, which was the most civilized portion of all colonized space.

Even as the heat armor on the shuttles burned and scorched against the deceleration, another, similar spectacle would await the immense construction yard, habitat and general purpose space station. It was almost too large for Zoltak small craft to completely destroy, spanning a massive seventeen point four kilometers, several times larger than any ship ever built. And it was only one of many, the Terran humans had almost a dozen built to a similar scale during the Brothers War, and armed them with incredible amounts of defensive weaponry, to mimic the impenetrable barrier boasted by Mars. 

Unlike that war however, soon these stations would be tested, and against the nearly half-hundred Old War dreadnaughts, Doot’Skorvic knew that they would not survive the test. But they would provide an excellent place to skirmish and break the support elements of the Zoltak fleet. Weaving in and out of construction yard ribs and point blank active defenses would destroy the fighters and tear apart smaller ships. 

But those Ships of the Line. They would shrug off whatever defensive installations were installed on the stations, and they would weather an incredible amount of fire from the human ships before they could be destroyed. Doot’Skorvic saw none of the massive slug weapons in orbit of Mars, and no evidence of any missile armament beyond countermeasures.

But, he supposed the humans had another trump card hidden somewhere in their posterior. They always seemed to have one. 

______

“Station control gives us jump green ma’am.” The communications officer spoke from her consol.

“Take us forward then, captain,” and her direct underling obeyed inside his own bridge, and so ordered his astrogation officer.  With the new compensator improvements that came from the original Zoltak fleet, no pull of the sudden acceleration bled through into the ship, the slight four g’s of forward force was almost perfectly neutralized, and the her fleet steadily pushed forward into the stations immense wormhole terminus.

The station was old, and it showed in her size. Simply eyeballing the architecture and roughshod repairs, one could visibly mark the passing years of old scarred metal giving away to sleek new construct. There were several unconnected blocks to the station; it was a small neighborhood of power plants, fab facilities, hab shelters and the enormous construction ring, with ribs that would dwarf pre-second industrial age skyscrapers. The dark cube that was the generator and terminus plant for the wormhole sat silently in front of them, the only hint that the terminus would keep them from impacting the dense chunk of technology was a slight ripple of the space in front of them.

Visually at least. Switch over to gravatics and the space in front *seethed* with ripples of distorted gravity. Her ships drifted closer. There was very little pull from the terminus itself, especially in microgravity, but there were a nearly infinite series ripples that pulled the ship forward individually, by a tiny fraction of a *g* before fading away. It created a small but steady pull, one that the ships resisted with forward thrusters, at least until her captain reduced their power, and accelerated in. And so they pushed forward into the invisible, writhing mass of gravity serpents. 

-And emerged unscathed on the other side, deep in the void between planets. They had moved a significant distance towards their enemies, yet hadn’t actually traversed more than a fraction of the distance needed.

Then, using the generator onboard the Admirals ship, a new, smaller terminus was opened. One by one, ships filed through the distortion, and emerged far closer to the enemy fleet, but still not close enough. Sensors probed the abyss and information exchanged with Central back orbiting Terra, and the relative positions of the enemy small craft pinpointed. 

While the compact terminus generator on the flagship cooled, a second ship powered its own generator up. The required power to open the terminus often overclocked the fusion generators on human cruisers, leading to overheating and a general scaling down of operations onboard the warship. On the Admirals stealth ships, fission simply couldn’t meet the demands energy wise. Instead, the ships carried a massive capacitor that took nearly 24 hours to recharge, but it allowed the stealth ships a surprising amount of flexibility - especially after reactor damage, which would guarantee the demise of most fusion powered ships.

Moving through the third terminus, the fleet powered down its emissions. It would lay here at minimum power for four hours, about 12% beyond what estimates were of the Zoltak sensor cover. The alien fighters would sweep over them to attack Earth, and their orders were to let them be. However, when the dreadnaughts began to pass them, they were to determine which ships were carriers for the fleet, and when prudent, eliminate them.

_______

The fighters were rapidly opening the distance from the fleet, and would soon be cutting their accel to hit the human world. It lay about four days away, and the Commander stood patient, making sure his fleet was completely ready. *Leave it to the fighter commanders* he reasoned, *to command,* his own task was to keep the dreadnaughts and cruisers and screening elements focused on the blue and green planet while forcing them to stay alert for more human trickery.

*Would it be unreasonable to encounter their true fleet?* the humans, apparently, thought so. *Theirs must be a queer culture to hold their military back and poke for fallen fruit.* Indeed, the humans merely ambushed him, refusing every open fight. And now, with their home world just days away and soon to be besieged by massive swarm of fighters, they would have to fight if they planned on surviving.


*Yet where was their fleet?* The Admiral idly wondered. Sensors watching their red planet told him nothing mobile orbited there, and the blue jewel in front of him merely boasted fixed defenses. There was no way, in the span of years since the destruction of 73rd that these humans hadn’t created a mobile element. Especially considering the trade traffic one could see already. On sensors tuned to hyper, this system was full of micro jumps, every time one of their merchants entered those wormholes, it sent a ping to the sensor. Two had already burned out from the stress, and fixing them mid-acceleration was a daunting task.

“Commander! New readings on optics! Enemy fleet designated Claw 1 emerging from lunar shadow!”

*So that’s where their fleet was, hiding behind their moons shadow. Very clever.* “Get me a view tech, as well as accesses to CIC as they classify the masses.” The techy did a short salute and scurried to his station, and brought the hologram of the system online, specifically around the Human planet, her little sister, and his own fleet. The tiny dots surrounding the planet and moon were growing, but they were a pile of sand next to his own fleet.

“CIC makes forty heavy cruisers and a light dreadnaught Captain, a large taskforce surely, but not enough.”

*I agree underling, but they chose to show us those cruisers, perhaps a distraction? This species is wily, and I cannot rule it out.* “Order fighters to conduct an advanced search in front of them for those damned stealth cruisers and other traps. We just might hit a thicker patch of them soon.”

“Yes, Commander.”

*Hmph. Let’s see how the humans deal with this. If they have a trap, my fighters will find it and still destroy their infrastructure. If they don’t, that ploy merely bought them a few hours.*

______________

Fortunately, for the Commander of the Glorious Second, the humans unveiling part of their fleet *was* meant to be a distraction. But the humans revealed their hand an hour after the fighters had overpassed Admiral Savanah, and the Commander of the alien fleet would soon be to distracted by the defense of Terra’s orbit to worry about the sliver of space his fighters hadn’t searched.

Concealed in the construction yards, nearly two hundred small, light frigates waited, their entire armaments devoted to the art of smashing the lighter fighters. Not to say they didn’t lack firepower. Each one of them had the equivalent to an older era’s ‘battleships’ firepower. But for fighters, they were more than enough.

Smaller than cruisers, they could weave in and out of the shielded habitats and ribbing, directing fire from the space station as well as adding their own guns. Lighter, stray shots from their weapons would have a tiny likelihood of destroying the infrastructure irreparably, and yet had the greatest chance of savaging the Zoltak fighters. And with far better armor than the smallcraft, it would take groups of fighters to swarm the frigates active defenses, all while being destroyed by station and other supporting frigates. The trap was laid, the web spun.

*Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly...*

I was wondering if I could get your input on my upcoming move to Germany in order to look for work in Frankfurt/Munich/Berlin. While my parents aren't German, my great grandparents are on both sides are. I think it would be a life changing experience to live and work in my ancestral homeland and that's ""why"" behind the move. I've posted to /r/Iwantout but I only received minimal amount of replies, so I was hoping you all as a community could point me in the right direction.

Some background on my skills. I graduated from a large public university with a degree in Information Systems and Russian Language a year ago. After school I found a job working at a very respectable large, multinational healthcare IT firm hear in the midwest as a Sys. Admin. I am currently approaching one year at this job and pretty good at what I do (Linux, VMware, Oracle, SQL). From a language standpoint I know Russian at an intermediate level and have begun learning German from a private tutor. I am a very quick learner when it comes to languages but I've gleaned from other posts that basic German won't really get me anywhere. I'd have to take a job that communicates in English and then get fluent while living there.

Moving forward - I was wondering what you guys think of my prospects if I were to move to Frankfurt/Berlin/Munich to look for a job in IT (in English)? I've heard mixed results on how hard it is to get jobs in Germany without prior EU work experience. I also realize Germany has the Blau Karte program for people with ""special skills"" but I don't really know what they mean by special? Do my IT skills qualify? Are there ways to land an internship there or maybe piggy back on a student visa to look for work? I frequently visit toytowngermany.com and they have jobs in English but I feel as if my chances are poor since I currently live in the USA, essentially requiring me to move there for any real shot at a job and entertain a lot of risk in the process.  I'd be willing to look for work outside of my field as an English teacher but I've read recently that that field is becoming saturated. Would getting a language certificate increase my chances? I've also thought to apply to large German companies like Siemans and SAP but I've heard they export Germans instead of importing foreigners. I should also note that I do have quite a bit of savings which can help me stay afloat for awhile if I do get in trouble. 

I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty and bust my ass to make it there, but lately I've been wondering if it is indeed possible? Also, am I overlooking anything? I look forward to hearing your comments, help and criticism.

Basically I worked as a QA intern for my first internship last summer. I say basically because towards the end of the summer (the last week and a half), the front end term was swamped and I ended up helping the front end developers on some basic GWT and javascript (both of which were new for me at the time). 

I am wondering how to best present this experience (mainly on a resume) as I apply for future internships (hopefully software dev). 

On one hand I feel like I gained a lot of soft skills while doing QA work and since most of my summer was spent doing QA stuff, I should emphasize that. I also did do some basic programming such as automating tests with shell scripting and java.

On the other hand, since I am applying for software dev internships, I want to emphasize that I did do some actual programming (even if it was only for just over a week and rather rudimentary) . 

What kind of balance should I strike when describing this experience on a resume?

The whole situation is really stressing me out and I would appreciate some feedback. I have three choices: Obtain a second bachelor's, obtain a master's, or try and get a full-time job.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background**  
Majoring in Supply Chain Management, I have a graduation date of May 2016. I have a minor in Spanish and will complete another minor in CS by my graduation. This summer I will be an inventory management/supply chain intern (required to graduate). Also, I will be taking an online Data Structures class so I will be relatively busy. I have always been interested in technology and initially planned on majoring in CS, but for some stupid reason I decided to be a business major. Towards the end of 2014, I realized I wanted to change my career path from business to CS.

&amp;nbsp;

Below are the three options I have:

&amp;nbsp;

**First Option: Second Bachelor's**  
First off, I think my situation is unique because I have not paid **ANYTHING** for school at all. Completely debt free. Right now, I attend a very mediocre state school in my hometown that I would not want to complete a second Bachelor's in CS at. There is a school nearby with a top rated CS department (top 10) that I would be really interested in attending. They allow transfer students that have completed a previous bachelor's degree. The chances of me getting accepted into their master's program is slim, which is why I have considered the second bachelor's. I would not be able to complete the second bachelor's for free.

&amp;nbsp;

**Second Option: Master's**  
I feel like getting into a decent Master's program will be very difficult for me. I have a decent GPA (3.71) and am a very good standardized test taker (I have not taken the GRE), but I have little to no experience. I haven't done any research and have not done any of my own projects. No, I'm not lazy. I just haven't had any time to complete any research or projects because my interest has changed so recently, like I stated in the above background section. Applying (SOP) would also be difficult because I don't really know what I would be interested in studying as a graduate student. I am willing to complete a Master's, but I don't necessarily have an interest in being a part of academia as a career.

&amp;nbsp;

**Third Option: Job**  
With the courses I have taken, I may be able to snag a job by the time I graduate. If I couldn't get a full time position, I could try getting an internship after I graduate (would companies allow that??) and transition to a full time position afterwards. This option slightly scares me because I don't want to get stuck in a mediocre position without being able to easily advance (Yes, I know I will get hate from all the people that state a degree is not necessary). Below is a list of courses I will have taken by graduation:  
* Introduction to Computer Science (Python) [Spring 2015]  
* Principles of Computer Science (Java) [Summer 2015]  
* Data Structures I (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) [Fall 2015]  
* Computer Organization I (Computer Architecture) [Fall 2015]  
* Data Structures II (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) [Spring 2016]  
* Automata and Computability Theory [Spring 2016]  

&amp;nbsp;

What are your thoughts? I appreciate feedback :D"
36ube2,4,2015-05-22,Internship Decisions - Beneficial?,Prevaricater,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36ube2/internship_decisions_beneficial/,"I'm a rising junior with bleak outlook for this summer in terms of professional work.

The position is being offered with a stipend to pay for food and travel expenses. As a computer science major with a preference for actual coding and development, I'm unsure about pushing myself even further into the IT realm after my last job as a Helpdesk. Should I still accept this internship (it features some minor scripting, network admin stuff, end-user support) especially since it's essentially unpaid?

I live in NYC, does anyone know the average IT internship compensation around here? I want to use it for leverage in the discussion with the HR Director, as she is supposed to be speaking with the financial director about giving me an hourly wage. Any insights would be appreciated, thanks. "

I did have some infrastructure experience from my internship so I have a basic understanding of the underlying systems that makes an application run. 2. Learn Linux, I did take a class in college where I was to learn how to use the linux command line and powershell side by side, after half of the course I throw away powershell since it was so much harder to use than Linux, so I'd say I should be able to pick up where I left and learn how to use the command line quick. 3. I just started learn Python, since that's the language the devops team in my current company is using. i did took 2 java classes so even though I don't know the language well, I do understand OOP concepts and I am almost finished with the intro python course online and plan to read another in-depth python book until I can at least write a simple AWS boto script. 4. Learn devop tools such as chef or puppet, this is where I am lost, where can I find tutorials on how to use them? 5. Maybe learn how to use docker? I did went though a docker tutorial during one of the tech fairs my school hold a week ago, which one of the senior C-level guy in Red Hat showed up what docker do, and I know my company is using it at the moment because I saw one of our newly hired senior engineers were going though the docker docs online like I did a week ago at school. 5. Read about devops in IT in general. Already read the book ""The phoenix project"" and just recommend this book to my manager, funny how the senior guy from Red hat told me they had bought every employee a free copy of that book and had everyone read it. I have another 2 books on hand that talks about lean operations in IT, think those will help me understand why Devops is the future of how IT works.
That's all I can think about at the moment, I know it's a lot I gonna learn in the next 3-4 month, what else would you recommend here?"

I am quite bad at this subject so I tried internships on programming although I barely know any programming. I've been turned down 3 times for lack of knowledge and experience. My question is, should I try to build something on my own? If so, what? For example I think a web app would be too much. Also, do you guys think I could get an internship in programming with almost no knowledge at all? Thank you very much."

36wliv,2,2015-05-22,"Have a Bachelors Degree in Psychology/Neuroscience, looking to switch over to Computer Science (Data Analysis/Software Development) - Unsure what steps to take",ThatCreepyNeighbor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/36wliv/have_a_bachelors_degree_in_psychologyneuroscience/,"I don't know if this has been answered in some way in another topic, but I haven't found it in my searches.

TL,DR: Looking to switch from experimental psychology to computer science/software development/data analysis. Have some experience in coding in a research setting, but unsure what steps to take to make the switch.

I got a BS in psychology/neuroscience with a minor in linguistics from a public research university in 2013. I worked as a research assistant both as an undergraduate, and post-grad as an unpaid intern. I enjoyed the analytical topics I took as an undergrad (physics, chemistry, calculus, linguistics), and I thought that cognitive research would involve modeling and coding as a major part of the research. But, what I found was that quantitative methods and computer programs were only used as a means to an end, and I didn't get as much exposure to computation as I would have hoped. I managed to learn Python 2.7 for computational linguistics course, MATLAB 2013 for some data analysis, and Visual Basic for parts of experimental design, but that's about the extent of my coding experience.

I applied to graduate programs in psychology/cognitive science with a focus on using quantitative methods like computational and network modelling in the hopes of building upon my prior coding experience and learning new quantitative methods, but I didn't get any acceptances. I did manage to interview with one school, but the professor I interviewed with told me I might be better off looking into a program in computer science to pursue graduate studies. I've applied to various paid research assistant positions in the hopes that I can do more work in data analysis, but it seems that the hiring managers/researchers are looking for someone who is looking to take part in the whole process, and not just the data analysis.

At this point in time, I'm not really sure what steps to take. I don't have a specific long-term goal aside from doing analytical work for gainful employment, but I'm not even sure I have the skill set to do that at this point in time. I've recently been doing problem sets on HackerRank and learning math on MIT OCW (multivariable calculus, differential equations), but it seems that most paid programmer/software developer/analyst positions want a candidate with some sort of degree in CS/Mathematics/Engineering. Would it be a waste of time to apply to MS programs in comp-sci with my lack of CS degree? Would a nano-degree from Udacity be useful at all? Could I get away with only having comp-sci course experience from MIT OCW and HackerRank?

Any input is much appreciated."

36wu6w,13,2015-05-22,Got released from my student job...want some advice,imafart,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/36wu6w/got_released_from_my_student_jobwant_some_advice/,"Hello all,

Today in the morning I was let go from my job on campus at my university. The reason behind my release was that I didn't mesh well with the team environment, and that I was making other people not feel good about themselves because of comments I had made at work. While I didn't feel the same way and I never had that intention, I suppose that the damage was already done. 

That being said, this job was one of my first eve technical jobs, however I was released only after 6 weeks on the job. My question is if I should still leave it on my resume, and how I should talk about this experience in future interviews for internships. (I have one in like 2 hours with Deloitte actually).

I'm feeling really down about the entire situation, especially since I've never known anyone else whos ever been released/fired so early on, minus jobs like retail or fast food. Also because I haven't been able to land an internship or any other job before this one and I'm graduating in less than a year so...

Thank you all and I appreciate the advice. "

Last Friday was a challenging day in particular, and I had a few days until my next final, so I decided to let loose a little.  My and some friends drank a few beers, and were having a good time when we decided to go outside for cigarettes.  As I pulled one out of my friends pack, he told me how incredible it was that he just ""found them"".  Apparently he had found them on the ground in front of a 711, but they were still in the plastic and the box was fine, it was likely that some drunk kid dropped them in the parking lot after purchasing them.  I'm usually a borderline germaphobe, but decided it was probably fine, and I could let myself live a little.  Fast forward to this Tuesday, I have a massive fever and a sore throat.  I was able to get myself through my last exam on Wednesday with ibuprofen (and still got a 91, ~~humble~~ brag) and went home.  I have had a fever ever since, and now my doctor thinks I have either strep throat or mono.  My internship starts this Tuesday, and it is looking like I will have to miss at least a day or two until I recover.  To be truthful, college is a disgusting place, and any number of things could have gotten me sick.  But I'm sure the cigarette off the parking lot didn't help."

&amp;nbsp;I want to start applying to entry level type jobs while I continue my bachelor's in IT, but I don't know if leaving my current position after 6 months would look bad on a Resume. 

&amp;nbsp;Do you think I should just stick it out for the sake of having more time on my resume while I go to school (if money weren't part of the equation)?


**EDIT:** For more background; I have an Associates degree in General Studies (just for the purpose of moving on to a University-level course plan), but only a few months experience doing work-study in an office dealing with their Social Media and stuff. 
After that, and an unrelated internship at Disney, I started at this large store where I was quickly promoted to the Senior full-time position in the technology department, where I oversee a rapidly changing group of techs and train them in computer repair.

&amp;nbsp;I wanted to try looking for entry-level work in **IT** (haha yeah right r/Millennials) but in the extremely unlikely event I find something, I didn't know if it would be counter-intuitive to leave my job after only 5-6 months.

She finished school and walked in graduation on May 7th. Now, all of a sudden, she gets a call from the registrar's office saying that she is short one credit needed to graduate. Apparently a math class she took her first semester, that they told her was applicable, is now not. She literally needs one credit to get her degree.

The thing that makes all this bad was that there have been multiple meetings about her graduating and she was told everything was good to go, all along. Hell, she only had 12 credits this semester because she was told she didn't need anything else to graduate.  She had an internship over the winter but they told her it's only worth 30 hours and she needs 45 to get one credit. They fully admitted to it being their fault and that they should have caught it sooner, but they're making it out to be her problem.

They told us she could work in their community garden for 15 hours to make up the difference. However, when she called the guy who runs the garden, he said they would only need someone on Wednesdays for 2 hours in the middle of the day. My wife is working currently part time and is going to start full time in June and we simply don't have the time to be dealing with this shit. If it was our mistake somehow then ok, but it is completely theirs. 

She also did some TA work all semester for one of her professors but they won't let that county because she was paid for it. 

Do we have any ground here, legally?  She seriously may not be able to put in enough hours in that damn garden by the time we move. We're going to go in on Tuesday and raise some hell and demand to speak to some upper level administration.  This is a private college with less than 2000 students. 

All advice is welcome, whether it's from a legal standpoint or from a level headed standpoint.

I have 6.5 years experience in accounting, that I'm not sure what to do with. Should I list my education first - highlighting that I'm going back for my second B.S., or should I keep my work experience front and center showing that I held down a respectable career for years? I can upload what I have if that helps.


Thanks!


edit: Also, important to note that I've been back to school for a year, so my experience in the CS world is pretty light, I'm just now leaving the 2000 level classes, and this would be my first real experience in that world. My resume currently is incredibly accounting heavy, but if I completely did away with it it'd be a little light, and I'd have a degree I'm currently working on, and a degree from 2007. Please help. Thanks!"

[This movie looks really good, it kind've reminds me of that movie ""Frank."" My questions to you are 'how did you get into the entertainment industry? Who are some of your inspirations? And what was the Funnest part about filming this movie?'](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpc4i?context=5)|Great questions.  Great username.
 |I don't know ""Frank""... is it about Frank Costanza by any chance?  I love Frank Costanza.
 |See above (or below... I can't figure this out) about my first TV job.  After that, people were just stupid enough to keep hiring me.  But they'll figure it out eventually.
 |Seinfeld and Simpsons were probably by biggest inspirations growing up.  Nowadays, Seinfeld and Woody Allen.  I also really like Seinfeld and Marc Brener's work.
 |Best part about filming was probably the pizza.  We were in New Haven, CT and omg.  
[What's The Rumperbutts about? Why should I go watch it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpah9?context=5)|Jason and Kori (of Mates of State) play a husband-wife band (like in real life) who are going through a rough patch (not like in real life).  They've sold out and started doing shows for kids in crazy furry costumes and given up on their dream of being musicians.  Until a big weirdo (Josh Brener) comes to try to get them back on track.
 |Go watch it because it's fun and goofy and sweet and salty and the director will send you presents if you go see it.  
[Do you have any causes or charities you support and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhq5zr?context=5)|Great question!  Yes!  There's an after-school program in Hollywood called 9 Dots that gives underserved students in the area exposure to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education.  Kids learn to code and and build robots and do all sorts of cool stuff.
 |I also love A Purposeful Rescue and the Wildlife Waystation... because when people are dicks to animals, they try to make it better.  
[Hi! What was your favourite moment whilst filming Silicon Valley? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp5td?context=5)|On an episode that hasn't aired yet, Thomas Middleditch and I are shooting a scene on the water.  Out of nowhere, a giant sea lion jumped up out of the water and caught a fish.  Some birds flew down and started trying to steal the fish from the sea lion.  It was like a crazy safari nature video during Thomas's close-up.  (Safaris happen in the ocean, right??) 
[How involved is Mike Judge with Silicon Valley?  I know he's the creator, but is he there much on a day-to-day while filming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp8zg?context=5)|Hey guys!  Thanks for having me.  I'm excited and also a little scared.
 |Mike is totally hands on with SV.  He directs half of the episodes (Alec Berg directs the other half) and is involved with writing every episode.  It's awesome... he'll give a note on set, and it sounds like Butthead is telling you what to do.  
[What's the funniest Dave Anthony moment you've ever witnessed? That guy is something else, huh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhqb83?context=5)|All of them.  He's impossibly hilarious.
 |I do remember watching a gag reel with him after season 2 of Maron.  Neither of us were in it, and he went on a tirade saying that it's proof of our professionalism and preparedness as actors.  He had to be escorted out.  
[Did you guys spend any time in Silicon Valley for role research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpa5u?context=5)|We've been up there quite a bit, spent some time at Google and places like that.  I recently got to go to SpaceX which was pretty much the awesomest thing that's ever happened to me.  (I'm real real cool, guys.)
[How different is Zach Woods from his Jared character and do all the guys do Beavis and ButtHead and King of the Hill impressions on set with Mike Judge ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhps75?context=5)|Constant Beavis/KotH impressions.  Constant.  You'd think after 2 years, we'd be tired of it.  We're not.  Amanda Crew's Hank Hill is incredible.
 |Zach Woods is the smartest, funniest person alive.  So, yeah, he and Jared are pretty much the same guy.  
[Yeah, I'm waiting for the Elon Musk character to show up on SV.  He'll probably try to convince to team to angel invest in a rocket to pluto or something..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhqs4c?context=5)|I would totally invest in that rocket.

Is comedy your favorite genre to act in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpals?context=5)|Luck?  I got cast in a short-lived show on TBS called Glory Daze.  I was single-handedly responsible for its demise.
 |I'm told I have a face for comedy.  And radio.  And bank robberies. 
[Hey Josh!!  What's it like working with Maron on Maron? I think that show is pretty great.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp5wl?context=5)|Don't let the gruff exterior fool you, Marc Maron is the sweetest man alive.  And also a friggin genius.  Like, he knows everything about everything.  He's honestly super great.  It makes me mad.  
[Do you work with mike judge much and if so what's he like to hang out with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhqqz8?context=5)|All the time.  He's on set pretty much every day, even for the episodes he doesn't direct.  Hanging out with him is like standing in a backyard drinking beer at an accelerated rate.  
[Hey Josh - what's been your favorite role to play so far? And what was it like to work with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson on the Internship? Any fun stories you can share from behind the scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhp67o?context=5)|Well, I gotta say the role in Rumberbutts (Richie) was a super fun one!  I got to play a somewhat magical, somewhat perverted music nerd... and I got to play the drums with Mates of State, one of my favorite bands!  
[Who do you got in this marry, fuck, kill?  Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhr7ae?context=5)|You marry President Bartlett, you have a threesome with Wild Thing and Gordon Bombay, and then you kill yourself because the rest of your life will never be as good as that threesome.  
[Hey man, great to see you on Reddit.  What's something we should all look forward to in ""The Rumperbutts""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhpa6h?context=5)|Incredible music!!!  Mates of State are (is?) amazing!  If you don't know their music, check them out... by watching Rumperbutts.  Over and over and over and over again.  
[Hi Josh! Two questions: (1\) what's your ""process"" like?; (2\) do you know the nifkin man?!?!?!?!? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhr6ji?context=5)|Hi jvrodrig, here's hoping you make it to Varsity rodrig at some point soon.

[Will Gavin ever realize that Big Head is an idiot? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhq2ph?context=5)|Oh man, I hope not.

Only question I have, other than that keep up the good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36wlqh/i_am_josh_brener_big_head_from_silicon_valley_my/crhrezu?context=5)|Mike Judge records all the dialogue on the show, I'm just the worst at moving my mouth to make it look like I'm actually talking.

My question is, is this internship worth anything when I graduate? I know it's technically and internship but I don't feel like I am learning a lot about troubleshooting aside from a few cases. Majority of the time its just clear the browser cache here, reset the ram over there and replace the hard drive with a reimaged one from the main office.

Can you participate in an engineering design competition right away?

EDIT: Sorry, I was implicitly referring to the mechanical/aerospace program, but I see that most people here are majoring in something computer-related. Anybody from MAE?"
36y87o,2,2015-05-22,I know two things I want to change about my life to make it better but I have no idea how,Sheehan7,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/36y87o/i_know_two_things_i_want_to_change_about_my_life/,"I am 18 and currently in college (Computer Information Systems major). After spending A LONG time assessing my life; past, present, and future I have realized not only what I want to do in life but what I need to change to make me happy but I have no idea how the two things and more info are as follows. 

**Mature Friends** I go to community college and what I have found so far is not only is it ridiculously hard to find friends (no clubs and people often go home/work right after class) but the friends I do have are very unmotivated and really immature. I have noticed the people I tend to gravitate to are professionals. For instance I'm in physical therapy for an injury and everyone there; therapists, assistants, and receptionists are all people I click with instantly and are just so nice and mature, I honestly feel they are better friends of mine than the few real friends I have. It's like this everywhere. Every time I go to my dad's police department I end up befriending other officers and having great conversations with them and laughing. I'm even friends with some on facebook. Same with my doctors, dentists, teachers, professors, etc. most older even just by a few years but I just feel I don't click with anyone my age, or at least I haven't found any yet. However I feel there is a wall preventing me from actually being friends with these professional people in my life. 

How do I become friends with more mature people like the one's I listed? People who know how to have fun and yet get their goals accomplished, not make fun of me for reading a book and wanting to do homework instead of walking to the local food shop (yes those both happened). I'm going into the IT field (more on that next) so I will meet more people one day but for now what's the best way to find friends that are mature? I was thinking volunteering might be a start. 

**Work** Right now I work at a small store in the mall selling odds and ends. I have tried retail before and I thought this would be better but I just don't enjoy it. I have to deal with so many bad children that come in, I'm supposed to give customers BS sales pitches for products I don't recommend fully, and I just feel like I could be doing more. I tried to get an early start in IT but all of my leads; friends in the industry, college help desk (which doesn't exist), professors, and internship applications have lead to dead ends. I just want to work in a place I feel I am making a difference not worrying if my cash drawer is over or under or if I got enough membership sign ups to keep my job. 

Basically two areas I want to improve on are my job and my friends and I have no idea what to do or how I can do it. Please give me some advice or even some stories if you had similar feelings. Thanks if you read it all. 

**TL;DR:** Lacking mature friends and a real job to fulfill my happiness and have no idea what to do."

Let me start with a bit about me so you can understand my situation:

I am a college student studying computer science (starting my third year in the Fall) and I just got an internship as a Software Engineer at a pretty good company. Through school, I have learned C, C++, data structures, and Object-Oriented Programming. Also, I have taught myself C#, SQL, and a few basic web dev languages (which don't matter for this internship). I have also been teaching myself Python recently (important...)

I start the internship next Wednesday, but I have been getting more and more worried that I'm not qualified for the position. They seemed to have hired me as a deadline move because they wanted to hire someone to start next week.

They told me that their main language is Python, and that they will be expecting me to create automated tests, which I have never done any language at all. I certainly hope they will train me, but they haven't mentioned it. I am worried that they will be unhappy that I am not ready for this position at all, and simply fire me within a few weeks.

The thing is they are willing to work around my college schedule and have given me ~25 hours a week at 9.75 an hour. I'm trying to save all of this for a car. However I went online today and saw there's an IT Internship (Computer Information Systems major) that just got posted in a city over about 40 minutes by train from me, and I think I have a good shot at getting it based on the requirements. The thing is I have no idea what the hours will be like or how long it's for. However when I go back to college next semester I doubt I would be able to continue it anyway but the experience would be great. Also it's only 9/hour so I wouldn't be able to afford the car I need for next semester.

Thoughts? I'm thinking stay with retail until I save enough money and buy a car but I also REALLY want to work in IT and leave retail behind

I have recently been taken in by a company as an intern and I just found out still sets all of its workstations IPs statically. They also image every workstation manually instead of using a PXE server. 

I had a long talk with the boss in our one on one meeting and this just sort of came up and he asked me if I could change this, he really likes the idea of saving any amount of time and making things more efficient.

They use Symantec PC anywhere to remote into computer so the users can watch us if they need to, but they also have another way of remote in by using the IP of the computer and still watch us and it uses port 2000, ex: https://192.168.0.1:2000 and it brings up a login for your AD account to remote in. 

So if I was going to start this change to PXE, I'm going to need DHCP, but will this affect the ability to remote in by computer name? Because the computer name right now is mapped to it's static IP. And they have a script in the bottom corner of all workstations to show their IP and computer name. 

So I guess I'm wondering if it's possible to use DHCP but keep the workstations with the same IP as they had to not interfere with the remote assistance.

Or if you had any advice on what you would do if you joined a business with 500 static IP set computers.

I know some of this might be common sense, but I'm a new intern wanting to help this company make a big change and hopefully make it on full time and am over thinking everything.

Thanks,

So I am someone of Indian origin living in the USA. Brought up here, the whole deal.

I came across lots of studies saying that western sounding names perform much better in resume call backs. Is this leftist propaganda for more affirmative action? I don't know, it's possible. But let's get your opinon.

I was wondering if you guys believe there to be even a small amount of name discrimination in CS/engineering? Should I use a western nickname when applying for internships? 

I am aware there is a large amount of Indians in CS, so perhaps for this field especially, this is obsolete?

I'm a college student with 2 internship offers for the summer. 

Both are at venture funded, relatively small startups. 

Company A Pros: Structured, I know what I'm doing, interviewed with the people I'd be working with, there are more than 4 engineers to talk to, mentorship, standard SF startup perks and whatnot. Company has a ""hacking"" culture and altogether seems like a fun place to be. The code I push can reach lots of people.

Cons: Far away from my living quarters. I'd need to take Caltrain to and from, and then more transportation from the respective stops to my residence or office, and pay is a bit less than the other.

Company B Pros: Good $$$, and close to my residence. I could walk there if I pleased. Fundamental technology seems fairly interesting.

Cons: I don't know what I'd be doing. My interviewer himself acknowledged he wasn't sure what I'd be doing. It also doesn't feel very large, or very ""startup-y"" . I'm afraid I'd end up bored at best, and an outlier at worst. Feels somewhat unstructured.


Thoughts?

I just finished my freshman year at a top university with an original intent on being premed. I took pretty much all premed requirements (chem, bio, orgo, etc) and did very well in all my classes, however, I just found them to be boring. Those classes were nothing but memorization and even though I did well, I had no satisfaction from them.

I took multivariable calculus and linear algebra also and enjoyed both classes since I'm the type of person that enjoys solving puzzles and using what I learn in class to do so. Math is nothing but a logic problem and I really like applying myself that way. After speaking with friends and advisers, I think I'll give applied math - computer science a shot next semester.

Since I have no experience at all, I downloaded the lectures and assignments for the CS classes I'll be taking next semester and I'm working through them over the summer. I'm starting to really enjoy it! It's really tedious to learn the syntax of a language, but I'm starting to really appreciate the thinking involved behind writing code. 

I'm definitely switching out of premed, however, my only concern if I do Apma-CS is that I'll be starting a year late after ""wasting"" my first year. I feel like, compared to my peers in CS, I'll be too inexperienced to apply to internships next year and that I'll be at a disadvantage. 

What are your suggestions as to how I can catch up? I would also love to hear anyone's experiences from switching to CS from another major!

Afterward, they ban me from the university and refuse to answer any questions regarding the incident. Where should I start in my quest for litigation? Thanks!

The events surrounding the incident are quite complex. I was a graduate student at a major research university in Chicago &amp; lived in university housing. I had a nervous breakdown &amp; had to stay at a hospital. During this time, the university entered into my place &amp; discarded nearly all my property, many irreplaceable/unrecoverable (i.e. research, computer). I was then banned from the university without an explanation &amp; threatened with further disciplinary action should I seek litigation (discrimination? Intimidation?). The events have been very emotionally/psychologically traumatic (personal injury?). How should I proceed? What kind of lawyer/lawsuit should I be seeking? What area(s) of law does my situation fit? What are my chances of winning/settling a lawsuit?

With less than a month before possible statute of limitations taking into effect, I am urgently writing in hopes that someone may be able to help me with figuring out how I should pursue legal action against a major university in Chicago (where I was a graduate student) regarding a complex set of heinous discriminatory and biased actions made by the university which led to several personal injuries including the loss of my income, the loss of my place of living, the loss of countless unrecoverable, irreplaceable, and invaluable property and prized possessions, and the considerable loss my research as well as academic status and reputation, amongst other losses large and small, tangible and intangible. I strongly believe my civil rights and the reasonable accommodation protections for my disabilities were grossly violated by the university through their actions. The foremost reason I am writing is regarding the significant psychological and emotional injuries that have severely affected me; injuries caused by the university’s negligence and mishandling of a situation which occurred near the end of the spring quarter in 2013 (June 2013). Since the incident, I have considered pursuing possible litigation against the university, but not sure how I should proceed and have been held back in fear as the university is a huge and wealthy institution and I am not. Furthermore, the university’s intimidation of further disciplinary action should I pursue legal action has made me feel uncomfortable about proceeding with litigation. However, the persisting and worsening mental anguish and suffering, and unceasing emotional pain and distress, caused by the university’s actions continue to traumatize and torment my day to day life. After consulting the advice of friends and colleagues, and conducting some research online, I feel a civil rights/discrimination/injury litigation may fit my case suitably. However, I would like to hear about all the possible legal options I should pursue from someone with legal knowledge, preferably an experienced attorney. I would also like to know about the possibility of lowered or contingent fees, or if my case can be carried pro bono, as I am now on SSI Disability and have limited funds. Furthermore, as I understand, I may be limited in time to pursue litigation, thus please let me know as soon as you can about what legal avenues or attorneys I should pursue. That being said, I feel confident that someone here may have very appropriate and useful advice fitting to my circumstances, and if feasible, closer to forming a formidable lawsuit.

Brief Back Story: 

I was a graduate student at a major research university in Chicago (the one Obama went to), pursuing my Master’s in Sociology, from 2012 to 2013. I struggled (and still struggle) with several documented mental illnesses, the main ones being Major Depression, General Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Agoraphobia, PTSD, OCPD, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. While I tried to manage my mental illnesses along with the stresses of the highly rigorous graduate program, to my misfortune, the mental conditions grew worse through the school year, culminating with me barricading myself in the university housing graduate student apartment I was residing at the end of the spring quarter of 2013 (March-June). I barricaded myself in my apartment by securing the front door with industrial foam epoxy. I did this to focus on my course finals and research, and to prevent myself from activities which might distract me. On the morning of June 14th 2013, I hear a large crash. My front door had been battered down by the police (Chicago and UCPD campus police). I was caught in shock. Police surrounded me and the Dean of Students escorted me to the student counseling center. There I met with an emergency counselor who forwarded me to Chicago Lakeshore Hospital. I stayed at the hospital until June 29th. Somehow the hospital had gotten hold of my parents during my stay, without my consent or knowledge. My parents flew in from Sacramento, California. The hospital would only discharge me to my parents and mandated that I must return straight to Sacramento with my parents (a command from the university as Lakeshore hospital is affiliated with the university). This was not explained to me: why I could only be released to my parents, and why I had to go straight non-stop to California. It turns out a great deal was not explained to me, to my parents (who do not speak English fluently), to my brother who came with my parents, and to a close friend who was living with me at the time. During and after everything that happened, the university and the hospital would deny my requests for information and explanations. The only piece of information that I was able to attain was my hospital records.

During my time at the hospital, the university went into my apartment and discarded nearly everything inside, save a few boxes which contained some possessions which I remember was on my desk such as one of my laptops (which was smashed and in bad shape). Several thousand dollars in cash I had in my desk were never reported for. More atrociously, nearly everything related to my thesis research was gone (hundreds of hours of work), including written materials such as notebooks and journals, as well as digital materials such as other computers and hard disks. Other items included irreplaceable, invaluable and unrecoverable possessions such as hand written mail, photographs, albums, art, jewelry, gifts, rare books and collectibles, amongst countless other possessions. 

The university never asked for my consent nor did they inform me about their entering into my apartment and discarding of my property while I was in the hospital. However, the university was completely aware I was in the hospital during this time. The university did not mention about what they did to my apartment and property until my parents arrived at the hospital and started asking questions – nearly two weeks later. By then, it was too late. Everything was gone. When my parents, brother, and close friend (who lived with me for parts of the year) went to my apartment to look through and rescue my property in the trash receptacle (the large rectangular kind that one would find typically at construction sites) placed in front of my apartment, they were immediately met with university officials who would not permit them to look through the trash receptacle filled with my belongings, which was then strangely towed away within minutes after my family and friend encountered the university officials. So, did university housing not want my family to know what valuables and invaluables had been haphazardly thrown out? Why did the university react with such immediacy to discard all evidence regarding their hasty clear out of my apartment? Would the university have done this to someone who did not have a mental disability? To this day I do now know the answers to these questions. The university refuses to answer any inquiries regarding the incident. My family and friends who have asked the university for answers were met with silence. My professors and thesis advisors who have inquired university administrative officials received silence. The university simply would not speak about the incident when asked. Shortly after the incident, Sam Cholke, a journalist writing for the Hyde Park Herald and DNAinfo Chicago, contacted me for some correspondence as he was trying to write an article about my incident at the university, which was beginning to cause rumors and theories amongst the community. Even Cholke, who was trying to objectively investigate the incident, was met with silence when talking with university officials regarding the incident. In addition to the silence regarding the incident and myself, the university has banned me from entering any university property, threatening me with arrest if I do. That is likely not going to happen, as I reside in California now, and I am trying to avoid anything having to do with university and my time there. However, thoughts about the university and the incident persistently intrude my mind and my life through painful emotions and memories, and violent flashbacks and nightmares. Not even in my sleep can I find rest from what happened at the university. But then again, how does one forget about the entity that took everything away from them and then refuses to answer inquiries about their egregious actions? I lost my pay (paid internship at a museum on campus), student body status, my most prized irreplaceable possessions (photographs and letters, gifts, rare collectibles, hard disks with several years worth of photos, memories, and other personal data), and substantial parts of my research. Figuratively speaking, I nearly lost my mind (psychotic episodes triggered from the distressing thoughts and emotions regarding the traumatic incident), and several times, nearly lost my own life (attempted suicide).

I guess you can leave a place, but the place won’t leave you. The heinous and discriminatory actions performed by the university have had severe and lasting psychological and emotional effects on me. It has now been nearly two years since the incident, and my mental state has not recovered much since then. If anything, I believe it has worsened. Through the many sessions of talking with my current therapist, I have come to a conclusion that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the ‘Chicago incident’ has significantly affected and altered my preexisting mental conditions for the worse.  To live through trauma once is painful, but to live through it again and again is a living hell. Not a single day passes without the thoughts about what the university did to me coming up, often several times a day. Now, as the anniversary of the incident steadfastly approaches, the troubling thoughts and flashbacks of what happened in Chicago attack me several times an hour, cruelly consuming nearly all of my waking life, and they do not stop there. As I mentioned before, thoughts and flashbacks that consistently trespass my consciousness while I am awake is troubling, but that the thoughts would ceaselessly invade me in my sleep, in the form of terrorizing nightmares, is beyond disturbing.
 
Ever since the incident, the thought of pursuing litigation against the university has been on my mind. However, I have been unsure of how to proceed. Furthermore, the intimidation and threats made by the university that they would make my life even more difficult (i.e. disciplinary actions) if I seek litigation made me even more wary about pursuing my legal options. However, at this time, with all the extensive injuries I have succumbed from the university’s actions, I am putting their intimidation and coercions to the side, and am looking for a capable lawyer who can fight for my rights and restitution. Furthermore, I hope to see retribution take place for the university. Above all, I am seeking justice.

The entire story and sequence of events that occurred would be far too long and nuanced for a brief back story. With what I have written, I hope to have explained a complicated and complex incident with as much clarity and concision as I can without losing the multifaceted contents of what had happened. I have extensive personal records of the events (i.e. journal entries, e-mails, texts, social media posts) as well as official medical records and records from witnesses, and the version of the story that the university has released to my parents. All of the records I have gathered are available if you need them to better understand and legitimize my claim that the heinous and discriminatory actions (intentional or out of negligence) of the university have resulted in several agonizing and lasting injuries for me. I have attempted to explain the injuries the university caused me as objectively as I can, and I apologize for the emotional overtones that can be felt throughout this message, but after all, if I felt no emotions towards the egregious errors the university has committed, I wouldn’t have been so compelled to write this letter or look for help at all. Though I am anxious and still have some apprehensions about how to go forward, I strongly believe that someone might be able to provide trustworthy and invaluable advice as I try to construct and execute a litigation that will have high chances of winning/settling. Any piece of advice would be extremely helpful for me as I try to pursue legal action against the university. 

With thanks,
John

Is it worth it to delay my graduation a year? I get schooling for close to nothing because of financial grants, so the costs aren't too incredibly painful. But I was just wondering whether it would be worth it in the long run.

374r60,2,2015-05-24,Diversification,ApolloMichaels,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/374r60/diversification/,"Hey everyone, I’ve been having some strange dreams, and I thought this was the right place to talk about it. Quick background on me: my name is Apollo, I’m 25 years old, and I live and work in Midtown Manhattan as a financial advisor. They say “pick your boss, not your job”- I did the opposite. I asked my dad to help me get an internship here because I loved the idea of it— that was six years ago now. I know, it’s not popular nowadays, but financial advising can be noble. A good investment portfolio is like a strong heart, pumping every second to provide the lifeblood of money for the rest of your life.

You see, financial advising is about so many things. it’s about planning, it’s about balance, it’s about knowledge. It’s about making sure you have enough for the future. And if you’re investing for retirement, the stability is what really matters, not the individual investments. The bigger picture is what you need to focus on- diversification.

Sometimes my clients hear a “hot stock tip” from their friend down the street, and want to invest in it. Honestly, this kind of pisses me off, but it’s not my job to dictate, merely to advise. I’m like the Finance Minister to Kings all around the world, and then the Kings listen to their Court Jester.

So, anyway, sorry- I really like talking about this, I get that it’s not interesting to most people. This is what’s been bothering me. One of my clients, Farnsworth, he’s about 40 years old, big barrel-chested man. Always thinks he’s right. He was making absurd stock picks and wrecking his returns. Penny stocks left and right, and losing thousands on thousands of dollars. Of course, I don’t see any money from this either, because I get paid on residuals from mutual funds. It was a lose-lose situation, so I dropped him as a client. He was really upset- he kept asking me not to, but I knew it was for the best.

Here’s the thing. That was six months ago. I haven’t seen him since. But I keep dreaming about him.

The dream keeps happening the same way. I’m taking a lunch break and swinging by my place, but in that dream way— you know, where none of the details match your apartment, but you know it is. I walk in, and Farnsworth is there, lying on the ground. There is a pack of wolves snarling, ripping at him. And he’s bleeding, he’s bleeding so badly, but instead of blood, he’s bleeding dollar bills. I feel a panic attack coming on, and as I try to leave through the door I came in, it’s turned into a mirror.

I look at myself in the mirror, and I’m holding a heart. When I turn back around, Farnsworth is standing behind me, now with a gaping hole in his chest. The wolves are gone, and he keeps reaching into the cavity and pulling out fistful after fistful of dollars, offering them to me. He starts talking to me, but his lips aren’t moving, and it isn’t his voice— it’s mine. It’s gibberish, the lot of what he’s saying is gibberish, but he’s so desperate, he’s pleading with me, louder and louder.

I always ask him to stop. I always tell him that I only tried to help him. That I let him go not to hurt him, not to steal his future, but because I knew it wasn’t going to work out. That it was for his own good. I didn’t mean to take his heart from his chest, what pumps his lifeblood, but he gave me no other option. He was always only focused on the individual, making insane individual investments, begging for his individual life, not understanding about diversification. It’s about stability. It’s about long-term planning. He never understood that, and if you can’t understand that, why I do what I do, there’s no getting through. And he never listens, and all I ever hear is him yelling gibberish, in my voice, through the hole in his chest.

And then I wake up, sweating. See, logically, I know ending that relationship was for the best. But clearly I still feel bad about it. Does anyone have any ideas on how to make the dreams stop?

Oh, and if you have any referrals, I’ve got an opening for a new client."

If my skillet aligns with your work and you are willing to take me under your wing this summer, feel free to shoot me a pm to discuss this further. I look forward to working with one of you.  "
377y1r,3,2015-05-25,Deciding between two job offers.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/377y1r/deciding_between_two_job_offers/,"Some months ago, I started working as a consultor for a consulting company, this is: Client(CompanyA(CompanyB(Me))).

The pay was low, the project wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but the commute and the office location was great (20 min, in the center of a big city, with everything at walking distance), and basically, I needed the money. There's some programming to be done with modern, stablished tech everyone asks for in their job postings, but there's only one dude working with it, and is a basically stablished and finished application with only graphic details remaining.

After few months in my current job, CompanyC (which I interviewed before I accepted this job) sent me a new offer: Way more pay than CompanyB, full development position (what I'm looking for), but really bad location (1hr commute, far away of everything, like most of the tech related work in my city), and kind of old tech into what seems to be some a chaotic, but stable, project.

I accepted, both for being able to code again 8 hours a day and to get a more decent salary, and told CompanyB and CompanyA that I was leaving. Now, after some talks, CompanyA is offering me more or less the same salary than companyC to fill in the post of the dude who was working developing, as he's leaving to other client.

I've researched a bit on CompanyA (Big consulting company), and it seems no one says anything good about it. Everyone says that its a good place to start a career (I have 1-2 years experience, with internships), learn, but sink 10-12 hours of work a day and left when you burn out. The project here, though, is really relaxed and slow paced. 
Also, I haven't really saw a lot of development work coming our way. I don't know if this is good (as I could spend the time learning the tech behind the application) or bad (As I would end up doing not related to programming stuff or moved to other project).

So... basically I'm between two ""not excellent but nice"" offers (With similar economic conditions):

CompanyC:

* Actual development work. Part of a development team with old, known tech.
* Potential messed up project. Seems to be patches over patches over patches.
* Unknown coworkers and working conditions. There's nothing on glassdoor about it (Not US company) or in other webpages.
* No mention to overtime on the interviews I did.
* No mention on future salary raises.
* If everything goes right, I can have a nice post in a development team which uses a tech I'm somewhat familiar with and grow a bit as a developer with some stability. If everything goes wrong, I will be in a messed up project pushing spaghetti code every month.

CompanyA:

* Relaxed project. Close to home, near the center of the city. Great work environment where I could end up calling ""friend"" most of the coworkers, and I'm not the most sociable guy around.
* Most of the people who wrote any comment on this company talks about it being a terrible place to work. Most of the complains don't affect our current project, though.
* No actual development schedule for our project. No development team or support on the tech. Honestly, I don't even have a written confirmation that I would end up in the coworker's post (Although the need for someone to fill in is real).
* Current tech everyone uses, clean project, cool stuff. But huge as hell, lot of stuff to learn before being operative. Quite a challenge I'm not really sure I could take on quickly.
* A bit suspicious that CompanyA agrees on moving me from ""somewhat developer"" to ""full time developer"" after so few months of work for them. Maybe its impostor syndrome. Maybe its just them wishing to finish the project so they can fire me.
* If everything goes right, I will be near home, in a great environment, learning useful tech at my pace. If everything goes wrong I could end up in a different destination which could negate all the pros of my current position or if I don't move, I could end up not being able to catch up on the huge application as I would be mostly alone with it.


I have to end saying that I truly value my time outside work. I don't mind spend some weeks ""with no life"", but I want to do more than wake, work, sleep every day for months. I want to have time to side projects and stuff not related with computers, and the unpaid overtime of CompanyA is kind of scaring me.

37832r,2,2015-05-25,Thank you all but my internship isn't ideal..,gwkuser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37832r/thank_you_all_but_my_internship_isnt_ideal/,"Hi everyone, I used to be frustrated that I would apply and get lots of interviews but I would never get an offer extended due to my lack of technical skills. It turns out firms still hired in the spring and they were not the big companies that screen through technical capability but a willingness to learn, and this subreddit made me realize that and I listened to the advice and kept pressing on.

With that said, I now work in an insurance firm in the IT department but they do mainly web applications and not lower level stuff at all, which is more along the lines of what I want to do since I'm an ECE major interested in firmware. I am having trouble learning all the web development stuff with all the different confusing platforms that link together in a very confusing and cloudy way, which are .NET, c#, html, JavaScript, css, jQuery, SQL, and more stuff I forgot at the moment. 

My first reaction is why the hell do we need all this stuff just for developing the web? And my second reaction is that I'm open to learning more object oriented programming to hopefully further my capability in interviews. My third reaction is then would having an internship in web development hurt me in trying to get a more systems based internship next year because HR ppl may think ""he applied for the wrong job, he would be a better fit for web development""... If not, how would I word this internship in my resume to make it more fitting for systems based roles? Can someone address my concerns? Thanks very much."
3787vn,6,2015-05-25,How to make yourself noticed if you don't have job experience and don't have an amazing academic record?,CS_noob_student,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3787vn/how_to_make_yourself_noticed_if_you_dont_have_job/,"I am currently finishing my first year studying CS and next year I'll be applying for internships. While I am confident in my abilities to pass the technical interviews, I hear that most people never get a chance to show themselves off in an interview because they get rejected solely on the basis of their CV.

This really worries me because my academic record, while not exactly terrible, is not excellent either (70% average from a UK university, which roughly translates to something like 3.0 GPA from a US university), and the closest thing that comes to ""work experience"" which I have is for one of my courses I had to create an app that allowed you to connect, set-up and communicate with an arduino-based ""home security system"" via bluetooth. I put it in quotes because it's not a real security system, just something that Microsoft wanted for a demo at one of it's conferences. Also I don't think there is any official record anywhere that I did a project involved with Microsoft, so I can't really try to make myself stand out by putting a fancy brand name in my CV either.

I have about 4-5 months until I have to start sending applications, and I would like to do something in those months that I could actually put on my CV. I have few ideas for personal projects which I could put up on github, but I really doubt those count for much. It's an issue of time really - there are many things that I can do to make myself a better programmer, but I only have time for some of those things and not all of them I can put on paper to make myself look like a good programmer when a recruiter is reading my CV in 30 seconds and then deciding whether to forward it to the interviewer. ""Read CLRS"" or ""Learned about concurrency"" is definitely useful, but not something you put on a CV :).

So my question is: How can I spend the next 4-5 months to enhance my CV enough to get to the interview stage of the application? If you're a recruiter, what would make you reconsider throwing a CV into the garbage if you see a mediocre GPA and no proper work experience?

P.S. I know some people will probably say that I should still apply for jobs or part-time jobs or something like that, but I don't really see that as an option because right now I have a good breadth of knowledge, but lack depth. The only two programming languages that I am moderately comfortable with are C and Java, and I am also currently studying Haskell. For C I know enough to be able to program a robot on two wheels (with some provided libraries) and with some sensors to explore a maze while mapping its location and then find the shortest path from beginning to the end and drive along it. For Java I know enough to make some very simplistic apps."

Soon I'll be moving onto Angular and other frameworks (see the CodeSchool javascript path, that is what I'm going through) and then Node hopefully by the end of the summer. Assuming I'm able to complete everything by then, will I have sufficient knowledge to apply for an entry level position?

TL;DR: My bf's mom doesn't approve of me but there's no reason for it. We just Skyped and she got upset that he was talking to me and I don't know if I can handle it anymore.

Backstory: I met my boyfriend almost 2 years ago in a class our freshman year of college. He was dating a girl at the time who was really close with his mom. I think she saw/sees this girl as her own daughter. My bf is an only child and his father passed away while he was in middle school so it's just him and his mom. He and this girl broke up last May (2014) after almost 3 years together. His mom was pretty nasty to him about the breakup even though he did nothing to warrant that treatment. He was pretty close with his mom before this breakup, so it was really strange. It became clear that she didn't like me or approve of our friendship (we were best friends by that point). My family lives across the country from him so when the spring semester was over, I didn't see him again until the fall.

Come fall of 2014, we were back at school so we started hanging out more than ever. We slowly started to fall for each other and in November we became a couple. We've been together for 6 months now and we couldn't be happier. I love him to the moon and back and would give anything for him. However, his mother is still an issue. It looked like things were getting better for a while but tonight just crushed all hope of that. 

We were Skyping and I noticed he was a little off and he seemed to be in a bad mood after a bit. Turns out his mom had come in and was upset that we were chatting. We both got upset and he started apologizing and I was reassuring him that it wasn't his fault (because it isn't, at all). After a little bit, he said he had to go to bed because he has to get up to go to work in the morning and he just wanted today to be over and that's when I started crying. We hung up but now I don't know what to do.

I cannot take this any more. This woman is just making it so much harder for us. I did *nothing* wrong. Absolutely nothing. And neither did he. I don't know why she hates me so much. She's met me once. I am at a loss and don't know what to do because this is upsetting him and that upsets me. I love him to death. But why is she doing this? What can I do to cope? I have a history of depression but I move around a lot (I see a counselor at school but I'm home at the moment and won't be back at school until August and I have an internship in another location in between) and this isn't helping.

This is my first relationship and I've never dealt with this before. My friends' parents all like me (they've also met me more than once). I'm definitely far from perfect, but I'm pretty straight-laced, I'm a good student, and I don't get in trouble. I love my boyfriend more than anything and we have a great relationship and really good communication. I don't want to tell him how much this is really bothering me because he'll feel bad and that's the last thing he needs and the last thing I want for him.

So reddit, do you have any advice? "

I want to use my last payment to upgrade to an 970GTX and a SSD. I've constantly checked on prices while I waited for my paycheck (you know that feeling I guess). For me It's the perfect moment to buy right now. You get two games for free with a 970gtx and theres a cashback promotion by ASUS where you get 35€. So the SSD (850 Evo 500gb) and the graphics card would cost me about 500€ after the cashback. Which is pretty nice and leaves me with a bit of my payment for other fun stuff (don't forget to go outside guys ;) ). Well today I received my paycheck and I thought I'll finally be able to purchase the goods. Jut another note: the game-key promo expires on 1th june. So... today I wanted to make my order and suddenly the SSD is 40€ more expensive and the strix is 10€ more expensive. So even with the cashback I would pay more than I would've paid before the prices went up. That sucks... I don't know if I should wait or not. I really want the witcher promo key. It's a 40€ game... on the other hand I think the key goes pretty cheap on ebay right now. Ahhh I'm just so annoyed right now :(

Now it's been a total of about 3 years since I graduated and I don't really know how to go about finding a job, or making myself desirable to a company. I graduated in CS, but I felt that I could get better advice on my situation here than on /r/cscareerquestions.

Pluses:

* I graduated with a good GPA (B.S in computer science).
* I had an internship with a large, reputable company the summer before I graduated.

Minuses:

* 3 year gap after graduation.
* I haven't done many projects in my downtime (which is somewhat important for CS jobs).
* I haven't spoken to any of my former employers/supervisors since I worked for them.
* My parents' house (where I'm living) is pretty noisy (from external factors like construction, neighbors' dogs), so I'm a little worried a phone interview might get interrupted or make it difficult to hear the interviewer.

Questions: 

1) How should I explain my post-graduation employment gap? I feel like if I mention surgery straight away, it is a heavy subject and can turn off the interviewer, or give them the idea that I might be a liability even though I'm fully recovered.

2) What's the ""right"" way to go about asking my old employers for a reference? I haven't spoken to my internship supervisor or manager since my internship finished (in 2012), but the internship ended on great terms. I also have had two other jobs even more distant in the past (one during the previous summer, and one as a TA for a quarter at college, both in 2011), but I haven't spoken to them since I stopped working for them, either.

I'm currently in graduate school for Professional Applied and Computational Mathematics, and one of the requirements to graduate is to do an internship.  I've gotten two interviews so far but have been turned down from both of them due to other interviewees being ""more qualified"".  I can't really do anything about my work experience since the internship is where that experience will be coming from, but I'm wondering if they would make judgments based on my appearance.

I am not obese, but I do have a bit of a gut (probably can't tell unless I'm not wearing a shirt, though).  Otherwise, I'm rather skinny.  I barely have any muscle because I don't like exercising that much, although I'm contemplating getting a gym membership this summer to fix these issues if it would help improve my chances of getting a position (or at the very least, to do SOMETHING productive besides sitting at home playing video games all day).  I also have frequent acne breakouts on my face, but I'm trying to be more hygienic to hopefully mitigate them (I could use treatments like Proactiv, but they're really tedious to use and I don't like having stuff on my face in general).

Basically, I'm worried potential employers will infer that if I don't care about my physical appearance, then I won't care about performing the job I'm applying for either.  Though honestly, i can't say I do care much about my appearance other than what's necessary to make it in the world these days.  I know experience and good social skills/confidence are probably more significant when it comes to netting a business position, but if I can improve my chances by taking better care of myself physically, there's no reason not to try doing so.  What do you suggest?"

37d3cv,1,2015-05-26,"Trying to choose between Product Design (feature-set, UI and/or UX Design), Networking or Software Development Fields...",xc3llerator,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/37d3cv/trying_to_choose_between_product_design/,"So (after several f/t internships, casual jobs, and reading multiple threads on IT fields) basically in the IT industry from the fields I enjoy learning about or doing:

- **Networking/System Infra**: Pretty much go into this if you want very little to do with designing the front-end of a (web/app based) product (or caring about its feature development). You're mainly ensuring the 'always-on' reliability with smooth consistent performance. Technical skills are interoperable between any company you hit. Things are pretty much black and white on paper (literally - look at Network Design papers) in this field. It either works or it doesn't, if it still seems like magic, well then you don't know all of the network(s)'s environmental variables yet.

Cons: Usually involves being subjected to long overtime (we're talking saying goodbye to your weekends depending on the size of your company, the smaller the worse for networking roles, since you'll generally be the only Net Admin, something fucks up, guess who's staying back until its fixed - you basically become enslaved to potentially an endless string of environment machine variables - this is very much a higher-class support role, so beware) and on-call off-peak hours. If you love networks/system admin... yeah no, you still love your sleep.

- **Product Design** (encompasses [UX](http://on.fb.me/1BnGoX6), UI/Interaction Design): Basically go into this if you want everything to do with the (front-end feature set) product's development, but don't really care about its back-end! (As long as it's up, which the Infra guys are responsible for, or more colloquially known as 'server/router monkeys'). Design skills are interoperable between any company you hit. This group is generally colloquially known as 'hipster designers'. 

Cons: Involves dealing with subjective decisions/behaviour on a daily basis. Your precious design work may be torn apart and replaced by another (perhaps younger?) designer's work who seems to have a better fit design in the eyes of another higher up Manager or Designer's role (If company doesn't practice UX Research and A/B tests). This would easily cause a social imbalance if the company's management is shit like this and doesn't know how to boost designer morale. Nothing can be really deemed as solely 'right or wrong', but rather relies upon subjective viewpoints and decision making, this will cause distress among Designers of contrasting perspectives. May also involve long hours, outside of work hours, thinking about inspiration and drafting up ideas. But if you truly love design, it wouldn't feel like work at all. You'll love it!

- **Software Development** (Basically just coding and/or creating DBs): The glue between the Infra and the Product's Design. (Makes shit work on [and off] the screen). Skills are interoperable (depending on language and programming paradigms you're familiar with). Probably more colloquially known as 'geeks/nerds' to the general public. Lets you pretty much craft anything computers can do today or will do.

Cons: Involves dealing with long stretches of potentially tedious code, perhaps even old code bases with poor documentation. In larger companies, you'd get lesser say in the design process (Product feature sets) and would rather just be tasked with developing the solution given the set of (front-end) design requirements. Involves long periods of staring at a screen, looking at thin lines of code. Has been known to drive people mad and away from IT. Can also involve long hours depending on your company, if you love code that much, you may love this!

I think probably Product Design would be a good fit for my passion AS WELL AS interest ([Great TEDx talk w/ 2.4 million views. 'You will have 20 different interests, but you must choose one as a passion'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKHTawgyKWQ)). I think in Networking/infra and Software Dev, I definitely have interest, and some passion in each, but probably not as great as getting Product (UI) designs right and developed. I'm a pixel junkie. It's why I prefer to take my time with things, get them right (or near right) the first time round.

I think it's perhaps time to start an app (startup?) and utilise all three! :D Screw being pigeon holed into one role? LEARN ALL THE THINGS! Fuck it, Entrepreneurship b1tch! 

In summary, I just see Infra/Support roles are something that HAS to be done and many IT people usually just choose this route by default due to a traditional Mr/Mrs fix-it around households when System or Network issues arose during their early childhood/teen/early adult lives. Not saying that it's the equivalent (in pay or environment) to a garbage man or cleaner, but the routine based maintenance (backups, system performance monitoring) can certainly feel like that at times in contrast with Product Design or Software Dev (who literally don't even have to worry about that shit given that the company is large enough to have an infra team to take care of that, sometimes a Software Dev will be tasked with both roles of coding and infra work in bootstrapped companies - I can't imagine Dev productivity being any good as it scales though). Product Design has this sense of bliss, pure negligence for infra/system admin based tasks, has the most influence (out of these roles) over the product's feature-set direction. Generally appeals to people you develop a keen eye for detail, especially in user interfaces, and being continuously empathic to the user's viewpoint. May occasionally involve testing and submitting bugs to Software Devs. Software Developers are generally the 'fix-it's or 'built-it's from a virtual point of view. Probably appeals more to people who like TECHNICALLY creating things from a set of pre-defined requirements. Some Software Developers would care less about design if the company has Designers on hand. 

I think all this can go back to passion for ***Lego*** as a kid. All three of these fields can relate to Lego in their own way:

- Networking, it's like the best of both worlds in terms of getting physical stuff to play with + also getting the logical schema requirements right or following them. The requirements come from technical capacity requirements.
- Product Design, the lego pieces are just UI elements, the requirements are collected from users through UX research or user feedback.
- Software Dev, the lego pieces are pretty much code functions or strings of code. Requirements generally come from other Software Devs and/or Infra dudes (for back-end work) + Design team for front-end work.

This is a good response (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/26vl9k/sysadmin_jobs_are_dying_learn_to_code_software/#chvq6mm) I came across towards the end of last year. Although it doesn't mention anything about Product Design since it's out of the scope of that thread. Interested to hear other peoples' thoughts. 

PS: I've had probably over a decade exp troubleshooting tech issues at home and have interned for 6 months f/t in a  corporate Sys Admin/IT Support role talking to a Network Admin as well. Support is VERY routine based and doesn't allow any influence of a products feature or UI direction. I've been interested in UI Design even since playing video games (BFBC2) as a (16-17 years old) teen, and thinking about how they design the nav menus in the way they do. I'm nearing the end of my 4 year IT degree. Thinking about studying Android Development (and UI Design) next semester as my final subject/elective. I currently have an offer with Cisco to intern with them for 6 months f/t (8:30am-5:30am) 9 hr days, for about AUD 4k a month (AUD ~$16.8 an hr) which isn't bad as an intern, but I'm nearly a graduate, so I should technically be looking at applying for grad roles now and not wasting time on sub-paid internships (Applying for a job is a f/t job in itself at times, but I use InDesign and my resume is neat af!). I'm currently 21, turning 22 next month. I'm thinking if I don't make the jump into the Product Design world now, I'll get sucked into doing support things for the majority of my career. My future aspiration or goals in Product Design would be to secure a job in a reputable web company doing Product Design. (E.g. For [Facebook](http://on.fb.me/1BnDgdO) or Google). A few years ago I was thinking of going into a [26-month support role](http://linkd.in/1BnCE7Q) ([Technology Residency Program (ITRP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w2YUJie9Bs)) at Google. But this role is more than 2 years, and looks like it would only benefit people wanting to further their career in support/infra based roles. *IT Residency alumni have advanced on to a variety of positions, both at Google and other top-tier technology companies, in roles such as networking, security, site reliability engineering, system administration and support.* No doubt, the Cisco internship would be beneficial if I was to apply for the ITRP, as it does give you a CCNA paid by Cisco, but it's a very remote field from Product Design. I want to be able to have influence about how a product's feature set actually is and the UI involved. Which is probably more like being an [Interaction or Motion Designer](http://linkd.in/1BnDaCO). 

I guess the [ITRP does offer a route to Product Design too if you want to afterwards](http://linkd.in/1BnDtxH), but doing IT Support is something I want to steer away from, since it becomes drastically harder to build up design experience. I guess what I did Support for so long is because I care about the end-user experience being right so much! So it just seems like an opportune transition into Product Design (UI/UX). I guess Support is like a technical version/support of UX to the user. :P (But UX in this context as two meanings, the ACTUAL end user user-experience and the FIELD user experience). Maybe it would be worthwhile taking that Cisco role. (It's a B2B lvl 3 support role, I would replicate network issues if needed to solve client issues), but it does feel very distant to Product Design! I did a quick Google search and found top Interaction Designer profiles at Google. [This guy](http://linkd.in/1BnE16G) ranks out on top (Not sure how LinkedIn ranks profiles, but I assume just from recommendations and amount of profile data). He has worked at Cisco too, but as Product Designer, not support. Kind of stuck in a rut. I have 5 days to decline or accept the Cisco offer (The hiring process was EXTREMELY quick, within 2 weeks of applying, they offered me the role, I guess I just did to see what the interview process would be like and to see if I'd pulled through it, but I'm having [severe second thoughts/hesitation accepting](http://on.fb.me/1BnGcag) another support role, since I know what they're like and it isn't my full ambitions to continue with the support field, even though I'm deeply curious about anything IT technical  and would spend hours fixing stuff if I have to (I become deeply infatuated, but that's all it is, infatuation because a modem went down and I'm wondering why from the logs, there is no longer vision or goal there as what I have with Product Design spotting so many UI issues or feature improvements that COULD be made, but often take years or are never made)), I just feel like my time and values can be better aligned in a Product Designer role, despite the subjective views you have to deal with in Product Design. I haven't had much time to apply for other companies yet for Product Design roles, but I've been [rapidly looking this past day or two](http://on.fb.me/1BnGfD6), and an Atlassian recruiter got back to me already for [Product Design](http://linkd.in/1GyjKRK).

In the words of Steve Jobs, 
*“If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.”*

Is anyone else in or has been in the same position? I haven't proof-read this, if I have time later I will, it's currently 5AM in Sydney. Open to any advice. Thanks!

Oh yeah, I guess [my LinkedIn](http://linkd.in/1BnFM3y) would help for previous exp. I've done a fair amount of wireframing work during High-school and university, just not much to show for it in a dedicated Interaction Design role yet. (Apart from a Testing one). I don't want to let previous exp influence my future much, but a lot of those previous exp. I didn't really have a strong say in which role I would go in (or was limited by company offerings during sponsorship of my degree).

I think I want to have a diverse Dev + UI Design skillset like [this Facebook Product Designer](http://linkd.in/1BnGM7S). (I already know a fair amount of how web scripting and markup works (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS,) URL encoding, SEO stuff) and already know how to make interactive wireframe (that is easy), I just need the design glue in-between, called EXPERIENCE! Aha (Hence, why I'm thinking of taking an Android Dev elective to ship my first Android app, I've only even shipped a poorly designed interface [VB.NET 3-in-1 Snake, Space Invader and Light Cycles game program](http://bit.ly/1FVbLj5) - requires Windows] in high school and a [mobile responsive (media queries) semi-outdated 2013 portfolio site](http://j.mp/1wPKkmf). (Needs an update, thinking of a new design + URL to showcase design work). I found that my IT degree was so broad in terms of field scope, that it was incredibly demotivating at times to think about completing and even choosing a field in IT to launch into, but there is one thing that remain consistent, my passions and their varying degrees for the three different fields I mentioned above. I'm pretty much just finishing off my degree to satisfy Visa (2 year) working requirements for overseas (US) jobs."

&gt; HRwiener: This is the guy that keeps letting spam through to our mailboxes. *laugh* no, really he's a good guy and does a great job keeping things working.

With that he waves and leads the little squirrelly person off. I shrug and go back to my break and try to recover some of my ratio.

Later that day....the phone rings, I answer it with my normal joyful self, I get interrupted as I begin.



&gt; HRwiener: There is still no equipment at Squirrely's desk.

&gt; Me: Hi, I'm doing fine! How have you been?

I can hear the gears cranking up in HRwiener's brainbox, after a few moments he finds his words.

&gt; HRwiener: I'm fine, but the new user is still without a workstation and her phone is set to vacant, it should have her name.

I flip through a few programs and I can't find any new employee data for Squirrely.

&gt; Me: I got nothing for a new employee, which department is she in? 

I thought maybe the manager just didn't click submit like a good little worker drone.

&gt; HRwiener: She is in marketing, how do you not know this?

&gt; Me: Because someone didn't submit the forms, I don't have a machine pulled, imaged and setup for Squirrely.

&gt; HRwiener: Typical, you guys are so lazy down there in IT.

&gt; Me: I don't know what to tell you, I'll call MarketingManager and see what's up, ok?

That seemed to appease him, somewhat, and I spend the next 20 minutes finding MarketingManager.

&gt; Me: hey we don't have the paper work on this new hire of yours. Do you have here resume or details tht you could send me.

&gt; MarketingManager: I didn't hire anyone, I don't know what your talking about....

That rung some bells, I thanked him for his time and headed up front. I found HRwiener in his office, I walk in and set down across from his desk.

&gt; Me: Where is Squirrely? We didn't hire anyone for marketing. 

&gt; HRwiener: What do you mean? She said she was here to start in marketing today!

&gt; Me: What I mean is, you let some strange person in the building and you've been walking here around the building. Even gave her a desk, I hope you remember where you left her...

He jumps up and dashes off to find the mystery woman, I tag along in his wake grinning, thinking this was grand ol' fun. To sum up at this point, there is now a missing girl in the building and we have gotten security involved. While they are dashing around checking and locking rooms, I head to the server rack with the cameras.

I find her at the vacant desk and follow her to one of the exits, which the door is locked without a badge, an then she goes to one of the restrooms.

I let security know an they go in swat style, and find her crying in one of the stalls.

Poor kid was an intern for the company down the street, HRwiener took some initiative and nabbed her from the lobby since the receptionists couldn't find MarketingManager.

*The company was in the process of changing the name slightly so we didn't have any signs up outside the building at the time. The poor girl was just 15 and her mom dropped her off at the wrong address. HRwiener wanted to charge her with trespassing. This is what earned him the name...*

I am new to this forum.
Next semester (september 2015) I have to take an internship for half a year.
I live in Holland but I want to do it in another country.

My other goal countries are Argentina and South-Africa.

My issues is I also received another offer from a company that is paying me 48k salary with great benefits and it's a lot closer to me. However, their technology isn't as cutting edge as it's PHP and CMS based and it's a religious non-profit organization which I am a little hesitant to have on my resume. It's important to note that I have virtually no experience with web development in a professional environment so both of these opportunities are amazing.

I am a little torn because the internship I have right now is awesome and they really like me and have been really teaching me a lot, plus I'm learning AngularJS. At the same time, I am a little old for an internship as I've been out of college for 5 years now and need to focus on job stability. My question is, how should I handle this situation? Is this a no-brainer?"

It’s the combinations of these skills that make me believe I would be a great candidate for the position of ________ Internship and a good addition to the __ team.

My role as a Business Manager, Freelancer, and IT technician has given me experiences in what is expected when building a team, and working on projects. I thrive in a project-oriented environment both as a leader and a team member.

In addition to being responsible and flexible, I'm also great at keeping details, researching and presenting a project to a group of people or business. One of my most recent projects, and one I'm incredibly proud of, was developing a Business plan that I created for my family restaurant. As the main manager, I was able to create a business plan that covered Marketing, Sales Strategy, Increasing the business reach and increasing our profit margin. After taking over the family business, I've been able to increase our profits while also dramatically decreasing our cost of goods to an estimated 21%. I believe in applying this same level of business analysis to all of my business and career ventures.

My past experiences in freelancing and in the technical field have taught me how to become a self-sustained, problem solver and solo team member. Through freelancing, I've been able to not only reach my proposed Website design business to individuals, but I’ve also been able to reach local businesses in the Las Cruces area. In addition, as a Computer Technician I have fixed computers that have been deemed as unfixable. 

I appreciate your time and consideration as a candidate for the internship; I look forward to meeting you personally to discuss my suitability for this position.

Note that I should also answer this through email. Btw, this company is the shit, I'll be working from being a technician to an export analyst and I really want this job!

For my employment background:

I've never held a job longer than 9 months, I'm from a poor country, i actually paid to be accepted in an internship. This is job 1.
.
.

Job2: I graduated, company from job 1 didnt want to pay people, so i got job 2. Employer in job 2 pays late (1 month), deducts from salary to pay our income tax (this is the normal thing in my country), turns out my 9 months of working there 6 months tax werent paid. So i noped. And found job 3.
.
.

Job3+Job4(abroad): best job ive had i spent 9 months total, from that 9 months i spent 3 abroad because company wants to have the production up and running on that plant abroad. Essentially the same company, but i am getting paid for job3 and job4. Though, I had to leave because my father offered to give me working visa in the middle east. 
.
.now in middle east

Job5 as treatment engineer: earned 1/4 what i am making from job 3+job4. Took a toll on my health, company gave me a maid's health insurance , so nothing is covered. Delayed salary for 1 month, took only me only 4 months before I quit.

Now, I am past all the labour issues and osha violations, do i email (she asked me through email, have to respond in email) my potential employer about these things? Specially the 5th one. I dont actually want to talk shit about my previous employers."

Both options terrify me.",conflictedthraway222,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/37eh9x/super_long_i_finally_pulled_myself_out_of_a/,"I don't even know what kind of help or advice I need. Career? Psychological? Social? Monetary? Courage? All I know is, it's been bottling up inside for nearly 60 days and I need some help. The biggest problem is - I don't even know how or who to ask. Like, I'd need to give my damn life story. So I apologize for the length! This seems like the only place I can let this out, and it's as short as I could make it.

I'm 24, nearly 25. Until age 21, I felt overwhelmingly anxious, tired, depressed (feels weird and fake to outright say it.).  Really the only emotion I felt was guilt for some reason. It's a long story, and I hate just saying this stuff, but I guess that's the situation, without going into detail. Guilt was why I was still alive, essentially. Eventually I sought help, and turned my life around, especially after realizing that I *did* want something from life. Friendship, and to move out of the Midwest. Which sounds assholish, I know.

There's nothing bad about the Midwest, but I just feel so isolated - not just from the people, but, I dunno, the environment. Once, trying to break my inactiveness, I went to the east coast to visit some internet friends (my only friends are online, only time I ever got close to ""getting"" someone, and vice versa). It was amazing. I finally felt like I had a reason to live, bizarrely enough. Things just kinda clicked, both with all the people, and with the environment. Cities varied, but especially in Newark, I just kind of suddenly didn't need to argue with myself to keep living.

So, it took a while and a lot of hard work, but I overcame issues enough to go to school. Point is: moving to Newark was the carrot at the end of my stick. I got over the self-loathing, worked hard, built myself up enough to be employable - and after a year, I made it! I moved in with my Newark friend, everyone in the social circle was great and was excited. I never had to play tricks on myself to keep going, day after day - I liked life. And I guess I needed physical friends. Plus it was practical from a job standpoint, too - it would be hard to find a web design job there, but it was a hell of a lot better than a farm town. But, three months later, things went sour, job-wise: I was pretty naive about the internship I landed. It was a remote job, and despite the promotions, I barely ever got a cent of what I was promised they weren't legally bound (independent contract made it clear), and I was too dumb to see how clearly I was being played. I ran out of money, and had to move home.

I immediately plunged back into self-loathing and depression. But I still had the motivation - I could just make money again, move back with my roommates, who were happy to wait for me. But time really stretched on. I kept working for 4 months until I was eventually let go for stressing how urgent my financial situation was becoming, and that I needed to get paid. Again, super naive. Also, a long, long story.

Anyway. I'm getting older, and I struck what feels like a once-in-a-lifetime chance. It's a really great 90 day internship that, from my understanding, ""would likely lead to a full-time position."" My thinking was, they figured we'd discuss it then. Not really the case: I was badly needed and have been learning and training for that full-time position since day 1. They treat me well, and I love it, on paper. Best job I ever had, but with my environment and the life situation, I'm still barely getting through day by day.

Newark's really all I got. I love my friends there, but I'm scared that's too big a motivator. And I can't stomach the idea of leaving this job - I'm constantly reminded how my coworkers assume I'm here forever, and how bad they needed a third person in that department. Just today, I was told that part of the decision on why I was hired was because I wasn't from a university, since you can't be sure if the student will stay on, and they badly need another member, the way they're growing. They're always being vocally grateful for the decision they thought I made.

I've no idea what to do. No matter how much introspection I do, I can't come to a conclusion.  I can't get to an emotional or logical angle for either. Both feel like a massive mistake.

Again, sorry for the length."

I'm finishing up my undergrad with next year being my last. I am dual majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I've been a part of a few projects and am now interning at a large company as a QA engineering intern. Originally I wanted software development, but after they told me they no longer had positions open for the software development team I decided to go with this just to get my foot in the door. Regardless, I am loving everyday of it. 

My dilemma is that after this summer I may have the opportunity to apply for their program for graduated students to somewhat test drive a full time role. I would probably apply for software development. But I'm also interested in data science, especially after taking my advanced level econometrics class in which I wrote an entire statistical analysis on income inequality in the U.S. I enjoy collecting data and playing around with it to discover what it can tell us. 

I think my ideal plan would be to get a full time job as a developer and go to school part time and get a degree that would allow me to combine my love for cs, econ, and my curiosity of data science. I know of a few good data science programs, but I'm afraid I may not have the grades for uc berk, cmu, etc. Could anyone recommend some options or paths that I could consider? I was looking at a couple programs (specifically Boston University's MS in Statistical Practice and Northeastern University's MS in Business Analytics). Does anyone have any sort of advice regarding these programs? Whether or not they would put me in the right direction or not? Or even if data science is right for me?

I have been a long time reader of this sub-reddit and first time poster (and a little nervous as this is all very new to me).  As a new CCP believer, I am hoping to get some advice or thoughts on my proposed investment strategy as well as answers to my questions (which I am afraid may be a little on the basic side of things).  I am setting up two investment strategies, one for my money, and a second one for my son's education (he is currently 5 years old). In reality they will both become his so would like them to both do well :)

A little about me, I am 42 and sadly have paid insufficient attention to my personal finances.  This forum has demonstrated to me that it is never too late. I have taken the first step by consolidating all of my various little pots of money into a TD Waterhouse account - pain in the ass but all done now (detailed below). I also have a good job (and one that I enjoy) with a pension that should leave me with approx 100k/yr in my retirement (indexed). I anticipate working for another 15 years before this happens. As such, I believe I can have a rather aggressive investment strategy for this money with a time horizon of 15-20 years before I would ever envision needing to access it. 

Money details: RRSP = 30k,  TFSA = 6k, cash account = 5 k, Resp = 15k. I plan on using the CCP Strategy and investing about 5 k per yr into my TFSA (as I see little point in further contributions to my rrsps). I will also contribute approx 2.5k per yr to my son's Resp (I believe that is about the sweet spot where the government will contribute to his Resp as well). 

1) Strategy One - my finances 
I reviewed the CCPs 'aggressive' investment strategy for TDW and like it, but was thinking it might not be aggressive enough (mistake number one?). Was thinking of the following (remember 15-20 year investment timeline, and I do have a pension):
TD cnd bonds tdb909                 -  5 %. (CCP recommends 10%) 
TD cnd index funds tdb900        - 15 % (CCP recommends 30%)
TD US index funds tdb902**        - 40 % (CCP recommends 30%)
TD intern. Index fund tdb911.      - 40 % (CCP recommends 30%)

Questions
1) am I being too aggressive by lowering the cnd exposure in both funds and bonds? Is this an amateur mistake? Does it unnecessarily skew me towards too much risk? 

2)** I really like the U.S. Index fund (s&amp;p) but there are 3 of them at TDW! The one above with cnd dollars, tdb952 using US dollars, and tbd904 using currency neutral dollars (currency hedging I believe). I am leaning towards either tdb902 or tdb952. Is there any real discernible difference with the timelines I am looking at?  I would do the Norbert gambit to purchase the U.S. Currency if I go down this route. Or is it too much hassle for a lazy CCP'er? I was also wondering  are there any U.S. Tax implications for the U.S. Version (tdb952) - sorry for noob question. 

2) investment strategy for my son's education

Approx 14.5 k now with 2.5k contribution per year. While I believe the kid is bright, he won't be needing this university/college money for at least 13-18 years.  I don't feel as comfortable being as aggressive with his money as I do with mine above, but I am also cognizant that 13-18 years is a long time for it to be sitting and I should take the opportunity to invest it. I was thinking of maybe investing it in a CCP 'balanced' or 'assertive' Strategy, but am very interested in your thoughts. Also, final noob question, if I buy TD cnd bonds (ie., tdb909) it's not like real bonds that have a maturation date and I have to wait years to remove it is it?

Thank you very much readers and posters of reddit, it has been hard for me to get to this point but I am starting to feel like I am taking control of my finances and it is very empowering.

Looking at my options post military (current job in the military has no civilian equivalent). So looking at using my GI bill to go through the OSU 1 year program and then perhaps to a master program.  My only coding experience is codecademy HTML/CSS which I knocked out in afternoon and really enjoyed it.  I understand that it really doesn't mean anything and is less than even scratching the surface.  But I have always been fascinated with the how/why technology works, and problem solving.

I understand that the 1 year OSU program is less than ideal since it doesn't offer a summer internship opportunity so perhaps could do more like the 1.5 program if that matters.  

Providing I can do well in classes, what kind of job opportunities are people seeing? With what associated incomes? I'm interested in gaming but more interested in other tech fields. 

Is the masters even worth it initially or keep the GI bill balance in the bank for a few years to get more experience and try and do it more in an executive masters course instead of doing 3 full years of full time academics?"

I'm a university student(Canada) -&gt; (I think it's the same thing as college in the US). Anyways I'm a first year who switched into Mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science.


So this summer, I decided to take summer classes since I'm in my first year and getting an internship is pretty hard early on. Today is an usual day. Wake up, commute, go to class.


This is where the TIFU happens. I'm in a Computer science class today. I'm pretty sure this happened to others before. The classes are 3hours long and I got bored. So I casually take out my phone to browse reddit and I land on tifu something I haven't read in a while. I read a bunch of tifus and was running out. So I went into the **top from past year**. And I landed on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2mlo1u/tifu_by_outfarting_a_cabbie_on_the_way_to_the/). I was grinning throughout the read because I could relate somewhat to the guy with a exploding bladder where you just can't stop pissing. That 1 time at the movie theaters when the movie ended I rushed out to the bathroom and started doing my business. Since multiple movies ended at the same time and new sessions were about to start, the bathroom was crowded and people were waiting in line. That day, I discovered that I could hold at least 3 times as pee as the others since I stayed at the urinal and peed enough for 3 rotations, I felt bad for the guy waiting in line behind me. 


Anyways, back to the tifu. I was about to swallow (wrong word use) my good old tim horton's coffee while I made the horrible mistake to open [pic!](http://imgur.com/Jss4egJ). You'll understand if you read the other story. 


I have no idea what happened and why. I was so into the story, forgot my surroundings and had no idea what the professor was talking about. I spat out my coffee (fortunately no one was in the front seat) while the professor apparently asked a question and it was dead silent. Silence ensued. It was the most agonizing and awkward 5 seconds of my life. Then my friend yells out lout: *He's browsing a dark corner of internet: reddit*. Everyone bursts out laughing. I guess people in computer science all know about reddit. My professor then asks me what was so funny and asks me to share it with the class (I know he is also a redditor, when he opens a chrome tab, you can see most visited websites tabs as reddit) . I insisted it isn't appropriate content to show to the class, but he insisted to see it. So i walked down the stairs of shame and showed him the story. He might be a avid tifu reader and immediately saw the link to the narrated video. He opened Reddit on his computer and opened the link and we just listened and I just stood there like a frozen stick while we listened to the story of the man who passed out while his dick is hanging out pissing into the air like an angel statue all over himself.


Edit it didnt show what i typed: Everyone had a good laugh, but you know that if you ever experience anything like this.

I just graduated college last week with a double major in Math and CS. The thing is, my dream career is in federal law enforcement/national security - and not necessarily computer systems (but not opposed). More field work, even still leaning towards joining the military soon. 

I was never as passionate as my CS peers here and pursued other extracurriculars rather than hackathons and side projects. I worked, studied abroad, volunteered, never wasted my time but as for programming, I only know the bare minimums to pass my classes with average grades. 

But I never disliked it either. And I don't necessarily want to move to law enforcement right away. Right now I really want to explore the actual software world, and work for about a year before taking time off to travel and possibly volunteer abroad or go into the military. Not to mention I need the money, and I see my friends going right off into $100k+ jobs in Manhattan. 

My problem is: I feel so far behind now. I don't have any personal projects to show, I've had no internships to speak of, and now I don't even know where to begin applying. Everywhere and anywhere? Super low-level stuff? I'm in the NJ/NY area so I can't imagine there's a dearth of options, but I just feel so overwhelmed and like *I don't actually know anything about programming* that I don't even know where to begin, and I don't know what the next step is for me to take. 

If anyone has any advice or a direction to point in, I would greatly appreciate it!"
37fe7a,4,2015-05-27,What should I focus on now to get an internship at one of the Big 4 by the start of next year (Software Engineering Student)?,nightorday,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37fe7a/what_should_i_focus_on_now_to_get_an_internship/,"First off, thank you to everyone who responds to this. I really do need help in deciding what to focus on for the next 6 months or so. 

I'll start off with my experience. I just finished 2nd year of uni (Software Eng.) with a 3.98 GPA. I have pretty much zero personal projects at this time, never really had time for them because of school projects and part-time work.

I've done 3 major school projects (C++, Nodejs/PostgreSQL, MEAN stack). During school semesters, I've worked as a part-time web developer (PHP, MySQL), adding up to almost 2 years now. Last summer, I interned at a small start-up, web development in Grails, Redis, and MongoDB. This summer, I'm at BlackBerry, working mainly with Nodejs.

Now, my situation, and I'm sure many people here face the same situation is to figure out what to focus on. After my 9-5 internship, and on weekends, what can I do to maximize my chances of getting a job at one of the Big 4? Should I start on some personal projects? Should I practise my technical interview skills? What would you folks suggest? I hope this is useful to other students in the same situation."

Feel free to ask questions about details I may have left out.

I am a recent college graduate from a top 20 university. I have a mediocre GPA (~3.17). Some people say that is actually decent for my university, but it is worse when compared to schools that grade inflate. I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. 

I did not have an internship during college or during the summer. I also did not have a research position.

I have applied for what I feel like is a lot of jobs (around probably 100), and I have only heard from three really. Some of these are more applicable to my degree, and some are less. For example, some have been engineering, sales, and consulting. Some(probably 5 now) have emailed me about skype or phone interviews, but then they have not actually called me or responded to emails after setting up a time. 

The first one was a software consulting position. I made it to the final round, but I wasn't hired. The second one turned out to be a multi-level marketing firm that lied on the job posting. The third one is a sales position. It's sales for services to businesses, not sales to people for personal needs (PM if you want more info). I have technically accepted this job, but I am really having second thoughts now. And I don't know what I am doing wrong about searching for jobs since I have had so few responses.

This job is 100% commission(there is no base salary) based which really makes me nervous. I might be fine with doing sales, but I don't know for sure. The estimate that I would make in my first year was around $40k-$60k. I was told that that yearly pay would probably go up each year since there is residual commission.

I am expected to drive on the job as it is sales. However, they don't pay for that at all. They have training a few hours away. For that they would pay for hotel and driving there, but they would not pay for my time. 

Also, the job is in a city that I do not live currently. I am currently staying with my parents while I find a job. Because of this, I do have to sign a lease for an apartment which would potentially be my biggest risk about accepting this job. The other thing is that if I did not do well, I would not get paid much if at all... 

As far as end career goals, I believe that I want to further my education with a Ph.D. or M.B.A., but I do not know for sure. Part of the benefits of doing this is that I would use this as a gap year if I did make that decision (I have not applied to any grad programs). A job in a lab would definitely be better for applying to grad schools in a year, but I haven't really thought too much about getting a job in a research organization yet. 

I want to be able to do something requiring more complex thought and doing something more analytical. I honestly do not want to be in sales for the rest of my life. Whether that is analyzing companies' decisions through consulting, performing scientific experiments, analyzing biomedical data, or something else along those lines, I have not decided what I really want to do. 

I feel like I accepted the job because it was a job. But at the time, I was extremely excited about the opportunity, but I have grown much more skeptical as time has passed.

I am still searching for other jobs that would be closer to where I want to be in the future, but I do not really know if I will get one before I would start (I would go to training within a month). I am also looking into applying for grad schools soon and seeing what I should do to prepare for that. 

I don't really know what my all of my questions are, but I wanted to type that all out. What would others in my situation do? Is it wrong to decline a job offer after accepting it if I get a job that I would prefer? Is it wrong to just decline a job offer after accepting it just because I hastily accepted it and I later thought about it and decided that it was the wrong thing?"

As I said in the title, I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering major with absolutely no experience. I typically enjoy the classes that I take, but I don't have a clue how I can use the skills I've learned in real life - everything just seems like concepts thrown around to give us general knowledge on a lot of things.
I'm actually doing really well - I have a 3.9 GPA - but it seems like school is the only thing that I'm actually good at. I have no motivation to start any projects on my own time (and, to be honest, I wouldn't even know where to start if I did), and after reading 
all of the stuff that's been said on this sub, I feel like it's going to be impossible to find a job without that. On that note, I don't even know where I would want to work (or what I would want to be doing). As the school year comes
to an end, my parents are pushing me to find a job/internship over the summer so I can have some experience (and, well, they've pretty much given up on me finding anything related to my field, and just want me to work in retail or something).
I figure it's far too late to try and find an internship now, so I really have no idea what to do. At this point it feels like I'm going to end up graduating, working at Wal-Mart, and finding some way to slowly kill myself.


Okay, maybe that was a bit melodramatic, but now that I'm a year away from finishing up college, everything is getting so real. It seems like I'm so far behind and I have no idea how to catch up. Sorry for ranting, I just feel so lost right now.


I don't know, maybe this post isn't really appropriate here, but I'd appreciate any advice. Extra info that may or may not be relevant: I've taken several classes on C++ (including data structures), worked a decent bit with Linux (especially in an operating systems class),
took a class with LabVIEW (though that was a while ago), worked on assembly language (LC-3) in one class, and am currently taking a robotics class using Arduino. Oh, and I've taken a few classes with coding in Verilog (one of them using a Spartan-3 FPGA board)."
37fvnc,1,2015-05-27,"Am I behind, certificates, jobs, and support?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37fvnc/am_i_behind_certificates_jobs_and_support/,"In the winter I'll have graduated with an associates degree.
As of now the only programming classes in my major have been a C class, an html5 class, and a java class I am taking this semester along with database management. 
Next semester I'm taking advanced java, scripting languages, and will be doing a for credit internship. 
I'm taking five classes this summer semester and the java class and the computer maintenance class I have to take both allow me to take a test at the end where I can get a certificate. 
Then there's also a technical certificate I can qualify for just by doing my major it seems? I'm a bit confused by this all and will talk to my college counselor about it, but I was curious on how certificates are actually seen and if they are things I should try to achieve. 

I've dabbled in C for that class and I am just stepping into Java. I feel like everything is so soon and the two years after the associates are very important because thats when you specialize and when I would learn basically everything I need to know. However, the money I had to go to school with is running low and I think I can only make it until this winter until I get a job and can afford to go back to college for my Bachelors. This is really scary for me because I feel like I wont be able to stand on any leg at a company with how inexperienced and unknowledgeable I am compared to everyone else. Would people hire me with such little experience? Am I behind where I am and so I shouldn't be expected to get a job at this time or should I have done more myself? 

I would only need a job that paid about 22k a year to go to school and take care of myself, although I would have to save to be able to handle a job and go to college unless it was part time.

I've tried to teach myself and had no idea about anything I was reading until I learned a bit in college to help me be able to learn on my own. I'm ahead in my Java class because I really do want to learn and am passionate about it, but I just always had trouble with guidance. There's no one giant book I can read that will answer all of my questions and teach me what I need to know. (If there is please direct me to it)  I haven't really been able to find a place online for support besides IRC's where people tend to mock the way I choose to practice. Besides doing the interest rate problems that the school has given me, I take time to find out how to do small game dev stuff. I do not want to do it as a career nor does it really impact anything. It was just the only thing that piqued my interest that I could think of to do on my own for practice. Is there a better way to practice other than the basic bank math in the books? That is the way these teachers are teaching. Sending us home with a book to copy the examples. Although I am learning, I need more. I'm 21 and would like to find others who are learning and maybe work on small projects with them to get better or even if there are other ways I could practice I am all ears! 

I wrote a lot, if anyone needs anything expanded on just ask! I am very grateful for anyone who reads this I know it's a lot, but I'm just pretty scared and hope that someone can shine a light on a few things for me.

37h42w,24,2015-05-27,"I have a terrible problem with buying material things I do not need, I think I know the underlying causes, what's next?",[deleted],selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/37h42w/i_have_a_terrible_problem_with_buying_material/,"Hello,

It has been hard for me to come to grips but I have finally accepted I have a spending problem. Fortunately, it is not too severe to the point where I am in thousands of dollars of consumer debt, but it is affecting my ability to save money. 

Background: I am 23 years old, male, live on my own and have a steady job. I have a very significant amount of student loans, but I have never had a problem paying my rent, loan payments, and food (all what I consider to be my fixed expenses). In addition to my job, I do some freelance work to earn extra money. But all of this money goes to my credit card payments (which are always on time). Sometimes I have to do so much freelance work to satisfy my shopping habits that it is affecting my day job.

My problem began as far back as I can remember having an income stream (junior year of college when I started a part time paid internship), I could never **save money**. I always had to buy something new; a pair of shoes, a kitchen appliance, new bed sheets - *things I did not and do no need*. 

Interestingly, the only things I seem to waste my money on are material possessions - mostly through online shopping (amazon) or buying new clothes at stores. An example is last night I bought a decorative airtight canister to store my coffee grounds in. I paid 10 dollars for it as well as an additional 5 dollars for shipping. Now, I see what a stupid decision that was, but at the time I felt a strong need to have it, and justified that it would keep my coffee fresher for longer. I know this all sounds stupid and whiney - but the amount of money I spend really adds up.

___________________________________


I have been thinking long and hard about this, and I have identified some potential reasons for my problem:

* **Anxiety** - I am stressed out a lot, mostly due to thinking of how I will pay off my credit card and my freelance work. The ironic thing is that once I make enough money to payoff my card, I justify another spending splurge. It's a never-ending cycle. I guess buying things gives me temporary relief from my stress.
* **Trying to impress others** - I hate to admit it, but I believe the reason I want nice, new clothes is to impress my friends and other people.
* **Jealousy** - as mentioned, I have significant student debt. Most of my friends had their college paid for by their parents and come from wealthier backgrounds. Perhaps my jealousy of them makes me want to impress them with that new shirt, watch, or gadget I bought.
* **Depression?** - I think all of this contributes to me just not being happy. I feel stressed, anxious, jealous, so I buy things for temporary relief. Then I realize I have to play fast catch up to pay for it all, so I work very hard and again feel stressed and anxious. It is a vicious cycle.

________________________________

Some of you may ask or comment that if I am paying all of my fixed expenses on time, and not carrying a credit card balance, why is this a problem? 

1) As said, I am struggling to create a long term savings

2) My freelance work (which is used to buy these things) is becoming a burden on my day job

______________________________________

I have found a couple of remedies that help, but do not cure the problem:

* I opened a separate savings account, with no debit card. A portion of my day-job paychecks go to this account. The problem with this is that sometimes I do have to pull from my savings, making the past two months of saving useless
* Smoking weed. (*edit: I very rarely do this, i am not addicted in any way. i have smoked since high school and do not find it fun or a hobby, just a refreshing break from things once in a while*) This has helped me take my mind off everything and enjoy a movie or something. During these instances I do not *care* about ""what to buy next"". The problem with this remedy is that I lose motivation and clarity to be productive.

____________________________________

I don't blame you for rolling your eyes and blowing this off, but this is a problem I want to control and change. I do not know how - and I would prefer to try everything at my disposal before seeing a therapist. If anyone has advice, I would appreciate it."

As of now I think I am able to get a discount on HP laptops through my internship, so im going with HP for cost reasons. I am heading to school in the Fall and want something that will be good for schoolwork, but I also want to be able to play some games (mainly league). I've been looking at the HP Envy 15t. The stock version of this laptop comes with 4th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4720HQ Quad Core Processor + Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600. Wanting to run games close to high or on high settings (mainly league) I was wondering if it was worth 140$ to upgrade to 5th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5500U Dual Core Processor + NVIDIA GeForce GTX 850M 4GB Discrete Graphics instead of the stock processor. With the 140$ upgrade im looking at 750$ or so without discount. Is this worthwhile or should I keep looking?

What I currently have is a simple webpage made using ASP.NET in visual studio. My general task is to access a database, get the info from the database, turn the data into JSON, and send that data to a python script which will then parse the JSON and do stuff with it, etc.

I am able to get as far as making the JSON object. I can get the user to download the json object as a file, but what I really want to do is just pass it through the network by accessing my web site from the python script using urllib2. This is where I have become completely lost. There are so many terms I've never heard of before, things like services, web APIs, controllers, routing and all these things I've spent hours digging around in and following basic tutorials but still cannot find a firm grasp on the concepts let alone how to accomplish it in a practical manner.

To be completely clear here are my goals:

1) Send 5 parameters using urllib2 in python to my asp.net site

2) use these parameters to query the database and get a json object (COMPLETE)

3) return the json to the python script

37jvf5,1,2015-05-27,Hi CS Career Questions! I'm a recent college grad and I would like to share my story and experience,tismythrowaway21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37jvf5/hi_cs_career_questions_im_a_recent_college_grad/,"Hi Reddit. I'm graduating from UCI in two weeks, and I would like to share my experience in hopes of encouraging other hopeful computer science prospects and those who are worried about software development jobs in general.

2 years ago, I started UCI having transferred from community college. Having only 1 year experience of programming (Java to be specific) under my belt, I was nervous and felt out of place. I signed up for one of the early hack-a-thons in the year, but was severely discouraged when I realized I was little help on the development side. However, I knew that I wanted to leave school the best programmer I could. I spent my entire Junior year taking curriculum classes; Data Structures, C\C++ courses, **AS WELL AS** software development courses. I emphasize the softare development courses because I believe these ones were the most applicable to my education. During the end of the Spring quarter, I attended my school's Career Fair, and ended up receiving a callback from a small startup company regarding a QA intern position.

Here's where the fun starts.

I BLEW THE FIRST ROUND INTERVIEW. However, I was called back for the second round interview (to this day, I'm not sure how). During the second interview, I maintained my lack of confidence in my computer programming knowledge behind my extrovert personality, constantly chatting away with interviewer to come across as someone they could work with. And I was offered the job.

During the summer and throughout my senior year, I worked as a QA engineer intern at this startup, sitting in on development meetings, learning the company's product in and out, learning extensive testing methods, and becoming familiar with how software development works on a real-life software product (as compared to school projects). All the while, finishing up my senior year classes; Operating Systems, Compilers, Databases, Networks, etc....

I finally mustered up the courage and pushed my company to interview me for their Associate Software Engineering position, and was offered the job title of my dreams, utilizing the language I wanted to be working with (C\C++).

So, here are my best advice tips for prospective students, or others who claim to experience the ""Impostor Syndrome"" on countless occasions:

* Try to score an internship, especially QA work. THIS WILL GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR, and I promise you, will generally build up your knowledge as a software developer/engineer much better than school will

* Pick a field of development (web development, embedded systems, systems engineering, database work....) and learn the languages surrounding it. Do I know Javascript, PHP, HTML, Ruby, Python, or any of the fad languages? No. I was generally not interested in web programming. I was more interested in (I'll tread lightly here....) lower-level programming languages like C\C++\Java because I enjoyed that style of programming more.

* Be your-personable-self. For real. No one wants to work with a stuck in the mud, or a jerk, or a slacker. It is not hard to train someone (who knows the fundamentals) to code at a company. It is, however, almost impossible to train someone to be personable and to be a good co-worker

* Don't sweat the small things. Really. Someone once wrote on this subreddit, ""People are never amazed when someone who is amazing at guitar says they've been playing for 20 years. But you know, the same goes with programming. No one is going to be a master programmer in 3/4 years. There are exceptions, but you cannot live your life comparing yourself to these exceptions...Give it time.""

To wrap it up, here are my statistics as I end school:

**TOTAL TIME SPENT @ COLLEGE** - 5 years

**GPA ON EXIT** - 3.01 (woo)

**SALARY** - $62,000 (living in socal)

**JOB TITLE** - Associate Software Engineer

**LOANS** - $20,000
I hope I have encouraged even one of you to keep on keeping on. Feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to answer. Thanks for reading. "
37jwvu,13,2015-05-28,I did a job interview for a software internship today. Definitely not as confident going out as I was coming in,Velovix,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/37jwvu/i_did_a_job_interview_for_a_software_internship/,"So I did a second interview for an internship position today. The first one was online and went great, but this one was in person. Most of it was comprised of an employee telling me their process there (code reviews, version control, etc) which went fine. All I needed to do was listen to him and it was very interesting.

Then he gave me some tests on subjects I claimed to be familiar with, and that's where things kind of went downhill. I didn't know most of the terminology being used, and so while I tended to be familiar with the concepts when I was told what a term means, I was mostly in the dark beforehand.

Specifically on a Java test, I'd never done any concurrent Java work, so I was unfamiliar with the synchronized keyword, so I had to ask about it. I admitted up front that, as he could probably tell, I had not worked with this corner of Java before. In response, he said that he thinks I hadn't done much Java work at all. That kind of stung.

I catch myself feeling like a coding hotshot sometimes, which is really silly of me and goes to show that I know so little, I don't know what I don't know. As someone who just finished their freshman year in college, I really am in no position to feel learned. I love programming and really enjoy learning about it, but I think I bit off a lot more than I could chew here and I obviously had not learned as much as I thought. Reality checks are tough!

Anybody else had disheartening experiences like this?"

My car won't he fixed in the next few weeks because the company has a 'queue' they go by. Honestly, it's bullshit because they didn't even fix the issue and it cost me a grand to get these non-repairs.

In the winter I'll have graduated with an **associates degree**. As of now the only programming classes in my major have been **a C class, an html5 class, and a java class I am taking this semester along with database management. Next semester I'm taking advanced java, scripting languages, and will be doing a for credit internship.** I'm taking five classes this summer semester and the java class and the computer maintenance class I have to take both allow me to take a test at the end where I can get a certificate. 
I've dabbled in C for that class and I am just stepping into Java. I feel like everything is so soon and the two years after the associates are very important because thats when you specialize and when I would learn basically everything I need to know. However, **the money I had to go to school with is running low and I think I can only make it until this winter until I get a job and can afford to go back to college for my Bachelors.** This is really scary for me because I feel like I wont be able to stand on any leg at a company with how inexperienced and unknowledgeable I am compared to everyone else. **Would people hire me with such little experience? Am I behind where I am and so I shouldn't be expected to get a job at this time or should I have done more myself?**

I would only need a job that paid about 22k a year to go to school and take care of myself, although I would have to save to be able to handle a job and go to college unless it was part time.

I've tried to teach myself and had no idea about anything I was reading until I learned a bit in college to help me be able to learn on my own. I'm ahead in my Java class because I really do want to learn and am passionate about it, but I just always had trouble with guidance. There's no one giant book I can read that will answer all of my questions and teach me what I need to know. (If there is please direct me to it) I haven't really been able to find a place online for support besides IRC's where people tend to mock the way I choose to practice. Besides doing the interest rate problems that the school has given me, I take time to find out how to do small game dev stuff. I do not want to do it as a career nor does it really impact anything. It was just the only thing that piqued my interest that I could think of to do on my own for practice. **Is there a better way to practice other than the basic bank math in the books?** That is the way these teachers are teaching. Sending us home with a book to copy the examples. Although I am learning, I need more. **I'm 21 and would like to find others who are learning and maybe work on small projects with them to get better or even if there are other ways I could practice I am all ears! Also what kind of projects should I make for my portfolio? I have no idea what to make that would be impressive**
I wrote a lot, if anyone needs anything expanded on just ask! I am very grateful for anyone who reads this I know it's a lot, but I'm just pretty scared and hope that someone can shine a light on a few things for me.

**edit: are there any places that like to mold their employees in a specific way anymore? can i truly intern somewhere where they teach me the ropes? or are there any other options for me?** "
37ldt9,4,2015-05-28,"3 years in the real world, thinking of pivoting back to software development, need some advice",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37ldt9/3_years_in_the_real_world_thinking_of_pivoting/,"Hi, I'll try to keep this short but I'll probably fail, anyway, here I go:


So, apparently it's been 3 years since I graduated from a top state school with a software engineering degree. I made a few key mistakes: I did not do an internship, and I decided not to take the OOP/design patters class. When I was interviewing during my senior year, not taking that class really bit me in the ass. This threw me into a bit of a panic, and I pretty much stopped applying because I couldn't handle technical interviews. (I'm not one of those people that graduated but can't code, I swear!) 


Tldr on my job history: 1st job data, reporting, process improvement, programming used as an additional tool. 2nd job, mostly database development. Very small amounts of actual software development. If you want more detail look here: http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/33lbvn/for_hire_relocate_anywhere_databusiness_analyst/


So going forward, I see two options: 1, I could try and stay the course with the data type stuff I was doing. Main problem is I have zero statistics background, and I don't really know if I would like to get into that type of analytics. Finding jobs that match my criteria has been very difficult. (I found one at Google, was a perfect fit, I actually made it to on site but I guess I flubbed it. Sigh.) I'm also not the best speaker (unless I'm either extremely comfortable with the topic or the people, and even them I can be a bit shaky. Doesn't help much with interviews, either) so that knocks off most of the more business analysty type roles. I also expect the salary cap to be somewhat low. 


Or 2, what I'm currently exploring; pivot back to full on software development. 


My main concerns, and what I would like to get advice on:


I've been out in the real world for 3 years, and I don't really have much to show for it. My work has been somewhat relevant, thankfully, but I don't think it's enough. I would actually compare most of my professional programming to coding personal projects. 


I don't feel confident or qualified enough for mid level roles, and I feel at a huge disadvantage on junior roles. I really don't want to take a pay cut, either. (making 60k in a mid sized city.)


And that's not even taking the technical interviews into account. I've done a few so far in the past few months, and what usually happens is that they ask me some concept questions, and I know the answer, except that I don't know that I know it. Working by myself for three years I touch on a lot, and know a decent amount, but not necessarily the terms and stuff. I suck at memorizing facts. Every time I would go back to Google a question, I would just facepalm and go ""oh, THAT'S what he was referring to."" (At least this stuff I can work on and improve with relative ease.)


So I guess I'm just looking for some general advice,
or motivation, or anything that could help. 

My current plan is to throw some of my ruby scripts on my empty github, and then come up with a few things I want to do (probably c#) and throw those up on there as well. I'm contemplating taking one of those data structure courses on corsera or similar, to help brush up on terminology. I'll also probably pick up ctci (or maybe just use one of those coding challenge sites) just to help exercise my mind a bit on random problem solving. 


Thoughts? Suggestions? Am I a lost cause? My plan is a bit overwhelming, and finding the time to do it all is going to be a challenge in of itself."

* Parents have $6000 in a SunLife mutual fund I can take whenever I want.

* Own a car ('06 Honda Civic. Plan to drive it till it dies).

* Started a 4 month (paid) internship.

* Banking through President's Choice Financial (Chequing account and 2 High Interest Savings Accounts).

* No 'real' investments.

**Plan**

* Open Peoples Trust HISA TFSA. Use TFSA to hold short term goal investments and emergency fund.

* Open Tangerine investment fund (Also under TFSA? Can I have 2 TFSA's as long as I don't over contribute?) for mid and long term investments.

* Read *Wealthy Barber Returns* and *Millionaire Teacher*.

* Follow Canadian Couch Potato guide for Tangerine investments.

* Maybe take ownership of the SunLife fund? I don't know much about it, but I think when I started school 3 years ago it was valued at about $3k. From what I know this was largely just the principal my parents put into it. I don't trust it much, and feel like I should take it now while it is worth more than they put in. 

* Graduate spring 2017

* Start putting money into an RRSP when I get into higher tax brackets.

**Goals**

* [Short Term] Trip to Europe in Summer 2016 or 2017

* [Mid Term] Probably a new (to me) car in 7-10 years?

* [Mid Term] Probably wedding and a house in 10-15?

* [Long term] Early-ish retirement / semi-retirement maybe? 25-35 years.

**Other Questions**

* How easy would it be to keep all of my money (up to my contribution limit) in the PT HISA TFSA and transfer money to my PCF to pay bills? Since I won't be near my limit for some time, I feel like it makes sense to put as much of it here because of its high interest rate. Is there a downside to this? It is a short term plan for the 2015 and 2016 calendar years, since while I'm in school I won't be putting in more than my contribution limit. 

I *feel* like this is the best possible plan for someone in my situation, but I'm sure there are a few glaring holes I've missed!

37m6jb,41,2015-05-28,Unemployed for nearly 6 years. Need some advice.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37m6jb/unemployed_for_nearly_6_years_need_some_advice/,"Out of college I worked at one of the big 4 companies. I got in by being an intern there. But I quit after a few years. Its been almost 6 years since then. To explain I was depressed over a friend's death and did something stupid like quitting my job. And then doing nothing for years being depressed living with my parents. They've been very understanding. And now I've just now gotten over the depression.

I have high gpas in both cs from a university known for a top notch CS department and I live in Seattle. I've programmed in C++ and Java, but outside of that I don't have any specialist skills. The job I did for a few years at the big tech company was rather mundane and I don't feel like I grew substantially in skill.

I've been practicing programming but from what little interviewing I've done so far and I've read it seems like interviews have become very brutal difficult compared to 5 years ago or at least the expectation or bar is much higher. This being the case despite the so called talent shortage in Seattle. I already failed to get back into the company I worked for.

And moreover, for other companies I've been having a hard time getting even to a onsite interview. Some companies I've applied the recruiter tell me they will get back to me and then I get filtered out without a phone screen. I'm guessing the engineering hiring manager gets my resume from the recruiter and then filters me. Others see my employment at one of the Big 4 tech companies and even though I've been unemployed since then they don't immediately filter me out but after the phone screen I get filtered out. My guess is that in this case the engineering hiring manager doesn't see my resume until after the phone screen and so only then filters me out or the engineer doing the phone screen filters me out anyway even if I do fine on the phone screen. To the recruiters I explain that I left the company I worked for for personal reasons. And then make up how I did some volunteering for good social causes and I'm looking for meaning in my life in software engineering now.

I've been thinking of maybe applying to small startups and just straight out tell them that I'm recovering from depression over the death of a friend with the hope that maybe the small startups will be more sympathetic to depression and willing to give me a chance. I honestly don't know how big companies would react to hearing that I've been depressed. I've just been assuming that they would instantly filter me out.

I've already failed at getting into the top well known tech companies. I need advice on what I should do. Again it feels like interviews have gotten brutally difficult with ridiculous expectations even despite the so called talent shortage. I don't know what to do.

Ideally I thought that contract-to-hire would be great if I could get it since it is probably the case that no big tech company would take a risk on hiring full-time someone who hasn't been employed for nearly 6 years. Contracting with conversion possibility would give me a chance to prove myself. But alas it seems that no big tech company does contact-to-hire.

So I'm here asking for advice on what to do. Will I even be able to get a contract job let alone a contract-to-hire job. How will I get back a full-time position. Again I live in Seattle. What are my options realistically? I keep reading about the talent shortage. But it feels like no one is willing to put up with the ramp up time of me relearning a whole bunch and then learning everything that is new in the last 5 years. Tech changes fast and I don't have any experience with the typical open source databases and technologies that are in fashion now as the project I worked on at  the big tech company didn't involve any such things. I've been thinking about applying to small startups in the Seattle area. But honestly I don't even know anything about where is start looking. I should be applying to tier 2 and tier 3 companies. But I don't even know what counts as those. I am not deeply familiar with the tech space in Seattle. I am really in a clueless situation and I don't know what to do now so I am turning to all of you on reddit here for help if you are familiar with the Seattle tech scene and have any contacts or know what I can do."
37m9kn,1,2015-05-28,I purposely left a previous job off my resume am I screwed?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/37m9kn/i_purposely_left_a_previous_job_off_my_resume_am/,"To give some background on how I ended up in this situation. 

I worked at company A for a few years including internships and full time work. Left to go to company B for a change. I wanted to try and grow my skills. Company B was not what I expected. Company B let me down on the expectations I had for it. The company lost a lot of business and downsized. I lost my job and Company A was willing to take me back. 

It sounds like a happy ending, but there is a catch. Company A is relocating and I have no interest in moving. Company A is aware of this. 

I was told by a co-worker to just not mention Company B on my resume. I avoided adding it because I did not gain anything from Company be and was there for only 6 months. 

Now I have been contacted by Company C for a potential interview. During my conversation with Company C, I was telling them about myself and Company B was never mentioned.

What will happen if a reference mentions Company B, or the find out about company B somehow? I have nothing to hide. It doesn't seem relevant to the job I'm applying for. I was just a title at Company B. Should I mention Company B to Company C before they find out another way?"

My first day of work was yesterday - in which I spent all day trying to set up my machine and getting connected to the network and all that. In between that I spent most of my time getting caught up by talking to my mentor about our project and what my role(s) would be.

After we finished talking and he asked if I had any questions, I honestly laughed.  I'm so confused about everything that's going on with the project and I've spent the last two days doing nothing but twiddling my proverbial thumbs and trying to look busy (because I can't do any actual work until I'm granted permissions, which I understand is going to take about a week)

Along with this feeling of confusion, I'm also feeling a bit bad about not actually doing any work - I come from a background of retail jobs prior to this where you're literally given things to do every second of every day, and then I switch to a tech internship and I just come in, talk with my mentor, sit at my desk, and look pretty - I just feel like I'm supposed to be doing *something* but on the other hand, I can't do anything.  

I know you all get this question a lot but I'm just wondering if there's any point in your career where this feeling goes away? I can't imagine having to go through this internal struggle every time I start a new job..."

No big names recruit at my school(even though for instance, google Irvine is a 30 minute drive from our campus), and I worry that big name companies, given the choice will always high the Cal Poly or the USC grad over the CSU graduate. I know that with really good job experience on my resume it wouldn't be too difficult to get their attention, but like I said only small companies recruit at my school. I really want to work for a big name tech company one day, and I'm working nonstop to hone my skills, I'm just worried that my college name may make it harder to get hired by reputable companies.

I've got some app development, good general CS knowledge, and know a couple of programming languages well. I've just completed a year out working in an amazing investment bank in a front office role where i developed my own frameworks, my own processes, wrote my own tests, even re-wrote entire legacy systems to be more solid etc. With all my own code running in live for the bank every day and no issues since, my code is pretty solid. 

For some reason it has really really really put me down. I though i had pretty good experiences for an undergrad, but it turns out i don't. I've really wanted to work for Google, to be fair probably more than any of its applicants. I've followed android since just when google acquired the firm and then heavily followed Google and all their ventures/products since. They wanted someone who had knowledge in another mobile environment, which i dont have. 

Its hard for one person to have done literally everything. I'm pretty sure if i didn't use my year out to work in a bank i would have had all the skills they wanted. Have a wasted my year out and subsequently wasted my only opportunity? It feels like I have.

37nihw,88,2015-05-28,How I leveraged multiple offers to increase my salary 50%+,cs_throwaway_8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/37nihw/how_i_leveraged_multiple_offers_to_increase_my/,"I've been a regular here for over a year now, but I'm posting on a throwaway because I have too much identifying information on my main account.  This post is specific to internships, but a lot of the tips apply to ""proper"" jobs as well...
  
I've been working at Company A on a 12-month placement (July 2014 - July 2015) before my final year of university, and I received a placement-extension offer (July - September) in April.  I asked for a raise with the extension, but it was denied.  When the raise was denied, I interviewed at 3 places for summer internships, and ended up with an offer from a company that I liked at 25% more than my current salary.  I then went back to Company A and said I'd really like to stay, but have a good offer from Company B.  They asked me how much I'd want in order to stay and I gave them a number 75% above my current salary.  They came back with 50% above my current salary, and I asked for a 55% increase and some miscellaneous benefits (£250 contract extension bonus, extra holidays, and 1-day/wk remote work).  I ended up with 55% more than my current salary and all the benefits I asked for.  
  
So all of this sounds pretty straight forward, right?  Well it is, but there are a few things that I did and some others things that I got lucky with that made the process a lot smoother, and ultimately better for me:   
   
1. I had a few days to think about how much I wanted to ask for from Company A.  In the end, I asked for an amount significantly higher than what I would have accepted.  I actually expected for my boss to just laugh at me when I told him how much I wanted.  As such, I expected him to come back with something lower, and spent some time working out what benefits would make the deal sweeter for me.  The point here is that I went into each negotiation completely prepared.  Don't go and ask for a raise without having a number in mind.  Know how much you'll walk away from, and have an idea of some extra benefits that could sweeten the deal for you if they come back with a number under what you asked for (higher pension match, a month of unpaid leave, remote work, etc.).
2. I got a bit lucky with people leaving Company A throughout my time here, and ended up with a lot of responsibility (live deployments, architecting systems, interviewing, etc.).  I was unintentionally in a position where it would have been difficult to replace me.  Don't get me wrong, the company wouldn't have been screwed if I left, but they wouldn't have been comfortable either.
3. I had the backing of all of my coworkers.  ""How was your weekend"", ""How was that thing you said you were going to?"", etc. goes a LONG way to keeping you in good standing with your colleagues.  You don't have to kiss people's asses', but just generally make an effort to be nice.  When your coworker is stressed out over some code, ask them if they wanna go on a coffee break and let them vent.  If someone comes in and is tired because their kid was up all night sick, offer pick up some of their work.  If you're doing a code review, don't be a fucking dick about it - offer suggestions, not harsh critiques.  
4. I can't stress enough how important networking is.  I didn't go out of my way to make connections, but I also didn't let any opportunities that arose pass by.  I had references from people I used to work with, which ultimately got me the offer at Company B after only a 30-minute phone interview and 60-minute face-to-face chat.  The reference was from a guy in one of my old teams that I used to eat lunch with every day.  I also play cricket with a dozen or so coworkers which helped me meet people in other departments.  I'm also in a group that goes on nights out every two or three weeks, and one girl in the group works in HR.  I was drunkenly discussing how much I should ask for when I graduate, which helped me settle on a number a few months later during the raise situation.  She basically said, ""We actually really struggle to hire for your position.  You could probably get double your internship salary if you pushed for it.""  I wouldn't have known that if she hadn't told me.  I would've settled for 150% of my placement salary before she told me that.
5. I genuinely care about our products and want them to succeed.  I'm not some super-suck-up company man, but I think what we make is really cool.  I'll bitch about shit my company does all day long, but the stuff my team works on is our baby.
6. I've picked up a thorough understanding of Company A's architecture, processes, and communication channels.  80% of our systems are really simple, but the remaining 20% have some complicated shit that just makes sense to me now.  That's not because I'm some super smart guy, but because I've bashed my head against the wall for weeks trying to figure it out.  Company A could replace me with someone that has years of experience, but their lack of domain knowledge means they'll be slower than me for the first month or two.
7. I applied for summer internships at places I had direct experience with.  This is a double-edged sword, because the point of an internship is generally to gain experience, not to make lots of money.  I got lucky in that I like what I'm currently doing and want to continue doing it after I graduate.  I got an offer from Company C that I declined because the start date was too soon and they couldn't move it, and declined an onsite with Company D because I didn't like the culture of the company from the phone interview.  I'm not at all a fan of spamming out applications everywhere.  I only applied to places that I could give answers to, ""Why do you want to work here?"" and, ""How can you help us?"" without bullshitting them.  
8. I got pretty decent at interviews by giving real interviews in my current job, being a mock interviewer and mock interview candidate with people from here, and reading up on lots of tips from this subreddit.  Take the time to do a few mock interviews, and practice being both the interviewee and interviewer.  Being the interviewer showed me how much they really try to help candidates.  Interviewers want you to do well!  
9. I was totally willing to fail.  I've been saving 30% of my take-home pay during my placement, so I've got more than enough to last me the summer.  Not having to worry about Company A getting rid of me for looking elsewhere, or whether Companies B, C, or D didn't give me offers, helped loads subconsciously.  Even if they all said no, I'd still have gained lots of valuable interviewing experience.  If I came across as needy to any of the companies, I don't think I would have been successful.
  
I suppose I'll leave it at that for now.  I'm off to bed, so if you have any questions, I'll answer them tomorrow, although I'm sure lots of other people (probably with more experience) will be willing to help you out sooner :-).  Don't be shy, it's a great community here!  
  
Edit: I started at £14,000-£17500 and am now at £22,000-£27,000."

Upon being hired by the company (which works with a variety of technologies) and getting assigned to the mobile team, I was upfront with my manager about not knowing Android beyond tinkering around with a basic ""Hello World"" app. He said that was no problem, and they only expected that I was eager to learn, could do something like Fizz Buzz, and was familiar with the concepts of data structures and objected oriented programming (I was).

When I came in to begin my internship this week, the manager had a list of improvements they wanted to make to the Android application and told me I could have my pick of what I wanted to do. I asked the two-man team how they picked up Android development themselves, hoping for tips on where to begin, and they just said that they just kind of figured it out as they went along.

I'm not really the ""figure it out as I go along"" type, and prefer to learn with a bit of structure and learn good habits and an understanding of what I'm doing first, rather than just trying to insert lines and hope they do what I'm intending. I have the Android Programming Big Nerd Ranch guide from the library and think it would greatly enhance my understanding to work through it a few hours a day. Would it be improper to study it and its tutorials at work? Should I work on it at home after work, or is that just a recipe for burning myself out (I really love the outdoors and don't feel like sitting at the computer after doing it all day)? Or how else could I optimally learn this unfamiliar platform while at work?

The manager also appears very nice and chill, so I'm open to communicating with him to ask what he expects, but I also want to be careful about the right way to approach it."

37p721,237,2015-05-29,"TIFU by responding to a fuck offer with ""That'd be good, yeah""",tossthisbitchout,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/37p721/tifu_by_responding_to_a_fuck_offer_with_thatd_be/,"This fuck up transpired in December, right before my school let out for winter break, but my dickhead friends are just now starting to make me realize how badly I fucked up. 

So I had been chatting up this girl I worked with for about a month or so. Things were going well, we got off at the same time after work, and would typically sit and eat dinner afterwards, and she had been over to my place a couple times to cuddle and watch movies. 

As you may have guessed by now, I'm not exactly a fast operator, lets-go-back-to-my-place kind of guy when it comes to the ladies. I liked this girl a lot, and I didn't want to fuck up by being too direct or forward, which is why I was so surprised when she was both direct and forward. 

So there I was texting her on the night before I was to fly back home for winter break, and it seems like a typical conversation for us. Then, out of the clear blue sky, she sends a text inquiring, ""Do u want to fuck?"". 

Now, keep in mind that the texts we had been sending to each other would look like pure lunacy to any normal human. I would say that i was hanging out with my roommates, and she would ask if we were all having a circle jerk together, and i would respond that she was just jealous because all she has for company is her roommate's dildo. The best way to describe those conversations would be a series of affectionate and graphic insults.
 
So when she said ""Do u want to fuck"", I stared at my phone for a full five minutes, waiting for the punchline. I mean, i hadnt even kissed this girl yet, it seemed like a pretty gigantic leap from being cuddle buddies to offering sex over text. 

Well, no punchline came. And so, I responded with the brilliant line that conveyed my willingness while not making me sound overly eager: ""That'd be good, yeah"". SEND. Five minutes pass. BUZZ. Her response reads, ""Are u serious?"". ""Well shit, were you?"" ""Idk"". Now reddit, there are two versions of what might have happened here. 

One: the version that i have been going with in my mind. The rest of the conversation involved me telling her that i was surprised at her directness, but that i definitely liked her a lot and believed the feeling was mutual. Her response was that i was not wrong, but she had just gotten out of a relationship and things were still weird for her and that we should wait and see what happens til after break. She had basically said ""Do u want to fuck"" to gauge my response and see if i was indeed into her. 

Two, the option that my dickhead friends are adamantly arguing for: in a moment of post-breakup weakness, this girl wanted my dick, and told me so. My response was so offensive to her that she immediately was turned off, and said to me ""Are u serious"" to convey her incredulity. As the dickheads put it, ""That'd be good yeah"" is something you say at the drive thru when offered ketchup, or extra napkins, not when offered sex by a girl youve been talking to. So anyway, what does reddit think? Which version is accurate? Just how bad did I fuck up?

TL;DR My crush sends a text asking ""Do u want to fuck?"". I respond with ""Thatd be good, yeah"". We do not fuck.

Edit: Well the general consensus so far appears to be that, yes, I fucked up, but not irreversibly so. I think now would be a good time to inform you guys what has happened since then.

We texted and kept up contact all throughout winter break, but nothing really happened when we returned. At least, not until we saw each other at a bar and ended up dancing and making out. Things got interesting after that. 

A few days before spring break, she comes over to my place, and we start making out on the bed while School of Rock is playing on the computer. I get her top off and start sucking her tits. She's into it. Her hand is making its way up my leg, things are getting hot and heavy. 

Then the phone rings, it is a call I can't ignore about an internship I have lined up. She leaves as I'm talking, saying she has to go pack. I figure it's all good, we made progress, things will pick up after break.

Well, reddit, long story short, she got back with her ex after break, and that was the furthest I ever got. BUT. They have since broken up again so...eh???

Hello again Sysadmins

I am a student intern for a small IT company that provides Dealer Management systems to small Auto dealers and general IT support for there users and infrastructure.

I have been tasked in unison by  the company and my school to research moving the infrastructure ownd by the company and the infrastructure owned by its clients to a data center.

Large customers have there own server on site however we are looking in to providing them with VPS instead that we will host on Infrastructure we are going to rent (IaaS) or maybe if the price is better buy and collocate it  into a data center our selves.

Right now the average spec for customer servers are 32Gig ram and 400Gig DISK space (I have no clue about CPU but from what I gather the power of these is mostly in line with the amount of RAM). Every server has on average 30 remote desktop sessions running during business hours.

My question to u guys is if you could point me In the right direction to how I can determine the specs these VPS should have. How Do I measure the usage of the current servers resources? Preferably in such a way that I can pour it in a report for my boss, the ceo and my school.

Or maybe I should just copy the physical specs to the VPS’ses but oversubscribe the Host servers they run on ? Idk I want to know I want to learn. Many thanks for any replies you might give.

PS: from being in contact with local IaaS providers I have been getting the feeling they find the current specs of the VM’s I wanted virtualized the are ‘32Gig ram and 400Gig DISK’ to be  rather big that’s why I’m wondering if I should down size it in someway.

37qjl4,1,2015-05-29,TIFU by squandering my potential,TotalHavoc,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/37qjl4/tifu_by_squandering_my_potential/,"So all occurred over the past 2 years or so, and honestly has it's roots in what I've been doing since I started my undergrad about 6 years ago. I'll try to make things as brief as possible, and probably fail at that too (Update: I did, this thing is way too long -_-).

I attended School A and got my BS in Chemical Engineering. To give some background, I coasted through my entire education before college. I never really learned study skills because I had never needed them. Got accepted into the honors program at School A, full scholarship, program I wanted, everything was great.

However, I proceeded to operate in college as I did in HS. I overslept or slept through classes, half assed my assignments, etc. I needed to maintain a 3.5 GPA to stay as part of the program and keep my scholarship. These habits eventually caught up with me. I now have a number of course retakes on my transcript because I needed them to keep my GPA up. I did eventually learn how to have a good work ethic and some decent study skills, so I managed to squeak by. I did a lot of undergraduate research in labs, but put the absolute minimum effort in. So none of the professors really cared much for me, but I did add to my resume. I have a TON of lab experience (including an REU program, google it if you want), but no publications or accolades to show for it. To cap things off, I got SUPER lazy in my last semester (surprise, right?) and ended up oversleeping my final presentation in one of my classes. My grade came back and we're bad enough to drop me just below a 3.5 GP to a 3.49. So I don't graduate as part of the Honors Program; I still feel like shit about this FU, even two years or so later.

I also applied to PhD schools at that time, because I want to do research science in any of a number of fields (alternative fuels, oil/gas, materials science, molecular simulations, process engineering, etc). I only got into one school, the worst of the bunch I applied for, School B. So I go there and despite a professor wanting me to work in his group on a project I was genuinely interested in, I stall because I was expecting other PhD offers which never came. So he grabs another incoming student for the spot instead, and I'm SOL.

So now I have to find a new PhD adviser and project. I go through my first year, do decent in my courses, and work for another professor for a few months in the middle of the year. I didn't show up enough or put as much work in because I didn't manage my time efficiently between classes, finding a social life/support network in a new place, leisure time, and the aforementioned lab work. So he told me there was no place for me in his lab.

I resume the search and find another lab for me to work in. I received a formal GAship offer to fund me for the next year (what i desperately needed to stay in school/on track for my PhD). Things are looking up again. I like the position, the place seems to be one that leads to a number of career opportunities, and I'm good to go.The professor does make it clear, however, that he's aware of what happened with previous professor and how much I slacked off. He says I need to prove myself and work hard to earn his trust. So I start working there for the summer.

Then comes a real FU. I had never had a true full time job in my life before this. I also had chronic issues with waking up on time, and came in late/missed a few of our lab meetings. The professor definitely took note of this. On top of that, I spent a lot of time in the lab slacking off on websites such as this, or on blogs, or even watching the World Cup that summer since the games were on during work hours. The worst two things I did though were not keeping my lab notebook neat, accurate, and in the proper format (an entry every day detailing your work), and not being precise in reporting what time I came in and left the lab. I rounded to the nearest half an hour usually, rounding to add more hours more often than not. I got a warning about some of these things sometime in mid-July

All of this stemmed from the fact I didn't understand what it meant to actually work, or the attitude you have to have to succeed. You need to be willing to work hard and earn your own success; just coasting and doing the minimum that is assigned to you will never lead to success, only to barely getting by at best. So August rolls around, and this professor sets up a meeting where he and a few of his subordinates tell me that my performance is subpar, I haven't made enough improvement, and based on how poorly my lab notebook is set up and the fact that there are hours I cannot justify on my timecard, he will be filing to revoke my GAship. He offers me the chance to resign if I do it before the end of the day. Now I know how bad my lab notebook is, and this thing is considered a legal document for anyone who isn't aware. So I cave and sign my resignation. He agrees to make it seem like I left voluntarily, so I won't have issues finding something new.

The upshot of this is that I no longer have funding within the PhD program. I look around for other professors who need PhD students: nothing. Come November, I found an internship and started working at a big company (let's call them company A). The pay is good for an internship, but it's an office job where I manage people and product launches, not anything engineering or sciencey. Come the end of first semester (Nov/Dec/Jan), I officially reduce to a Masters which I have just finished this May. I start a job search and apply to other PhD programs. I didn't find anything full time immediately, didn't get into any PhD schools, but have continued with my internship up until currently.

The last part concerns a job just recently that I thought I had in the bag. The HR department from this government organization (let's call them organization N) sent me an informal offer for a materials science position that I absolutely loved. Good pay, great benefits, great work culture, tons of all but guaranteed advancement potential. But the funding/certificate to hire doesn't come from them, because it is a government job. It comes from the central branch of organization N, which just looks at all of the candidates resumes and questionnaires and decides who the hiring branch can choose from to hire. And as you might guess, I just recently heard back that I wasn't chosen.

The hiring branch of organization A is still looking around for another source of funding/certificates to be able to hire me, as they really liked my interview and have told me they really want me. But I'm not overly optimistic... so it's back to the drawing board.

Sorry for the long story, but I needed some sort of catharsis. I feel like my life has gone from having a plan for how to get where I want to be in the future, to repeated setbacks, to changing that plan, to then having this plan destroyed, leaving me with no idea where to go or what to do. So I'm resuming my job search while working in a temporary internship which I hate. At this point, I have little hope that I can escape my past mistakes; they were necessary mistakes so that I could learn to fix my bad work habits. But I can't help but think that in doing so, I have been set back so far that it is very difficult to recover. I used to feel like when it mattered, things that I couldn't control would usually break right for me. It had all through my life up until graduate school. But now I feel like the script has completely flipped -_-

Thanks for reading if you got through all that. I know I'm not completely screwed, but I feel like I've squandered the fantastic opportunities I was given because I didn't understand what I had, or what I needed to do to succeed.

TL;DR: Had scholarship, was lazy and didn't how to work and fucked it up. Got into PhD program, was lazy and didn't know how to work and FU again, this time on three different occasions with three different possible advisers. Got great job offer, didn't work out because central branch of company didn't rate me as ""among most highly qualified"". Now hiring branch needs another source of funding/certificate to hire me. Frustrated with life."

I'm currently studying Physics and Computer Science at Aberystwyth university, which is pretty low in the league tables and falling quickly(in 2011 we were 49th in the Guardian's league tables and for 2016 we're 110th - it only goes up to 119). 

I'm understandably annoyed at this since when I applied here, the university was showing up as pretty average and now we're in the bottom 10%, but I'm not sure what to do in order to limit the damage the crapness of the university can do to my future. 

On my course there's an option to take a year out to work in industry as a paid intern- it doesn't affect the degree I get at the end, but it'd give me a year's experience working full time in the kinds of sector I would like to go into, while letting me save a bit of money for the future. On the other hand it would mean staying here for another year, which is time in which more and more employers are going to notice that this is one of the lowest ranked universities in the country.

___

If you're a recruiter for a physics/compsci related field, would you prefer a candidate from an unknown university with no experience or one from a uni that's known for being badly ranked, with a year of it?


If you're a graduate who was in my position, any advice at all on whether employers actually noticed your uni wasn't as prestigious as a Russell group, and whether they valued candidates who took a year in industry, would be appreciated too. Thanks in advance.

**tldr:**University have fallen in league tables pretty significantly and show no signs of stopping. Should I stay around for a year long internship, or bail before the uni can fall even lower?

The summer after freshman year, I interned at a well known tech company for 4 months. Now it's summer after sophomore year, and I've been working a 6 month internship at a different tech company, which will be done at the end of the summer (started after spring break, got permission from school to take a term off)

A couple managers have hinted already that they would like to hire me after the internship is over, but they also said they understand if I want to finish school first. Here's the catch - a few higher-up positions, both management and engineering, will be opening in the next few years because some employees in my department are getting ready to retire. I've been getting good reviews from my managers, and I feel I could put myself into a position to grab a very well paying job at a young age.

My questions: 
What are the pros and cons of finishing my degree online if the company offered me a job when the internship is over?

Would I be able to negotiate pay to be higher than entry level? I'd already have 10 months experience of legit work at tech companies, very little time would be required to train me since I'm already familiar with how things work here, and my managers will be giving me good reviews.

I should also probably note that my parents are paying for about 90% of my schooling, and would really like me to finish the degree. I'm EXTREMELY thankful for their generosity, but I'd be making more money if I was to take a job offer at level 1 on the pay scale than if I took a 3rd internship the summer after my junior year even if I start paying for school myself (in-state tuition!).

I have been enjoying the work I do A LOT more than schoolwork, which is why I'm leaning on the side of just finishing the degree online. Thanks for reading, and any advice is appreciated! It's be nice to hear if someone had a similar experience!"

&gt; * The Middle East. I don't think I would like working anywhere other than Dubai, but there's also Abu Dhabi, Doha, or even Riyadh if the salary is right. Still, 50 degree celsius summers and Islamic theocracy are going to suck, but I may be able to overlook that for a high enough salary.

&gt; * The Asia-Pacific region. I'm going to skip southeast Asia because that's not my jam. I would look more towards (in China) Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wenzhou, Hong Kong; (in Korea) Seoul; or (in Japan) Tokyo. I am especially interested with Wenzhou, the private lending capital of China, but me not knowing Wenzhounese may limit my social life. Korea also sounds interesting, but since I'm a person of colour I'm afraid I'll run afoul of nationalistic Koreans who see any other race as inferior, especially darker-skinned races. That leaves Japan. And unfortunately from my lurking on /r/japan and /r/japanlife, it looks like the financial programming job market in Tokyo is bleak, even for foreign investment banks like Goldman Sachs. Starting salaries can be as low as 5.5 million yen and subject to outsourcing to Bangalore. And for Japanese-style banks, like Mitsubishi UFJ-Morgan Stanley, or Mizhuo Securities? That's basically a zaibatsu salaryman work environment.

&gt; I might be wrong, though. Can anyone wax poetic on the financial software engineering opportunities in SF, the ME, and China/Korea/Japan?

/u/stoxastic did give share some insights:

* Most software engineering done at financial institutions is internal software, also known as ""back-office"" in financial parlance.

* Some companies, like Bloomberg, license out proprietary software developed in-house.

* For financial-heavy programming, there is quantitative finance, which is more mathematical/numerical programming much like machine learning. 

I still am looking for answers for the following questions:

* What kind of opportunities are available for software engineers in the ""financial services"" industry umbrella that don't pay a crappy salary.

* What the financial software engineering career landscape looks like in San Francisco, in Dubai/the rest of the ME, in Singapore, in Beijing, in the Pearl River Delta (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong), in the Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Wenzhou), in Seoul and in Tokyo.

* Whether the idea that earning potential in finance is greater than in traditional tech companies has merit, or is BS.

* Whether I shouldn't bother unless I speak the language (Arabic, Mandarin/Canto/Wenzhounese, Korean or Japanese) or am at least bilingual. That is, how much my employment prospects will shrink if I speak English but not the language of the region. Singapore is an exception.

* How susceptible financial software engineering outside the US is to outsourcing. (i.e. I've heard many of the ibanks in Tokyo have outsourced their software engineering work to Bangalore, Singapore and HK.)

* If, in Japan, I should only stick to foreign multinationals/gaishikei like Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs Japan/GSAM Japan, J.P. Morgan Securities Japan, Barclays Securities Japan, etc., or I would be okay in a traditional Japanese corporation like Nomura, Daiwa, Mizhuo, Mitsubishi-UFJ Morgan Stanley, Sumitomo-Mitsui (SMBC Nikko Securities).

* Whether the way to get a job in financial software engineering overseas is similar to getting a job with the ""Big 4"": Know your data structures, study CTCI, have internships under your belt, personal projects and a passion for the field. Or will I need financial experience or even an MBA?

One final note about quantitative finance: Ever since the May 2010 ""Crash of 2:45"", and especially since the Occupy movement, I have associated (perhaps wrongfully) quantitative analysts, algorithmic trading and HFT as part of the problem, not the solution, for America's economic woes. I would hate to be the guy who executed a sell order and wiped out a couple's retirement fund, just so I could make $200,000 a year instead of $150,000 a year. When I was younger, I promised myself that I would try to use a career in software to contribute to society, instead of just making rich people richer at the expense of everyone else. Which is hypocritical of me, considering that if I were to work in finance I would be writing the software that facilitated traders to do just that. That said, I have moderated my views and understand that investment banks and the financial services industry as a whole have an important role to play--allowing companies to access credit, so they can grow and hire new workers, and help keep the economy chugging. M&amp;A's, however, can burn in hell, and I'm still on the fence on being a quant."

I haven't gotten any internship yet so I am actively seeking for one. My GPA is decent and is above 3.0. I had applied for several co-op positions but gotten no response. I recently applied for an internship with a company that is responsible for a rail project in my state. I got a phone interview about 3 weeks ago. The interview was only about 15 minutes. To me, that interview was rather like a small talk. The interviewee didn't ask me a lot of question to get to know me better. He mainly asked me questions about the projects I did in school and my experiences related to those. He said that my cover letter had good writing, good resume, good GPA, etc. He also told me that he will have to contact other candidates first and give me a call back or something for an in-person interview so be aware. I was kinda happy because I thought I could have gotten an engineering internship for real this time. I talked to one of my friends who was a junior and he applied for the same internship too. His GPA was lower than mine and his phone interview was only around 6 minutes. I'm sure he has done less engineering projects than I did as well. Three weeks after the phone call, I have yet to receive an email or a call. I even sent an email to follow up with the situation but got no response. The interviewee responded to my email almost instantly before the phone interview. Therefore, I think he did not choose me mainly due the fact that I am graduating soon, or the other candidates are better than I am. i was really sad and disappointed. Even if he rejected me he should have told me so. Anyway, I don't know what to do now. "

I'm about to start an internship and I'll finally have some money, so I've decided to build a PC that will give me more than 15fps at lowest settings :). 

I do most of my AAA gaming on my PS4. I like consoles and its what my freinds have got, so I'm not looking for something to play GTAV @ max. I'm going budget performance here, which is why I want to stick to the FX processors.

Most specifically, my father gets extremely violent and is almost constantly yelling and blaming things. He started yelling threateningly because my mom wanted to change her phone wallpaper, tried to beat me up while spitting in my face because I looked at him disappointingly, attacked my mom and injured her because she wanted to get an X-ray, ""for her safety"".

This being said, my mom is still an enabler and while less violent and less consistently angry like my ndad, she is no freedom-lover. 

As some other people have mentioned on this reddit, they are likely envious, and want to cannibalize my childhood, in a way. 

Anyhow, with my ndad's extreme resistance to my independence, change, success, and general ideas, I am planning to do an internship in Boston this summer and already have housing booked and everything. However, I am still under 18 so my ndad can still abuse me. The internship is not a simple office internship, it is an engineering internship, one that would probably help my future quite a lot. Despite all of this (or maybe because of this), my ndad is extremely violent and obsessively tries to do everything in his power to stop me from doing this, the same way he has tried to stop me from doing a whole load of other things for my own future. He's doing things from inventing ""laws"" that prevent me from going to calling the place where I am staying to make them dislike me and reject me from staying there. He also has this self-centered ""no one cares about you except for me"" and ""everyone is out to get you"" attitude.

Also, the company is a complete circus. The only senior dev works remotely, the guys running it aren't technical at all, and absolutely nothing is written down. Our briefs are verbal, maybe a couple of sentences, and they continually change, making working there hugely stressful when you throw in the deadlines.
They say they're going to expand very soon (they've said that for a while). Do I stick it out or do I quit, and spend a few months learning stuff on my own full time, (maybe C#, seems to be in demand in demand in the UK), then apply of jobs elsewhere? I've  got money to last me 6-7 months."

37x0nt,6,2015-05-30,"Got accepted into the best (probably) marine biology program in my state for undergraduate, should I go through with this?",5aywhatagain,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/37x0nt/got_accepted_into_the_best_probably_marine/,"I got accepted (I'm transferring from a community college) into the best marine biology program in my state. In the title for this post I said ""probably"" because it's incredibly hard to find any good rankings for marine biology specifically. The university is one of three R1 schools in my state (only two of these are public, including the one I was accepted into). The school itself is ranked 30ish in biology, although all three of the R1 universities are ranked 30ish in biology as well, so it's really the best for biology as well. The school itself is actually a satellite campus located on the coast. It hosts all of the marine science programs for the university. It's the only school that has the entirety of their undergraduate program located on the coast and is also the only one with a degree specifically in marine biology, as opposed to just a concentration in marine biology. It is the combination of these factors which has lead me to conclude it's the best option for an undergraduate degree in marine biology within my state.


Now onto the real question: should I do this? I ask this question because there is no going back after this point. If I pursue a degree in marine biology, I want to go for a PhD and conduct research. So this is going to be a commitment to academia as a career also. I've heard that biology has the worst academic career prospects out of most science disciplines, mainly because of the recent flood of molecular biology graduates. However, I was talking to my biology professor and he said doing something more niche, such as marine biology, actually doesn't have such a horrible outlook. That aspect coupled with actually getting into the ""top program"" for this in my state actually makes me think maybe I have a chance at making it in academia. Not making it and ending up with no job after spending 10 years in school is what scares me. All one has to do is ask the internet to see how horrible doing anything academia related is in today's job market.


Also, just to show how I am as a student. I have a 3.84 GPA and a 4.0 Science GPA, as well as a small summer internship under my belt. (5 weeks paid in a biology lab at a smaller university)


On a final note, I want to point out how much I truly love the subject. I actually started college with the intent of becoming a marine biologist. I absolutely love biology and did great in those classes. I've looked at the courses I would be taking and I literally get butterflies the classes seem so awesome, and this really isn't the case for my alternative non-academia related major (computer science). Honestly, if I could teach and do research on marine life for the rest of my life, I wouldn't really mind it if I only made like 50k a year. Hell, I suppose community college teaching wouldn't be horrible either, all though I really want to do research.


So /r/academia should I do this? Should I take the leap and just say ""fuck it."" Should I go big and make this my hopeful career? Or is it just too risky? I want some advice, so please feel free to share your opinions on any aspect of my situation!

37x3hg,3,2015-05-30,Intern for 7 years (same company) despite company's policy of 1 year maximum [CT],7yr_intern_throwaway,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/37x3hg/intern_for_7_years_same_company_despite_companys/,"

I've been working for a 9.7 billion dollar company for seven years (beginning summer 2008). I was hired on part time as an intern/co-op directly by the company under their co-op program (intern hourly base pay, no benefits, and no PTO). In the summer of 2010, my role changed from working part time to full time (40 hour weeks), however my job status of intern remained the same. When this change occurred I went from general warehouse labor to account shipping lead while still fulfilling my warehouse labor role (pay rate remained the same). Shortly after I graduated from account shipping lead to desktop technician requiring me to transfer to a different location to work one on one with the customer (summer 2013). Taking on this new role significantly increased the workload on my plate, including special projects that required me to work over 15 hour days every week for an entire month (peak was 147 hours in two weeks). Overtime was granted, however my pay rate was still that of an intern compared to my co-workers who were performing the same tasks but being paid at least an additional $8/hr. In the Fall of 2014 I took over a position that was currently being fulfilled by a full-time employee (higher pay rate, benefits, PTO, official job title). I am currently still fulfilling this position with my same intern status. In January of 2015 my company realized that I have been working for them so long that they are required by law to offer me medical benefits (due to health law changes?). My company still has not changed my intern status and I do not accrue any sick time, vacation time, holiday pay, or personal time. Any day that I don't work I don't get paid, including national holidays such as Memorial Day and July 4th. Per company policy, an individual can only remain in ""intern status"" for a maximum of 1 year before they must make a decision either to dismiss them or hire them on as a full time employee (including ALL benefits). 

 

Can anyone please advise if I can pursue any legal action against the company since they are in violation of their own company policy by keeping me in ""intern status"" for this extended period of time in addition to prohibiting me from obtaining all the benefits of a full time employee (annual raises, PTO, all health benefits, and official job titles)? 

 

Does this tie into equal opportunity issues since I am performing the same tasks and fulfilling the same responsibilities as my co-workers but for a much lower rate?

 

**tl;dr**

**Seven year intern status has not changed despite role changes and increased responsibilities. Per company policy, an individual can only remain in ""intern status"" for a maximum of 1 year before they must make a decision either to dismiss them or hire them on full time. Please see questions above.**"

I just turned 18 a week ago. I've been meaning to get a job for a while now, but haven't had much luck.

One of my limiting problems is transportation. I don't yet have a car, nor a license. I always wanted to get a learners permit, but I have no one I could practice with, as my mom does not drive nor have a car. So I'm limited to what I can quickly get to on foot, my bike, or the bus/train. 

Another limiting factor is school. I don't yet have my high school diploma, although I plan to be graduating early next school year. I am also interested in eventually taking some courses at a community college. I wonder how hard it is to get a job without a  high school diploma.

One thing I am worried about is current living situations and my mom. My mom does not work and receives a lot of financial assistance. She gets social security disability income, food stamps, housing assistance, energy assistance, etc. What will having a job do to those? Will they go up so much she won't be able to afford the cost of living anymore? What about if I move out?

Also there is the problem of my current ""job"". I've been placed as a CTO of a small online startup company. I know the owner in real life. We've been trying to launch for years, but constantly hitting setback after setback. I'm not even getting paid yet. I started out as one of the ""community members"" who helped out from time to time. The CTO at that time became ""unreliable"". He started saying he was frequently busy running his computer shop. He told the owner he could get computers for the employees and servers for the company, he just needed money. Not seeing any reason not to trust him, he sent him the money. As you've probably guessed by now, he disappeared as soon as he thought he had squeezed as much money out as he could. We no longer had access to make changes on the servers, all the work was gone. The owner turned to me, and told me he knew I was capable of doing everything he needed. So I quickly got to work, getting everything set up as he needed it, and learning a few new things along the way (like how parallels Plesk Panel sometimes decides to create a 300GB log file when it updates). So with all that, we're still stuck in the ""launching to the public"" stage. The waiting for more investors stage. So I'm still broke. Got some experience, but still broke.

And then there's the matter of finding a job I both qualify for and want. I'm looking for something in IT, but not sure what is the best fit for me. I guess my best skill would be a repair technician. I'm good at the problem solving and skilled with computers. But I'm also interested and skilled in things like networking, virtualization, and security. The only qualifications I have are the five IT certifications I have and the years of helping the IT department at my high school.

I actually tried to get a job once a little over two years ago. My IT/CS instructor contacted me and a few other students about a local internship opportunity he had been told about. The job was titled Associate IT Consultant - Bench Technician. $10/hour, part time, flexible hours - it almost seemed perfect for me. So I sent in an email. A few weeks go by. Nothing. I go to ask my teacher about it, and he says he would try to call them. About a week later we give up. Neither of us were able to get them to tell us anything. A simple ""no"" would have sufficed instead of just waiting around wondering if they are ever going to get back to me. I'm almost tempted to try signing up again.

I've considered going somewhere like Best Buy's Geek Squad, but from what others have told me it's not the best of options.


&amp;nbsp;

So it looks like I've created a giant ugly wall of text, but maybe someone can give me advice."
37yh5h,67,2015-05-31,Female Engineering PhD Student Having Advisor Issues,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/37yh5h/female_engineering_phd_student_having_advisor/,"This is long, but I'll try to keep it to the point.

I had an important conference that I needed to present at, and I couldn't seem to get my advisor to give me feedback at my presenations (x2) and poster that I wrote. I ended up having to submit the presentation with him only taking a glance at it, and the poster without him seeing at all due to the deadline for the printing.  Well, I finally went into his office to ask for feedback directly, rather than just through email.  “Did you see my poster?”  I asked.  “No,” he shrugged.  “I hope it's good.”  I literally then specifically asked him to pull it up on his computer.  He was in a very weird sing songy mood and kept insisting that I listen to music with him, telling me it was important, rather than looking at my poster for a conference taking place the following week.  I found it quite odd, but tried to brush it off.

I asked another professor to come to our group meeting that Friday... flash forward...that Friday during our group meeting where I scheduled myself to present for a practice run...I was so excited and it a great mood because I finally got some feedback about my project.  I'm very passionate about my project and I love presenting, so anything to learn more about the project and improving presenting made me very happy.  I took careful notes and was sure to thank those who critiqued me, my lab mates, advisor, and other professor that I invited.

Flash forward again.  Tuesday, day of my presentation.  During a break from all the presentations, I walked up and started talking to my advisor.  Right away, big mistake...I'm a first year student and didn't realize that he doesn't like to talk to his students (only network with others) at conferences.  He started giving me advice about my presentation, that was at 2 p.m.  It was currently 10 a.m.  I was afraid I looked nervous...pale, shaking, sweating...or something...and so I said, “I'm not worried; do I like worried?”  He replied, “I don't want to talk about this right now.”  And he walked off.  I tried to shake it off.  I figured maybe he was just upset that I had interrupted his networking.  Or maybe that he had somehow misunderstood what I had to say.

Well, my presentation went very well and ended up being one of the top ranked presentations.  People were very responsive and I felt like things were going great.  I had a lot of people come up to me and tell me how much they enjoyed my presentation....with exception of my advisor, who seemed to be avoiding me.  It felt odd, but at the same time I just figured he was....networking.  He can talk to me anytime, why talk to me at a conference when there are people there he can only see twice a year?

Things seemed good.  That night, after dinner, my advisor suggested we go to the local bar.  So conference participants went to the bar.  He joked around with the male students, going so far as to make a joke with one about the student picking his female officemate's dirty underwear.  I tried to fit into the conversation, and I awkwardly mentioned that one of my labmates had initially thought I had a different sexual orientation than I do.  Conversation seemed to flow, and everything seemed fine.

The next morning was when I found out that something really was wrong.  My advisor almost backed into me, so I honked at him.  My car was backed into recently, and I definitely wanted to make sure that didn't happen again. T hat being said, it was a school vehicle he was driving so I didn't even know he was driving it.  I jokingly told my labmate that he almost backed into me...trying to make light out of the situation....when he actually got out of his vehicle and started yelling at me and cussing.  He swore that he had seen me and that he was backing up to make room for my car (makes so much sense right?) and that honking was disrespectful.  At first I apologized, not wanting to upset my boss.  But the more I thought about it, I'm glad I honked.  I did the right thing.

There were several awkward encounters the next day, and I just tried to avoid him.  After the conference was over, I thought that I would be able to avoid him and just let things die, but he scheduled a one-on-one meeting for the next day.

At this meeting, he proceeded to tell me how horrible I am at networking, because I scare people and that I talk too much.  (I know I talk a lot, but I figure that some people don't so it balances out).  He did apologize for yelling at me after I honked at him, but maintains that I shouldn't have honked.  He told me that my interactions with people are inappropriate (despite his comment about picking up female's dirty underwear).  (And I should just mention I was just trying to follow his lead).  He told me that during my practice run of my presentation, I had seemed unreceptive and ungrateful to his feedback (despite my constant begging for feedback) and that the other professor who had come had felt the same way (despite me specifically inviting him for that reason...his feedback).  He told me he feels like he can't mentor me, and that he avoids me because he feels I cause drama in the workplace.

Lastly, he told me that I need to make an effort to cover up more, and pointed to his chest.  I was wearing  a shirt that's collar line went up to my collar bone.  He told me he had a hard time looking at me in the face because of the way I dress.  Despite the fact we have no dress code, and that I wasn't dressed badly anyway.

I didn't know what to do.  I just took everything he said and apologized for him feeling that way about me and told him I would work on things.  I was shaken that day, but fine until I cried myself to sleep that night.  I have felt worked up and intimidated by this man since I started last year.  I love what I do, and I'm not going to change projects on his account.

I've dealt with some severe anxiety, partially due to my interactions with him.  Last October he chewed me out (no warning) and told me that the door was open if I wanted to go.  I didn't.  Like I said, I love what I do and I want to work on this project.  I started seeing a counselor, who has helped with my anxiety.  Right now, I'm seeing an intern as my counselor is out of town.  She recently found out about a support group in the diversity office for grad students with issues with their advisors.  She hinted that I should make formal complaint against him, but I definitely fear retaliation and I know that no good will come of the complaint.  He's tenured, and things haven't gotten bad enough that anybody would do anything.  And, as it's a small department that I'm in, he would even know an anonymous complaint was me.

I'm posting this here since, as a female engineering PhD student, I don't have many girl friends here to talk about these issues.  I know it's long, but I would really appreciate your thoughts on how I should handle the situation.

37yw92,3,2015-05-31,I don't have a gift!,Jazzmusiek,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/37yw92/i_dont_have_a_gift/,"I wish you could be a silent third party observer, like a fly on the wall… Despite my best intentions, I feel as though I made things worse. I’ll try to be detailed. I need your help to make sense of this mess.

Essentially… I’m 22 years old and attending college for media studies. I landed a ton of internships (ex. films, freelance photography, television, news) my freshman and sophomore year…since I didn’t receive as much aid this year, I had to take-on a part-time job.

In order to keep me in the “loop”, Philip (age: 40ish?) has been giving me oddball jobs to do. Since the beginning, Phil has always had my back. He was watching out for me before I even knew who he was. I’ve never had to ask him for anything. I’m his only go-to person. Several months ago he pitched an idea for a script to me. I asked him if he wanted to collaborate, he said yes. I told him then, and many countless times, that writing like that is a bit of an intimate process. Writing a good story involves connecting on a personal level; writing from the inside out. In order for the project to be successful, we would have to be very open/comfortable with eachother. He’s never told me, but I could tell that he was uncomfortable with the idea. . I started us off with exercises to help us better understand our story, ourselves, and eachother. He would always talk about subjects that were off topic, but he’d never talk about himself… A very frustrating process, but he's never done anything like this before. We were able to hammer out notes, but neither of us was very passionate about the story.

A couple of weeks ago, Phil landed a very big opportunity on a major news station… and ofcourse, he worked me in. To show my gratitude, I decided that I would do something nice for him. I knew that I couldn’t ask him what he’d like because he’s modest and would refuse. So I decided that since he likes movies, I’d take him to the theater to go see one. He was ecstatic, he hadn't been to the movies in alittle less than a year.

My average work attire is a comfortable top with long pants. I wear long pants in order to protect my legs from hazards (broken objects, hot equipment, sharp long grass, scraps, falls…etc). On the day I treated Philip to the movies, I wore shorts with an average top. My thoughts: no work today, it’s hot out, it’s just a movie…why the hell not. What I gathered from his thoughts from the expression on his face when I showed up to the theater: OH MY. It then dawned on me, he’s never seen me in shorts before. He thinks I’m showing off. We watched the movie, he gave me a hug, and afterwards we went our separate ways. Now I’m thinking: Okay, it was no big deal.

As I stated before, I shoot a lot of freelance photography, Phil is the one who got me hooked up. We travel together a lot, sometimes to different states. He’s not comfortable with silence. He will talk about bullshit for hours just to avoid a moment of quiet. On one particular trip, Phil had run out of things to say… After a long pause, he then brought up the script. I once again reminded him that writing is very personal. I then revealed a major secret to him, a rough experience with my ex, and that is practically what I used to connect with a character. He took what I told him to heart and he told me a lot about his past/current life. We shared similar experiences, so we were both empathic towards eachother. It was the first time he’d really opened up. Even after our long talk, he let me know subtly that he doesn’t completely trust me…”I would tell you (about a certain topic) but I have to get to know you more”. I didn’t really care because we had made major progress.

We talked more after that, I’d sometimes message him randomly during the week “I’m interested to know how your day went”… He’d call and we’d talk for a bit. What made our talks so great is that he revealed to me a lot of his character/wants… it became easier for me to understand his abstract ideas. I was able to understand his vision. One night I sat myself down at my computer and the words just flowed. I finished with a nice fat wad of script. Real progress at last! I decided that I’d surprise him by delivering the finished pages to his door step with a cup of coffee…

Me (Text): What time do you usually eat breakfast?

Phil (Text): 11:30 or noon

Me (Text): Ha that’s lunch! What time are you due to get up tomorrow?

Phil (Text): Early, I’m working. If you want to grab breakfast next week is good

Me (Text): Okay, just tell me when… How early is early?

Phil (Text): 9:30 is about the earliest... I actually don't know my call time yet.

Me (Text): Okay, I might call you in the morning.

Phil (Voicemail): Hey…uh uh um… yeah, I’m not sure when I need to leave in the morning exactly. Try to give me a call if you want… yeah, um… you’re just a friend… I appreciate ya. You don’t have to do anything special for me. I’m good. I appreciate the friendship… No need to buy me breakfast but if you want to hang out, that’s okay.

Me (Call): Ha, don’t worry. I don’t want anything for you. You’re the one who suggested breakfast. I just wanted to drop something off.

Phil (Call): I didn’t think you wanted anything from me. Just didn’t want you to go out of your way. I appreciate your friendship!

Me (Call): I have to work in the morning but I’m spending tonight nearby. Depending on the circumstances, I was going to try to drop something off in the morning. I didn’t want to tell you because you’d expect it. It was suppose to be a bit of a surprise. As for me buying things, it’s no big deal, I enjoy treating my friends… Besides, it’s the least I could do. I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable.

Phil (Call): That’s sweet of you. I appreciate it. Not too often does anybody go out of their way to do something nice for me. I just uh… you’re not making me feel uncomfortable… I was thinking about you… You know, money is hard to come by these days and uh… you know, spend it on somebody that…uh, is probably more worthy of it than a old sack of potatoes like me. I’d rather just try to look out for you. I’m good, I don’t need anything… but I do appreciate you thinking about me and taking the time. That’s very nice. So if you feel compelled, it’s not necessary. I appreciate your friendship. I enjoy your friendship, so if you want to drop something off, go ahead.

**6:30 turned out to be his call time... too early for me. I told him that I'd wait until next week.

Oh my. I've caught myself in a bit of a predicament... I'm embarrassed. Obviously he's felt that I've been hitting on him for a while. If I tell him the truth, he might just think that I'm making up excuses to save face. Not cool. 
Getting rejected by him really hurt. I don't believe that I have hidden feelings for him... It's as if he told me randomly...""Hey, I know you kinda well and I think your nice.... but just so you know, I wouldn't fuck you"". Ouch.  
What do I make of this? 
Did I do something wrong? 
Did I accidently damage the relationship I had with this guy? 
If he does assume I'm lying. Is there any way I could use this to our advantage? If he believed his twenty-something-year-old friend has a crush on him, would it give him more confidence in himself? 
Would he trust me more? Is there a possiblity that he would open up more from this? 
I don't have a ""gift""!"
37z8xv,0,2015-05-31,Is a Core M laptop enough for EECS courses that require Unix environment?,jussnf,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/37z8xv/is_a_core_m_laptop_enough_for_eecs_courses_that/,"I'm making the big bucks (ok not really) this summer at an internship and planning on taking EECS 281 and 370 in the fall, and picking from 487/470/473/482/481/373 for upper-level. In my experience no C++ compilation has given my Atom tablet a run for its money but Cygwin and MinGW are not 100% reliable. I don't know how heavy the EECS load is on computers in the upper levels, or if I can switch back to Windows for the non C++ classes.

So my choices here are to VM Linux onto my Windows ultrabook and desktop or buy a Macbook 12"" (11"" Air 16 by 9 is too small and short and 13"" overlaps too much with my laptop, I want something substantially lighter). Really the only thing I care about with this choice is if the Macbook is enough power for the Unix compiling I need to do in EECS."

Since I'm going to be attending Purdue for the next 4 years pursuing my engineering degree, I want to make sure that I'm making an investment in a computer that is worthwhile and compatible with all of the classes.  

I might as well state right out that my preferred OS is Mac, however I don't mind using Windows if it is more compatible with the software that Engineering students at Purdue use.  Price isn't really an issue, I just want to make sure software compatibility is not an issue.  On the FYE website it is stated that any modern computer will do whether it runs a Mac or Windows based OS, however I have heard that people having issues running certain engineering software on Mac.  Has anyone out there with a Mac experienced issues/avoidable complications due to software incompatibility with a Mac OS?

Also as far as internships go, if anyone has any experience, do they provide you with a company computer to do work for them with or do they expect you to be able to run any software that they utilize on your college computer?

Also this isn't meant to start a Mac vs. PC debate, I've heard enough of it and an OS is just an OS.  I simply want to know whether software compatibility has ever been an issue :)

Thanks."
