Got any hopes for journalism and journalists? (more questions inside!)",gill_outean,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/977e5/in_three_years_ill_be_graduating_with_a_degree_in/,"Hi, Reddit. I'm a Canadian university student living in southern Ontario.

Newspapers everywhere are dying, magazines are hiring less and less, and the Internet is still somewhat of a mystery to journalists wanting to make a decent living. I feel I'm a strong writer and reporter with a lot of qualities that lend specifically to being an excellent overall journalist, but I'm growing more and more concerned that this industry will have croaked before I even get a chance to put those skills to use.

So here's a few more questions I have:

1. How much can I expect to make straight out of school? I'd like to know how $$$ differs from medium to medium, job to job.

2. Are there ways I can increase that income? What are the accompanying consequences? For instance, I know that freelancing often fetches a much higher income than a salaried position, but it's also nowhere near as consistent and much more difficult to start doing in the first place. Also, will I get paid more living somewhere other than southern Ontario? Is there anywhere in the world where a journalist's quality of life is better than elsewhere?

3. In three years' time, where do you expect the best jobs in the journalism field to be? 

4. What can I start doing right now to increase my chances of getting a stable, good-paying job after I graduate? To save some time, assume I'm already aware of the most obvious stuff: work on my portfolio, do internships, make contacts, etc.

And finally, 5. If being a journalist in the traditional sense doesn't work out for me, what are some other routes I can take with my degree? I've been especially interested in PR work, but I'm one of those unlucky few who couldn't see himself working at a job that consists largely of deception (maybe that's an unfair statement, but it's the bias I have towards PR.) 

Err, one more question to expand on the last one:

6. If PR is something that interests me, but I have this moral gag reflex (justified or not), what are some clients or types of clients I could relate publicly and still be at ease with myself?

Thanks."

Any suggestions?",needjob,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/98p5v/hey_reddit_ive_been_searching_for_a_job_since/,"Just graduated in May with a degree in Comp Sci.  I had a job offer from a previous internship but declined it because I didn't have a good experience at the company.  BIG FUCKING MISTAKE.

The weird thing is I feel like I do well on the interviews (I know the answers to 90% of the questions since I've been interviewing for so goddamn long), but I always end up with a ""we're not going to be moving forward..."" rejection.  The thing that pisses me off is that they give no explanation whatsoever.  If I try to follow up with them and politely ask for a reason I just get straight up ignored.  I get no explanation so I have no fucking clue what I'm doing wrong so I can't fix it.

I know the economy is in the shitter and everyone is having a tough time but at this point I feel like just calling it quits and living with my mom for the rest of my life.

Anyway, I'd like to hear about your job application experiences and any tips you might have to land that precious job offer."

Well I can tell you that I am a programmer, and for about 6 weeks I worked in a system test environment the other 6 weeks were spent in a programming environment. Anywho, I was wondering if someone could submit a safe for work joke. It can be one of those lame jokes or a really funny one, lame jokes though would be good, because my advisor is known for that around here. Thanks for the help reddit."

I'm sending off e-mails and applications today and am planning on leaving for DC in about 2 weeks.  A lot of these places don't have any internships posted, but they're non-profits and I'm a fairly qualified candidate (language skills and political science background applying to organizations working in the Middle East).  I'm planning on cold-calling a few if I don't get anywhere soon.

Any advice on how to approach this?  Thanks!"

Does anyone know a good place to find work or need something done?",ericatha,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9clwp/hey_reddit_ive_been_doing_web_design_for_years/,"Hey Reddit, I’ve been doing web design for years, internships and freelance, but lately I haven’t been able to find any well paying projects. Does anyone know of a good place to find work? Besides Craigslist, where you find people who want you to build the next Facebook for $300, and sites like 99designs (I’m not interested in working for nothing only to have my concepts stolen and used by the winner) Or even know of someone that needs a web designer, preferably in or around Pittsburgh.

Here’s a link to my temporary portfolio (yes I’m even too poor to afford web hosting and my domain name)
http://ema153.aisites.com

I would like to find a part time Frontend Web design position in Pittsburgh, but unless I get lucky that’s not gonna happen soon. I’m still in school, and I’ve got about a year left, so while I’d love something full time, I need part time. I’ve applied to some normal places (retail and such) but I’d really like to continue to do web design, it’s just not paying the bills. So if anyone has a web project, knows someone who needs something done or a good site to find freelance, please leave a reply.

Hopefully someone can help, point me in the right direction or offer some advice.
Thanks in advance reddit, I love you guys.
