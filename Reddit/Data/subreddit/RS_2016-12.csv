I'm currently a freshman pursuing a mechanical engineering degree and I REALLY want an internship this summer.

I have no job experience or skills in software like MATLAB, but I'm probably going to finish the semester with a 3.8~.

5fubj7,3,2016-11-30,Why am I suddenly such a bad-looking candidate? [CS internships],dejectedintern,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/5fubj7/why_am_i_suddenly_such_a_badlooking_candidate_cs/,"Last spring, I applied for a summer software engineering internship. This was because the company sent recruiters to my school, and I decided ""what the hell, what's the worst that can happen?"" so I sent them my resume and got 3 back-to-back interviews. A couple weeks later, I was offered a position. This was the only internship I applied for because it was my first year of university and I thought it was too early to apply for internships.

This boosted my confidence a bunch. I'm an honors student, a double major (compsci and math), I make good grades, I'm good in my compsci classes especially (i'm generally the one that everyone asks for help when a project in class is too hard), and I even work closely with the Computer Science program coordinator as the Linux system administrator for the computer lab on campus. And on top of all that, now I have a software engineering internship with a Fortune 500 company after my first year of college? ""Wow! I must be doing stuff really right!"" I thought to myself.

I figured after this last summer, I would apply to a lot more internships, and I would look like a fantastic candidate. I still have all of the great things mentioned before, but now I *also* have a prior internship under my belt. And hey, even if I don't get an internship I like more, I can still go back to the same company for a second internship.

The end of the summer is when everything fell apart. I didn't get a return offer from the company. The other intern on my team (who goes to my school) told me that he didn't get a return offer for our team, but the company as a whole wants him to come back, so they're looking at other teams to put him on. He and I worked on the same stuff, had the same progress, were basically 100% on par with each other the whole summer. Why would they want him back, but not me?

This dropped my confidence a lot. I feel like an ass. I must have fucked up royally not to get a return offer.

But hey, I can still apply to other places.

I reapplied to the same company for a different team. The recruiter (same recruiter that recruited me last time) told me he'd love for me to reapply, and I got an interview. After the interview, the recruiter told me 2 things:

1) I have to apply online so my application is in their system. ""Don't worry, it's really simple.""

2) ""We'll be in touch in a couple weeks or so to follow up, regardless of whether you get the internship.""

Both of those were lies.

1) Their website had HUNDREDS of summer internships posted up that were relevant to software engineering, and I didn't know which one to apply for, or if I should apply for several. I picked the one closest to the one I interviewed for and applied for it. Then I emailed him, explaining what I did, and asking if it's sufficient. No email back (This was mid-October).

2) Still haven't heard back from them one way or another. Again, the interview was in mid-October.

Around the same time, I got two other interviews with different companies. One company I haven't heard back from yet, and another company rejected me. I emailed them thanking them for their consideration and for the interview and politely asking if they had any tips on what I could change in the future, and they haven't responded.

I've applied to 6 or 7 other internships, and plan on applying to more. Other than what I've said, I haven't heard back from anyone. Meanwhile, all sorts of students around me are getting offers left and right.

I feel like shit. I have no idea what I did wrong. I don't know how to fix this. I somehow went from a very attractive candidate to a very unattractive candidate, and I have absolutely no clue why, or how to fix it.

Sorry for the wall of text. I mostly just want to get this off of my chest."

I once told in a comment on this very subreddit that, in my place of work, job security is a given as we've got lots and lots of stuff to tell. At that time, I didn't think to include my fellow techs-in-training. Now, I know why I should have done that.

Please be aware that this is a story originally written by /u/BlackSunAjat, all spelling errors are his very own (At least the ones I didn't catch). Let's hear it, Ajat! This tale happened this very week.
***

Good day, fellow Techs! A warning beforehand, this is my first time posting here. Misspelling and bad formatting is a part of my learning experience. I'm an apprentice junior administrator. Apprentice is because I'm in Germany and we in Germany have a dual-system for getting a profession, school and work. 3 years long is our apprenticeship where we learn everything what a good programmer and/or sysadmin needs. I'm in my first year and now sort of the team leader of an IT Training Room and the support for it due to the fact that I'm one of the few who have a documentation of their work. To explain why, let me tell you what happened before I became unofficial team leader.

The Cast is as follows:

$Me - Yours truly, /u/BlackSunAjat

$NoDocu - The Colleague who's the reason for this story

$TGF, a good colleague of mine (AKA /u/ThatGermanFella)

$Devil_Boss - Our boss, a really great guy. Has a red beard that makes you think he's the devil himself.

And of course I'll declare ~~variables~~ names whenever I see fit to avoid confusion

Some weeks ago, we had to reassemble the training room after the ceiling got fixed. Sadly I was not present when they were packing away all the computers and tables. The work of 1 hour was prolonged to 3 hours due to the fact that none of my colleagues made a placing map of how the computer tables were supposed to stand and reassembled. (In itself not that bad, the room was planned to be down for 1 more week. (The Tech-Gods shall bless $Devil_Boss, for he knew we are retards.) After everything was set up and running like a satisfied cat, I made some simple test runs to see if the system was fully operational. The result was good and the room was ready to be used in a productive environment again.


`Three workdays and a weekend later:`

While I was preparing some minor stuff the main phone guy from our tech-support came and told me that I got a phone call in. $Support_Slave was on the phone and told me that the training room wasn't responding correctly and he can't access the web-interface to change the images.... A feeling of Dwarf Fortress FUN assaulted me. Three hours left until the training has to be, no panic yet. I arrive in under 10 minutes with the believe that I can fix it without problems. I start the console and try the standard procedure of fixing the problem child. Access web-interface via intern IP. -&gt; Failure. Okay, this isn't something new, web-interface loves to bug around. Access Linux with Putty. -&gt; Failure. This is strange, I know it isn't down since the old images were loaded. Maybe the Server itself has a hang up? Looks like a total restart of the server is needed.
The settings were made for the room to start up in less then 15 minutes, I know it works since I was the one who set it up. After the restart, there's still no connection. I open up the terminal of the server and start pinging the gateway and servers running on it. Result: No servers running. *At all*. A look on the clock reveals that only one hour is left. Crap. Installing VMWare I connect to the server and the first thing that meets me is... The designated servers that were supposed to be the working machines were all marked defect. The autostart wasn't set up correctly and every time the server was restarted, the wrong image was chosen. I felt a strong headache heading my way to hit me with a mallet. Knowing that only one person could have changed something, I took up the phone and called the helldesk to ask for my senior. After asking him why things were changed, $NoDocu answered simply:
&gt;""The server made problems so I changed the image and IP"".

... O-kay?
So close to face palming I ask the last question that decided who was in control of the team.

&gt;$Me: ""Did you tell anyone about the change?""

&gt;$NoDocu's answer: ""No?""

At this point let me pause a bit, my head hurts from the after effect of the face-palm. 
I think everyone here knows what a pain it is if a colleague does not document his work, right? Returning back to the story, after hanging up the phone I look at my 'partner in suffering' who has been trying to fix this with me. Only 20 minutes are left, no time to try and do it in a elaborate way.


A simple fix is needed, so we install the needed software on the current images. Back in my office I go and complain to $Devil_Boss. His first question: 
&gt;""Have you checked the documentation?""

&gt;$Me: ""Docu-what?""

In respone to that, he gave me the 'The  Fsck do you mean?!' look. After showing the non-existent documentation, he told me to take over the control and to make sure that every single change that was to be done and had been done was recorded and archived. Now I'm in charge of a barely working IT Training Room, a group of people for whom documentation is a word of fiction and generally everything that is remotely close to imaging. First year apprentice with a work-experience of 4 months. I did manage to fix the room with the help of $TGF. Though it's a quick-and-dirty patch using a simple bash-script to copy and rename certain files on the linbo system, IT WORKS. As long as it somehow works I won't be able to do great changes, but once the room will be free for some days I'll just delete everything and build it anew. I have the belief that this will take less time and nerves than anything else.

The best of all? I'm not a Sys-Admin. I originally planned to be a developer.

***
TL;DR: A colleague of mine now has to write a 1200-word-essay on why documentation is essential and must be done and mantained at all times. Also, I got some new responsibilites, which is nice. And last but not least, sometimes you just have to nuke something from orbit. Preferrably with $NoDocu in the blast radius.

I hope you've enjoyed this tale, we promise there are many more to come. We got another one of an enormous amount of tabstops. Around 1.4 GB, to be precise.

I have been coding for the last month and coming up with projects. I am getting okay with java and doing my own personal project while learning front end web development at the same time and hope to contribute to an open source project.

So learning is good and all but how do I go from learning to getting a job? Also i am in the middle of the country, should I be moving somewhere else? what places are hot? A lot of job posting require CS, CIS, or IT degrees, I have been applying to related but non developer jobs (i. e.QA testor, technical services,  technical support) and been getting rejection letters the day after. I think they might have automatic filtering systems that keep me out do to Civil engineering degree?

So I though of a few ways to break in:

1. Get a technical but non-developer job at a company and prove my technical abilities enough to become a developer.

2. Work as an intern or do contract work for a startup/small company and prove your ability and get hired 3 month later.

3. go to a dev boot camp. typically they say it is 3 months long with another 3 months job search. Seems kind of long to be unemployed?

4. get lucky and land a developer job right off the bat. A lot of people say it is possible but I am not sure where to look. Big corporations almost always automatic filter your resume for CS/CE degrees and small startups are very selective about who they hire. What kind of companies have the bar set low (names, types, industry)?"

A has requested she make a decision by this Friday; however, she already got an extension to next week. B should give her an offer either today or tomorrow, and C's interview isn't until next week.

Right now, she is on the fence about whether to take A or B, so she's waiting to hear back from B. However, she knows if C accepts her she will take that role.

She is unsure how to go about this in the most morally right way possible. For example, she will feel bad if she ""accepts"" the offer at A or B due to their imposed deadline, but then finds out C accepted her because she will definitely take that.

Additionally, she wants to keep A and B in the loop about C to further extend the deadlines, but she worries that they could rescind the offer if she does.

tl;dr SO wants role C, but she won't find out if she gets it before she has to make a decision on A or B. What should she do?

5fxz1d,1,2016-12-01,problem with hr from my internship,overactive-bladder,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/5fxz1d/problem_with_hr_from_my_internship/,"i was following a masters degree in csr the past year and had to take a 6 months internship at a company.

right from the beginning, i noticed that i had to eat lunch with her and her clique; a bunch of blabbermouths who lived for drama. so i quickly distanced myself and pretended i took a huge breakfast and was not hungry at noon. so i went to eat alone for 6 months at 2pm. this did not sit well with her but i soldiered on.

after a couple of weeks she comes into my office, and ""orders"" me to go for a personal errand. i was in the middle of a deadline with my own boss and frankly i wanted to take a stand because i'm 27, with a masters degree and i just didn't want to be the future mop of the service. so i declined. from that day on, she gave me the cold shoulder, was constatly bitch at me, and refused to say hello or anything. i was like, whatever i'm fucking her for 6 months and i need my diploma.

so i kept doing my job, but my own bos was distancing himself to stop talking to me altogether. i was basically sitting in my office working by myself on projects he did not even greenlight or give remarks on. so i wrote my thesis by myself and just counted the days to go by. it was obvious the head hr had him by the balls and he does not have a personality.

i send my boss the thesis and he does not even reply to the mail. at the day of my presentation in front of my professor, the boss calls and says he can't make it. so i just give my presentation and leave it at that.

on the final day, i decide to just go to the head hr's office and try to at least part on good terms. but she still refuses to talk to me (fakes a cellphone call) but aknowledges my hard work and excellent performance in my field.

fast forward to this past tuesday. i send a mail to the lady at the hr service who was nasty the whole internship (made it very clear she did not wanna work with me or contribute with data) to have my internship certificate signed. no answer at all. so i send a small reminder wednesday  and still no answer at all. it's a 1 minute thing that i waited long enough for them to hand me over. so today, i receive my diploma from my university and just have had it with the whole fucking company. so i write a brutal mail about how i accepted many things from them, but i will not accept being ignored and denied from a certificate i earned and worked for.

what happens was, the hr lady goes to blabber about the mail to the head hr, who in turn writes a mail sent to me, my professor and THE WHOLE FUCKING ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT to which i belong. the mail was a bunch of lies and just pointing finger about how i was aggressive, refused to cooperate and the subject of many complaints. it is true that i kept to myself and stayed woring in my office, but that's the nature of my job and because colleagues did not really want to bother with me (i was hired to build a csr department from scratch and nobody thought much of job and some even denied access to info).

from this mail, it was clear that the head hr wanted to block me from my diploma by addressing my university and professor. so i reply (leaving the prof and univ out of it) that i have my diploma and just counter every point she made by my experience working for them. i finished the mail off with their [glassdoor review](https://www.glassdoor.fr/Pr%C3%A9sentation/Travailler-chez-B2S-France-EI_IE846102.16,26.htm?countryRedirect=true) which constitues an abysmal review of their culture and an indicator i was not making stuff up.

i have yet to hear any reply from anyone.

my question is. can my diploma be taken from me? i thought hard about it but my boss said ""positive"" things about me in his exchange with my professor before my thesis. plus grades have been handed out, and my diploma is physically with me.

the head hr will definitely NOT leave it at that. what can i expect from her? i wouldn't worry about her blocking me elsewhere since my horizon is wide open with a masters in environmental economics and sustainable development. i am kinda anxious here that there will be repercussions from this behaviour.

any help is appreciated thank you!"

I hate my current job and want to find another one ASAP. However, I can't decide between my two best alternatives. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

*****

###Company A
*This is my current job.*

Company A is a mammoth global company, over 170k employees. They have no qualms about making people do 60 hour weeks on a regular basis, and have strict deadlines for work. Their philosophy seems to be ""if you don't know how to do something, figure it out,"" which has made work a living hell for me since I don't know how to do anything that they assign me (and we can't forget those impending strict deadlines).

The people there are wonderful for the most part. The only ""bad apple"" I've come across so far is my team leader on my current project. My manager genuinely cares about my development, and the director of my practice also wants to see me succeed. I love my coworkers.

However, I frankly don't feel cut out for the job at all, especially because my job satisfaction is heavily dependent upon my own self-perceived performance (which is all over the place on a day to day basis based on whether or not I got stuck on something). What's more, I'm stuck doing literally the one thing I don't want to do with my degree, and that won't change until at least next summer. I'm very worried I'll be fired at some point.

The commute also isn't great. 45-60 minutes on public transit each way is miserable. However, it's cheap: $600 per year in transit passes plus the cost of commuting 6 miles round trip every day to the park-and-ride station - and that distance will be even shorter once a new train line opens.

My salary is pretty good, and I have five weeks of paid time off - though I can never take it because of those aforementioned strict deadlines. I've taken all of one day so far.

**Summary: I don't see a light at the end of this tunnel.**

###Company B
*I had a five-month paid internship here previously.*

Company B is a pretty big company - 70k - though it's less than half the size of Company A. Speaking from experience, people in the local office generally don't work more than 45 hours in a week. They have great support structures, which means that if you don't know something, someone else in the office does and is willing to show you. Deadlines are far less strict.

The office is full of great people, and I walked away from my internship with many friends and fond memories. I know from experience that I would enjoy working here.

I really enjoyed the work I did, too.

The commute isn't great here either, but it is doable. It would be about 30-60 minutes depending on traffic, which is about the same as my commute to Company A. However, it would be much more expensive, since I would be driving the whole way. I have calculated that to break even with what I'm making at Company  A (including commute), I would need two make an additional $2k over my current salary. The commuting cost would decrease drastically after my current apartment lease ends next fall, as I would move much closer.

I could theoretically start here in the beginning of January.

**Summary: This is the ""safe"" option.**

###Company C
*I received a job offer from Company C a year ago, but chose Company A over it.*

Company C is a mid-sized company of about 10k people, but it's growing so quickly that they literally cannot build office buildings on their campus fast enough. From my conversations with employees in the interview process, it seems 45-50 hour weeks are about the norm.

I have no idea what the people are like since I haven't worked there, but those with whom I interacted seemed pleasant and reviews seem to echo that.

The job descriptions seem like exactly what I want to do. I'm currently talking with a recruiter to try and narrow down what the day-to-day responsibilities would be (so I don't wind up in the same situation that I did with Company A).

Working there would require relocation halfway across the country. That would be at a cost of around $1700 in lease break fee, plus 60 days notice to my apartment complex (which I would spend employed at Company A), plus the cost of moving (which I know Company C would reimburse). I could try and negotiate assistance with the lease break under the reasoning that I could start in as little as a month (or even less!).

They only offer two weeks of paid time off. I have no idea if I could negotiate more. However, they offer a significantly (6%) better salary than what I have now in a lower cost-of-living area than where I currently live.

**Summary: This is the risky option since there are unknowns about the culture and would involving moving, but could have great payoff.**

I feel exhausted by day to day life at the point I'm at now. I feel like I completely missed out on my window to have fun in college. I'm a computer science major and all of my friends, even the ones I've known for years, just feel like coworkers who value me as a resource and nothing more. I feel like I might have chosen the wrong major because even though I get good grades and have a good internship, my actual core skillset hasn't advanced at the same pace as everyone else in the past year and I'm getting ignored more and more by my friends since I'm not as useful. I feel incredibly busy but every time I've tried to make time to be more social or branch out I've been rejected or ignored.

I just turned 22 and I'm graduating next year, but I feel like my college experience is already mostly over and underwhelming and I don't have any true friends or experiences outside of work or school to look back on. I'm not extremely confident socially but it's not like I'm terrible at it or anything. I take decent care of myself and I think I'm okay looking, and maybe it's just the demographic in the CS degree program, but it feels incredibly difficult to meet anyone new or connect at a meaningful level. There are also very few social events at the University I'm at to speak of, everyone I know just goes to school, goes to work, and goes home. It really sucks.
Another thing that's absolutely killing me inside which may sound silly is that I'm balding. I've always had long, thick, reddish blond hair that was a big part of my identity and it's already at the point I can't wear it long anymore. I was only 19 when it started and I'm scarred of the potential permanent side effects of the drugs, which is the only effective way to treat it at the moment.

That kind of goes back to me feeling like I'm missing out though. It makes me feel older than I am and I feel like I'll be out of place with college age people before too long. I just want some genuine friends. I have hobbies I'm passionate about but at this point whenever I invite anyone I know currently to hang out, come to a game night party kind of thing, or do anything outside of work or school, I'm either ignored or declined. I put a lot of work into some of the events too and I've kind of stopped doing it since it doesn't feel like anyone cares anymore.
Maybe other people are in a similar situation, I'm just really kind of down at this point in my life and have been for a few years. I am taking anti depressants now as a side note, which did help a little bit, but didn't solve the underlying issues."
5fyt8t,1,2016-12-01,"As a student in CS where java script isn't in the curriculum, is it worth learning on my own?",-Kevin-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fyt8t/as_a_student_in_cs_where_java_script_isnt_in_the/,"So my understanding through my limited coursework is that we are learning timeless solutions to problems. Arrays will always exist. Hash tables will always exist. Sorting algorithms will always exist. These things should 'be in your toolbelt.'  
Then something like node.js comes along and you see it popping up as a required/proffered experience with for a CS internship position, and you're like but wait... 

That's not even in my curriculum. It's a spin off of JS and... wait no that isn't either. Is CS curriculum just so much more focused on theory and maybe back end work (things like hash tables I guess I'd say are back end?) or like database management work that you should learn it yourself? (yes I know projects, learn on your own, but is this like an absolute?) 

My understanding of these subjects is limited, but many postins will ask for html/css/javascript/node.js and maybe c++/python/java. Do you learn these things if you want a job at all ever? Or do you learn them if you want to do what I understand to be front end work (interacting with the user, sending/receiving, reacting to requests/events) and then the school CS is more aimed towards the theoretical and 'back end?' (like I said, sorting files, efficient storage, whatever)."

I'm in a dilemma here. I live and have always lived in Ottawa, Canada. However, I've been looking for jobs strictly in Toronto, Canada to try and get away from Ottawa and experience something different, however have discovered the salary for Ottawa and Toronto are almost identical, yet the cost of living is not.

**Ottawa**:

*Pros*:

* Low cost of living
* Salary in the $60,000's
* Currently pay only $800/month for my place
* I love my home, it's very cozy
* Have a job offer that's a 15 minute bike ride away (did my internship here)
* All friends are here

*Cons*:

* Mundane city (for me, anyway)
* Work a bit boring, old tech stack
* Been in this city for a long time, want something fresh
* Bad winter weather

**Toronto**:

*Pros:*

* Much, much bigger, more exciting city, with good social life
* More interesting work places
* New opportunities, experiences, and people
* Better winter weather, funner summers

*Cons:*

* Salary in the $60,000's
* Higher cost of living
* Will probably pay around $1,500 for apartment
* Will need find apartment close to work

What would you do in my position? Looking for an outside perspective and opinions. "
5fz6zx,4,2016-12-01,When is a boot camp the right option?,Arowden86,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5fz6zx/when_is_a_boot_camp_the_right_option/,"About 8 months ago I began programming and became addicted. 4 months ago I moved to silicon valley with hopes of starting career programming. I consider myself intermediate with Python and I know basics of HTML, CSS, SQL (MySQL/postgresSQL) and JavaScript. I worked in networking for a few months before moving here and have a good understanding of most networking protocols. I'm comfortable with Linux and use it for everything. I've worked with AWS on personal projects. I recently wrote a program in Python on a Raspberry Pi that connects wirelessly to a relay connected to my thermostat wires via the MQTT (IoT) protocol. It uses a support vector machine algorithm with data from past usage stored in a database to learn and automatically manage the temperature and is controlled from an android app. I've done web scraping with Selenium and know the basics of Django. I've had a professional resume made, good Linkedin, projects on Github, and I've also applied to 75+ jobs and have not got a single interview!

At a meetup a few weeks ago the CTO of a company said if anyone was looking for work to talk to her. But the moment I mentioned that I didn't have any work experience, her attitude did a 180 and she said, ""Well... sometimes we have internships for people who do boot camps. Good luck though.""

I am to the point where I would literally pay to work for a company be doing something I enjoy and get out of the house. Considering this, I'm wondering if a boot camp is the right option for me. I've been told by several Sr developers who reviewed my work that I should have no issue finding a job. So it's hard to rationalize spending 20-25k while potentially losing 3-5 months pay to do a boot camp. But it's starting to seem like it might be the only way to get in. 

Should I bite the bullet and do a boot camp (money is an issue)? Or is there another path? Udacity nano-degree? I’m worried in a few months I’m going to end up working fast food just to have a job. Any advice would be appreciated!

5fzasa,3,2016-12-01,"At major crossroads in life, seeking advice",advicethrowaway89473,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5fzasa/at_major_crossroads_in_life_seeking_advice/,"I'm a 22 year old guy who is currently enrolled in a graduate psychology program, first semester. Ever since my senior year of highschool when I took AP psych I pursued a career in the field without deviation. I declared my Psychology major out the gate and spent the next four years getting my bachelor's degree, which was last spring. I immediately applied for graduate school and got accepted into one of the programs. The problem is ever since around my sophomore year in college I started to have doubts about my potential future career as a clinician. I pursued this major because I had a romanticized view of what therapy would be like, and once I started learning about it more and realizing how stressful it would be coupled with the responsibility involved, I was having second thoughts. I'm the type of person who avoids controversy or stress like the plague, and it finally hit me that I was pursuing a career that put me right in the middle of that. Putting that aside since I realize i'm getting off track, I decided to continue because I had invested so much time already towards this goal, and my family/friends were so proud of me, that I couldn't turn back. 

The trouble began after I got accepted into the graduate program, because I was required to complete a set amount of hours at an internship for further experience in order to be lifted out of this probationary status most of the people in my cohort were put on. We were suppose to start looking for internships during the summer, and mid December was when our time logs were due to prove we met the requirement. Because of the doubts I had about continuing in this field, coupled with the stress/anxiety from graduate school once the semester started in the Fall, I had difficulty finding an internship. I procrastinated for too long and didn't put enough effort into the endevour due to my uncertainty about the future. Too sum up the rest of what's been happening since I realize this is becoming far too long a wall of text, I've spoken to my adviser/program directer multiple times recently and I'm not going to be able to continue into the program. My grades in classes are all A's and B's which is good, but without the experience that was made clear from the beginning was a hard requirement, I am going to be dropped from the program. 

I've already discussed this with my parents and brother, who are supportive of me and just want me to be happy so they'll be by my side no matter what decisions I make. However I haven't told my friends or extended family about any of this, and as far as they're aware (except two of my closest friends) i'm doing great in the program and am excited to continue. 

So now i'm at an impasse for where to go from here. As I said i'm a 22 year old guy who has a bachelor's in Psychology, will have 15 credits in a graduate program in a month's time, but will have no future plans either long term or short term. I should also mention that I had a job as a line cook at a restaurant, but quit once the semester started in hopes of having more time for class and an internship (didn't work out so well). I can always get my old job back, but at the time I quit almost as a point of pride for me moving on to bigger and better things, and my coworkers were happy for me. Going back after leaving the graduate program would be heartbreaking, and i'm not sure I could do that. 

I've talked with my best friend about this, and he said there are good jobs out there that just want to see you have a bachelor's degree in anything regardless of the subject and you can still do well for yourself, but I haven't looked into that myself. The stress and anxiety from this semester has put me in a bad place mentally too. I'm not getting enjoyment out of games I play or shows I use to love. I've avoided hanging out with friends in order to not be asked about the semester, because I hate lying to them about everything going great when in reality it's the opposite. And I've honestly lost a lot of motivation to do anything besides eat and sleep, which I can barely do without being restless and only getting a couple hours sleep, even though I'm in bed for well over 10 hours a day. 

I guess to sum this all up, the advice i'm looking for is where should I/can I proceed from here? I'm going to finish this semester off since I already paid for it, but after that I'm jobless, and only have a Bachelor's in Psychology. At this point i'd love to just get some advice, regardless what it may be. Very few people know the extent of my life situation as whoever's reading this now, so you may be the people most informed to give me guidance. I'm sorry for writing so much, but I think this was for advice as much as it was for my own cathartic purpose of venting and finally telling someone the full story. "

She's going through a terrible time at her new job, and I need some advice.

She was hired as a social media manager around the same time as another hire ""B"" who is a graphic artist (first job out of college).

The director of that division is in her mid fifties and is also a graphic artist at her core. 

The dept doesn't do marketing for the core business, but handles things like the online store, or any consumer engagement projects the company decides to do.

In the beginning they were all a happy family, till after a couple months, my gf started focusing on her social media duties, and the director and B started doing graphic artist things (packaging, social media company templates, etc).

I am not sure of the reasoning, but the director has decided that B is her protege and basically put her in charge of projects that she has no ability to manage at this point in her career. 

The solo projects she attempts are failing to the point where the board and senior VP's are looking into some of the choices and are basically playing a waiting game to see if it all crumbles (the director literally lies to cover her ass).

My gf has been told recently by the director to do all the marketing and project planning (saying each time she'll be presenting it), only for both her and the graphic artist to have meetings without her with the senior staff where they present all the work as if it is theirs.

The director has placed B in charge of social media after B had endless meetings whining about wanting to lead that project as well, to where all the work my gf does has to be approved by her. 

B has attempted to run the social media without my gf, but the very lively and very negative customer responses to her attempts soured her of that idea.

So now she makes my gf practically have to beg her to approve things before she can move forward on anything, to the point where timely marketing efforts are wasted due to her refusing to respond to emails or take meetings to plan out strategy.

My gf heard through the grapevine that B has been going to the director constantly to shit on her work, and say how she could do it better etc. While she is being slowly frozen out of all duties, and told that B is now overseeing her to the point where she is now practically an intern. 

The only time she does any real work is when they need marketing plans/budgets/ideas for engagement that they then just outright change to put their names on it.

Luckily with all the social engagement tools around the place, my gf has endless reams of data showing the direct results of her ideas/plans as compared to that of B's, but since the Director is the only person who can restore balance, that information is practically useless.


She is job hunting, but she is such a ""come-togetherist"" that I think she hopes they will accept her as part of the their circle if she tries harder and is more passive and accommodating, though I cannot see how that's possible.

She wants to just tell them she quits and walk away from the job most days, and I hate her leaving feeling crushed and powerless.

I want her to get out from under the thumb of B, and sidestep the director, but I know that may not be possible.

She has tried having meetings with them, but they both tell her everything is perfect and smile, but then things get worse instead of better.

She and the other people hired around the same time have had little after work meetings, and she realised early on that she in not going crazy, and B is the terror of the entire dept, since she has the director's ear, and several people are thinking of leaving so as not to have to deal with her rudeness and stealing of ideas.

Any ideas on what to do ?

i just got out of a horrible experience in my internship. and i am at my wit's end to better integrate myself in the office mentality. 

i couldn't make colleagues work hand in hand with me because they deemed my position as useless and crappy. i am a csr manager. even if they are right about my job, they have to accomodate since it's company's politics.

i was blamed for not ""fitting in"" even though i was nice to everyone, offered food and candy every day for everyone around me, asked if i could help every single day even for other departments for small tasks.

and apparetly i bothered the single person who could help me throughout the internship with ""lots of chat messages"" (well it's an internship, and i needed lots of info to build the department from scratch, and only her could provide the data).

so now i am searching for a stable job. but i NEED to know what i can do to make colleagues collaborate in a peaceful manner. i felt throughout the internship that i gave a lot of myself with patience and understanding but it was always a one-way thing. nobody wanted to work and no ody wanted to meet halfway. i accept that that's life, but it's become somekind of a pattern with me: people always wanting to take more from me without giving back and then me ending up getting fucked and tossed aside.

so can you recommend any attitude/behaviour/step by step procedure to succeed in a competitive narcissistic office environment? i am honestly open to any link or author that can help me improve myself.

thank you."

So I've got several sheets that list materials needed to make sub-components of a larger component, as well as some other information (cost, material, weight, etc). I've been tasked with created another sheet in the same workbook that acts as a ""master"" list of all the parts needed for the entire component.

This master list will have to have SOME of the information columns in the sublists (i.e, the master list won't have to have information on the part material, but it will have to have information on the part cost). It also has to be able to dynamically update, so if I add a new row to sub-component A, it automatically gets inserted into the master list. It would also ideally update the information (e.g, if I update the cost in the master list for a part, it updates the cost in the sub-components sheet).

So - what's the best way for me to approach this? I'm just an intern who was given what is (to me) a gargantuan task, and I'm hoping that the experts here can lend some advice.

5g4e6p,163,2016-12-02,Qualities employers are looking for when hiring Interns,Amanlikeyou,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5g4e6p/qualities_employers_are_looking_for_when_hiring/,"Hey folks,

Sharing some beneficial advice for finding internships. 

The 5 Qualities

Employers have developed a specific interest in their interns, especially as students develop greater skills in their early years. Below are 5 Qualities Recruiters look for at Silicon Valley companies:

* A person who can generate ideas 

* Intellectually curious 

* Strives toward a goal and reaches it

* A person who understands themselves and what they want

* A good personality and a sense of humor 


Now What?

Let's understand what these 5 Qualities mean. Essentially, what the Recruiters are looking for is someone who can adapt and learn. You can be put into an entirely new situation and figure out a plan of attack. You might not have the solution down, but you are someone who keeps working at it. 

So how do you become such a person? You put yourself into these situations. Out of classroom involvement prepares you exactly for being in situations where you can learn and grow. That is, go out and join interesting clubs and organizations who may be doing work you feel is hard. Little by little, you will learn (this is the adapting part) and begin to generate ideas on your own. 

This involvement should transfer onto your Resume easily by creating a PROJECT EXPERIENCE and ACTIVITIES sections. Of course, simply listing your involvement won't help. You have to highlight your achievements, show how you reached the goals you set, and demonstrate your brainstorming capabilities. 

Most important is the last Quality, Personality and Sense of Humor. This comes through Networking and Meeting people. Networking is simply speaking with people about your goals and learning from them on how to reach your goals. These can be your classmates, professors, or recruiters from company at Info Sessions. Being genuine and showing an interest in the person alone will make you stand out.

I started [hubintern.com](https://www.hubintern.com) with the aim of helping students learn about finding internships. You can upload your resume and receive free feedback as well. "

5g4jzg,1,2016-12-02,How to find startups looking to hire interns?,CodeFnatic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5g4jzg/how_to_find_startups_looking_to_hire_interns/,"First off, I am a freshman CS major would start-ups even be interested in hiring me? 

Secondly, I have checked a lot of websites and haven't heard back from the ones that I applied too. I have some family that lives in Austin, TX (No I don't go to UT). If I don't find an internship how beneficial would be for me to spend a week in Austin looking for start-ups who are hiring? The church which my family attends has lots of software engineers who work at companies such as Apple,Google,Microsoft, etc. in the Austin area and I would be able to talk with them and ask them if know of anyone who is hiring. So essentially two questions: as a software engineer do you keep up with start-ups in your area? Is it too late in mid-May to be searching for an internship with a start-up? 

The reason this is an issue is because if I don't have an internship I want to take a mini-mester at my local community college and the dates for that are right after my spring semester is finished. My job that I would be working at during summer would then start after the mini-mester. I want to be able to work and do side projects after my mini-mester if I am unable to get an internship."

I am from Germany, I study Computer Science and I am in my last year at my university. Next year (in March) all students have to do an internship at a company for three months (and after that we have to write our thesis and get our Bachelor's degree).

So, right now I am looking for the right company. But I don't exactly where I should looking.

Things I like (no specific order):

- Mathematics
- Statistics, R
- Image Processing
- Computer Vision
- OpenCV, OpenGL/WebGL
- Maschine Learning (Artificial neural network etc.), although I never done something like that, but I think I would like that
- Visualization of Data, Maps, Geography
- Languages: Python, C/C++

Maybe you could give me tipps how to quickly know if a company do things I listed above or not. Maybe there are hints in the company name or something like that.

Also can you tell me how you would call the field, that I like.

5g5p4x,4,2016-12-02,"My First Post: Bad Student with Good Grades, Self-Medicating and (Eventual) Diagnosis",ArthurStirling,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5g5p4x/my_first_post_bad_student_with_good_grades/,"I am sharing my ADHD story in hopes that it will help those struggling with ADHD or considering treatment for ADHD whose lives do not fit the typical ADHD narrative.

Childhood: For some reason, my parents kept all of my report cards from Kindergarten through the end of high school. I reviewed them a few months ago in preparation for my first visit to a psychiatrist. From an early age, I received high grades. However, my instructor commentary usually said something along the lines of ""works below potential,"" ""disruptive to other students,"" or ""does not complete work on time."" I got good grades, but I was far from a good student. I frequently forgot my homework, permission slips for field trips and the dates of exams. I managed to get by in school because I was smart, but I often felt guilty and upset because I was lazy, unmotivated and constantly working below my potential. 

College and Law School: College was the first time I really needed to study in order to pass my classes. I quickly realized that I was terrible at it. I took tons of energy, and I had to constantly move around between different libraries, dorms and coffees to stay focused. It was like after half an hour in a certain room, I had burned off all of the energy there and had to go some place different to renew my focus. My classmates and friends were jealous of me because I could, in their minds, do 8 hours of work in 2 hours. I was always jealous of them because 2 hours of studying was as much as I could do. After 2 hours of studying (divided between the library, my apartment, a coffee shop and a park bench) I felt exhausted. My brain couldn't handle anything else and I felt like I had just studied for 24 hours straight. I turned down executive positions in campus clubs and internships with my favorite professors because I didn't think I could handle that responsibility on top of my school work. I was afraid of disappointing people who I respected and did not want to risk losing a substantial scholarship. 

Self-Medicating: This is the part that I really wanted to share. Everything else is just for context. One thing I've always prided myself on is my ability to recognize patterns and solve problems. Throughout school, my problem was figuring out a way to fit 8 hours worth of studying into the 2 hours of focused attention that I had. The solutions I came up with through trial and error were many of the solutions that other redditors have suggested. For example, I had a roommate who loved to exercise. I can't stand working out, but I noticed that when I worked out, I had a little bit more energy to study. So I started exercising more regularly. Once I was ""studying"" while my then girlfriend was putting together signs for a sorority event. She had a bunch of markers and posters, and I had forgotten to bring pens and paper to study. So, I asked if I could take notes on here poster paper. That day I learned that it was easier to memorize things I wrote down in bright colors on big posters. So I started taking notes that way all the time. Those were the solutions I'm proud of. Now here's the solution I'm not proud of. 

One day, while I was sleeping in the library, some guy tapped me on the shoulder and woke me up. He said, ""I see you in here all the time, you always pass out ten minutes into studying."" He then offered to sell me Adderall, claiming that it would help keep me awake. At this point I was going to a competitive law school and it was no secret that lots of students were taking Adderall and similar drugs to maintain their grades. I rejected his offer. Not so much because of any moral reasons, but because at that point in my life, the last thing I wanted was less sleep. Instead I went to CVS and bought Unisom, Zzzquil, Sominex, Melatonin and Tryptophan. I starting at least one of those medications every night because I thought if I got more sleep at night, I wouldn't be so tired during the day. This actually worked, and the only side effect was feeling like a zombie for half the time you're awake.

When I graduated, I stopped taking sleeping pills. It took several months and many sleepless nights before I could truly say I didn't want or need them.

Diagnosis: You're probably wondering why, after all of this, I did not talk to a doctor about my concentration issues. The answer is, I never thought there was anything wrong with me. I had good grades, I had friends, I managed to hold down jobs. I knew that my brain processed information differently than the people around me, but I never thought that process was worse. I've always compared my brain to an overclocked computer. It can process things faster than most other people's brains, but that speed comes at a price. I get burned out faster. I need more breaks. But people overclock their computers all the time.

I finally decided to see a doctor two years into my career. Work is different from school. I can't cram. It's impossible to do all of my work in 3 hours. People depend on me. I have a lot of responsibility. I always hoped that things would get better when I finished school. Then I finished school. Then I hoped things would get better once I got used to my job, but that didn't happen either. All of those traits that made school difficult were making my job impossible. Finally, at the suggestion of my girlfriend (a therapist) and a close friend (a lawyer who has ADHD), I made an appointment with a psychiatrist and started treating two months ago.

TL;DR: 1. Not every kid with ADHD has bad grades. 2. ADHD makes some tasks harder, but it makes others much easier. It's a trade off. 3. And this is important, see a doctor before you start taking any kind of medicine to treat attention issues."

After hearing these stories, I just felt upset about myself, because I was way far behind these people. I doubt I could ever catch up with them given that I usually struggle to learn programming and there is still tons of stuff for me to learn.

5g6ywc,6,2016-12-02,New job isn't working out. Should I leave it off my resume?,Kairi212,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5g6ywc/new_job_isnt_working_out_should_i_leave_it_off_my/,"Hi all. I started a new job a month ago. However, it isn't working out. I am not a good fit for the organization and much less the position I was hired for. This is a job in a new field and the more time I spend in it, the more I realize it isn't for me. Thus, I am on the job hunt again. 

This is my first ""real"" job, as my previous positions were internships or part time jobs in college. Because this was my first “real”  job offer and only had two days to accept the offer before it was rescinded, I jumped the gun and accepted it immediately. I cancelled other interviews I had because I already accepted this job.

However, I'm not liking this job at all. At my old job, I used to look forward to coming in to work every day. Now, I dread coming to work and now I impatiently look at the clock, waiting to go home. I'm even counting down the days until it is acceptable to leave this position. This is the first time I feel this way towards a job. I’ve never experienced this with any other job, even my full time internships. 

I feel like I'm not being useful here. I feel like the work is so dry and rote. I feel as if I'm wasting my skills, knowledge, and brainpower as I am not really using my brain in this position. Although the pay and benefits are good, I'm miserable and bored here. I feel as if I won't do a good job and my performance will be mediocre because I'm not interested in the work at all. 

I have already caught myself looking for new job posts in my downtime. Although I've told myself to stick it out for at least a year since the pay and benefits are good and it looks bad to leave a job after so little, I feel like I can't hold out that long. I also feel like it will be harder to switch into a different field If I wait too long. So, I've decided to start applying to jobs again. This time, I will be more patient, will think things thoroughly and won't jump the gun as I already have a steady source of income. 

Now that I've provided some context, I would like to know if I should leave my current position off my resume when applying for jobs since I've only worked there for a month. Or should I include it? Will it help me or hurt me when negotiating the job and/or salary?

Many thanks!"

5g7yrw,40,2016-12-02,Dead bodies don't scare me.,AutopsyBarbie,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5g7yrw/dead_bodies_dont_scare_me/,"When deciding to pursue a medical education, most people envision themselves stitching up huge lacerations, performing CPR, or otherwise saving lives dramatically and on a daily basis. I was no exception to this notion. So naturally, I wound up with a specialty that lead me to a job where I work almost exclusively with dead people. This wasn't my original plan, but my residency was coming to an end, and I needed to haul ass out of Arizona. I wasn't particular about my specialty, really; I worked so hard for so long, and burned myself out between my personal and professional lives. Ultimately I resigned myself to take whatever was furthest away. I'll spare the sob story for now.

Long story short, I procrastinated in applying, and ended up with very few options. Oncology, cardio, OB, and anything else I was genuinely interested in was out of the question. One of my attendings who knew my situation offered to help me find a spot at a decent sister hospital in Michigan's upper peninsula. The only fellowship opening they still hadn't filled there was in forensic pathology, so I took it as a sign. Honestly, I was just relieved to have one less decision to make in my life. So, by the recommendation of my attending - bless his heart - I was selected for the fellowship, and when my residency was over I made the 2,000-mile drive with everything I owned crammed into my shitty '97 Camaro. Honestly, I'm not really sure how that tin can made it that far without exploding; my check engine light was on, and the car was making some really unsettling noises. I know a lot about a lot of things, but I don't know a goddamn thing about cars.

So that's the Cliffnotes version of how I ended up performing autopsies for a living. I actually enjoy it more than I thought I would. I get a lot of peace and quiet because nobody wants to come down to the morgue to bother me. Even my office is in the basement, so the only time anyone ever comes by is when they truly need something. It's for that reason that I found it extremely odd when I entered my office after my last autopsy of the day and found a flyer on my desk. I slid my glasses from on the top of my head onto my nose, brow furrowed as I skimmed the page. It was announcing some sort of scavenger hunt. I figured it was one of those events from the Pedes floor and someone had made their intern bring me one as a sort of mild hazing; my neck of the woods freaks brand new med students out. I crumpled the paper up, tossed it into the bin without looking, and plopped into my chair. I felt extremely ready to go home, but I needed to file my reports away and respond to a few emails. A cold cup of coffee sat on the corner of the old, rusty desk. The old, rusty matching filing cabinet drawer made a god-awful screeching as I tugged it open and began sorting paperwork. There wasn't much to be done to brighten the space up; cheesy motivational posters and cheerful Scentsy smells somehow make the must and dust of the place even more depressing.

My eyes flicked open and I peeled my face off of the metal surface of the desk, wondering what time it was. I glanced down at my right wrist.. 3:00? 3AM? Or PM? I snatched my cell phone up and hit the home button, feeling an instant wave of relief. It was only 6:30, I hadn't even been asleep for half an hour. My watch must've stopped. I tapped the glass, tried winding it, but couldn't get it started again, so I undid the leather strap and put the watch away in the top drawer of my desk with a bunch of paperclips and writing utensils. Despite having work left to do, I figured there was no point in staying and trying to finish it all if I was just going to fall asleep. May as well sleep in my own bed. I tucked the paperwork away in the cabinet and locked it, then gathered my things into my bag. After pulling my coat on, I grabbed the bag, slung it over my shoulder, flipped the light switch, and stepped out, locking the door behind me.

The walk to the parking garage and the drive home were both wholly uneventful. The snow was really coming down, making me thankful I had gotten rid of the bobsled-deathtrap that was my Camaro in favor of something with heat, all-wheel drive, and reliable brakes. With the weather, it took 20 minutes to get back to my second floor apartment. The building was really old and rickety, but it didn't really bother me any. I'm from northern Illinois, and cold and sub-standard living conditions are kind of a part of who I am at this point. You may be wondering ""but OP, if you're a doctor, why does your apartment suck?"" Well, lads and lasses, my poor life choices led me to spend an extra year and a half working on my undergrad degree fixing my GPA. I just want to pay my debt off as fast as I can; that interest is already piling up.

I wasn't even home for 45 minutes before my phone rang. The number was from a line in the hospital, so I picked up.

""This is Sarah Smith,"" I answered, trying not to rustle the family size bag of Cheetos I'd just sat down with.

""Hey, Dr. Smith, it's Kevin Fuller from Records,"" the voice said.

""Hi Kevin. Is something the matter? It's kind of late."" I wasn't really being inconvenienced in any way, but I was kind of looking forward to binge-watching the rest of House of Cards on Netflix, and I don't exactly love talking on the phone.

""Yeah, actually... Well, the thing is... The reason I'm calling is because no one else was around and we didn't know what to do, but one of the custodians was wondering why you left your exam room open. All of the lights are on, the door was unlocked, and..."" - He cleared his throat - ""well, we were wondering if you were okay. I mean, it looks like you just left in the middle of something.""

I was quiet for a moment, my brows knit together. What the fuck was he talking about? ""I'm really not sure what you're referring to,"" I said slowly. ""When I left, I turned the lights off and locked up, then went over to my office."" I hadn't checked the morgue on the way out to the garage, but why would I? There are only two other people in the hospital who would even have a key: the head of the department, and the custodian. I really didn't see my department head coming in and fucking around with my work.

""I really think you ought to come see this. I know you say you didn't leave it this way, but if you don't come I'm going to have to call Dr. Nelson in. I'm just a paperwork guy, I'm not even supposed to be in here but Carla didn't know what to do."" Doctor Andrew Nelson is my boss, and he's a son of a bitch. He replaced the doctor who hired me, and he's had some sort of issue with me since he started working there. I really didn't need him in my morgue or asking questions.

I heaved a sigh. ""Okay, Kevin, I'm on my way. Just stay there with Carla until I get there, please.""

""Oh... Okay,"" he muttered, sounding unsure. I hung up, tossing the snack bag aside. Something about the tone of his voice made me uneasy. I don't know why the lights were on or why the door was open, but I know I didn't leave a mess... Then it clicked. I swore out loud, jumping to my feet. My wool throw blanket fell to the floor and my fat tabby cat darted from under the sofa into the kitchen. I had had a stack of papers sitting out that needed to be sorted into the patients' files, and I had been meaning to put them all into the binders before I went home. I forgot to bring them into the office with me, so they had been left unbound in a pile. Somebody must have come through and knocked them over... It was going to take forever to sort them back out.

I drove back to the hospital as fast as I safely could and found who I assumed to be Kevin Fuller standing outside of the morgue. He was a tall, lanky guy, maybe a couple years younger than me, or maybe he just looked young. I look young; too young to be a doctor, even though I graduated two years older than most people do. He was nervously running his hands through his hair. Coming down the hallway, I could see the door to the morgue was ajar, and the lights were on. Kevin was looking the other way, and I guess was too deep in his own thoughts to hear my footsteps echoing in the empty hallway.

""Kevin?"" I asked, stopping a few feet short of the door. He jumped slightly, whipping around to face me.  ""Are you Kevin Fuller?"" I asked impatiently, picturing my work scattered across the floor.

""Oh, are you Dr. Smith?"" He exhaled audibly, his cheeks puffing out as he laced his hands behind his head.

""Yeah, please tell me no one tried to reorganize that paperwork, there's sensitive patient information and-""

He held up a hand to silence me. I tried to start talking again but this time he actually shushed me. ""It's not... Just look."" He gestured toward the door. I struggled not to roll my eyes as I pushed past him into the morgue. He stepped aside and did not follow me; he just stayed facing away from the room, his hands on his head and eyes forward.

I froze, my breath catching as my eyes came to rest on an open human cadaver. He was one of mine from earlier in the day, though I was absolutely sure I hadn't left him sitting out on the table, and I had closed after my exam. What was he doing there? Who had dragged him out? I approached the table slowly, a sense of deep dread creeping into my chest and down my spine. Even in the context of random bodies reappearing on the slab, something was clearly very, very wrong. The Y-incision I had made and stitched closed earlier had been not cut, but torn open. The skin around the sutures was mangled, hanging like fringe on a leather jacket. The ribcage of the elderly man was crushed. Pieces of bone stuck into the diaphram, and pierced the lungs. I struggled to process what I was seeing. Kevin Fuller must have gotten freaked out because it had been quiet for so long, because I heard the door squeak open behind me.

""Where is it?"" I asked. I turned and lifted my eyes to meet Kevin's gaze. ""I performed an autopsy on this body earlier today. This damage is all new, everything was intact when I did the exam. It was an MI that killed him, not injuries like this."" I put my face as close as I dared and continued to visually search the chest. It seemed everything in the lower abdomen - the stomach, liver, kidneys, intestines - had been left undisturbed.

Kevin shifted uncomfortably, crossing his arms in a tense manner. ""An MI? Isn't that a heart attack?"" His voice was anxious and a little pitchy, but still betrayed a hint of interest. He seemed torn between a desire to know more, and a desire to know not a damn thing.

I nodded, not looking up. ""Yeah. Except it isn't here. The heart isn't in the body anymore, or if it is I can't see it."" I knew better than to touch anything, and with the way things were skewered with the bones, I felt pretty sure it was gone. ""So,"" I said, ""we need to call the police.""

That was two weeks ago now. The police investigated, and although they didn't find out who destroyed the body or how they got into the morgue in the first place, they seemed to chalk it up to a petty act of vandalism and drop it. I can't say I blame them, they have enough on their plates with actual murders of living people. I was put on leave during the investigation, but I'm going back on Monday. The cops might not care, but I think it's going to eat at me until I find out who did it and why, and what happened to the damn heart. Hopefully something turns up soon."

I don't know much about javascript, so I was hoping someone could help me pick a javascript project I could create that is suitable for beginners/intermediate, yet still impressive. My only current resume level project is a iOS app made with Xcode swift that isn't too complex (took one month to make), and I was hoping for something around this level of difficulty. I definitely want something that can be published, so that I can play with it and have other people download or open it easily and use it as well. Preferably not just ""published on github"".

5ga2qw,9,2016-12-03,Hey reddit! How do I tell my boss that I don't want to work here after I finish my course?,lunarbeaversarecute,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5ga2qw/hey_reddit_how_do_i_tell_my_boss_that_i_dont_want/,"I'm 21 and I'm going to finish my course between November and December of 2017. 

My course has 3 internships (one for each year), I'm currently in my second internship in a small company - let's call them company123. 

My first internship in company123 was between February to April, I was mostly doing backoffice/frontoffice stuff. I think it's also important to mention that this company work with international relationships and tourism and I'm the only one (we are 4) that has actually studied this. My other three coworkers are only working here because they are friends with my boss and none of them is qualified to work here in my opinion.
I know I sound really bitchy but just to give you an example:
 
- we receive a lot of English clients and they can't speak a word of english and they also have no idea how to talk to clients/potential clients, they can even be really rude and immature sometimes which scares clients away. 

Since I worked mostly backoffice and wasn't in contact with my coworkers all was okay! The best part about working at company123 was that my boss was paying me (under the table)!! It was like freelancing but I don't have to deal with taxes and I'm doing it while finishing my course. 

I was in the clouds but of course... nothings lasts forever. 

I'm currently in my second internship which is from November to March and one of my coworkers (boss's best friend) decided that he wanted to pursue his dream of being a carpenter but wanted to continue working here so my boss just like that gave him 3 days of break each week. 

Since my coworker decided to follow his dreams, I am not only doing backoffice/frontoffice work which means that I'm the one that designs all the advertisement, I'm the one in charge of contacting our clients and our partners, I'm the one communicating with clients and dealing with their problem, I'm the one dealing with social media, I'm the one organising everything but now, I also have to do my coworker's job which is maintenance of our products and driving our clients from point a to point c, oh and we also have a small gift shop inside our shop so I also have to take care of that. 

It's just too much for me and I'm miserable, even though I'm getting paid... I'm not happy and I also don't see this company lasting more than 5 years (but that's another can of worms...). 

I decided that I'm going to tolerate this until the end of my internship because I don't want to delay my internship (if I were to switch it could take weeks) but I don't want to do my third and final internship here and I don't want to work here after my course is over (my boss made the offer in the first internship and I immediately said yes ugh). 

How do I tell him that I don't want to work here without burning any bridges (he's not very reasonable btw) I want to put the time that I've been interning here in my resumé but I'm afraid future employers will contact my current boss and he'll bad talk me (he's capable of doing it because I've seen him do it to others...) 

I'm sorry if this is all too much, I'm very nervous and I just needed to somewhat get this off my chest! "

Many of us have come very close to killing ourselves, only to be stopped by some profound sense of ""hope"". That maybe, in a few years, things could get better. Hell, things could be good!** 

Imagine waking up next to the love of your life, jumping out of bed, putting on the coffee, and getting ready for another exciting day at work! Things are busy in the office, but that is good; you love being busy! Plus, you know that some promotions are likely just around the corner! And, most of all, the busier you are, the less time you have to sit around and think. Because bad things happen when you sit around and think. Bad things like... well, never mind that; it's time to go, or you'll be late!

You kiss your love goodbye as (s)he heads upstairs to help your beautiful children prepare for another day at school. Damn, they're so smart! Smarter than you could ever be. And your love is so beautiful; how did you get so lucky?

You open the front door to walk out to the car. It's a brisk morning. Brisk mornings were few and far between in your old town, but that's ok, you like the cold! Besides, you can never move back to you old town. *Never.* Too many... bad memories... But, oh! Look at the time! You quickly scrape the ice off of your windshield and happily pull out of your driveway.

Traffic is a mess, but that's ok! It always is, so you give yourself an extra half hour to get to work everyday. It's nice, actually! You sit in the car with the heat cranked up, listening to your favorite morning Podcast while sipping that new organic coffee your friend got you hooked on. Mornings are nice. Life is nice.

You finally arrive to work. Right on time, which for you, is fifteen minutes early! You say hello to your boss, and he greets you back with a hefty stack of paperwork, due by lunch. That's ok, you understand that all of this hard work is for the greater good! You head to your cubicle, the one that's strategically placed not too far from the bathroom and not to close to the air vent, and get to work! Working is fun for you; you put on your headphones, turn on that same podcast you didn't have time to finish in the car, and get to working! Sure, it's mostly busywork. The same busywork that the twenty-one year old intern gets stuck with. But, what can you say? College was rough; it wasn't your fault! You had a disease. Things were... well, never mind that; there's too much work to be done to think about that!

As the clock slowly continues to gain hours, that stack of paper slowly continues to lose height! You're doing things as fast as you can, when suddenly;

*""Hey, Don't_Want_2_Die_Yet, it's two o'clock; have you finished those files yet?""*

You look at the stack. You've been working all day, and hadn't even realized how late it had gotten. You never even break for lunch; you were working so hard! But, does your hard work ever pay-off?

""No? You haven't? Well, that's ok I guess. That was *a lot* to expect out of you. Here, I'll give the rest of them to the intern to finish up. He's such a hard worker! And smart as the Dickens, too.""

*What you would give to be the twenty-one year old intern! Oh, what you would give for another chance at a beautiful life. A reset button, so to speak. Everything could be so nice.*

The boss gives you an odd look. You can't tell if it's a patronizing look, or a look of pity, but nonetheless, it evokes some gross feelings. Those same feelings that ultimately led you to this job situation in the first place. Those same feeli-

""Hey, you ok? You look tired?"" Says the boss. ""Do you need to take the afternoon off? I've worked you half to death already; why don't you take off? It's Friday anyways, and have you even had lunch yet? I'll see you Monday!""

You *have* been worked ""half to death"", you think to yourself. Why are you always so tired? Maybe it's the office coffee; it's so much more bitter than that organic stuff your friend got you into. You wonder to yourself ""what my friend is up to today."" Wait; isn't he off from work on Fridays? Oh, yeah, he is! Perhaps you can spend some time with your friend!

You call your friend up, and you both decide to go catch a movie. It's a good movie; an action movie with one of those genius top secret agents as a star. You've always been able to relate to those kinds of characters. You're pretty smart yourself. You have a wide array of interests. You're honestly not in that bad of shape. Surely you could be *just like* one of these badass agents if you weren't always just so- well, never mind, the movie is starting!

After the movie ends, you leave the theatre, chatting with your friend about how great the special effects were. Technology has come so far in the past few years! It's amazing!

You say your goodbyes to your friend, and then head to the car with a smile on your face. It's Friday night, and, oh yeah, you and your family always order pizza and play games together on Friday nights! Time to head home; you don't want to be late for this again!

When you get home, the sun has already long been set. You notice that a bit of ice has already started to form on the driveway again. It's going to be cold tonight, that's for sure!

You open the front door to your house, and are greeted by the embrace of warm air and the aroma of pizza (guess that your significant other already decided to go ahead and order the pizza; no worries)! It's so nice! Everything is so nice!

""Hi, honey!"" your significant other says as you walk into the kitchen. ""Want some pizza? We're playing 'Life' in the den. We're about halfway done, so you can just watch if you want and join the next game. Or, you can take my spot, though I wouldn't recommend it!""

You smile, grab a couple slices of cheese pizza (you're vegetarian, after all) and head into the den to spend a warm evening with the family. Everything is just so wonderful.

""Ah, I see you're winning again!"" you say to one of your children. ""And, of course- wait, where is-""

""Oh, yes, that child got in trouble again at school today. He's in his room"" says your significant other.

""Oh- I, I suppose I ought to go talk to him"" you murmur, then head upstairs.

You knock on the door, and then, after no response, you reluctantly open it and walk in. Your child is sitting on the bed, looking at you with brilliant eyes. He looks so much like you. He acts so much like you. How could a kid *so smart* be so troubled? 

After talking with him for a bit, you discover that he skipped class, yet again. His reasoning is that school is meaningless at this point; he's sixteen, and he already knows all of the basic fundamentals of secondary education. In fact, he's taken so many AP classes that he's technically already a sophomore in college! But, as he explains to you for the up-teenth time, he *doesnt want* to go to college. He wants to be a musician. A singer-songwriter, to be specific. And, he genuinely could be. He's very talented, and has already begun this career, managing to garner a small fan base around town and on social media sites.

But, deep down, you know that the odds of him ever making it are very low. Even with his incredible talent. Even if he *did* make it one day, that would obviously be no excuse to give up on school at the present. You try and explain this to him. To help him hear the voice of reason. He nods his head as if he agrees, but you know damn well that he's not listening, but rather, he's off in his own little world. He's left this reality for another, just like you did so many years ago...

As you stand up to head out of the room, you say ""I love you,"" to your child. He looks up at you, thinks for a second, and then says;

""Are you happy?""

You are caught off guard by this question. ""Am I happy?"" you think to yourself.

*""Well, of course I'm happy!""* you explain to your son. You then head back downstairs to be with the rest of the family, still a little shaken by that peculiar question.

""Is he ok?"" your significant other questions, curious about how the conversation went.

""Yes, yes I believe so,"" you lie.

The fireplace is so warm. You sit in your big armchair, and just watch your beautiful family play games for the next half hour or so...

.

.

.


...After a while, the fire slowly begins to die down. Things aren't as warm anymore, but no worries! You take a generous shot of whiskey to warm yourself back up. Your family is so beautiful. Everything is so nice. Everything is so nice.

Your eyes begin to get very heavy. You feel so contempt in that big, fluffy armchair of yours, just sitting back and watching your beautiful family as you slowly drift off to sleep. Everything is just so nice. So nice. So nice....

I spend a lot of time doing school stuff and programming on the side (algorithms, side projects, etc), but this is taking it's toll on me.

The biggest problem is that I can't relax, not truly. For example, watching TV shows or gaming used to relax me a lot when I was in high school. I could just go to school, come home, do some homework and then do whatever I wanted afterwards. Now, however, I feel 'guilty' about relaxing. I know it sounds weird, but even if I've spent a lot of time studying, I'll have thoughts like ""While I'm playing games here, somebody out there is studying and they will get into prestigious companies while I wont"". I also have this fear that I will fail the ""implicit test"" when I graduate. What I mean by that is I wont have a good enough resume ( internships, projects ) and knowledge (algorithms, coding, design) to get a good start, which would in turn basically bury my career.

Anyways, I guess what I'm asking is, how do I deal with this? How do I stop thinking about it? What do you do to relieve stress ( mostly question for other students )."

Any advice for a new graduate? I feel like I'm a decent coder but I probably wouldn't ace a google programming interview. It seems like the CS degree focused on a lot of math/logic courses with other courses that assigned short programming assignments. Basically, I feel like I've been introduced to a lot of languages and have some familiarity with them. I'm looking forward to being able to focus my time and energy into a single project rather than bouncing around short term assignments in different classes. 

Any advice on how to find a decent programming job that's willing to offer some training for fresh grads? Are internships better for offering beginning experience or do some companies expect to train their entry level hirees?"

5gbqau,3,2016-12-03,Is a career in CS fulfilling?,guayaquilguava,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5gbqau/is_a_career_in_cs_fulfilling/,"**TL;DR at the bottom** 

A bit of background: I was in college this fall, but I dropped out due to depression. I was studying CivE and I hated all my classes and the school itself. Parents and society pressured me to study engineering, and I've been questioning whether or not it's the best path for me for the past few months. 

Before starting college, I thought I wanted to study CS (I took a Java class in high school and did some Python self-study, I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect a lot) but that changed when I did a web-development internship. I didn't like sitting at a desk for hours on end, I found the process of writing, testing, and revising code to be annoyingly tedious, and the lack of socialization really affected me; I'm introverted, but I still felt very alone. 

This was what made me study CivE, but I realized that the idea of working as a civil engineer made me feel more hopeless than that of working as a software engineer. I'm not a science person by any means; that's what initially drew me to CS. I also have a tendency to idealize things, and I think I idealized what it meant to be a software developer. I *wanted* that to be my job, because it's what all the smart kids are doing. I *wanted* to have the title of engineer on my resume, and I *wanted* the high pay, not for the money, but so that people knew that I made a lot of money. I *wanted* the comfortable office environment, I *wanted* to be surrounded by smart people. I wanted people to think that I was smart, and I still do; I've realized that it's one of my greatest insecurities. And now that I'm questioning my decision to study CS, it's tearing me apart.

When I dropped out and got back home, I thought ""Finally, I'll have time to do those CS Coursera classes I've always wanted to do!"" After a few days I was done. It just doesn't excite me anymore. I was never the person to write code in my spare time. I never created a GitHub account until my internship. I never built any programs other than the ones I needed to do for my high school class. Obviously, a lot of people don't do any of this either, at least not until they get to college. But I, knowing that I have the opportunities to do so, have zero motivation to try. 

I will be starting at a new college this spring, and while my intention was to study CS, I think I will try business. Almost every day since dropping out has consisted of me spending a good hour thinking, ""I'm smart enough to study CS. My parents want me to study it. Even though I didn't like my internship, maybe I can learn to enjoy the job. Maybe making all that money will make me happy. Maybe happiness is getting a job you can tolerate, and spending your free time doing the things that you love."" I've been watching a lot of TED Talks lately, and many of them say, ""No. You can't tolerate your job and be happy with it."" I watched Steve Job's commencement speech at Stanford, and he said ""Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle."" At this moment I don't know anyone who truly loves their job; everyone I know just seems to tolerate it.

Nonetheless, those words really stuck with me. It's been extremely difficult for me to accept that a career in CS may not make me happy, because I know that I'll never know the answer unless I try. My biggest fear is ending up with a job in business that I don't enjoy, or not having a job at all, and wishing that I would've studied CS instead. 

Which has led me to think, is that just the way things are? Is anyone really happy with their jobs? Or do they just stick around because they make a lot of money and are only really happy when they're out of the office?  

I don't think that a career in CS will make me happy. I want to lead, manage, and communicate; it's what I do best. Business (as a major) seems interesting, but I still have no idea what I'd want to do with it, and it's making me wonder if I should even go to college, considering that I have absolutely no set path. 

I think I've rambled for far too long. 

TL;DR: I guess my questions are, do you find your career in CS to be fulfilling? Is it what you see yourself as doing for the rest of your working life? What advice could you give me to find my ""path"", whether or not it's in CS? How can I get rid of the societal, parental, and personal expectations that are holding me back?"

Am I crazy?",throwaway12032016,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5gbss0/graduated_from_a_top_10_program_with_a_high_gpa/,"Background: graduated with honors from a top 10 school last May. High GPA (&gt;3.8). Majored in CS and studied AI/NLP as a concentration. Did a good amount of ""research"" (read: grunt work for PhD students), but no internships. Still unemployed.

Everything I read on here indicates that a degree from a top school is a huge advantage. Roughly half of the CS majors I graduated with are making 6 figures right off the bat. All my friends and family expect me to be able to do the same, especially because I was a diligent student. But I don't feel skilled at all. Even the shitty, low-paying, ""entry level"" developer jobs on Indeed intimidate me and always seem to reference a slew of technologies/frameworks/concepts/practices that I've never heard of or only vaguely understand. I learned everything that I needed to do well in my classes and thought that would be worth something in the real world. I guess not?

The cynic in me says that top schools are an advantage because programmers with ambitious career aspirations gather there and network and support each other, and the educational component doesn't actually vary that much from school to school. I was kind of a socially anxious shut-in, so I didn't retain much of a network. Is my degree therefore worthless? 

I'm thinking seriously about totally giving up on becoming a developer. At this point I associate programming with drudgery, rejection, academic pressure, self-flagellation, and feelings of inadequacy, so fuck it, right? On the other hand, I need income soon to avoid starvation, and when I browse Craigslist job postings in my area and consider how I would fare as an administrative assistant or dishwasher or landscaping hand, I think to myself: this is insane. Look at my credentials. Look at my peers. There is no way I'm as worthless and I think I am. 

What do I do? Am I underselling myself? Should I focus on learning some specialized skill like mobile development so I can freelance or something? If I were to jump ship on software development, what are some good places to jump to?"

Background 
Moved to Can when I was about 14 with my parents and have been here since (so a Canadian citizen). I am currently in my last year of university (a reputed one to say the least) pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Commerce. I also have 1.5 years of work experience as a developer where I did actual work unlike most other intern stories I have heard.

Ever since I have been here all I have thought about is moving back because this country just isn't in sync with me. Believe me I have tried fitting in but just can't. I have been through 4 year of depression which was only cured after I met people from India and Pak in my Uni 4 years ago. Now that my post secondary is coming to an end I am having anxiety about staying in this country. A lot of my friends are still going to be here but I still feel like I should at least give living in India a shot. The main reason in my head for this move would be people, people, people. Don't get me wrong people in Canada are great but may be it is just me that I haven't found many people who are in the same frequency as me. Day in day out I am so freaking frustrated, I don't know how to explain it. 

I still have a house in Mumbai to go back to, my grand father is still there running my dad's business (not at full capacity obviously).

I need some serious concerns addressed.

1) There are a lot of people complaining about how the professors are very hands off and hard to contact. How true is this?

2) Lots of people saying ""X Class is a joke"". I get maybe CS 352 (UI/UX) is a joke, that's fine. But if half of you guys think so many classes are a ""joke"" I am worried that recruiters are going to think so too.

3) Do you think that 12 credits per quarter is too much combined with a part time job, or leaves very little time for personal projects or hanging out with friends?

4) Is anyone here getting legit internships with big companies? Are recruiters respecting the ""online"" degree, or do you find yourself fighting against the stigma that online degrees are junk?

5) Do you feel this program is a ripoff? Do you truly feel like you have learned a lot of useful stuff?

6) Do you feel that the school has listened to your concerns, and has made an effort to update in-demand skills or course structures?

Thank you guys for your time. I really appreciate this subreddit. It's going to be important to keep this subreddit active and friendly as a support system as we go through this online experience together."

I'm a fresher, with a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering, from a mediocre college. 8/10 cgpa. 1 internship at a startup. Built a couple of Android apps, as part of the coursework and otherwise. Completed a few MOOCs. 

Nothing boastworthy: well read, informed on current affairs &amp; pop culture, follow s/w tech closely 

Plusses: have a very good eye for detail &amp; design, catch on quick, always willing to learn new skills related to things I love and things I might like/enjoy, incredibly optimistic (generally) 

Minuses: lack extensive hands-on experience with coding

Tech stack: Java, some python, C#/.NET (mostly college projects), Android Studio, a good understanding of the oops ideologies, some HTML/CSS - moderately proficient in all 

Problem - Need advice/help finding a good development job in Chennai/Bangalore/Gurgaon

What I have already done - Applied to more than a few companies, but have received no response. I have uploaded my profile to various job portals like Monster, TimesJobs, Naukri, etc (I am genuinely appalled at how inefficient &amp; incompetent they are). I have also tried to speak with a few people who have contacts within a certain company, or are working there themselves, and there have been a few leads but unfortunately, nothing has come to fruition. Failed to pass an interview at Zoho. 

So, my question is - 

What am I doing wrong? What more do I need to do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

For any redditors that might be interested themselves, or know of any available opportunities/openings, please feel free to PM me. Regardless, any help or advice would be immensely appreciated. I will answer any (follow-up)/questions you might have.

I was told I can partner with other Cisco interns to bring the cost down, but the NCH Cisco URL notes that it's $1717 for four people sharing two bedrooms. I'm not trying to be picky as I know I'm just starting out, but if I'm sharing a place I would rather it be a two bedroom, two bath shared between two people.

Currently a second year in Computer Eng and starting to look for internships for the summer or Fall if i can't find one in the summer.  Finished my first year on academic probation because of laziness and currently building up my GPA but it still isn't close to good enough to be proud of it and i don't expect it to get me a job so I figured I should focus more on all the projects I've worked on both personal and in school clubs as i'm VERY involved and have a very solid foundation of hands-on skills for a second-year.I consider my self more on the electrical side of Comp Eng than the software side but I'm still very competent in C++ and wouldn't mind doing a software job.
        

I figured I would put together a portfolio type of thing comprised of all the work I've done (mech drawings for parts I've had machined, schematics for PCB's...) but I'm not really sure about how to go about doing it.  My current idea is to setup a website and at the end of my ""relevant experience"" section on my CV put a note with the URL to the website but I'm not sure whether employers would even bother visiting it.  I'm also not sure to what I should include, just include anything that has my name on it or anything I've worked on as most of my drawings were part of bigger machines and assemblies and many had my ideas used even if I wasn't the main contributor who got their name on the part.  I could also include drawings of the completed designs as well a competition pictures and results.

&amp;nbsp;

At the start of last month I applied to an investment firm for an internship. About 2 weeks later I got an email to set up an over-the-phone interview. It went well and they invited me in for an in-person interview the next week.

&amp;nbsp;

The in-person interview went very well I thought, one of the interviewers (there were 4) had even told me after that it went very well. Afterwards they emailed me an ""internship exercise"" to complete within the week. Basically it was just researching companies and giving an overview, as well as some industry related questions. 

&amp;nbsp;


The next week (this past Friday) I got an email from one of the interviewers saying they just wanted to check in and let me know that they'd be meeting up on Monday (tomorrow) to look over the exercise and I should plan on hearing back early next week. A few hours after that email he sent another one asking if I could meet him in a coffee shop near by on Tuesday. 

&amp;nbsp;


I feel pretty confident I got the internship, but there are a few things that make it seem a little odd. The main one being that the email asking to meet him at the coffee shop came just a few hours after his email about them reviewing the work I sent in on Monday. Is it that a bad sign that I may not even be in the running at this point? Wouldn't he wait to ask for a meet up after they had already reviewed my work?

&amp;nbsp;



At the same time I don't feel as if they would waste their time meeting up with me just to let me know i didn't get it. I'm sure an email would do the job just as well, unless they like to handle business more personally.

&amp;nbsp;



So yeah, any thoughts? I know over-analyzing never helps but my mind is racing.

Thanks in advance!

5gj1hf,268,2016-12-04,Ms. Loretta June's Hunting Club,h6485a,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5gj1hf/ms_loretta_junes_hunting_club/,"Ms. Loretta June was known for two things in Adalaine, Nebraska: her Apple Brown Betty and her hunting club. My best friend, Molly and her husband, Stephen, had lived in Adalaine for a year or two, and had told me stories of Ms. Loretta June.  As it happened, her immensely successful stockbroker husband of thirty-something years had finally gone to trade in the great heavenly stock exchange, leaving her rich in land and wealth. Shortly after his death, she had built a beautiful hunting lodge on the outskirts of her property, and started what was now one of the most exclusive, female-only hunting clubs in the state, if not the country. When Jeremy’s job had him uproot us to Adalaine, I made it my mission to join that club. My Father had made me a great shot, and I had always had a natural affinity to feeling a crossbow in my hand and a buck in my sight.  Though having Molly close would be great, Jeremy worked such long hours and traveled often, I knew this hunting club would be the perfect way to engrain myself in a community of new friends and a bustling social life. 

Coincidently enough, Ms. Loretta June had been the first to come to the door of our modest, but encouragingly labeled “single family” home with a warm welcome and warmer Brown Betty. 

After introductions, she said, “ Welcome to Adalaine, sweetie,” handing me the pastry and my opportunity to impress.

“Thank you so much, Ms. Loretta! It’s so wonderful to be here. I had heard you run quite a famous hunting club here in Adalaine. I’m not sure what the process is for applying or joining, but I sure would love to be a part of it.” The minute I said the last word, I feared I had laid it on too thick. Would she think I was too desperate? Was the word famous condescending? Luckily, she interrupted my anxious internal twittering.

Her face fell. “Thank you, dear. Unfortunately, you don’t have the credentials at the moment to be considered for a membership, but thank you so much for asking.” And with that, she turned on her heel and waved over her shoulder as she walked down our path.

I didn't have the credentials? She didn’t even know who I was, nor did she have any clue about my hunting ability. Had Molly put in a good word for my like I’d asked? Molly had only recently been asked to join a few weeks ago. It was actually perfect timing, since she had caught Stephen cheating on her with a senior from the college he taught at the next town over. It would be great for her to have a supportive group of women around her; but I also wanted to be in that group! To support her, of course, but somewhat selfishly, to fit in and be accepted by the woman who appeared to be the Matriarch of Adalaine. 

I texted Molly for answers, but unfortunately wouldn’t get any until that weekend since she was too busy to meet. I occupied myself with setting up the new house, since Jeremy was working almost twelve hours everyday to establish himself in this new branch. I could barely wait for Saturday to come so I could at least understand what my next move should be. The morning of, I texted Jeremy I would be out all afternoon with Molly and headed for my car. 

When I arrived at the Starbucks, Molly was already there and seemed so sad that she muted the colors around her. I knew I couldn't launch right into asking about Loretta June, so she caught me up on Stephen or rather the lack thereof. He seemed to have skipped town completely. She was working with lawyers now to get handle on his estate or even life insurance policy depending on how the next few weeks played out, but I felt like she was holding back something.  She seemed distracted and her right hand kept fiddling with a pink envelope with gold embossing sitting on the table. 

She exhaled deeply and blurted, “ you’re probably wondering what this pink envelope is right?” Had she seen my eyes dart to it? I felt the guilt set in, and my delay in response was an obvious answer.
She inhaled deeply, as if stealing herself for the words about to come out of her mouth and said, “ It is my pleasure to formally invite you to join Ms. Loretta June's Hunting Club.” She smiled, but it looked like it had caused her pain to do so. I could barely speak due almost entirely to the mismatch of emotion to the content in the news she had just delivered to me. Before I could react, she shoved the envelope in my hand and told me to come to the address listed in the envelope tonight at 8PM. As I opened the letter to finally discover the mysterious address of the hunting club, Molly had already risen, tossed a “see you tonight” over her shoulder, and was halfway out the door. 

I sat there a moment, trying to comprehend what had just occurred. My emotional wheel of fortune finally landed on excited, narrowly missing concerned and worried. I rushed home to excise my hunting equipment from the basement and choose an outfit that was the perfect ratio of rugged and cute.  I was weighing benefits of wearing multicam vs. realtree when I heard music coming from the second floor. It was “All of Me” by John Legend; Jeremy and my wedding song.  I smiled, thinking how nice it was he listened to it even four years later. I was hoping he was home so I could tell him the news in person. I raced up the stairs and opened the bedroom door. 

The next twenty minutes felt like stop motion. The first thing I saw was a woman’s back, upright on my bed, with Jeremy’s head shooting up from the pillows at the sound of the door. Then more flashes. A woman’s gasp. Magenta lipstick on my white sheets. Our wedding present sheets. Jeremy falling of the bed, fumbling for his pants. The swirl of a blue linen dress being put on backwards. A black bra. Her bumping into my shoulder as she squeezed past me and down the stairs. Sandalwood and vanilla perfume. Expensive perfume. Jeremy rushing to me, putting his hands on my forearms, my pulse. Trying to get me to look at him, to say something.

The following hours were filled with thin apologies, fat excuses, and an overwrought narrative meant to justify shortsightedness and selfishness. He finally had the sense to leave to let me “digest everything” and “we could figure everything out  “after I’d slept on it.”
I sat down at the kitchen table and wistfully remembered I used to refer to him as my  “Trophy Husband.” I know that’s not the correct way to use the term, but me, with my shiny Newlywed sheen, referred to him as my Trophy Husband because he was such a prize and I was so lucky to have him. He worked so hard, looked so handsome, and invested so much in us as a couple. I suppose I thought I had won him, but that didn’t really matter now. I had been so trusting so devoted to Jeremy and his “work” I didn't see the clichés playing out, and myself a willing, but ignorant participant I mentally shook the nostalgia Etch-e-Sketch and remembered I was supposed to be at the hunting lodge in an hour.  As emotionally decimated as I felt, it seemed like I should honor the invitation, if not for Molly’s sake, to prove to Ms. Loretta June I had been worth the invitation. 

As I wove through the dirt roads of what felt like the ten thousandth acre of Ms. Loretta June’s property, I came upon the beautifully rustic hunting lodge. The sun was finally down, and it finally occurred to me that it was unlikely we would be doing any hunting at night, but didn’t really matter.  I parked, swallowed any feelings I had and lifted ornate brass doorknocker to announce my arrival.

I was surprised to find Ms. Loretta June opened the door herself. She had the warm maternal look of understanding I needed to see in that moment as she welcomed me. Did she know about Jeremy and I already? I was escorted into through a cavernous lounge with twenty or so women in different states of leisure spread about on leather couches. As I walked through, each of them met my eye and gave me an affirming, welcome head nod, which was both encouraging and daunting. Was there some odd initiation ritual I should be steeling myself for?

We finally arrived at the well-stocked armory I had ever seen.  Before I could specifically count what had to be over two hundred different types of weapons, I noticed Molly sitting in the corner in front of ten television monitors. She leapt out of her chair and ran over to hug me. 

“Elsie, I am so sorry this happened to you. I really wanted to say more to you today, but you had to be here to understand. We have something that will make you feel better, I promise. I know you’re probably super overwhelmed, but just listen to Ms. Loretta. It’ll all make sense.”

I blinked. I really had no idea what was going on. How could they possibly know about Jeremy? It had only happened a few hours ago and I hadn’t told anyone. 

Ms. Loretta grabbed my hands and looked me dead in the eyes. 
“Sweetie, I started this Hunting Club a long time ago for one reason: to hunt animals. Not just the cute ones you see trotting around and singing in Disney movies, either. The real ones. The people who think they can treat other people who love them like they’re dirt and get away with it. The ones who turn their backs on thirty-four years because they want to feel young again with a twenty-something coffee-runner.” 

“The ones that manipulate college seniors to believe that being with them would be a academic privilege,” Molly added from the corner.

“And the ones that rotate through interns every time they move because they get bored and only really work three hours a day,” Ms. Loretta poignantly concluded.

“But…how did you know it was going on when I had no idea myself?” I finally squeaked out.

“Molly had a hunch and mentioned it one day. We’ve been considering you for a membership for a long time. The final credential was you knowing who Jeremy really is.” That really hadn’t answered my question, but I didn’t have the opportunity to ask anything else. She gestured to one of the monitors and my mouth dropped.

There was Jeremy, huddled in a cage meant for a large-sized dog. There was no sound, but I could see him calling out and desperately trying (and failing) to open the locking mechanism.

“Sweetie, this is your final test. In order to join my hunting lodge, you need to catch your prize animal. He’s meant for you and only for you. We’ll set him loose, give him some time to discover the electric fences and think he’s found safety under the cover of something, then we’ll track him; hunt him down, like the animal he is. You up for it?”

Molly looked at me expectantly as Ms. Loretta looked as casually at me as if she’d just asked me for the time. A myriad of thoughts and feeling swirled through my mind. I looked back to the screen, at the state Jeremy was in. What these women had done. What would happen if I said I didn’t want to join. How badly I wanted to be where I was standing right now. 

And then, my eyes fell on something as they scanned the room. The minute I saw it, my decision was made. Every negative emotion I had felt in the past few hours gave way to complete serenity. I’m not sure how long I was quiet, but I knew the right thing to say.

“Ms. Loretta June, it would be a downright pleasure to try out that lovely crossbow you have hanging up there.”
She smiled and instructed Molly to select two other women to join our hunting party for the evening. We would all track him together, but I would have the finale.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I returned home to find even more benefits to my new membership. My house had been completely cleaned. My fridge was full of delicious food (including an Apple Brown Betty). My bed was made with beautiful new sheets, as if the magenta stains had never existed. My phone buzzed with a text from Molly. 

“ You’ll have to wait until tomorrow for the full effect, but here’s a sneak peek:”

When the picture finally loaded, all I could do was smile. There, between a stockbroker and a thirteen-point buck, was my Trophy Husband. Right where he belonged.

I really don't want to go to Maryland (state school), and I'm looking to add one or two more schools. Thoughts on what schools to apply, or if this list is ok or not? Help greatly appreciated. Sorry if this isn't the right sub, but I don't think this really fits under chance me.

However, outside of these fundamentals I'm severely lacking basic skills all the whiz-bang programmers have. 

 I've never used things like github or sequel or tomcat, and I couldn't tell you the difference between node and angular and javascript.  This is because I've never immersed myself in a personal project that I needed to use them for.  I know an obvious answer seems to be ""Well go do a project"", but I can't think of a project to incorporate these technologies before knowing what they do.

But I have like 6 months and a reasonable amount of free time.  Where should I start? What should I learn?  I've yet to be told what specific work my internship will entail, but I feel like these gaping holes in my programming knowledge should be filled regardless of if I'll immediately use them."
5gldxl,6,2016-12-05,Need help predicting what will happen once we lift the gear beam (how can this problem be approached?),Fourier1,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/5gldxl/need_help_predicting_what_will_happen_once_we/,"Hello /r/askengineers,

I am an undergraduate ME and an intern at a machined parts supplier. I have been assigned to address a safety concern in the company. I believe there are more reliable solutions to this concern, but the details do not pertain to the task for which I am asking for help here today.

[Quick sketch of the problem.](http://i.imgur.com/rWy1luH.jpg)

My boss asked me to predict (calculate) what will happen once this I beam lifts the gear beam off of its supports, in order to justify changing the way we currently lift the gear beam or disprove the proposed method you see in the sketch . I have marked the CG of the gear beam as shown. My intuition tells me that once the gear beam is lifted off the supports, it will rotate CCW until its CG is a minimum distance from the ground. This will cause the I beam to rotate about the cable. 

My question is, what do I do to show exactly how much each component will rotate? I have looked through my dynamics books, my statics books, and my calculus book, but nothing deals with something of this sort. I have considered calculating the instantaneous center for the gear beam, but the problem with that is that it changes as the gear beam rotates. 

How may I approach this problem; and is solving this a realistic expectation of me by my boss? 

I can provide more details if necessary; I appreciate any input I can get on this. Thank you!

5gldxu,0,2016-12-05,What goes where in my software engineer CV/personal letter?,Ran4,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/5gldxu/what_goes_where_in_my_software_engineer/,"I'm re-writing my cv and personal letter template (I always modify the personal letter for every company I apply for), and I'm having trouble figuring out how to show off my software engineering skills.

I do have personal projects on my github/bitbucket page, a portfolio page with introductions and explanation for some of my projects (50-50 my own work and *original* school projects, no exercise projects of course...), but I still need to put things into my CV/personal letter (should I make a strong reference to my portfolio page?) since I can't show any NDA'd stuff. It would be so easy to just namedrop tools, frameworks, libraries and development principles, but where does it go and to what extent?

I've interviewed people before (for internships and master thesis work), and I definitely preferred candidates which mentioned working knowledge of things like git/CI/agile/TDD/POSIX tools and the frameworks that we're using. Should I mentioned things like those in my CV or personal letter? Only during the interview (with the engineers, that is)?

Omitting these things and having my CV focus on my positions (work assignments, degrees, school committees) would of course be an alternative. It'd certainly shrink my CV down to 1 page from 2, but it'd look a bit bare.

I've been working professionally for about a year now and is currently looking at interviewing for startups or at companies as a data analyst (since I have the most on-paper work experience doing data analysis), trying to avoid the most junior positions (while still acknowledging that most companies consider you to be a junior up until ~3-4 years of working professionally). I've got enough connections to not have to go through HR interviews, so thankfully I don't need to consider that bit (can someone shine some light on when and where I can drop off the whole *working knowledge of Microsoft Office* shtick?)"

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

My older laptop could run League of Legends at around 60FPS (with constant freezes) but not many of the newer, flashier RPGs like The Witcher or Skyrim. I would love to start looking into these and hopefully the hardware will be good enough to play new releases for a few years to come.
I also would like to potentially stream in the future.

tl;dr:Gaming, possibly streaming, surfing the web, the occasional cat video, office stuff here and there and social media.


**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

This is completely new terrain for me. Since my budget is a bit tight I don't want to buy a huge 4k monitor right away, I settled for a 1920x1080 monitor.
I am not yet looking into HD gaming, VR, etc.
I also don't want the game to feel like slogging through mud FPS-wise, like it does on my laptop. I think 60-80+ FPS on high graphic settings for demanding games sounds fair. League should run as smoothly as possible, aiming for &gt;150 FPS here.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I wanted to stay under 1100€, since that's what I get for Christmas gratifications from work. Also have a 50€ gift voucher for Amazon shop, so 1150€ completely.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Germany/EU

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

CPU is already bought used from a reseller with warranty.
Monitor and Power supply is also already purchased from ZackZack, a liveshopping spinoff page by Alternate, a German shop.

The prices without listed merchants were deals outside of the 4 German shops that PcPartPicker can list.
This is where I grabbed the already purchased parts: 

Mainboard and CPU are refurbished pieces from ebay sellers. I hope they work! **Does anybody have experience with purchasing hardware from ebay?** Is it a bad idea overall?

I am not completely done with comparing prices for some pieces. I am eyeballing a seemingly good deal on the GPU. 

The colour scheme happened on accident, I don't need to stay with it, can propably skimp a few € with changing back to a closed 30€ Thermaltake versa H21, but I am kinda happy how the colours turned out and it started to grow on me.

Hard drive is from my laptop. It's older but it hopefully does its job until I can financially manage to upgrade to an SSD. It is not a pressing priority and I want to make it work with essential parts first.
**Is the hard drive still ok or do I absolutely NEED a better one ASAP?**

The Steelseries Siberia v2 headset I already owned, same goes for a cheap no-name mouse, which also does its job well for years now. May upgrade when I have money left.
I don't have a keyboard yet. Any suggestions on something cheap and alright?

Any ideas where I can still skimp a few moneys? Or how I can make the colour topic even nicer?
Is the CPU cooler and the WLAN adapter any good/ good enough? Should I opt for a water cooler in the same price range or are those bad?

**Is there a grave mistake in my build that I somehow overlooked?**

Thank you for your feedback. It's my first attempt and my first post in /r/buildapc. Any help is highly appreciated. :)

*Edit: Included some of your suggestions and tweaked it around a bit. Worth mentioning: German shop Mindfactory is mostly a bit cheaper on parts and I don't have Amazon Prime, so the ""picked"" parts and shipping prices are not completely accurate. You can order without shipment costs between 12 and 6 am, making it way cheaper than Amazon for the most parts.

I recently got a traineeship for 2 years, but I have two questions which you could maybe answer for me.

1. Since traineeships do not exist in my country in this form, I am a bit confused about what to expect. Is a traineeship basically an extended internship, where the company gets a cheap worker or is the intention of the company to keep me if I do good work?

2. Due to personal reasons, I cannot start my traineeship at the expected date, so I asked for an extension of one month, which was granted to me. I thought that this means that the two year period will simply start one month later, but actually, they just reduced my time there to 1 year 11 months.  

Now I am worried that this already leaves a bad impression (not being able to attend at the expected date) and reduces my chances of keeping to work for the company, since they just reduced my internship duration. What do you think about it?  

  

Thank you very much for your help!"

The part I do enjoy is software design, with user experience in mind (primary function, number of clicks, user statistics...) as well as the back end interactions. I want more social interaction as well. 

I've seen program manager job descriptions that look like they focus largely on those things. I have a friend at one of the big 4 who let me come in and have 30 minute sit downs with people in different positions. The program manager sounded most interesting. 

Even with the sit downs, and reading job descriptions/postings I couldn't give a clear answer on what a day in the life of a program manager is like. 

Are descriptions vague because the position is different at different companies? Or is it just hard to put into words beyond ""promote synergy"", or ""manage responsibilities effectively with strong organizational and communication skills""? 

The pm I talked to at one of the big 4 got hired into that position straight out of school. Is this rare? I'm trying to see how qualified I am (most positions want pm experience.. it's the old catch 22). Are there classes/certifications that would go well with a 4 year degree in cs to make a more attractive pm candidate?

Fast forward 1.5 years and I dread going to work each and every day. The work never stops and nobody is ever happy. I manage our Veeam backups, failover clusters (a 12 node cluster, 10 node cluster, 4 node cluster, and multiple 2 node clusters.), our HVAC sitemanager, our portfolio software, our virtual server and physical server builds, and I'm expected to be a leader in our day to day tasks of supporting our retail sites.

Management gets upset because I'm not proactively maintaining systems for future support, but where do I find the time!? I have just enough time to apply a bandaid fix and hop on my next call/project, until the bandaid rips again!  I'm having to work afterhours just to keep up. (Salary, no overtime) We have a team of 10 admins, most twice my age and I feel looked down upon and receive no help cause their too busy with their own items.

I feel like I'd be happier in a support type role not stressing about the above responsibilities 24/7, but im afraid quitting and going from Sysadmin &gt; support would have a negative impact on my career.  Do things get better?

**Little backstory, skip to the last paragraph for the question.**

I just finished my 2nd year in CS. After applying for a internship at a company with close relationship with my Uni I didn't get a response while two of my colleges got accepted, they received a confirmation email today, but I don't have my hopes up that I'll get in.

In terms of projects, I have 2 years of research in Data mining and IA, while they have nothing. Their grades are better than mine, but mostly in the mathematics field, in programming I have the edge in all of the classes.

There is also an age gap between us, they are 18/19 and I'm 25. Started late because money.

**The question:**

How important is for a student to be the ""right age"" (having started uni after high school)?

Thanks All

**EDIT:**

Thx for the answers guys, I guess I just didn't do good enough on the interview."

I'm in between jobs right now after leaving my previous job in April but I'm having some real troubles getting noticed by companies that I've been applying to. I've applied to both internships and entry-level positions to no avail. I'm applying to both because I'm kind of stuck: I have too much experience (professional and educational) for an internship, many openings require applicants to be in PURSUIT of a degree, and not enough for an entry level position, these openings typically require 1+ year of experience. 

Neither of these apply to me. 

Recently my hope has been that the skills, interests, etc. that I describe in my cover letters and resumes get me noticed but that obviously hasn't worked either. 

I've done the whole resume and cover letter tailoring thing with every job I apply to with no avail. 

Anyone have any tips on getting my foot in the door for jobs I may be slightly under qualified for experience-wise? And as a Portland resident, could the job market simply be tapped out for people in Marketing? Should I branch out to something else by going back to school (I do have an interest in programming and know quite a bit for someone who doesn't know much, if that makes sense. Marketing and programming can also pair nicely in many ways). 

I consider myself very ambitious and hope to own a business one day (I have several business plans in the process of being drafted). So what about trying to find an entry-level position in Marketing, but getting as much seed money as possible while working full-time in a non-marketing position? 

Has anyone ever been in this position? Or have any words/tips of encouragement?

What do you think?",Xenograteful,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5gs49k/i_asked_from_someone_on_reddit_what_things_about/,"[So here's my question and his answer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/56fdmf/how_useful_are_the_different_university_degrees/d8jomob/) I have an opinion about his answer but I won't say what it is because I want to hear from you first. But it seems a little like he doesn't really get the point of college.

My question:

&gt;Computer science student here, if you don't need advanced math in your job, are there other specialized skills that you *do* need?

&gt;I'm just happy that a good job is only partly my motivation, and a bigger motivation is to learn a domain that I think is important and grow my thinking doing that.

His answer:

&gt;Aside from basic programming knowledge I don't know if there are any hard/specific skills that you definitely need. There are plenty of soft skills, working with people on a team, knowing how to figure things out with google, good communication, and enough interest in your field to keep work interesting for you.

&gt;Programming jobs can get very specialized very quickly. So there will definitely be specialized skills that you learn on the job, but I can't say what those skills might look like for a generic CS graduate. Even for a graduate that was hoping to get a job at the company I work at. I could give them 5 or 6 different programming languages to learn, tell them to learn about databases, build scripts, practice programming complex logic puzzles, or play around with front end UI stuff. And that would be just what I've worked on in the last three years at this company.

&gt;Overall I'd say my computer science minor in college prepared me for some interview questions, and maybe saved me a few weeks at my job where I didn't need to learn some CS basics. That minor was about one semester's worth of classes. Based on the class choices at my college there would have been diminishing marginal returns to taking more courses.

&gt;My advice to you (you've probably heard a lot of it already, but its good advice):

&gt;Get a programming internship, or just some experience working in the real world.

&gt;Start figuring out what you enjoy most about programming. Then learn as much as you can about it. Your knowledge will shape your career path. Unless its really basic stuff, don't learn about things you hate just because people tell you its necessary. Also speaking to what you enjoy, and what you know a lot about will come across well in interviews.

&gt;Avoid the gaming industry, it has the worst jobs you can get as a programmer. If you just like programming and solving problems, find a boring industry that programmers wouldn't like, you'll get great compensation for doing what you enjoy."

Thank you for your time. I'll give an specific example and try to explain my limitations. My English is also limited so please be patient!



At my internship, i enjoy finding easier ways to work in excel and I have had opportunities to practice improving simples reports with index/match, conditional formatting and dynamic ranges.



About the versions, the company gave me an excel 2007 to work even though some people (like my boss) has 2013. I can't ask for it atm. And if needed i can use my own PC with newer excel. So I'm not really worried about excel version.




Recently i am generating a relatively simples reports from a table with about 2k rows and 10 columns.




At first I did it with pivot tables and that was enough. However, I feel limited. I mean, my report (from a dynamic table) show me, for instance, how many workers did a kind of workshop. I have the total number of workers in another table in the same sheet and I want to calculate the ratio of workers who did this workshop/total workers of the company.



What now?



In summary, I want a automated report from a table that might want to add info from another table.



Below I wrote specific about how I considered approaching go solve this issue. Help!



Option 1:
I'm not good with pivot table calculated fields. But I understand that all columns must be in the same table? That is not the case. I don't want to add in my table all the workers in the company because that is not how we've been using this table. I'm not sure that I can solve it with pivot tables.


Option 2:
I can calculate with formulas but I don't know exactly how. For instance, if I refer to a cell from a pivot table report (like an index/match to bring an information from this second table, I can't generate any kind of graphs. I'd need go ""copy out"" the pivot info. Am I missing something from ""get pivot"" option?


Therefore I am struggling with this 'hybrid' of pivot and formula.


Option 3:
When I consider approaching full on formulas I realized that I really don't know how to do the following: how can I filter in a new list a column? Just like when you add a column to the lines field of the pivot table."

This was my first real job outside of college (although I have had 3 internships) and when I joined last year they also hired one other recent grad around the same time. I have been very happy with the job overall but this has been annoying me for the past 2 months or so.  

I feel like as I have been doing better with my assigned tasks than the other new developer the senior programmers and my supervisor are assigning me more involved and higher priority projects and have higher expectations from me.  While the work I am assigned is by no means unreasonable (and the projects are usually fun) I still feel like it's unfair that the other junior dev is 'getting away' with still only having to do simple bug fixes.   

I do not know what would be the solution to this. I don't want to complain about my workload because it's not unreasonable at all and I don't know if it's good to complain about someone else's lack of workload. I have been promised a good raise next year but that does not make me feel better about this situation as I am pretty sure he is going to be getting a similar raise.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I'm not sure if I should choose an Intel or AMD CPU. My AMD build is way cheaper but probably uses more power.  
Also I still need an inexpensive system drive (SSD or HDD) and a good PSU.  

The system drive doesn't need to be bigger than 64 GB because it will only contain the OS.  
I don't really know which PSU to choose. According to various PSU calculators this system needs about 120W under load which means I'd need a 150 - 200W PSU. But I can't really find one so small. The PSU I included seems to be a good one but it's a bit to big. Are there even 200W PSUs?    
And if anyone can recommend a cheaper case with at least 5x 3.5 inch drive bays that'd be great.

Thanks a lot in advance!"

My school has a program that allows us to do a year long intern between our 3rd and 4th year. One of the offers I got is a sw(specifically java) testing position from a well known company.

The salary/condition is kind of appealing to me but I'm afraid that this experience will affect my job search for dev when I graduate because it marks a ""testing"" on my resume... Plz help"

I have a hard time making up my mind so I am looking forward hearing thoughts from strangers!
So, I am a 24 years old guy living states side, I am graduating computer engineering. In the past few months I applied at two different places and I turned down both of their offers but recently my boss from an internship I did two years ago contacted me and offered me a job with great condition for a job I enjoyed and I know I will enjoy again.
So far so good right?
Wrong. Last year I went in eastern Europe to study for a semester and I had a blast, I traveled all around Europe, I made memories, friends and of course, I fell in love.
So I have this girl which I ended up dating for a while there, she came to visit me at the beginning of my semester and she will be back for christmas. I love her, I really do.
But I have to move to Europe to make it work, and it turns out it is a lot harder than I thought to find a job in Europe as someone from America (education difference, no knowledge of the language and no citizenship..).
So I find myself in this situation, I can either work here in a good job that I will enjoy, and accept not seeing the girl I love for a while and probably (let's be honest here) dooming the relationship.
Or I go to Europe. Apply for a master and study there while I learn the language, test the relationship, etc.
The thing is I feel like I am ready to work. If I could find a job there it would be the best of both world, I could work and be with the woman I love.
But then again, 24 is the perfect age to be stupid and take a leap of faith. Plus I loved my time in Europe!
So yeah, what do you think stranger?"

I've been browsing this subreddit for a while now and have learned a ton from other peoples advices and questions.
I am currently a Computer Science student and have recently been applying to a TON of places for internships and never seem to get any responses back for interviews from anyone so I guess I'd like some feedback or guidance on what to do better. The places I've been applying to have for the most part been in different states as I currently live in Orlando, Florida and there isnt much opportunity for Software Engineering/Developer internships here.

What I currently have going for me:

1. I have a personal site where I list the several side projects I have and even write some ""useful"" articles for other people who may need help: https://luispadron.com/

2. I have a GitHub with several projects in both iOS/Android and even some Python stuff, one of my projects is also a bit popular: https://github.com/luispadron

3. I have almost a year of internship experience at a single company as you can see in my resume: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmlhete68488mpe/Luis%20Padron%20Resume.pdf?dl=0

Even with this, which isn't much, but still I am happy with what I have accomplished in around 2 years of study in the field. No one shows interest in interviewing or getting back to me. I've been auto rejected from several places with no reason or feedback as to why.

The only thing I can think may be a reason for rejection is I am currently going to a small college in my town as I work to finish my AA (next semester) and will then be transferring to a bigger university very soon.

Anyway, I listed my resume and projects out so that I can show what I have been applying with to these places and why I am a little worried and disappointed over not getting any interest. If any of you have any ideas or help/feedback (especially on my resume) that would be great. 

Thank you all so much!

I've been working as a junior sysadmin for 3 years now but I'd like to switch to software development. The school I went to offers a direct transfer option to a school in Aarhus, where I can finish my comp sci degree in 1.5 yrs (two semesters, and then a 4 month internship). Questions:

There is a scholarship available for SAIT grads which would cover a large portion of the cost. Said scholarship wants to know my motivation and ""relevant information that the admission officer should consider when assessing your application"". I'm not sure where to go with this. I would like to go to school in Denmark, and then reside in Scandinavia permanently, but I'm not sure they want to hear that. I have no ties to Denmark or Europe for that matter, aside from my German heritage. I only speak English but I would love to learn Danish. There will also be a Skype interview. Should I just say I like vikings and black metal? :p Because I actually do - I've been obsessed with scandinavia for many years...

I can't find any information on this one-semester internship really. It does say that it can occur in Denmark at one of their approved companies/institutions, or outside of Denmark if approved by the school. The school provides a long list of Danish tech companies and has job fairs and stuff. If I land an internship in Denmark, does that mean I would get a work visa? Would that enable me to find long term work afterwards?

I already know that I will be applying for the school and the scholarship at the same time in February, and I will know in May whether I am accepted or not. I will also probably be applying for student housing at this time. From what I read, I can't apply for a residence permit until I've been accepted to the school, but I could be wrong. Is there anything I need to be aware of here that I might be missing? 

I should also add that I'm in a relationship with a girl from Poland (19) and she is wanting to live in Denmark with me during this time. She doesn't know if she wants to go to University or find some random job yet. I don't know what complications we will have here but as far as I know, she can just move there as long as she has the money. She speaks Polish and English and has roughly no work experience and no post-secondary school. Any thoughts on this one?

Thanks in advance!

5gymcr,1,2016-12-07,What is the generic path to successful immigration to US?,chalocanada,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5gymcr/what_is_the_generic_path_to_successful/,"So I made a thread about Canada, thought I would do one about the US as well. 

So this is the generic path that I have seen celebrated in Indian newspaper and know of only three such cases personally. 

1. B.E in Electrical Engineering, some small summer internship 
2. M.S. in some small US university (in this case it was Colorado State University). No 100% scholarships for MS level, so some student loan from Indian.
3. Summer internship at Amazon.
4. Full time offer at Microsoft. Pay off Student loan from India.
5. H1-B -&gt; Green Card (after 5-7years) -&gt; US CITIZEN!

The problem with the above path is that there are way too many variable that can go wrong. First there are not that many large tech companies as such and large companies are the only one sponsoring H1B visas. Second not every one is super smart to crack those interviews. 

The question here what are the stories about people who mess up in the above path? Do they turn out to be ok after their US adventure? What about the ""consultancy"" agencies that claim to hire those who don't get lucky with the above path? 

Is the US adventure still worth it?"

I'm from São Paulo/Brazil and in January I have a court hearing against my father and I'm really in need of legal advice on how to defend my case.

Up until June my father paid alimony to my mother and I, in July he filed a lawsuit asking to be exempt from paying alimony. On the lawsite there were a bunch of lies, which I'll explain bellow, but still, as my lawyer said, it'll depend on the judge.

In August the judge accepted his claim and since then my father hasn't paid alimony. What I need to do is defend why he must pay us alimony for these 4 months or, if the judge sees fit, for a couple of years more.

During my last year of reddit I wrote a couple of posts asking for advice, unfortunately only one person replied one of them. I know this is a freaking big story and many of you won't read this, but I have no idea what to do. I'm desperate and really need help.

Thank you and best regards,

**My background**

My father when to military school. Did his entire career there and got up to Colonel, with a paycheck of U$5.560,00.
My mother never graduated, she moved in with my father and then didn't had the time to study because she had to raise me.

My father had and affair with another woman he dated before dating my mother. As he cheated my mother several times (you read it right), they decided that he would help my mother until I was born and after that move in with his lover, and so he did.

He was never present in my life. When I was a child my mother would ask me to call him on father's day, Christmas, New Year and other festive dates. He would rarely call me and when he did he would tell me that we would meet in an X amount of days or he would be in town for holidays and we would go out, we never did.

When I was around 10, I traveled to his place and stayed 15 days. During those days he didn't stay with me. I played with my ""brother"" and my mother-in-law, but me and my father didn't spend time together. 17 years later I still remember him saying, when my brother wasn't around, that ""I was the son he liked the most and he was very proud of me"".

I came home, got tired of calling him and never getting called back and decided not to call anymore. During the next 17 years, until today, we met only 3 times. Every time we met he would tell the same lies:

""I'll be in town for &lt;holiday&gt;"";

""I would like to see you more"";

""This are very busy lately, maybe we can meet"";

""I'm broke, I can't help you with anything"";

""How's your mother?""

I was bullied during my whole childhood. From 13 to 15 I suffered from panic syndrome and anxiety disorder. My mother got in contact with him to ask him to help her with paying for therapy and he refused, said he was broke. Me and my mother got through it together.

Due to the panic syndrome and anxiety disorder I had to quit school. My mother formally canceled my tuition with the school I was in. When she did it, they didn't inform her that it was said on the school rules that a student couldn't quit and if he did he would have to pay for the whole year.

The school sued my mother for not paying 3 months of tuition without ever charging her. They were charging my father and he never told us. At this time my mother was unemployed and when the bill of U$1.370,00 finally came, she couldn't pay for it and due to her depression she didn't get out of bed to get in contact with a lawyer and ask if the school could do what it was doing.
*Recently we found out that if she had sued the school at the time, she would've won because they can't force you to pay for something that you're not using/enrolled. But as she didn't do it in 3 years, we are having to deal with a debt of U$2.100,00.

At the time, my mother asked my father to help her. Explained the whole situation and he said he would help us *part 2 comes 12 years later*.

**I never knew about this situation until this year.**

When I became 18 (legal age in my country) he filed a lawsuit asking to be exempt from paying alimony. My mother went to court against him, showed proof that I was still in school, presented that I had suffered from panic syndrome and we won. The judge decided that he would have to pay alimony **until I graduated.** 

Four years latter he asked us to meet, I was 22, we did met. He said he was sorry for what he had done, that he filed the lawsuit because he was broke and desperate. That his wife was against it and would always tell him to meet me, but he didn't have the guts to face me. I thought he had finally matured and decided to give him another chance. At this time he was driving a car that costs around U$24.000,00 and was living on the coast.

When I was 21 I traveled to Canada, lived on year there (really miss you, Canada). I came back to Brazil, started college. I tried keeping a close communication with him, told him that *I was in college*, what I was doing, what I did in Canada and so on.

He kept saying that he would come over but never did. During my third year of college I wanted to take a course. My mother couldn't afford it and I asked him. As always, he said he couldn't help because he was broke.

Mid 2015, I was coming back home from work, he said he was in town and really wanted to see me. We met, he asked me a bunch of question and I openly replied them.

At this time:

- I was in college, finishing the third year;

- I was working as an intern;

- Me and my mother had rented a place and moved from my aunt's place;

- We managed to buy a car.

I asked him what he was doing and he said **he was a private pilot for a company. That the army wasn't paying enough**. I asked him to have dinner with me, he said he couldn't and he had to go back home. At this time he was driving the same car I had, which costs around U$14.600,00.

The story goes to 2016, one year later, around April. A law officer shows up at my aunt's house asking for my mother. She tells him that my mother moved and don't know where she lives and promptly tells my mother what happened. We found out that the school I studied in 2005, when I was 15, had won the lawsuit and my mother would have to pawn our car to pay for what she owns.

We got after more information and we find out that my father claimed that he had no responsibility over what happened because he was paying alimony to my mother. The judge decided in favor of my father and now the lawsuit was fully against my mother. My father never told my mother what happened and she never received a single letter regarding the lawsuit, therefore she lost the case. We got in contact with the school's lawyer and enter in an agreement. She would pay them U$150 per month during 35 months.

In August we received another bad news, my father filed another lawsuit to be exempt from paying alimony. He would now claimed that I wasn't studying, that I was earning enough to pay for all my expenses, that he was retired and due to the fact that he was from the army, he couldn't work on anything else. He also said that he would like his other sons to have the same chances as I did in my life, therefore he couldn't pay alimony anymore.

At this time I was in the middle of my fourth year of college. The total of my paycheck and my mother was barely enough to pay for our living expenses. During four years I had saved every penny to be able to achieve my childhood dream of traveling to Japan. All the money I saved was spend paying our bills while my mother paid the school's lawsuit and a lawyer to help us with the lawsuit my father filed against us. He hasn't paid alimony since august because the judge saw fit what he wrote on the lawsuit.

Finally, two days ago the date of my court hearing against him was decided and I really need to win this."

My social skills are terrible. I make people uncomfortable and am off putting especially to girls. I have friends but not many just a ton of friendly aquaintences. I spend most weekend nights either weight lifting, playing video games or studying. I hear people talk about the parties they get invited to and what they send to their friends on snap chat. Very rarely do I get invited to parties and no one texts me just to talk or shares snap chat moments beyond what they send everyone. 

For 5 years I did every thing I could to get the social skills needed to make tons of friends and have dating life. I volunteered at a social position 20 hours a week for a few months, took two acting classes, forced myself to engage in small talk with people I ran into, talk to people in line, say hi to girls who smile at me, approach 1 girl a day, attend as many social functions as I can even if I don't want to, going to mock interviews, ask friends for advice, actively reading body language, and reading books/blogs on body language, charisma, social skills, communication, networking, how to not be creepy, etc. Friends fsmily say I shouldn't change the way I am but the way I am isn't sufficient. 

I also put in effort to improve my looks by weight lifting, eating healthy, and having a trendy haircut. I'm good looking enough that I can get a ton of dates online. However none of these girls wanted continue dating me. A couple wanted to continue as friends.

Despite all that effort I am still called socially awkward, socially inept, weird in a good way, asked if I am a virgin  and offputting. A few times I caused tension because I made some girl feel uncomfortable. I have a ton of acquaintances both male and female but very rarely does it translate to anything. It doesn't help that I have esoteric tastes and am conservative in a very liberal area.

It's hard to get out of bed because of all the depression from the fact that I am missing out on so much in my life. That the window of opportunity is closing as people start settling down when they hit their 30s, and leave the party life behind. The way people look at a 30 something who still parties. That regardless of being in shape, good at programming, having an awesome internship, and studying a difficult subject that people will always judge me for my lack of interpersonal skills. That there is something about me that makes some people not want to be friends with me or even feel uneasy.

I want to have that fulfilling life with great memories.  "
5gzq7m,2,2016-12-07,Question about listing work experience on graduate school applications?,gpcr93,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5gzq7m/question_about_listing_work_experience_on/,"Hi,
I'm a recent grad applying for MS programs in computer science.  I had a question about listing work experience on my application.  I only decided that I loved CS my senior year, which only gave me enough time to finish a minor in CS, therefore I have no relevant internships in software engineering.  Being a biology major, a lot of opportunities that my school had access to were of the unpaid variety (yay unpaid research :) and non-profit work).  I could only find paid work as a tutor, so that is definitely getting listed.

My question is: Does unpaid research count under those sections of my grad school application that asks for employment?  I actually continued with some unpaid work after graduate (everyone in my hometown is applying to grad school/med school and needs research experience) while getting paid tutoring in the hope of applying to PhD programs in biology before I realized my course background qualifies for admission to some MS programs in computer science.

Thank you!"

Background: I'm a Michigan native but I moved to Maryland in June '16 for a job. It's great here work is fun, and I see potential to climb the ladders but my girlfriend just got a full time job in Michigan and its been hard adjusting to a new state where I know no one so I visit Michigan every month or so. My girlfriend and I have been long distance for about a year now and I would much rather prefer to move back to Michigan to be with her. We cannot get married right now for a couple reasons but plan on in a couple years. Anyways, before this job, I was in Philly for a 6 month internship so in June '17 I'll have 1.5 years of work experience under my belt so I could see myself considering another 6 months to meet the common 2yr work experience requirement. The reason why I'm having to think of this so early on is because my apartment is going to ask me in a couple months if I'd like to resign my lease.

Will recruiters be concerned from seeing that I only worked at my first job for only a year? Any other potential watchouts?"

This is not my area of research in grad school so I was just teaching myself as I went (nobody else at the company is doing this work). It turns out they're really happy with my work and begged me to stay on as a part-time contractor when the summer ended, and have now made me a (tentative) offer for $120,000 when I graduate in June. I was kind of blown away because this sounds like a LOT of money (I was making $50k as a biologist a year and a half ago, even with experience). Is this a good offer? I know it's high for an entry level software engineer, but I'm hesitant to put myself on the job market as a data scientist because this project is my only experience. Otherwise, how do I secure the offer, besides not screwing up (I'm still working there 10 hours a week or so until graduation)?

I am a backend developer and I have only ever done backend development. However, recently I am now half way through a website as I wanted to improve my understanding of the whole process as opposed to consistently looking at frontend as the place that sends the requests to us.

Anyways here is my question. We make this differentiation between frontend and backend and the general definition of backend is the stuff that is on the server. Well I don't know if I am being stupid but isn't everything on the server?

html files are sent from the server. You can make your html use scripts that exist on the server. So isn't everything on the server? At what point are frontend and backend considered separate.

To give a bit of background I am an intern at a company and I am a backend developer. I have been making this website for a while using a bunch of libraries and I want to host it soon. This is why I ask this question. 

I was thinking it works like this. Maybe you would just have ajax calls in the html files to be given data back from another application? Is that where the separation lies?"

It seems that for some of these, if I try to view the status of my application, it tells me the job listing no longer exists (so I'm assuming that means I got rejected).

So several of the people in the group have suggested I try applying to internships or apprenticeships to jump-start my dead end career. 

Now you might be thinking to yourself, what, why would I apply to those when I have a lot of experience already? The reasons some of the programmers gave is ""Why *wouldn't* you be eligible for an entry level internship in some language, if that's not something you're advanced at?"" ""Your philosophy should be that you are always a beginner in tech. if you're not constantly learning, your skills fade"", and ""Seems like a decent idea to me, especially if you've been out of work for a while.""

So I applied to two web developer internships, and actually got a reply from one of the companies. They want to set up a time to discuss it.

I would consider myself a shy extrovert and I talk a lot if I feel comfortable (if I've known you for a while or if I'm drinking). I had a very lackluster high school and early college experience, so I feel like I missed out on developing a lot of basic social skills. I was fortunately able to finally ""catch up"" socially and make good friends in my last few years of college, and I now feel very socially normal but definitely on the quiet side.

I've had previous jobs where I ended up being the shy one and never really interacted with coworkers unless I had to; I ate lunch at my desk or alone at the cafe, didn't hang out after work when invited, didn't talk much during breaks, etc. Part of it was that I already had a solid friend group outside of work and didn't see the point of socializing. I do a great job of appearing super perky during interviews so I suppose employers are a bit surprised at how reserved I am when I start working.

I've now moved back home so the dynamic is a bit different. I don't have the friend group to hang out with after work or on the weekends. I don't really do much socializing besides through social media/texting or talking with my parents. My job is in public relations and that means that essentially everyone is outgoing. I'd like to get over my closed-off behavior and have more fun at work by having people I can joke around with or eat lunch with.

I'm thinking about just doing the whole ""fake it till I make it"" until I actually feel comfortable, but I don't want to appear actually fake, if that makes sense. I'm scared of going to work and being surrounded by cliques; I think that's the worst part of finding friends at work, as everyone has been there for months/years and have established friendships and I'm not sure if there's any room for me.

How do I deal with work cliques? What is the best way to get to know a coworker on a closer level? Should I ask people to lunch or sit in a common area? Not really sure what specific things I should try :("

I am finished with my fall semester December 19 and begin my spring semester January 23rd which allows me to work for 5 weeks full time. 

To start off I'll label the jobs as Job A and Job B to clear up any confusion. 

Job A description: at a local optometric clinic approximately a 2 minute walk from my house which requires checking in patients, verifying they have insurance before coming in, and setting up appointments. But allows me to work closely with the optometrists and possibly be a reference for when I apply to optometry school. Pays $11 an hour. My interview is set for next Thursday. 

Job B: at a government office in the downtown area of the city that I live in and is an administrative intern position literally just filing, organizing, copying, cleaning, etc. Pays $14 an hour. 

I had a friend recommend me for a position at Job A in the clinic however was told they decided not to interview me. So a week later, I applied to job B got an interview on Friday, was immediately accepted an hour after interviewing. The following Monday Job A calls for an interview. 

I had set my schedule with Job B for the next week as: 

From: 
MWF: 2-5 pm 
TH: 9-5 
To:
Only MWF: 2-5 pm 

And then to full time M-F 9-5* starting December 19 


because of my final exams coming up this week and next week and I really need the time to study so I already feel that they are hoping to have me on a regular schedule soon so that they know for sure when I am coming in. 

*side note* I also stupidly asked if I could have my time changed from 10-5 instead of 9-5. Which I realize now was a really bad look but I 100% intended on coming in as early as I could, I just didn't want any accidental/occasional late days and keep having to call in since there's a ton of traffic in the morning. So I thought scheduling it for 10 but still coming in as early as 9 would make it easier for me and for my supervisor. Apparently.. WRONG. 

I will go to the interview but I don't know what to do. I've already committed to this job, working full time until the end of my winter break, I do not want to request ANOTHER change with my schedule and 
I obviously don't want to burn any bridges considering I JUST joined the team.. they were also all extremely happy to have me on board but ultimately and obviously an administrative intern isn't my ultimate goal here. My supervisor also did say, she personally never fires her interns and I'm free to work here until I find a job. 

I'm really only worried about the winter break since I've already agreed to work full time. 

IF I get accepted to Job A, I don't know if I should either: 

1. ask to rearrange my schedule AGAIN (which I really don't want to do) 

2. quit Job B 
(Which I've never ever quit a job almost as soon as I got hired)

3. ask to start Job A at the end of winter break so that I can somehow balance both jobs throughout the spring semester. (Will this lower my chances of being hired? And how do I go about informing the interviewer I wish to start at a later date? ) 

*side note* Job A clinic is open on the weekends, I can definitely work on the weekends. Should I just list my availability for winter break as weekends only? 

I'm seriously under so much stress and pressure from school and now deciding between these two jobs that I can't even think straight anymore. 

PLEASE help or at least put in your input. I hope it all made sense and thank you if you're reading this and left any comments! "

After that though, it's all computer science classes that I have left. I was wondering what you guys' course-load looked like at your uni's (how many classes did you take) and what you all would recommend.

Right now it looks like five computer programming classes a semester and I'm not sure if that's a good idea since discrete math has been rocking my world a bit and prior to this it'd been six years since I took any math/logic classes. I think I'm getting back in the groove of things though.

I'm going to a no name state university and just looking for advice on how to plan out my studies.

I had a vfx job at a mobile place for a little over a year until it went on hiatus and a lot of the places I interviewed at afterwards said they liked my work but wanted someone who could code as well so I think I'm leaning to go somewhere towards tech-art but just want a general cs background incase I fall completely out of love with art.

Right now, I moved back in with my folks and just looking to concentrate on school and get out as fast as I can with a BS of comp sci in hand. That is to say, I don't have anything else going on in my life so can go hard on this.

Wondering though if maybe you guys would recommend taking internships in the summer, having personal projects, etc. What did you guys do? Especially for those maybe trying to get into games.

In my second round, I had another interviewer who talked mostly about typical work expectations. He did a terrible job of selling the position to me and made comments about how ""new grads expect to be learning the moment they get the position which is not the case"", ""you'll likely work on projects you don't enjoy"", ""during peak times you'll be expected to work 15-20 hour days"" (no OT pay. And yes, 15-20 hours). Essentially, a lot of things that contradicted how great the first interviewer made the company sound and with emphasis on how much OT you'll be expected to work for free.

I appreciated his honesty and straightforwardness but it gave me a little anxiety about whether or not I should work for them.To add to that, all the employee reviews I've read say the company is terrible and support what the interviewers told me themselves - they overwork you on a regularly, pay terribly, and management does terrible caring for employees.

That said, they made me an offer and i feel they lowballed me...they gave me an intial range before making the offer and while it fell within the range, it was closer to the lower end. I attempted to negotiate, asking for a number closer to the higher end of the range, but the interviewer I spoke with didn't seem too confident that'd happen (it didnt) but said he'd check with higherups. I suspect he never actually made much effort to check because over the next few days, he just stopped replying to most of my emails, responding once every few days (before he would respond within an hour). To put it in perspective, they offered me less than what I was getting for an internship, which came as a large surprise. The benefits they offered me are also hardly better than what my university offers...In the end, I accepted because a job is better than no job...

that said, is this the norm for most developer positions? I know theres truth to crap pay and OT but didn't expect it to be as terrible as they made it sound...I also wanted to continue the job hunt but wanted to know if that's a bad idea. I've heard of people getting fired because management discovered they were job hunting without informing them and the last thing I want to do is jeopardize a potential job, albeit a shitty one.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?"

Not too picky about where I work, in fact really anything goes as long as it's good experience (and semi-decent pay) but just looking to find something. 

First year wasn't ideal for applying but by the end of my second year I'll know a decent chunk of stuff, having taking a ton of courses at this point. But my main central data structures course (CSC263) isn't until the coming semester which isn't exactly ideal if I do get interviews. Would I have to explain that to employers? As for side projects, I'm sort of lacking there as well. And I don't got a Github or Linkedin either...



Question really is, I'm at a loss of where to apply or how really, GTA/Toronto-specific. Really just want to make sure I at least *have* an internship this coming summer and from what I understand, now is the best time to apply.

These are the 12 distance learning credits (just enough for a full-time status) that I plan on taking while away on an internship in the spring. I'm an in-state student so this is something I would be able to afford, but was wondering if anyone has tried something like this. Also time commitments for these classes in general would be helpful if you've taken them. I've included the instructor of my distance learning section as well as the time frame of full semester vs. 2nd 8 weeks class for each. I would really appreciate some input on these classes or recommendations for other distance learning courses to take in stead! Thanks."

I originally planned on double majoring in mathematics and philosophy, and eventually getting a statistics masters degree and possibly a statistics phd if I could stomach the extra opportunity cost and time sink.

 I planned on working in industry after the conclusion of my education and I considered the prospect of being a quantitative analyst in finance to be one of the more interesting options available to me if I choose to focus on my quantitative skills to the completion of a phd. However, as I learn more and more about life and get older, the less willing I am to incur the massive opportunity costs present in something like a phd program. 

The way I see it, if I am going to work behind a computer all day and utlize my analytical skills to pay the bills; I might as well actually get paid for it and accrue work experience in the process. Accordingly, the idea of simply striving to work in finance directly after my bachelors degree is completed is appealing more and more to me. 

My main problem lies in how late to the game I am. I find finance an interesting and beautiful thing. The idea of making money and wealth for others, problem solving, and using my analytical skills to the fullest in a challenging environment doesn't just sound like something that pays the bills, it sounds pretty damn interesting.

I am not too keen on investment banking in particular, but equity research and corporate/commercial banking seem promising to me as well. At my campus there is a club dedicated to helping people find finance jobs with an attached alumni network on it. There is also a financial mathematics and statistics major, and if it makes any difference I was planning on taking a fifth year to knock out my statistics masters program prerequsites if I was still going to go down that career path. I also know that our career center is very good.

But before I investigate further and talk to knowledgable people directly through lunch or something like that(which is hard to do when finals week is underway), I was wondering if you folks could give me any advice. 

I am willing to change my major, stay a fifth year, network insanely, join the finance club(but thats a given), take internships, and pretty much do anything legal to get a finance job at this point. What are your suggestions? I also have a 3.7 GPA if that matters.

Tl:dr

5h7xxe,1,2016-12-08,MBA Worth it for Software Developer,CSMusicAndMath,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/5h7xxe/mba_worth_it_for_software_developer/,"I'm currently researching MBA programs and getting an MBA and I'm trying to decide if it is worth pursuing. I figured I would ask here to see what advise people had.

Here's some back ground:

**Age:** 23 (I understand this is young and don't plan on applying to b-school for another few years, though I graduated undergrad just after turning 21)

**Sex:** Male

**Race:** White

**Education:** Undergrad in CS at UC Berkeley with a 3.45 GPA.
Currently enrolled in GA Tech's OMSCS program and halfway through my masters with a 4.0 GPA so far.

**Work Experience:** Currently working as a Senior Software Developer in Austin, TX in the web space. Been in software development full time for about two years now with 2 years of internships before that.

**Goals:** I would like to continue to progress in the tech industry, maybe someday becoming a director of VP at a tech company.

My main question is whether or not the MBA is worth pursuing.
I want to get an MBA for personal reasons and I understand that some people will say that is reason enough to do it, but I want to make sure it makes sense financially before I really pursue it.

My thought process is that I'm from Austin, and I would like to go to McCombs after I complete my MSCS at which point I would have about 3 and a half years of experience in the tech industry, a decent undergrad GPA, a technical masters, and I still need to take the GMAT so we'll see on that. I understand that getting into McCombs is no small project but for the sake of discussion lets assume I can get accepted into McCombs full time MBA.

I've researched McCombs MBA graduating salary statistics and I've found that the mean and median are about $113k and $114k with the tech industry at about $104k and consulting at $129k. My main concern is that I'm already making $105k so going through the MBA is not guaranteed to raise my pay if I get the median pay coming out. A McCombs MBA in-state costs roughly $65k plus opportunity cost on lost wages.

I understand that in the long run the MBA could still pay for itself if it allows me to enter upper management positions further down my career path. Additionally I understand that the MBA experience is valuable for personal reasons and that does factor into the decision.

So the question is, if I'm already making almost the median salary of a graduating MBA does it make sense financially to go through the MBA program? Is it still likely to amortize itself over a 35 year career?"

Throughout the year, I've made it apparent to my manager that I'm interested in doing actual development work.  In the last few months he made me aware that I'd be switching to a new assignment that would have me as a ""full stack"" dev.  Front-end and back-end, as he put it.

Now, I've just been informed that starting Jan 1st that I'll be taking over a position for another dev that was handling a web portal which uses sharepoint in its entirety.

Please ignore any odd formatting and punctuation for now :) Any criticism is appreciated. Willing to delete whole chunks of this thing.**

For many years I've known that the time would come to sit down and write this letter to you. As a driven and highly curious person, it was only a matter of time before life's path lead me to the blinking cursor of a blank graduate school application. I have taken time off from academics to pursue topics which have fueled my desire to work in this field, and am now prepared begin my studies in the Resources and Environmental Management program at XXXr University in the Fall of 2017.

Firstly, I’ll admit that I am that millennial. The carbon-conscious, bike-commuting, local food-eating, and tree-hugging idealistic democratic socialist who just wants to be the change. Even if it means incrementally and through small, attainable goals. Cliches aside, I am deeply committed to a less impactful lifestyle and have hope that these ideals will spread to ours and future generations. I'm here knocking at your door today not just for a credential to help my career goals, but for a chance at collaborating with like minded researchers for the solutions I want to see in our future.

My academic, professional, volunteer and personal experiences thus far have been a part of a puzzle, and the next piece will be a Masters thesis and degree. The picture I’m building is a life and career dedicated to environmental protection, restoration, and sustainability. I am devoted to finding solutions through understanding consumer attitudes towards the environment and to work to positively change their motivations. In order to make my passion into my career, I recognize the need for higher education, collaboration, and guidance. 

During university, I obtained an internship with the City of XXX’s Bureau of Environmental Services. I was a part of the Pollution Prevention team and had many opportunities to work with professionals in other departments including source control, stormwater mitigation, and urban planning. My work ethic and hard-working positive attitude lead to being awarded this internship for a consecutive year. 

After my internship and undergraduate studies were complete, I had the opportunity to get my hands dirty as a Biologist. Combining my love for the outdoors with my spirit of adventure and devotion to resource management, I was hired to spend a 5-month field season as a botanist collecting data on land-use in rural eastern Nevada. I was in the field four days a week, camping in the wilderness and hiking trailless mountains to obtain data points for a proposed water mining project. My time in Nevada gave me an even higher appreciation for our wild spaces and the value of protecting them from human activity. 

At the end of the field season, I returned to XXX and was hired by the Bureau of Environmental Services to conduct surveys for the urban forestry department. It was an opportunity to speak directly to residents and communicate not only the proposals of the City, but to engage in a conversation about the importance of trees and the impact of green spaces for urban residents. That year we planted more than 4,000 trees. 

Peppered throughout the years are the small but meaningful contributions I've had the great fortune to be a part of. From monitoring salmon on native lands in Oregon or releasing hawksbill turtles from a hatchery a moonlit beach in Malaysia to initiating cleanups on weekends at the beach. These experiences represent my values, and my commitment ...

For 5 years I have lived in XXX where I teach English to learners of all ages and abilities. I discovered and cultivated a passion for teaching and have had the opportunity to bring my devotion to environmental issues into the classroom. And it is from here that I write to the selection committee at XXX for the opportunity to pursue a passion that I’ve had for as long as I can remember. My work at XXX will be a part of the picture of who I am and the impact I can make on the future. My research interests are wide and my dreams are big. I know that the scope of my thesis will be one of the most important factors of my success. I have been in contact with a professor in the MRM department who has agreed to advise me should I be accepted in this program, and I am confident that he can assist in defining my research topic and breadth. I look forward to working with him and his team next fall.

The Yelp internship is a back-end role in the Commerce team at the SF office. They're paying $46/hr + $1500 housing stipend less taxes.

The Salesforce internship is also a back-end role in the Infrastructure team at the Seattle office. They're paying $44/hr + corporate housing. Apart from this, they also offer overtime pay and corporate insurance plans.

Since they're both similar roles and the pay is more or less the same, I'm looking for an internship experience where I'll learn a lot. Along with that, the company culture and future prospects are extremely important to me. 

I know that Salesforce is one of the best companies to work at, but I've not heard a lot about Yelp.

5haxrv,6,2016-12-08,"What is the Austin, TX internship experience like?",Vonbonnery,IBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBM/comments/5haxrv/what_is_the_austin_tx_internship_experience_like/,"First of all I know this is something I should've done during the interview process but I only had 1 short interview before being sent an offer. I was expecting to go through more interviews, which I would have asked more questions in. I did ask what the internship would be like and got a vague response about being assigned a project and just working on that.

So I was contacted by a manager in the AIX Development organization whose team is responsible for virtualization and file systems development about looking for interns to do systems level and operating level programming in C/C++. I want to know what this would be like. I am not from the Austin area so I would have to rent a 2nd apartment which is making me think I should just turn it down due to that cost and also being away from family/friends the whole summer when I'm from DFW and could likely find an internship there. What specific things could I be assigned to work on? What type of work in general might I be doing? What is the internship program going to be like? Also what are the chances of getting a job from this following the internship?

I know they have other large programs with many interns like IBM Extreme Blue but I am worried this internship will just be me as a single intern by myself on a team of regular employees and that does not seem like a very good experience. It sounds like just some random manager hiring an intern or two to work on their team. I kind of want to be interacting with other interns as well and be part of a class of interns who get taught rather than just thrown a project to work on by myself in the corner. I am hoping for more organization coming from the company rather than just doing the bidding of a single manager. Not sure if that makes sense. My brother interned, and then got a job, with AT&amp;T. His experience sounded good as he was with 50 or so other interns and they had organized activities and lessons for the interns. Would this internship be anything like that?

Thanks in advance."
5hb1dr,9,2016-12-08,Godspeed,teddyroughrider,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5hb1dr/godspeed/,"I haven't posted before, mostly because I don't know that I have anything that interesting to say. In this 65,000 strong ""family"" of ours, I learn, laugh, and get irritated a little bit every day. Today, however, I feel compelled to briefly share something that hit me more than I had expected. 

I don't know what inspires most of you. For some it is the joy that problem solving brings; others it is the promise of a strong career for you and your family; others still may be in engineering due to familial pressures or just because you don't know what else to do. 

I have a passion for the stars that began many years ago, and has carried me through to my now senior year in Aerospace Engineering. The earliest memory I had of being interested in the field was in middle school, when my Algebra teacher rolled in a television on an oversized AV cart (yes, I'm dating myself a bit) to show us John Glenn becoming the oldest person to be launched into space. It meant a lot to many people, and even more to people in my home state of Ohio, where he was already a bit of a legend. Since that day, and through stories that I've read and heard from people fortunate enough to have met him, his story has been one of great inspiration to me, and a huge factor in why I am so committed to the goal of wanting to work at NASA. Sure, there's other factors in there. Some that I mentioned before, some more idealistic, but that image on a 24"" tube television - a rocket, blasting upward for what seemed like an eternity - began a journey that has taken me to where I now am and soon hope to be.

As you may probably know by now, John Glenn passed away today. If you don't know who he is, I respectfully suggest that you read a brief biography on the man, as I think you will find a compelling story therein. When I read the news story of his recent hospitalization yesterday, I didn't think much of it. I knew, at 95 years old, that his time may very well be limited. I wasn't fazed, as he was one of those people I believed was just always going to be around. I'm surprised at how taken aback I was to hear of his passing today, but grateful in how it reinvigorates the idea of making every day better than the one before it.

So, that is my story. What I wanted to get off my chest today, to you, my friends that are represented by nothing more than text on a screen, but that sometimes get me through moments those in the flesh cannot.

I really hope you have a John Glenn. I really hope you have something or someone that drives you to doing the best you can every day, and seeing opportunities in place of failures. Not just in engineering, or even academics in general. But in life, in whatever your passions are, be it writing, music, movies, sports... anything that sets you on fire for each day, I hope that you have one. Even if not, I hope you have loved ones in your life that you can lean on, or even text-based friends if you don't, because I don't believe there is anyone that can't live their dream if they want to. I don't believe any of us wouldn't be there to pick you up if you needed it.

I still don't believe tomorrow, for the first time in nearly a century, there will be a sunrise without John beneath it.

I wish you all nothing but the best for finals, or on your internship, or for the rest of this year and into the new. Please, I would love to hear your story if you would be willing to share.

5hb8f9,1,2016-12-08,I need help evaluating an offer.,throwaway-ols,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5hb8f9/i_need_help_evaluating_an_offer/,"I'm a college senior going into my final semester. I went into an interview for a company looking for an iOS developer internship but left with a offer for an immediate full time position. So's great right? Well here's the details. 

It's a small company doing contract work in mobile and web development. If hired I would be their only iOS developer in a company with less than 10 employees, no designers or QA. Their previous developers left under unknown circumstances. 

I have years of web development experience with one web dev internship under my belt. I've shifted focus unto iOS development for the past 2.5 years and I've published a fairly substantial app on the App Store that I spent a year on (client and server side). I'm looking to get some professional mobile development experience before graduating and in the interview they conceded that I am a great fit for the position.

At the end of this 4 hour interview they offered me $40k for a immediate full time long term position. This in the New Jersey, not far from NYC, where I'm also looking for spring 2017 intern positions. I know $40k is crazy low, far below market rates. Their reasoning is that I don't have the professional experience to leverage a higher salary (which I know is bs). It felt like a gut punch because I know I'm worth more than that. They made it clear that they want someone that will work with them long term and grow with the company. So my hope for just a internship that will complement my FT final semester is out the window. They gave me 5 days until the offer expires.

The crazy part is that I'm actually considering it. I feel like I need the experience but I'm not sure what kind of quality experience I'll get at a company with one iOS developer. As graduation nears there is some anxiety given my admittedly meager resume. If I join them I would definitely leave for a higher paying position post graduation but their stipulation that they are looking for a long term employee could leave some bad blood if I decide to leave after 5 months.

Should I reject the offer and continue looking for a spring internship or post grad FT position? "

I always refuse being fake just for the sake of being accepted by others. 

For as long as I can remember, I always hated the whole process of finding a job, because in my opinion, it involves playing a very specific role perfectly, and if you fail at any point during the whole process, then you're screwed, you don't get the job... and the guy (or girl) who managed to fake the ""I am a perfect employee"" personality will land the job instead of you. That is, regardless of competence.

I mean, how the **** am I supposed to land a job when EVERY. SINGLE. employer is searching for the exact same profile:

* If you don't want to be underpaid for a high qualifications job, you don't get the job.
* If you don't want all of your time and thoughts be related to your job, you don't get the job.
* If you lack confidence in the slightest, you don't get the job.
* If you show any sign of nervousness during the interview, you don't get the job.
* If you don't answer perfectly to every single question in the interview (as in, answer everything like a perfect sheep would), you don't get the job.
* If you don't ask the right questions at the end of the interview, you don't get the job.
* If the interviewer finds you are not dressed well enough, you don't get the job.
* If you don't want to be a slave and work ridiculous hours (night shifts randomly and weekends or just being on call 24/7), you don't get the job.
* If you somehow manage to get confident about yourself, but the interviewer interprets it as being cocky, you don't get the job.
* If you expect a decent salary, you don't get the job.
* If an ethnic minority with a similar resume to yours apply for the same job, you don't get the job because ""equal opportunity"". I might get hate for this one.
* If you don't pretend you are absolutely passionate about what the company you apply at does, you don't get the job.
* If you are desperate about getting a job, you don't get the job.
* If you don't fake smile 100% of the time at the interview, you don't get the job.
* If the interviewer feels you won't ""fit in"", you don't get the job.
* If you don't want to work extra hours for free, don't ever hope to get a job, even at min. wage.
* And many more... 

Then you will all think it's all my fault not getting a job with this ass attitude and whatnot. I just don't get why we still have to go through an interview if you have to play a very specific role just to have a chance of getting a job, when you are not allowed to be yourself at all. I thought an interview was meant to show who I am, instead of showing how well I can fake being someone I am not.

With that said, I am a computer science student, and am at a point in my studies where I have to get an internship for the next semester, which is my last semester before getting my degree (or whatever it's called in English). Being the type of guy who wears T-Shirt + Jeans pretty much every day, and having no money because, you know, a typical poor student, I have no money to spend on clothes that are acceptable at an interview. Even though I think it should not have any kind of influence. Clothings don't define who I am, nor how good/bad I might be in my field.

I don't want to risk spending money on clothes I'll probably wear only for an interview or two, when my personality itself is unemployable, that would just be a waste of money. Then if by any chance I get the internship (which aren't paid), then I won't have money to get clothes that will make me look like ""professional"" at work. Especially since I'll have to get enough outfits for a week, otherwise people will notice I wear the same piece of clothes too often to be normal.

For all those reasons, whenever I go to an interview, I always feel inadequate, and thus I get nervous, inconfident and then I can barely speak fluidly and make sense out of what I say, just because I try to avoid showing the real ""me"", because I know I don't fit the ""perfect little sheep ~~slave~~ worker"" persona. Consequently, my colleagues took all the interesting internships offered in the area, and I'm stuck with none, even though we all have the exact same qualifications.

So, what can I do? How can I feel comfortable being myself during an interview, without fucking it up just because I am being myself?"

I'm a sophomore in college and I'm trying to get better at CS. I started off in business stuff, but have since switched over to CS and am searching for internships. I haven't been getting interviews because of a lack of practical experience with programming, aside from a few very obvious class projects, and a very obvious business focus on my resume. At the same time, I have no clue what I really want to do with respect to front end versus back end development - I only know that I don't have a great eye for design. What can I build over winter break to explore both aspects, that would also help me with my internship search the most?

I'm asking around to try and get a few opinions - one recruiter recommended that I build something in the PLAY framework with Scala, another recommended I learn JS and try for something with React Native, and a friend recommended I go for a conventional Android app built in Java. What are your thoughts?

If a resume is needed for reference/to see where I am at CS-wise, I can post it as well. Any help is much appreciated!

I lived with my parents all the way through college because I wanted to focus on finishing college before getting a job. 

No social support system in my life:
I'm an only child with literally no social life. I have no close friends because I can't relate to my peers who hit puberty and I didn't. I have kallmann syndrome, so I look like guy trapped in a teenager's body. Sometimes I wonder if job interviewers really believe me when I tell them my age. My mom passed away in 2014 and my dad is the only ""family"" I have (his family are all in Peru and my mom's only known family are 2 siblings who live on opposite ends of the United States). 

I ran out of pell grant and fell into student debt:
I studied paralegal studies with the goal of using that knowledge to help me get into the legal field. Then in 2009, my dad couldn't afford paying for rent in New York, so we moved to Pennsylvania. I didn't finish at the 2 year college I attended in New York and the major wasn't available where I moved, so I had to start over (I had to take pre-law/public administration instead). Without even realizing it, I would eventually be using up all my federal Pell grant money. After finishing at the 2 year college in Pennsylvania, I transferred to nearest 4 year college, which happened to be a private college. Private colleges are generally expensive and I ended up getting myself into student loan debt. I thought it would never happen to me, but then it did.

I struggled to pay off my 4 year degree:
My Pell ran out during my final year and I ended up not having enough money to pay off some of my tuition. While I did complete my degree, I couldn't receive it until the tuition was payed. I managed to find and keep a job just long enough to pay it off, but soon after that I had no job. My degree was going to be Criminal Justice, but it required an internship and my adviser didn't think I was able to handle that, so I graduated with a bachelor's in Liberal Studies instead. During my final semester, I took some business courses as well.

I can't drive, my dad won't let me!
Now I live with my dad who is still a renter and self-employed (my mom recently passed away). Since my dad's clients are mostly from New York, sometimes he has to go over there. I get food stamps from welfare and I have to go with my dad when ever we need to buy food. Having a degree doesn't help much with getting a job when I still have to lean to drive, but my overprotective father refuses to let me."

I´m about to finish my research master in social and organizational psychology and I´m really interested in working at the intersection of datascience, (social) psychology and marketing.

What bothers me about my field is that there is a HUGE amount of real time data that we could use to learn about human behaviour, but we´re not using it. Psychologists basically still invite 100 students to their labs, do an experiment and then spent the rest of the year trying to get that published, while nobody has use for their results. I decided that this approach is not for me.

In my degree, I learned inferential statistics (ANOVA, Multiple Regression, GLM, multivariate regression and some non-parametric techniques) and I can do these kinds of analyses in SPSS and R. We also learned about survey construction, causal inference, and experimental designs and of course how to interpret results. As a ""bonus"" I also probably now more about the psychological theories that explain human behaviour, which might help in some circumstances.

What I´m clearly lacking are skills in programming, machine learning and database management, which I hope to acquire now so that I can work my way  up from internships/traineeships.

Regarding this, I have some questions that some of you might be able to answer:

- would you say that with my background it is even worth to apply to data-science internships? A friend of mine pulled it off but he also had programming as a hobby for a long time, so I´m not sure whether this is a viable way in?

- Is Python a good programming language to start with or would something more specific like SQL be more useful? I found this online course that sounds pretty good, maybe sombody here took it and has an opinion? (https://www.datacamp.com/getting-started?step=2&amp;track=python)

- Most basic courses like ""Intro to Datascience"" seem to basic for me (with entire lectures devoted to ""How to install R studio"" and ""making barplots""). Are you aware of any courses directed at people with medium knowledge of R that have never done ML or worked with BigData before?

I've been offered a couple-months full-time unpaid IT internship for at a small company/training center for my field of interest, with the offers of free classes and some money after it ends. Thing is I want to do this because I think it's a good place to network, I want to work with tech and in IT, and I can really develop my skills here. But it is still unpaid-ish and full-time so I would have to quit one of my jobs right now.

On the other hand, I have an upcoming interview for a paid customer service job--something I feel okay with--for a big startup-ish company that is somewhat related to my field of interest and there is room for movements if I can get the job. 

So my question is should I accept the internship and interview for the big company? If I go through with their recruitment cycle and get the job, how wrong it is to jump ship and take the paying job that I feel average towards? Should I just take the internship and continue my frugal lifestyle?

**tl;dr Take an unpaid internship that I really want to do or interview for a paid job that I feel average towards?**

edit: Some more info: the training center trains professionals in media production software as well as Mac IT software. I also graduated with a marketing degree in May and I find my network too limited to my school, so it hasn't help me get a job in the city that I currently now live in (all my degree/experience does is get me high-pressure sales/cold call interviews). I do agree that I should get paid to work, but due to the lack of a proper degree and zero experience in IT and a small network in my current city, I think this is a good starting point and at least 60% of interns have went on to be full-time employees.

5hhlm4,1,2016-12-09,Which MS Degree should I choose to advance my career??,NovDjokovic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5hhlm4/which_ms_degree_should_i_choose_to_advance_my/,"Background: I have a BS in EE from a top 3 private science/engineering school and currently an engineer in the R&amp;D team in a hot wearable device company startup that went IPO in 2015, based in SF. 

I started as an intern in 2014 and moved to full-time engineer. We don't really have much title delineations, but my role currently is equal to other mid-level engineers. Over the last 2 years, I've worked my butt off and had three raises and one promotion and earned the respect of my peers  (My team is 95% Ph.Ds and M.S CS/EE nerds from competitive schools)

Today I work pretty cross-functionally as a tech lead (sensor dev, firmware dev, algorithm dev, data analysis, and hardware engineering )

Goal:
I want to move up to engineering/technical leadership/management roles within my org as soon as possible. Without at at an MS Degree, I think I would look like a joke trying to be a manager of Ph.Ds. 

Schools accepted so far(all distance programs so that I keep accruing industry exp):

UIUC MCS/Georgia Tech OMSCS (30k and 7k total cost) - these two have top CS programs and my thinking is that it'll diversify my skill set in hot technical domains of the future (ML, AI, Robotics/Perception)

Cornell MEng Systems Engineering (50k tot. but could be 25k or less with merit based scholarship) - my rational is that systems level thinking is very important for managers and I didn't want a soft-skill degree like Masters of Engineering Management. Also relates to Operations, which I do have an interest in learning more on. Results of merit scholarship is yet to be determined, but I can expect a huge price of 50k if no aid.

what do you guys think?

5hhrxq,2,2016-12-09,"Had 1 bad help desk job, scared of trying another",RustyShakleferd,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5hhrxq/had_1_bad_help_desk_job_scared_of_trying_another/,"First off, I'm looking for any advice that might help me feel a little better about trying another IT job.  I know that one job doesn't represent all of the jobs in the IT world but I would like to hear some opinions on how different it can be because I'm very much discouraged with the idea of trying another IT job.   Let me start with my story:


  My first job out of college was as a help desk technician for a small IT office supporting a large and growing number of car dealerships.  I got the job through a local recruiting agency who were very helpful and talked up the job like it would be the perfect fit for me.  Originally I interviewed for a position as their third help desk team member.  My job would be half help desk and half web development but when I showed up on my first day they informed me that they had lost their second help desk and that my job would now be just help desk.  They said they would find a 3rd person in the near future.  I roll with it because i want to make a good impression and quickly find that im doing well at my job.  2 weeks later they hire someone but they are assigned solely to web development.  At this point i feel like i'm already being taken advantage of and that I have been bamboozled into taking a job i didn't want, as i had told my recruiter i didn't want a help desk job where i would be on the phone 24/7.  Anyway, come to find out later on that the 2nd help desk that they 'lost' just before i got there was fired for being awful at customer service.  He was there for 2 weeks.  So they clearly knew how they were going to play me to get me into that job. 

My boss told me on my first day to just take calls, make tickets, and try to learn as much as you can.  I realized right away that if i wasn't going to resolve any tickets, they were quickly piling up to an unmanageable amount.  The other help desk focused solely on critical tickets and there was no way he was going to make it through to the rest.  So in order to make the help desk look good for both of us, I started working on resolving some issues as well as recording them within a week of starting my job.    I was told that there was supposed to be a monthly rotation from answering the phones to working on critical tickets, but that never materializes.   A month later I was absolutely drowning in the number of calls that were pouring in and i begin to see why there was supposed to be a 3rd help desk but my manager insists that ""this job can and has been done by 1 person. 2 is a luxury.""  So I work on trying to resolve everyone's issues that i can and pass up the more time consuming ones to the other help desk.  This kept the ticket list looking reasonable and i received a lot of positive reviews.  Things seem to be leveling out for a bit.

Now 2 and a half months have gone by and i'm getting by with my nose above water.  Then i find out that our office is moving further away from my house (from a 5 minute commute to 30) and the lead help desk is getting promoted to DBA.  I would be the new lead help desk which would include weekly on-call hours and working weekends at least once a month.  This sounded like a nightmare scenario as i have been watching this guy pull his hair out for almost 3 months straight and hes been doing this job for over 2 years now.  He's been under more stress than me the entire time, and now i'm expected to jump into his seat??? Not cool.  So they hire a new intern to start the process and i realize right away that I'm not going to be getting any help from this person and also, it might be a while before they hire someone who can given their hiring history.  This intern can barely log a ticket, much less troubleshoot and oh yeah their internship ends in 2 months.  I'm essentially going to be on my own on this help desk with an increasing workload and increasing difficulty of work, all within 3 months of starting my first entry level job.

Wrap all of this up inside of the fact that my boss didn't like the idea of having two people with the same name in the office, so he forced me to go by my nickname.  He jokingly asked me in the interview to go by my middle name and I casually agreed to my nick name thinking it would just be an in-office thing. Nope, everyone thought it was my real name. I was even in active directory as my nick name.  Something about that really bothered me and when you tacked on all of the other circumstances, I lost it.  I told my boss that I would not be staying on board with the company when my contract expired, which was 2 weeks away.  

They took this news poorly.  The IT manager was ready to let me go with no questions, but the CTO came to me a week later and offered me a different job as a half field tech / help desk to try to get me to stay because my main complaint was the workload on the phone.  I accepted the offer thinking it would get me away from my phone a lot more.  2 days later my IT manager comes to me and says that ""he can't offer me my dream job"" and that the job just doesn't exist, even though we have a field technician and a growing client base.  The way I see it, he just wasn't willing to create a new job for me which I understand is a lot to ask but I'm a little confused as to why the CTO would offer it to me and then not say anything else to me after i find out that it can't be done.

All in all, i was starting to feel like i was getting good at my job but i just couldn't handle the stress that was continuously being poured onto a very new employee.  Is this kind of stuff common in the industry or is it possible for me to find a help desk job that I won't dread going to every day?  I could really use some positive advice because at this point i'm ready to take up any other job just thinking about going back into that environment.  


TL;DR suck it and please read my post! :)

I recently accepted an internship offer for next semester, after a lot of hard work and trial and error, and I'm super pumped about it.  
Problem is, I need to take a hair drug test this week, and I'm not sure I'll pass it. Allegedly THC can be detected in hair for three months with such a test, and I've smoked marijuana three times over that time period, the last time being about a month ago.  
I feel like the odds of me passing are slim. I have four prescriptions for various symptoms of bipolar II, and I'm also not sure how that will play into such a test or skew the results either way.  
If anyone else has been in a similar predicament, I would really appreciate any input or advice. At the end of the day I'm aware that this is entirely my own fault but it's still very frustrating given the amount of blood, sweat, and tears I've put into my schooling and into preparing for an experience like this that I might lose it."

Apologies for the wall of text.

I'm currently finishing up my last two courses for my BSc in Psychology. When I started this degree, I was unsure of what I wanted to major in, and felt this was the right path at the time. Halfway through the degree I came to the conclusion that Psychology would not be the field I wanted to continue in. Nonetheless, I decided to stick with it, with the mindset that since I was halfway through, that I might as well finish the degree. Unfortunately, this did not turn out as hoped - I felt extremely exhausted, depressed and out of steam. My overall GPA progressively fell to a little over 2.0 which resulted in me being kicked out of university for one year. 

I took the year off as an opportunity to explore the IT field. I managed to get into a one-year intensive AEC (Attestation of Collegial Studies) program in Network Administration, which I loved and ended up doing well in. This opportunity allowed me to secure an 3-month internship, and was asked back for a 5-month paid work contract doing mostly technical support work. 

Fast-forward to the last few months, where I managed to get re-admitted to university, and have been working to finish up my remaining courses for my Psychology degree.

At this point, I am left with wondering what steps to take for the future. I would ideally like to work in the cybersecurity field, and want to keep taking steps towards that goal. I currently have a part-time job that is totally unrelated to the IT field. Would it be advisable to look for an IT-related part-time job, and then to try to complete a second BSc in Computer Science while working? I have also considered applying for a post-graduate diploma in Computer Science, but am not sure if this would carry the same weight as a Bachelor's degree. 

TL;DR Finishing up a BSc in Psychology. Wondering whether the next best step would be to complete a 2nd BSc in Computer Science while having a part-time IT job. "

My goal is to transfer to UC Davis for Economics. Since the major is so short (only around 45 upper division units), I plan to do 2 minors, one in technology management and the other in applied computing and information systems. I was wondering what kind of careers can an econ major along with a information systems minor bring to employers. I am not looking to go into a finance route for any of you wondering... that's why I feel like managerial econ at Davis isnt for me.

I might try a CS minor but it's unlikely since I hated the intro C++ course at my CC. I also don't want to double major at all.

A career that I have some interest in is business analyst or something similar; will this combo along with internships ofcourse give me the skills for this career. Any other career option or opinion about something is greatly appreciated"

5hkaqv,5,2016-12-10,"General advice for my situation? (CS, applying for master's programs)",FreakyCheeseMan,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5hkaqv/general_advice_for_my_situation_cs_applying_for/,"Sorry this is so broad. Just new to the process, trying to figure out what to say, what to avoid and what to stress. Okay. My situation, as succinctly as I can, in order of what I'm guessing is how much it helps my application:

 * Math and CS double major, looking for master's program in CS

 * Flunked out the first time I went to college.

 * Went back two years later, actually succeeded (and then some).

 * During my second run of college, both my parents got diagnosed with cancer and died, with me as their primary caretaker alongside classes.

 * Wrote an undergraduate thesis on static analysis techniques for memory management (which is basically the area I want to go into). Just a survey paper, not original research, though.

 * Worked with a research group on adversarial machine learning my first year back. Only ""hard"" product was a related group project for the professor in one of his classes a while later, but I read/summarized papers for the group, and was the only one working on my particular sub-domain.

 * GRE scores - 98th percentile in verbal and analytic, 89th in math.

 * Internship with an AI research firm doing scheduling software for sattelite communications. Wrote the entire security system for one of their software products (password management/encryption, public-key token system for session authentication)

 * Took most of the tougher classes offered. I think I took all of the 400-level classes required for grad students at my university. 

 * Grades: 3.13 GPA overall, 3.75 since coming back to college, 3.99 in CS since coming back. (4.3 scale. Got a single B+ in CS since coming back.)

 * I have three letters of reccomendation (Thesis advisor, research supervisor and one professor who just seemed to like me, whose class I did really  well in.) I don't know how good the letters will be as letters go, but at least they're there.

 * Kicked ass in an ACM programming contest. It was only tier 2, but we won our site 7-2 and took second in the region. Two-person team, I was the math/algorithms guy.

I should mention, I'm not *just* starting now. I already have a couple of applications out, and a couple more I'm doing final revisions for. Just looking for things I need to change for other Dec. 15th deadlines, or the couple of later-deadline schools I'm applying to.

Oh, reasons for grad school: I want better job opprotunities, I want to try my hand at research to see if I should go for a PhD, and I want to go back to school for a few years beause it's fun.

Right now most of my personal statements are generally structured like:
 
 * Intro about either flunking out and returning to college, or finishing college despite dying parents. For the latter, my theme is always ""Having school in my life is what made me able to cope.""
 * Research experience section on adversarial machine learning and thesis
 * Optional ""Motivation"" section on why grad school and why their grad school in particular (and maybe why my particular subject, but I usually just cover that in the research experience section)
 * Conclusion paragraph, usually stressing either work ethic (""I've spent a lot of time in situations where hard work wasn't rewarded. Computer science isn't one of them. In this domain, when I put in the effort, I get results. It took me a long time to recognize what a singularly good deal that is, but I won't be forgetting anytime soon."") or why I think academia in general is a natural fit for me.

Okay, that's my situation. Anyone who has more experience with this process got any advice? Things I should lean on? Things I should keep my mouth shut about?

I've always been involved with technology.  I built my first computer from scratch at 13.  I have a BA in communications.  I worked in television/film industry in NYC for the last 8 years in mostly technical roles.  I deliver videos to online streaming platforms like Amazon/Netflix for TV Networks and also international broadcast.  Some of the clients have been for major networks that you definitely watch.  I've also done video editing and shooting.  I've been successful, but I honestly hate the industry and the location (NYC).  

I'm older (29), but I have no debt from undergrad.  No wife or kids.  

I devised a plan to move and go back to school.  I'm looking to pursue a Masters in Computer Science at Portland State University.  This school seems to be the most efficient way in terms of time and money.  This is one of the few schools that will take someone with a BA for a Masters in Computer Science.  A second bachelors would actually take longer than a Masters and many schools do not want this kind of student either.  PSU also has significantly lower tuition.  The name isn't noteworthy, but it's a state university so it's good enough.  And the Pacific Northwest is at the top of my list for relocation.  So I would be able to look for jobs immediately in Portland and Seattle after graduating.

Reading this subreddit has already taught me a lot about the industry.  My plan was to get into Security, but the more I read this subreddit, the more I realize that's more of a long term goal that requires a high amount of skills and a lucky opportunity.  It also seems like the backgrounds of people interested in IT in this subreddit range from people with a high school diploma doing tech support to people working at Fortune 500 companies.  I want to work at a big company in a medium sized city like Seattle or Portland.  I'm trying to shoot high here, I'm fine with working day and night learning skills or getting an advanced degree.

I'm not sure where I want to specialize in yet, but ultimately I do not want to be creative or to create a product which is why I've leaned away from development.  I have no quarrels with learning programming, I just don't want to be in a role where I have to produce something for someone.  I've also done a lot of video editing in film/television and I learned that I'm not an artist. 

I'm still serious about getting into Security over the long term, despite the hurdles.  What kind of entry level and mid level positions should I be targeting for this path?  Sysadmin?

My plan is to focus on getting as many solid internships/co-op as possible during grad school.  PSU has some relationships with Nike and Intel in Portland, but I think I will have to do most of the leg work.  And I'm sure those two companies are highly competitive.  I have to fulfill some prereqs to complete the master so I will be in school for about 3 to 4 years.  I'm hoping the fact that I have some noteworthy professional experience will help me get my foot in the door at my first job.  Or even first internship.

But how do I get started in the field?  In my previous career I had success, but I really didn't prepare to find a job until after I graduated.  And even then I think I got lucky.  This time I want to be prepared for my career from the very start.

**TLDR: Career Change.  BA in different field.  Professional technical experience in different field.  Going for a Masters in Computer Science.  How do I get my foot in the door?**"

He just came in one day because our original boss decided to start another business and everyone have to adjust to him so suddenly.

We shifted from our old office(shared office space) to a new office/home (it is like a half office/half apartment kind of space) so technically we work in his ""apartment"" He is especially nice to this one lady staff and treated everyone as nonchalently. The guy staff got it the worst.

Some ridiculous things he did
1) He asks the guy staff to sit down to pee in ""his toilet"" instead of standing to ""ensure cleanliness""
2) No one is allowed to leave their jacket on their chair/ slippers at their workstations/ nothing can be left on the table eg. No bottles if it is not work related (I mean seriously it is technically an office for us not our house shouldn't we be able to put what we need?)
3) We cannot put anything in the fridge because it is his. (I'm sorry but this is because the old office space has a pantry and fridge which we can put what we want and now it is taken away from us) People gets hungry you know?
4) He doesn't exactly know how the job is done and he just kept throwing work at you/ any problems he faced and always  waiting for us to solve his issues. When he did try to help he messes everything up and sorry was what he says. We receive the scolding from the clients and I feel like we wouldn't have to do extra work if he done things right in the first place. When the guy staff makes a mistake he would say things like this is your job, you should know how to handle it. In short he it just giving orders because he is the boss and if one day everyone quits at the same time, he will be in deep shit because he knows nothing.
5) He kept trying to crack stupid jokes and the way he acts ""kawaii"" in front of girls just makes my hair stand.
6) We have to clean the entire table in his apartment before he comes back from his business trip because he don't want to see a mess.
7) Sometimes he messages in japanese and expect us non-japanese to understand. When I told him about this he just says he forgots. I mean seriously how can you forget because we are not even in Japan.
8) He doesn't allow us to swear and when I accidentally says minor stuff like 'shit' when I messes things up he will give me the death stare like I murdered his family. I mean this is not even a school. (I swear in school as well)
9) I really thought he would be nicer to people of his own country but no. He took advantage of this one jap intern asking him to wash his dishes, buy lunch and get sales for the company when he is only paid 500 a month. The intern decided to end off his internship a month earlier because something happened back home and he threatened not to pay him.
10)He fired this one lady staff because she was honest and told him the hard truth and she got fired with one day notice not due to work and did not even raise our pay when we are doing more because we are understaff.

This gender discrimination/two-faced/psychopathic/control freak/micro managing behaviour is getting on my nerves.   I really love this job before he arrives. It is him that is the problem. I know some people will say just quit. I've tried applying for other jobs but the economy is seriously so bad and honestly i think it will just take months for a switch. How do we get rid of him or how to deal with him?

After graduating I applied for internships and got denied or no responses. I panicked and applied for any job I could and have been in retail for 1 year now. 

In four months I will be 2 years out of college without a full time job. I've been saving money to get equipment, a computer, camera, etc because I didn't have enough money when I got out of school.

Now I am worried that it will be a waste of money because my skills have rusted so my low confidence is even worse. 

I don't know where to go. If I should pursue a masters or another degree or whatever. I really don't want to be trapped in retail but I  feel like I don't have any good skills. 

Is there any way to get out of this situation? "

First level was basic html, css and Java from basics up to file i/o and I understood all of it. 
Second level was using the mvc framework with c# and a sql database 
3rd level we had to do most research ourselves. But I learnt some angular, using web apis and using mvc framework. 

Now I'm at a stage where I know the basics and how to build something functional but I don't know enough to get a job from it. 

But whenever I work on something, most the process involves me looking how to do each part of the program, I'll know what to do but not how to do it. Problem is, I don't learn much about the framework or library I'm using. And it'll involve a lot of bad code because I don't have anyone to check my code. 

What would be the best way to become good at the things I already know and learn more things so I can atleast get an internship. I think of projects to work on, but I know it'll involve the same process as before, constantly looking up each part I want to create, then ending up with whatever I need but barely learning anything. It's like I'm always looking things up and have to spend so much time getting the simplest things to work. 

Any advice would be appreciated. "

I also commute, which makes me hate going to school because I'm an hour away and it is very hard to get involved on campus or make friends.  I considered moving there, but it would put me into even MORE debt. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, I've run out of ideas.  I worked so hard at community college to get into this school, and now I can't even fully enjoy it because of my situation(s).  My mental health is slowly deteriorating.  Any advice or words of encouragement are very much appreciated.

Months have passed and here I am reflecting and a bit let down because I feel my skill and passion will be left to rot. Startup industry from what I hear is nowadays unpredictable so the only 'safe' option I have is the MNC offer which I honestly don't feel like going with.

Hello all, I'm a junior in college, but got somewhat of a late start into programming. I didn't apply to any summer internships the past quarter because I was very heavily focused on my grades (they were terrible) and didn't want to bother wasting time doing something that I had little chance of achieving. I just have a hunch that I won't be accepted into any internships and wanted to see if I'm somewhat correct on that. 

My experiences are:

- 4 months learning SQL Server
- Intro course on Java
- Intro course on R
- Basic HTML/CSS
- UX Internship at a startup the past summer

If my hunch comes to be true, I will probably take summer courses and get as much practice as I can, work on a project, or do a GIS internship (I'm a Geography major) as a stepping stone.

First I want to say thanks for everyone being really helpful in this subreddit!

So here is my situation right now, I have 2 semesters left to get my associate in computer science and I am really excited. Not to brag or sound arrogant, but I love programming and I am really good at it. I am confident in my skills and If when I come across something new I have the ability to grasp it and dive deep into the concepts.

I have been thinking, I dont want to graduate with a bachelor degree and have lots of debts, plus I dont want to have to wait couple of more years to launch my career. And to be honest, its not like all the knowledge is not already available on the internet. I will eventually get a bachelor's degree though but I wanna make sure I can afford it; last thing I want is student loans.

What can I do to launch my career when I get my associate degree? Would it be better to get an full time paid internship to start off? or get an entry level full time position if I could? Is that even a possibility since I will be mostly competing with 4 year graduates? 

I would love to hear some experiences and opinions, I really appreciate it!"

- $24/hr
- 3 month internship
- $650 relocation bonus
- $1k/month in rent
- 200+ interns in program
- Would be working with IBM System Z firmware (java based)

- Security Clearance
- $20/hr
- 3 month internship
- 2-6 interns in program
- ~$700/month rent (no relocation bonus)
- Cyber Security related work (couldn't specify), Java based.

- IBM has a large industry presence, but I'm not sure how much weight it holds when compared to other companies like Google, Facebook, etc...

Right, so like the title says, I'm headed back to school to start my CS degree next semester (Spring 2017). Since I'm trying to expedite the process to graduate in Spring 2019, as well as when I can take certain classes due to when they're offered, as well as needing required pre-reqs, I'll be taking summer classes next summer (Summer 2017). Since I'll need an internship at some point, that leaves me with getting one for Summer 2018.

But I'm concerned whether or not I'll even stand a chance. A lot of companies, especially the Big 4, require you to apply in the Fall for the next Summer. Unfortunately, if I apply next Fall for Summer 2018, I'll only have completed *two* CS classes at that point, and only the intro ones at that (since the bulk of my CS classes will be taken while I'm applying/after I apply). 

My question is: since I'll have limited experience when I'll be applying, how big of a disadvantage will I be at for say, a Big 4 company? Do interns get hired on with limited experience even for an intern? Will I even be offered an interview, period? What about any internship in general?

Three days later, GS replied with an offer of 85k/yr. I am a sophomore at uiuc and have no other offers currently so I am leaning towards GS. So, a few questions:

1) I haven't had any SWE internships before and so wanted a legit SWE internship for the summer but I've heard Goldman tech is old and irrelevant; should I keep on applying to other more core tech companies? 

2) I already feel like I am becoming a corporate shill by joining GS. I know a 9-5 internship timing might be common for all companies but I feel like I am heading in the direction of taking up a job like this after graduation instead of working on some startup of my own. Am I overthinking this? 

3) Before the interview for GS, I really wanted the position and now that I have it, I feel like it isn't a big deal. Do many people get GS summer analyst offers? Are there any statistics on this? I feel like not many people choose to work for GS because they have better offers from more core tech companies. 

4) If before summer, Goldman is my only offer. Should I take it up? I know I wouldn't be able to work on any side projects during the internship since I've heard it's a lot of work. Or should I try and work on my own personal projects and try to get a mediocre job along the way? 

5) How does GS's salary offer compare with the big 4 or other internships? 

I'd really appreciate your insight on this matter; so, thank you!

1. Get back into my industry and study code on the side. I will learn code, albeit slower but I can acrue a lot of months before I apply for my first full time dev job. PROS: I can make good money CONS: will most likely be working in construction with long hours and stress on top of having to learn code when I get home.

2. get a job at a tech related company doing non developer tasks and learn code on the side. This might be a bit harder to achieve since I don't have experience outside of civil/construction. Would working at a low IT job such as the Help Desk advance my career in any way? PROS: Will have my foot in the door with a tech company. CONS: Unsure of if I even qualify with my resume.

3.ask around and take contract/temp work maybe an internship in dev. Although the pay might be low, I can get into the industry. I saved up enough to be able take a pay cut anyways. I'm in kansas city so it might not be a hotbed of small tech companies around here that can hand out work.

Intern and get work experience NOW, b/c it will haunt you if you don't.",CityLiver12345,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5hz70m/folks_dont_make_my_terrible_mistake_intern_and/,"I'm living in New York and graduated seven years ago, so my experiences are very different...plus, I'm sorry if these are obvious, recommendations.

Anyway:
1) treat college as a job recruiting ground--every department connection (do you have an adjunt that might have a sweet internship/volunteering recommendation)?, every friend in your major. It really is who you can turn to down the line and say, I need a job.

2) The horrible thing is literally every entry level job these days seems to expect college students to learn all the skills one might need for a mid level job - excel for data entry or accounting; a certain amount of bookeeping; salesforce or similar database programs. Possible even MS Access. Adobe Photoshop and some html/web design. It's all versatile. 

I was stupid; my sociology degree in gender/welfare makes me far, far less valuable than the person with a digital marketing degree who will not only make more money than me, but is more valuable to not-for-profits where we're competing for, say, administrative jobs. 

There are some common things--stuff you'll learn writing for your papers, but....know more than that. If you can learn Quickbooks (big plus in entry level office jobs in any major company) for basic accounting, do it. If you can learn Adobe Creative Suite for a school paper, do it. If you can write for ANYONE, in any recreational respect--group blog, online school newspaper, personal tumblr of reviews, TED Talks--do so.

I am applying for receptionist jobs now but the major employers hiring want creative types with experience and they want references. 

Go on Craigslist and really take a look at the internships and the software asked for the skills....now.

3) Don't put off going to your career services office.
I'm very lucky, that's one thing my school got right.

It takes four years to build up basic computer skills, poise to get through an interview, write a good resume tailored to a specific job, get used to the grind of writing cover letters, and develop transferable skills that will get you in the day to data entry/analysis, event planning, coordinating with clients...all of which can be tailored across different fields into jobs to keep a roof over your head.

I wish someone had taken me by the hand and warned me a decade ago, but I was forced into graduate school for a field I had zero interest in that was highly specialized and horrifically underpaid.

I would not go to grad school unless you MUST--I'm sure those of you in the medical or engineering fields have to. It's a huge waste of money and physical energy. Be very careful about the program you choose and their requirements to graduate (the fieldwork, the reviews of professors, the number of credits assigned to ""x"" number of work). I've seen it all. Try to get as high a gpa as you can now based on the same criteria and if you can't get into a graduate school with good accrediation and a strong career placement for you field...RUN. Really, just fucking run in the other direction. Look into another route. Get your GPA up some other way.

See college as the first step feeding up the ladder into employment.

The sad thing is it's wonderful and you're learning how to write and think as a community but employers give fuckall about giving you that experience in the future until you can demonstrate basic, technical use to them, generating content (again--even for a basic receptionists or data entry job for an industry that specifies they only need a receptionist, but interviewed as if they would only hire someone with 5 years experience performing the same content creation tasks they did) or demonstrating office/marketing experience (and multiple fields, including not-for-profits, want people that do that or have skills in that. Hell, receptionists are now expected to ""market"" their organizations). 

You need to have all these skills for jobs that might pay $13/hour.
Get it now, even if it's unfair you should be obligated to treat this time as job training time too.

P.S. You can totally count on campus jobs or that 3 month internship/stint."

I have been told that a bachelors in math is not anywhere near as good as a comp sci degree. Are there any other degrees/job tittles that would enable me the same job market that orient themselves less to having to write code. Does a computer science degree also qualify me for jobs not related to computer science and more using the stuff I learn in math classes? What job titles that have high pay would I be able to do?

Now I have to pick a direction.",fiscal_tiger,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/5i09y3/time_to_make_a_decision_industry_or_grad_school/,"### Quick background:

So as the title said, I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.  Up until now, everything had a logical next step.  I graduated high school, so I went to college.  I needed experience, so I got a internship and so on and so forth.  I always loved coding and solving the problems in my classes.  I decided to try out embedded software for one internship, and really found the company drab and the topic boring.  I then worked for a startup and that was a lot of fun because they had be doing important things for their business, rather than busy work.  I believe that I enjoyed the backend parts of web dev in that role the most.  I am not a huge fan of front end because it seems like it would get really tedious quickly.  I really enjoy a challenge, and when I find something I can really buy into I will just go full bore on it.  
### Current situation:
So now I find myself at a fork in the road.  I have an offer from a company that is the sort of R&amp;D department of a much larger company.  They pay well and seem to offer challenging work.  On the other hand I have a research fellowship offer for grad school at a prestigious NSF funded research center.  I have done some research during my undergraduate career and I enjoyed it, but from what I have heard grad school is like having a full time job on top of classes.  On the other hand, I really enjoyed being able to have a work life balance during my internships.  

### Questions:
1. If you are in my field, where should I expect to be in 2 or 3 years for the route you are in?

2. How hard is it to get into industry with such a research focused degree?

3. How hard is it to get into a masters program after a few years in industry?


P.S. Sorry if seems like bragging, I have worked hard to get this point and I am genuinely lost.  I just don't want all my hard work to go to waste by selecting a path I will not enjoy."
5i0j20,1,2016-12-12,I graduate on Saturday and still have not heard from my internship about full-time,lsthrowaway22213,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5i0j20/i_graduate_on_saturday_and_still_have_not_heard/,"So long story short, I started a paid internship at a very successful startup (5 years old at this point) in June. I worked until August because I had to go back to school. I graduate in December (this Saturday) and did a pretty good job gaining my own accounts and generating revenue for the company so my boss offered me a part-time offer working remotely (I accepted). All semester I've been working part-time while finishing my degree and I've gotten many compliments from my boss about my performance (albeit not without some bumps in the road but he's even told me he understood). In one instance he even told me that I was exceeding quota for what they would from a full-time worker.

Now, I know a full-time offer isn't a guarantee AT ALL. Our meeting after Thanksgiving I kinda kept dropping hints about a position and he told me they would actually like to hire me come January ""assuming the money is right."" Ok, so I was content with that response for the meantime.

Now, flash forward to last week. We use Slack, which is an IM app for teams to communicate with each other. I was searching for something sent between me and him and I stumbled upon a channel that I don't think he knew I was able to see...it was only him and the other two higher up people. It was mostly just talking about prices of projects and stuff but I was looking back more and apparently they were interviewing this guy for the full-time role that I'm gunning for and in the chat my boss asked the other two if they would prefer him or me and all three said me. My boss even went as far to say ""I really just want to make an offer next week"" and ""We can start him on Jan 2."" Going down the chat a little more, he mentions when I asked in our post-Thanksgiving meeting about how I kept asking about the job and was like ""do I have your blessings to tell him we want to hire him assuming the money is right (which it is?)"" and also went on in another day saying how ""we're gonna need to buy [my name] a new computer, I can take this old one.""

I stopped looking at their chat after that just because I felt wrong but I graduate this weekend and still have not heard anything. Would I be in the wrong to bring up the job again? Or would I just be pushing buttons and being a pain in the ass? I think it's a little obvious that they're prepping me for a full-time position when the new year hits but idk. I'm so stressed out about this to the point where I'm feeling sick because I would like to enjoy this week knowing I'll have a job. I was thinking of messaging him something like ""so what do I do next week?"" tomorrow or something along those lines but I'm not sure if that comes off as too passive aggressive. "

Here's hoping no one in my office reddits. 

So I've been working at my current job since graduating last year and did an internship in the same position last summer. I like the people at my job and the office environment for the most part but the work itself is incredibly boring and not the industry I ever thought I would end up in. My bosses have been wonderful to me though and were very accommodating to me when I was ill and only able to work part time for a couple of months. 

However I'm very unhappy with the work I do, and am living alone in a city with no social life and no friends. I've always wanted to travel and decided to take a course on teaching English to non-native speakers. I got accepted to a program that is being taught overseas and I will be leaving to do this in early April. I'm really excited for this opportunity, I've been talking about doing it for the past two years but needed a degree and the chance to save some money first before pursuing it. 

Quitting my job would be simple, except that I was just told that I will be sent on an international trip for training in the new year, which, as much as I'd like to go on this trip, I couldn't do it with a clear conscience knowing that I'll be quitting less than a month after the trip. I'm worried about telling my boss too early, and getting fired before having the time to save up as much as I have planned to. But I also worry about doing it too late and wasting everyone's time and money. I feel like this company has treated me well and I don't want to just go on some free trips and then turn around and say ""oops sorry I'm quitting!"" Especially when the time between the trip and when I will be leaving for my course is literally within a few weeks. 

When is the best time to tell my boss I'm quitting? Should I look out for myself, by telling them after the trip? Or help them out, by telling them before and possibly getting fired (bad on resume) and screwing myself out of an extra $2000-3000+ that I really need to pay for the course and flights? I want to be a good person, but I also really don't want to get fired. Help.

I've currently moved back home with my parents in a tiny town with pretty much no job opportunities and have been stressing about this. I know I fucked up and would have changed so much if I could but that's in the past now.

The first is as a 4 month internship at a game development firm. My inner gamer is screeching in agony because I haven't pick this one. The other is as a graduate web developer, 3-month probationary period after which I'll be employed full time.

Now if I can tell my 12-yo self that I just got offered a space at a game dev firm, I know I would die of excitement. And trust me, I am excited and I think what they do is amazingly interesting. The problem is that the pay is eh (game dev standards) and I'll be working long hours with lots of overtime and as an example, no time off between Christmas and New Year. I would be sacrificing time with my loved ones and leaving my hobbies in the dust while working like a mule.

The web dev role is obviously less interesting, but the pay is a bit more stable, the hours more reasonable and I'll have free time to pursue my hobbies (such as my hobby game dev project I've been tackling in my free time). Their clientele also includes some really big names in the financial services industry, so I'll be building up really good connections.

And yet, I can't decide. I've listed the pros and cons of each, I've asked my friends for input, etc. I'm still no closer to a decision than I was when I received the offers. I've never been this conflicted in my life. Can someone give me some advice on how to resolve this inner conflict?"

Currently attending a University going for a CIS degree. Recently I have been realizing that I am more interested in Management Information Systems... but my University only offers Computer Information Systems. I am finding out the more I look in to Management Information Systems I am beginning to realize that I am more interested in the business side of IT rather than the ""technical"" and ""hands-on"" aspect of it.

Thing is, financial it would be really difficult for me to transfer schools and living situations. Also, I have a really good internship with a very good and successful wealth management company that I am going to regret if I leave.

Throwaway account as for reasons I can't have this post associated with my main account.

I have an undergraduate degree in social sciences before completing a one year conversion Masters in Information Technology.  The name is a bit of a misnomer as it was mostly software development based, but I digress.

I decided that I wanted to follow a software development path once I finished.  I have had lots of job interviews for Graduate Software Developer roles but unfortunately have either been beaten by portfolios which I have not had the time to develop during my Masters (I am working on stuff now) or my fluffing up on technical questions which I do know but I sometimes need a gentle prodding to get me started.

Someone in my city on reddit pointed me towards their company for graduate testing roles and I thought 'Well why not'.  So far I have been through a telephone interview, an assessment centre in their office in London and now I have been invited to a final interview in the companies local office.  Since I am on a throwaway, the company is Cognizant.

If I be honest, I thought it was going to be a no for the final stage as I wasn't sure about the company itself, but there we go.

I am worried that if I head down a testing route I may have to start again from the ground up in a development role in a few years time, which is why I am considering possibly saying no at this stage.  I do have a possible internship offer but I am still awaiting the outcome. 

I appreciate I need experience, but I am worried about the effects later in my career going into a testing job now could have on my future prospects.

What would you do in my situation?

TLDR; worried about going down a testing route and the possible impacts on future roles I could get.  I would much rather be a software developer."

For high school seniors, it is the first time you are confronting college admissions. 

For us career professionals, it's another year amongst many. For the parents, it may be your second or third child going through the process. 

We have basically the same conversations every year, and rightly so - this is new information for most of you. Given the understandable stress, anxiety, and excitement with decisions rolling in, I felt resharing this post is timely.

I am going through all of my old Reddit posts mining data and collecting content I have already written for an upcoming book. 

[I wanted to share one posted around this same time last year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/3t77f9/a_reminder_that_college_admissions_outcomes_are/)

I am currently reading a fascinating and haunting piece that I feel many of our members can relate to: [The Silicon Valley Suicides](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-silicon-valley-suicides/413140/?single_page=true). 

It talks about the massive pressures that affluent students face to perform well while paradoxically being distant and alienated from their parents.

""(And what about … the girl taking a summer immersion program to skip ahead and get into AP French her sophomore year? And that internship your best friend has with a Stanford professor?) You can’t help but slip into the system of competitive insanity … We are not teenagers. We are lifeless bodies in a system that breeds competition, hatred, and discourages teamwork and genuine learning. We lack sincere passion. We are sick … Why is that not getting through to this community? Why does this insanity that is our school district continue?""

---

I have been working with students for a few years now both as a counselor for UT-Austin serving the most competitive high schools in the Dallas area and also as an independent consultant. I have seen snapshots across culture, race, socioeconomics, and so on from working directly with students, but also reading their often very private thoughts in thousands of essays.

My biggest takeaway from this profession: I am so thankful I am not an 18 year old American applying to college. 

In addition to the anxiety and neurotic posts that plague this community publicly, I receive a lot of private messages that can be summed up in one word: tragic. 

The student stressing that their 2270 isn't ""good enough""; the student who secretly wants to study film but knows their parents would never allow it; the student who's family threatens not to pay for college if they don't gain admission and attend an elite university; the student who is so concerned about whether giving up sports to take on a part-time job to help pay family expenses will hurt their college admissions chances; the student already stressing about applying to medical school before they've even started their undergraduate applications.

I think we all collectively wish the system were different, and outside of individual conversations I have with people, I don't have any meaningful or constructive ideas on how to change things or even where to start. I feel like the most frequent advice I give is, especially in /r/chanceme threads: breathe, calm down, it will all be fine.

Seriously. It will be fine. 

Work hard, ask questions, do what you're passionate about, and avoid things you don't want to do. These are some qualities, in my mind, that make for productive people, college students, professionals, partners, parents, etc. 

As you near application deadlines and those decisions begin rolling in, I think I can speak on behalf of all admissions and educational professionals to just take a step back, look at things in context, and try not to let an often arbitrary, opaque, and seemingly random process define who you are or what you are worth. 

Only you - not your parents, not your teachers, not your coaches, not your resume, not the labrynth of college admissions - can define your worth."

My issue is that I would enrol in CS in the university i'm currently attending however I lack my high school high math classes that are prerequisites, so that option is nearly out of the picture. Another alternative would be a course taught at a college in my city meant for mature students (those who haven't done any post-secondary education). 

The overview makes it appear as a pretty decent overview for web development with the inclusion of HTML/CSS, Java, PHP, .NET, ect. And then an internship period near the end. It's a fairly intensive course running 8:30-2:30 5 days a week for 13 months.

Here's a link for the full [curriculum](http://www.johnabbott.qc.ca/continuing-education/programs-2/internet-programming-development)

1. Switch into Computer Engineering (or possibly information systems), which is not my passion, but I have already met the admittance requirements. 

2. Transfer to an out of state school, which would raise Tutition from 4k per semester to 10-15K a semester, but get a CS degree there. 

My question is about how higherable would I be for a coding career even if I have a degree in computer engineering instead?
Would it be worth it to go into more debt, if a CS degree would get me greater job security/higher wages?

I am currently at a paid internship for website development at a small but very sucsessful company, and have thoughts about going for a minor in CS, and getting an information systems major.

5i6occ,45,2016-12-13,Hidden Truths About How to Choose Colleges,hayden_shumsky,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5i6occ/hidden_truths_about_how_to_choose_colleges/,"With so many focusing on rather unimportant characteristics of a university like ""ranking"" (very often a game-ified and unreliable matrix),  average SAT/ACT score (self-reported and not scientifically verified), college confidential feedback,""prestige"" and network rumors, it is critical to rethink what is most important in choosing a prospective college.  

First and foremost is quality of academic program; you want to attend a school that will challenge you and help you build useful skills for the job and graduate school marketplace.  Equally important and closely related is teaching style and how it fits your learning style. 

**WARNING #1- COLLEGE EDUCATION IS NOT A WIDGET THAT IS THE SAME AT EVERY UNIVERSITY, EVEN IN SAME MAJOR**

Different schools have different missions, different size/scale, varying availability of professor interaction, and varied pedagogical methods.  

You may already have a firm grasp of college types and teaching styles, and if so, please skip ahead to the next section.

Public research universities offer large, mostly lecture oriented classes, with discussion-based courses available only to upper division students, if at all. 

Smaller colleges typically offer nearly all courses in discussion-based settings, with a small number of lecture courses.

If you're a self-directed learner, then you can succeed anywhere because you can pickup a textbook, listen to a lecture, and master the material on your own.  In such cases, large classrooms (150-300 or more) like those found at most introductory courses at public research universities like UCLA, UT, UMich, etc, will not be a stumbling block for you.  

If on the other hand, you struggle to pickup material on your own and need lots of assistance and guidance from professors, you probably do not belong at a large public research university.  If you are the type of student who learns best through classroom discourse and debate or wants to present your ideas for scrutiny, smaller colleges will likely fit your academic need more closely.

Medium sized universities, typically private and having 5k-10k undergrads (Ivies, Stanford, Tulane), with some larger 10-20k undergraduates (USC, NYU, BU), vary in the kinds of teaching styles and settings on offer. Some do a great job in limiting large lecture classes and mandating professor support for undergrads, others do not.  

Many uninformed students are surprised that Penn and other Ivies have lots of lecture classes that have 100 or more students and professors who are not so available as hoped for. BU and NYU are notorious for 1st and 2nd year classes that have several hundred  or more students like those found at public research unis.

**WARNING #2- YOU WILL LIKELY NEED ASSISTANCE FROM CAREER SERVICES AND PROFESSOR SUPPORT TO ACQUIRE INTERNSHIPS AND JOBS**

As above, the most driven and well-connected students can probably do well in getting top jobs and internships at any university in the country. For the vast majority of others, the quality of professor and staff support and assistance in acquiring internships, research projects, and jobs is of critical importance.

So, in thinking about how to choose colleges, you should look very closely at the career services office and speak to current students about the availability and quality of assistance from professors and staff in getting the jobs and internships that will launch the first stage of your career.

The quality of career advising from staff and professors is not uniform and is not necessarily related to the overall prestige and quality of the university.  As a general rule of thumb: the larger the university, the more difficulty in acquiring personalized assistance for job and internship placement.

The latest research from Purdue U/Gallup shows that those recent college grads who received high quality career assistance were more likely to have full-time employment and to acquire a first job more quickly upon graduation than their peers. 

49% who said they received good help from career services had a good job waiting for them upon graduation vs. 15% who did not receive useful career assistance.

Both of them are somewhat related to ML, but I felt I don't really understand these two companies. Here are some my thoughts.

A9:

- Project: migrate original Hadoop + PIG script to Spark.
- Maybe ML relevant, but more likely is somewhat engineering project (re-write existed code to another framework).
- Subsidiary of Amazon. Not sure if it has Amazon-like working environment, which I heard is not of the best type.

NVIDIA:

- Project: neural network visualization. May need to hook into NVIDIA's internal library, which might be a interesting and challenging thing.
- Somewhat more ML relevant, but not sure will the visualization part be more focused or the ""hardcore"" library part.
- Manager's background looks very strong, seems like a really awesome person I can learn a lot from.
- Not of the same scale of A9 (Amazon).

I also have concern on whether the company's scale is big enough to secure me on the working visa issues.
It'd be greatly appreciated if someone can share some insights about any of these two companies, or some suggestions / advice.

*TL;DR – Did not have an engineering internship upon graduating. Found an engineering job, which really only dealt with CAD. Released from my employment in April 2016, have been trying to find my next position since. I feel as If I lack experience compared to other candidates . Any suggestions?*

Dear r/AskEngineers,

I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from an ABET credited program in May of 2014. Unfortunately I have been unemployed for the last 8 months as I have not been able to find a position that will allow me to advance my engineering career. Because of the growing employment gap in my resume, I am afraid that it will become increasingly more difficult for me to find another engineering position. To the experienced engineers on this subreddit: do you have any advice for me for taking the next step in my engineering career?

**A little background on me and my situation:**
Upon graduating in May of 2014 I entered the job market without previous engineering co-op or internship experience, which in retrospect is something I should have been more proactive to obtain. In June of 2014 I took a position on a production line in my hometown in order to build employment history and financial security with the intent to find an entry level position. Although I had a handful of interviews over the next couple of months, I was still unable to secure an engineering position by early 2015. I therefore decided to quit the my position late that March, as I wanted to spend 1st shift being more aggressive in my job search instead of on a production line pressing buttons on a preprogrammed CNC machine. My aggressiveness seemed to pay off, as I finally was able to secure an engineering position at a company who produced custom vendor carts in May of 2015.

Overall my experience at this company was positive as I enjoyed the coworkers I interacted with and the product the company was producing. The position also allowed me the opportunity to master the CAD software utilized by the company, where I was able to explore the different features and tools of the program. Unfortunately CAD was the only engineering skill I was practicing, as the products the company produced did not require analysis or other engineering tools. But I knew holding an engineering position was beneficial for my resume so I decided to stay at the position for about a year before starting to look for another engineering position.

Unfortunately in April of 2016 my company released me from their employment, which came as a shock. On my final day at the company my manager stated that I was behind on my work production, which he gauged by the number of production and quote packets I had created so far in 2016. Up to that point management never communicated to me that I was not performing at their expectations or gave me the opportunity to learn and improve my work output. Although dismayed I tried to be optimistic, as I know had the opportunity to pursue the next step in my engineering career.

Now it’s 8 months later and my optimism is starting to run out. Even after countless of applications and dozens of phone and on-site interviews, I still have not been able to land another engineering position. I am starting to get nervous that the employment gap on my resume will start to become a red flag for potential employers. I have used my university’s engineering career services and attended their career fair, searched many online job boards, and submitted my resume to numerous staffing firms, which has resulted in interviews but as of right now no offers of employment.

I have felt that some of my interviews have gone smoothly as well, and therefore the companies’ decisions to pursue other candidates came as a surprise, leaving me to only speculate their reasons. Occasionally a company would provide me with some feedback on my interview or resume, the most common response being that other candidates had internship or co-op experience more applicable to the position than the experience I had.

As 2017 comes to a close I have come to a realization that I might need to think outside the box if I want to continue my engineering career. So to the experienced engineers on this subreddit, what do you suggest I do in my predicament? Do you have any tip or suggestions to help me either land another job or develop new engineering skills to help bolster my resume? I am starting to consider following: taking some courses at my local tech school, studying for EIT Exam (which I am a little hesitant to take,) joining ASME, and/or finding a hobby that would allow me to develop a hands-on engineering skill set. But even with these options I feel like a need a bit more direction. Any suggestions?

I did read over the subreddit FAQ, and I do realize that some of my questions overlap with “What are some things I can do in my spare time to make myself more marketable as an engineer?” But a lot of the suggested skills are ones that I already acquired. I am familiar with CAD and have taken coursework in programming (Java, C), LabVIEW, and prototype design/fabrication (which covered using mills, lathes, and other machines in the shop.)

The first offer is in search and gives me backend/db experience. It pays significantly more, and gives me the opportunity to pitch ideas and run an idea through the entire product lifecycle. There are also great perks and culture.  This would give me strong general knowledge to go into a wider variety of CS subfields later. 

The second offer is working on a security product. This would give me some experience on pieces overall on the full stack. It is also much closer to my house. 

I think the first will give me more to work on overall and get better with backend, whereas the second will give me a better view of security in industry. The first will also give a much better price point to argue for full time salaries, though I'm unsure how much I should take this into account. It also seems that ProofPoint has a bigger name, though I'm not sure on how to gauge.

I’ve spent about six years at my local community college trying to obtain my associates degree. I was a bit of a floater for the first four years of my college experience when I found myself pregnant. It took the birth of my son to really spur me to find a career path that would benefit me later on. I ended up in the Human Services program because of my desire to one day be a counselor for people with mental illness. For my degree program, I was required to have two internships for my last two semesters. This was the tricky part, landing a volunteer position that would provide at least ten hours a week that provided enough on-site experience to warrant an A on my records. 
	
My first internship was a miracle in and of itself. My teacher took me aside, knowing I was searching for an internship and asked if I had settled on a particular job. I told her I was thinking about working at the Senior Center in town, or maybe work with someone with developmental disabilities. She told me that the local Psychiatric Hospital was looking for a volunteer and could offer as many hours as I wanted. 
	
I was thrilled. I grew up knowing about Central Hospital, knowing that was where “crazy people” went when they completely lost it. I myself had been admitted into a psychiatric ward for suicide watch but never Central Hospital. I ended up getting the position after a TB test and a short orientation. The position was in the adolescent unit where children who were suffering from mental illness went to recover. The average stay, I noticed after about a month, was about two weeks. I attended classes with them in the on-site school and helped with as much school work as I could. My favorite thing to do was attend therapy with the children and their treatment team meetings. In the mornings, the doctor would give me a couple of files for children who were having a treatment team meeting. I would pull the children out of class and lead them into a small room where we would talk with their parents about their progress and what further interventions they needed. 
	
About two months into my internship I met Angel. She was a young girl with pale skin, bright blue eyes, and black hair down to her waist. She was shy at first but slowly opened up to me when she saw no judgement coming from me. I knew better than to stare at her wrists where she had tried to end her life by cutting. Angel was only 14 years old, and apparently constant bullying at her new high school had driven her to suicide. According to her file she had lost a lot of blood and needed a transfusion. During the ride to the hospital the paramedics couldn’t feel a pulse and needed to resuscitate her. When she was healed as much as possible, she was sent here to try and control her obvious depression.
	
Angel and I got along quite well. In fact, she began to follow me around. During her first week there she talked to me constantly about how much she enjoyed the people here at Central, the nurses and the therapists and even the teachers. She smiled a lot. I attended her treatment team meeting and noticed that thankfully her parents were eager to help her get better. It wasn’t every day that a child got a supportive parent. Some parents just couldn’t care which I firmly believe led to some of the problems their children were having.
	
Angel was admitted on a Monday and by Wednesday we were fast friends. I loved interacting with her and helping her with her science homework. One day during math class, I was helping her with a particularly difficult problem when she leaned close to me and told me that she had died briefly. 
	
“I did read that in your doctor’s report when you transferred here,” I informed her. 
	
“I don’t think anyone should commit suicide,” she said. 

“There are a lot of people who love you,” I said with a smile. “Suicide is never the answer.”
	
She shook her head. “Not because of that. Because of the people on the other side.” The blank look on my face spurred her on as she said, “When I was dead for those 2 minutes and 15 seconds, it felt like forever. I met the Scary Man. He was a big shadowy man. He hurt me a lot. He told me that if I couldn’t respect life and go by the rules…he said that suicide was cheating. He said that if I couldn’t follow the rules of life, I should be punished.” She looked down. “There were a lot of people there. I guess a lot of people commit suicide, huh.”
	
I had nothing to say. I was shocked. For someone to have such a vivid imagination was terrifying. We dropped the conversation and went back to doing math problems. Angel acted like nothing had ever happened.
	
Over the weekend though, something changed. When I came into the building, fully expecting a good report, I overheard the doctors talking. One of the doctors motioned for me to come closer. 
	
“Was Angel acting strangely before you left on Friday?” He inquired, watching my face for any reaction. I frowned and informed him that everything had been normal when we parted ways the week before. He nodded as if he knew that was the case. “Sunday morning we discovered Angel in a psychotic state. We’ve had to sedate her twice since then. She’s done a complete 180 and we just can’t figure out why. This is extremely abnormal behavior for her.”
	
I was shocked. The little girl I had been mentoring had just suddenly gone bonkers. That’s not a term I would use in front of the children of course. But hearing this, I knew I had to see it to believe it. After getting permission from the doctor I went up the stairs to her room on the female wing. It was dark in the hallway except for the light from the nurses station. At 8 in the morning it was strange for anyone to be in this wing because all the children would be at school and it was unnecessary for a nurse to be on watch. I knew before I saw the nurse that she was watching the solitude monitor. That monitor was for the solitude room where a tiny camera was hidden in the corner of the room to keep an eye on patients that needed to be placed in any kind of restraints. Containing a child to a bed was often the last method we used and chose to either use chemical restraints like Haldol or place them in the solitude room with padded walls. It was for their own good. 
	
I glanced at the screen and saw Angel slumped on the ground in a small ball, her breathing even and slow. I knew she had fallen asleep.

The nurse turned to me, shaking her head.
	
“She’s been screaming non-stop since Sunday morning.”
	
“What has she been screaming about?” I asked, trying to piece things together.
	
“She keeps talking about a man. Says there is this tall shadow man who is stalking her here.” The nurse pursed her lips. “She talked about it Saturday night, asking who had a visitor at 7 in the evening. I told her no one did, that visiting hours were not allowed after 5 in the afternoon. She kept pointing to the corner of the room, saying ‘that man is there, though. How did he get in?’” and then by the next morning she was screaming at us to save her, that the man was going to get her.” She shook her head. “Maybe her medicine isn’t right. I don’t know.” She rubbed her eyes. 
	
I watched the monitor for a few minutes before I turned to go back to the classrooms. If I couldn’t help Angel today, I could still help another patient. Before I left though, while the nurse was reaching for a bottle of water, I saw Angel start to wake up. She slowly lifted her head. I smiled, hoping that her nap had been the answer and she was back to normal. Instead, I watched as her face turned to one of intense horror. Her face twisted as her mouth dropped open and she screamed. I could hear it from down the hall where I was at the nurse’s station. She stood up, her straight jacket making her movements a bit harder to perform.

	
The camera only showed her in the room, but I watched as she seemed to gasp for breath. The screams were silenced suddenly. I could no longer hear her. I took a step back, wondering if I should check on her in the room, but knew I didn’t have permission. I glanced at the nurse and she too had a look of pure horror on her face. Angel was now dangling against the wall, her feet at least two feet off the ground. Her face was turning blue and she struggled, but her hands were useless in the straight jacket.
	
I grabbed the keys to the room off the desk and ran down the hallway, desperate to save Angel from whatever was in that room with her. When I got to the door to the solitude room, I was struck cold with fear. Through the very tiny window in the door I could see Angel, being held up by a shadowy man, tall with spindly arms and legs. He had no face. There was a deep growling echoing from the room. How was this man in the room? There was only one set of keys to this room and I had them. And the camera clearly showed that she was alone. What creature could this be?
	
I struggled to pet the key in the lock and by this time the nurse had joined me to help. She didn’t look through the small window into the room. I think she was too scared.
	
When we opened the door it was too late. Angel was slumped back onto the ground, this time her face frozen in a horrific pose. We tried CPR but there was too much damage to her wind pipe to do anything helpful. Angel was dead.

I left that day and never returned.

I've been scheduled for an interview for a gaming company as a gameplay developer (C++). The game is 3D and the description said 3D math is a plus.

I'm so nervous, especially since it takes me 6 hours to drive to this place.


I really want this job, and I'm guessing I have about a week to prepare. I have been going through CTCI exercises, but it took me a couple hours just to get through exercises 1.1 and 1.2 (to understand them by heart, writing the code out, speaking my mind process out loud). I feel like there is no way I'm going to be able to get through all of the exercises.


What chapters/exercises would you guys recommend? I'm planning on picking problems from the C/C++ section, LinkedList, Stacks/Queues, Trees/Graphs, and 3D math. That's already quite a lot of work. Am I going about this wrong by trying to understand and write the code out? Any advice is appreciated!

I am having a lot of trouble finding an internship for the summer of 2017. I have applied to a lot of places using Indeed.com but I haven't even gotten a phone interview yet. Thing is, I have a decent amount of experience (I worked at a big video game review site as a web dev intern and a big medicine company as an IT Intern) + have projects I build live on the app store (of decent scale, implemented systems like messaging, transactions (w/braintree API) etc. etc.) 

The only caveat is that I graduated High School very recently (2016 of May this year) And directly went to my local community college to save money because I had already finished a year of classes at my cc as a high schooler and live in California (so I'm able to get guaranteed seating at a decent UC for next fall with TAG - as a Junior).

Any idea what I'm doing wrong/what I can improve on? My algorithms/data structure knowledge also isn't super strong (I understand all the basic structs ie. queues, stacks, BST, graphs, heaps, AVL trees) and a little algo knowledge (some basic graph algos ie. Kruskal, prims, getting minimum spanning trees). I don't know if this would even be a problem yet though as I haven't even received a phone interview (50+ applications). 

Here is the resume I have been sending out:

I kind of slacked around my UG and despite having decent grades and very good programming skills (compared to people in finance anyway), I have had very little luck finding internships. So now I am graduating with a bachelors and no internships / work experience, and I really doubt I'd be able to find employment in finance.

I have the opportunity to work in either Raiffeisen Bank or Societe Generale. **However**, those jobs are located in Eastern Europe, not Austria/France. Both jobs are related to risk management, which is right in my alley.

I am a bit indecisive. On one hand, it seems like very comfortable jobs. Nominally the salaries are lower than in North America, but if you consider the cost of living, I'd be enjoying a better standard of life in Eastern Europe. Plus I'd have a change of scenery for a while. On the other hand, if I do go work in Eastern Europe, I would absolutely want to go back and work/live in North America after 2 years. So I am a bit scared that this foreign experience won't be taken seriously by North American employers, thus I'd have wasted two years essentially. 

Any inputs?"

I'm looking for some advice on my college list. With January 1st deadlines approaching, I have been incredibly overwhelmed with the crazy amount of supplements I need to write. As a result, I feel like I should readdress my list and make sure I'm not wasting time on schools in which I simply have no shot. However, I feel like the more schools I apply to, the better my chances are of ending up at a top school.

* **Location**: Florida

* **Intended Area of Study:** Computer Science (Although I plan on applying undecided to most schools due to the competitive nature of computer science programs)

* **GPA**: 3.35 weighted (Before you can say uh oh, I can explain! Firstly, it's not that terrible for my school which is stupidly rigorous but it does hold a decent reputation, especially with UF. I also had a pretty rough freshman year due to medical reasons. After I got it sorted, my massive upward trend began (3.89 junior year would probably be top 5% of my class if my school reported rank). I know that I am still at a major disadvantage, unfortunately.

* **ACT**: 35C (36E, 35M, 36R, 33S)

* **Course Rigor**: Strong

* **Hooks**:
 * 3-time internship w/ medical software company in Dallas
 * Founded and currently operate a profitable local photography business
 * 2x 40hr/wk local summer jobs
 * Tech blog administrator and journalist
 * President of environmental club
 * Local volunteer tutoring
 * Summer programs at Columbia U (Programming), Auburn U (Industrial Design), and Williams (Writing)
 * 250+ hours of community service

So yeah— I don't care about location or size, I just primarily want a reputable/name school with a strong CS program. 

**Here's my current list (I've already applied to the first 5 but decisions aren't until February or so):**

* U of Florida *(Reach + meh computer science)* 
* U of Central Florida *(Safety + strongly dislike)*
* U of Texas (Austin) *(Reach)*
* U of Washington (Seattle) *(Slight Reach)*
* U of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) *(Slight Reach)*
* Columbia University *(Major Reach, relying on a four-generation legacy + connection)*
* Georgia Institute of Technology *(Slight Reach)*
* University of Miami *(Safety)*
* Vanderbilt University  *(Reach + meh computer science)*
* New York University *(Reach + probably too expensive)*
* Northeastern University *(Safety + too expensive for what it is)*
* Middlebury College *(Reach)*
* Northwestern University *(Reach + relying on legacy)*
* Johns Hopkins University *(Reach + connection)*
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute *(Reach)*
* Case Western Reserve University *(Slight Reach)*
* Washington University (St. Louis) *(Reach)*
* Rose-Hulman Institute of Tech *(Reach)*
* U of Michigan (Ann Arbor) *(Reach)*
* U of Wisconsin (Madison) *(Slight Reach)*

Thank you so much! Any feedback is much appreciated. 

**Pls note:** I know people often say ""never apply to schools you can't see yourself at"". I can see myself at each of these schools (except for UCF and Northeastern). I know this is all a longshot, but I figure I might as well try."

We've even discussed me joining the team's personal business as a developer regardless of where I go. The work is fun, I enjoy it, but it's very niche and won't be very applicable if I ever change jobs. A lot of the work is done in Coldfusion though a switch to Node.js is planned for the future. Base salary is 85k, I'm still interning their now so they would bump me to full time now and I'd end up making right now 8k once you take out taxes before starting full time. Their 401k plan is match 6% for 6% and then an extra 2% at the end of the year. Paid time off is 4 weeks. Raises are pretty normal at the end of the year, but are based on performance. I would live in Baltimore, MD. 

The second job is at Capital One in a technology rotational program, each rotation is one year and you work on a different project and team each year. The base salary is 94k, starting bonus of 10k tax free, relocation assistance at 1.5k tax free and a performance based bonus that would probably end up being in the range of 3-5k. If you contribute 6% to your 401k they match at 7.5%. The job would be located out of McLean, VA but I would probably live in Arlington, VA. Paid time off is 3 weeks. Same as the previous, raises are normal but based on performance. Most of the work would be done in Java and it would be a brand new system, walking in blind. 

Obviously I know I have to make the choice, but I'd appreciate any advice people could send my way. It's a tough choice to make."

I have 1 year left after this year completes.

i have also invested in the 2 books necessary to become a CISCO certified network tech and i intend to study these in the summer break.

Rather than take random classes for 2 years I decided to add a second major: computer science.  I can’t start taking classes for the cs major until next semester.  My university requires I take two introductory programming courses in my first 2 semesters as a cs major.  One is mandatory for the other, so they must be taken over two semesters.  Unfortunately, my university also requires that these two courses be taken before any other computer science classes.  This means that by the fall of 2017, when everyone else is applying for internships, I will only have completed 2 programming courses, but will be a junior.  Will I be competitive for a decent internship considering I only have 2 programming courses and am a junior in college?"

Do they ask very technical questions or are they more of the behavioral type questions? How long did it take to for you to get a response after your interview?

5ig5vr,0,2016-12-15,Taking a semester off.,robot_t0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ig5vr/taking_a_semester_off/,"Hi, 
       I was wondering whether I could take a semester off. I want to see what the pro's and cons or this decision might be. I am a CS junior. I need to take 1 more course to complete my cs curriculum, so taking the semester off will not be affecting my graduation date. May be I should graduate faster, but I got into CS last year and I don't have experience with internships like you guys have. I don't know if I can call that an internships, but I have been working as a developer (12/hr) for my university for about 8 months now. So clearly, I will not stand a chance against you guys when I apply for jobs. I did poorly this semester, due to a number of side projects so I will be ending up with a 3. 

The reason I want to take a semester off, is to build something. It has do with machine learning,robotics etc. I hate going to school and would like to spend more time focusing on my project. Commercialization is most probably possible, but I am not sure if this is just me being stupid or if it is really possible. If I can create what I have dreamt up, the creation also seems possible ( I have a lot of experience in the field from numerous side projects) , it should be of some value. May be not commercial, but it is going to be a complex project, so it should add value to me, from the employer's side.
 
 I have adhd, unmedicated , so I am not really good at time management either. I have tried a lot to improve, but it hasn't really helped me. I cannot focus on different things at the same time properly. I want to just focus on my project for the next 6 months and try to make something out of it. 

What am I missing here? Is this going to destroy my life ? How about the chances of getting hired? Should I mention this in my resume, or gloss over it ? The break does not affect my current graduation date of Spring 2018. Has anyone else done it ? I might also apply to graduate school, can someone talk about how this choice might hurt me ?

5igkup,7,2016-12-15,Back to School?,Hashemm,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5igkup/back_to_school/,"I'm a 23-year-old recent grad with a B.S. in Business Administration that focused on Operations and Supply Chain Management. I'm weighing my options right now of either entering the workforce or heading back to school. 

* I'm considering going back to school for a second bachelor's degree in either Data Science (https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/undergraduate/arts-sciences/data-science/major) or Computer Science (https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/undergraduate/arts-sciences/computer-science/major). I have also looked into the online post-bacc degree from Oregon State University. My long-term goal would be to attain an MS in Data Science (http://www.galvanizeu.com/curriculum). Recently, I've been learning to code in Python and have gotten pretty comfortable with it, as well brushing up on my quantitative skills. I understand both the financial and time investment I would have to undertake in pursuing a second bachelor's degree, but I feel like this may be the best ROI for the long-term. 

* I may have an internship lined up with a professional sports team to be an operations intern and am also considering going down the path of getting an MA in Sports Management (https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/sport-management). To me, this path doesn't scream security and is such a specific focus that it may end up being detrimental in the long-run if things don't work out. I'm passionate about sports and especially sports analytics, but I'm unsure that this choice would be as rewarding as pursuing a quantitative field.

My current situation is relatively free of personal expenses, and I want to be able to contribute to my family financially down the road as well when they are no longer providing for me. My parents aren't getting any younger, and for me to continue to live in San Francisco, I'm going to need to be able to financially support myself which is why I'm looking to pivot towards a more technical field. Be it either CS or DS with which I can utilize not only in the sports industry but also a broad array of other areas from economics to people analytics. Any advice, guidance, or personal experience would be very much appreciated. Thanks again.

----------------------------

Dr. Justin Case had heard the jokes about his name too many times. Whilst doing his research for NASA his colleagues always joked that he should make a back-up somewhere else, just in case something went wrong. The first 3 times he could laugh about it, but now it wasnt funny anymore.

Looking at the device in front of him, he wondered if this new propulsion system would finally get us out of our own planetary system. Yeah, both Voyagers were somewhere in the Oort Cloud, and the colony on the terraformd Mars was doing well, but if the theory of Stephen Hawkins was correct, this thing would either backfire and kill him, or give Humanity the biggest boost in space-engineering since the discovery of the telescope.

""Doctor, maybe you should step out of the room, and let the camera's do the observing, just in case."" 

Again that lame joke, thought Justin. ""Pull off that joke one more time, and I'll assign you cleaning duty for the next week, Clara. You may be my assistant, but I'd like to be treated with some respect, and I make the decisions around here. Now, pull the lever.""

Clara sighed. She should have watched her words. As the new intern she was appointed to help the doctor, and this was the 3rd time in 2 days she said had it without thinking. She looked at the checklist. Camera's looked ready, power was at 100%, the measuring equipment was all set up. They were good to go. The last thing she remembered was pulling the lever.

------

When she woke up, she felt a headache as if she had drunk a gallon of moonshine. 'Hell, I prefer my period cramps over this', she thought. Then she realised she was lying in a hospital bed, covered in bandages. 'What the hell happened, why am I here'. She wanted to stand up, but her legs wouldn't respond the way she wanted.

""Hey, you're finally awake"" A male nurse came in looking relieved. ""Why am I here, what in Cthulhu's name happened?"" said Clara, slightly panicking because she was so in the dark. ""Well, I don't know exactly, but we found you in the rubble of the research factory, knocked out cold. I'd suggest you just lay back, as you have 3 broken ribs, a broken vertebra, and you were in an induced coma for 3 days to get the surgeries and recovery done, and to keep you out of pain for a bit. We shot you up with some morphine 2 hours ago to keep the pain away, but you can ask for more.""

Her mind went racing. Rubble? Coma? We were testing a possible FTL device, did it explode? We knew it could be dangerous, and that there was a risk of failure, but did it go so damn wrong? Her mind went to the doctor, who was standing within 3 feet of the device they were testing. ""How is Dr. Case?"", she asked the nurse. ""yeah, about that... How many people we're in the room with you? We only found you, and the cleaning lady so far. It was 11 PM when we heard the blast, so there wouldn't be many people, but search and rescue teams are still clearing the rubble. All we found besides you and the cleaning lady was a size 9 boot on the parking lot."" Size 9, that was Dr. Case's size. That meant he probably didnt make it. She let her head fall into the pillow, and started to cry.

------------

Case woke up on a steel bed, in a yellow shirt, sharp white lights above him, and a rather oversized Emu with a wide neck, 4 legs, and 2 strange looking arms standing next to his bed. ""Hello, you're awake. We studied your brain, took out the memories, and created a translator so we could talk to you. Do you remember anything?"" He was hallucinating, that was the only reasonable option, he thought, My brain is playing tricks on me. He decided to play the game, as it couldn't get worse: ""My name is Doctor Justin Case, scientist for NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.. Who the hell are you, and where the hell am I?"" ""I'm Tropali, and I'm a Cleaser, you're on the planet Broudo, and we are orbiting a binary star that your memory named Alpha Centauri.""

The revelation hit Case: the FTL worked. He wanted to see if the power was working, but he made the whole thing work, and he was on another planet, with a different species. But how could he ever get home?

Smaller company in a decent midwestern city, strong client base and their main focus is a core, mature product and they were looking to gradually expand, as a soon to be college grad I'd start in May. I liked meeting with the owner and developers, they all seemed pleasant.

$60,000/yr., medical/dental, 12 days PTO to start and earning more days immediately. Salary would translate to something like $80,000/yr. were I to be living in Chicago, cost of living wise ($115,000 yr. in San Fran according to my online calculator).

Here's the caveat: I have a good GPA, good school, great work experience (2 internships, one I'm still working remotely for, lots of project work), and as far as CS goes I'm personable. I wasn't looking for a job very seriously this past semester and had actually planned on really pushing my applications out this next one since I know a lot of companies prefer to hire May grads in Spring, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm capable of getting.

Regardless, I was really looking to stay in my college city (which this would let me do) near my family and friends, so this is just about optimal for me. Should I counter-offer for something more like $64,000 (around the median for software devs in my area), or just take the money and count on getting promoted and raises after proving myself?

Will I gain good dev skills during my work with IBM that will significantly help me market myself to other companies after I graduate?

I was laid off the other day from a small Market Research company where I did HR for a little under a year. Since graduating in 2015 with a BA in HR. I've worked at the company mentioned above and also worked in the HR department for a big corporation in Seattle. (you all know that one popular coffee business ).


Before being laid off, I've come to the realization that this career field isn't for me and want to look into the tech industry. I have some experience with HTML, Java, CSS as a hobby. I've recently enrolled into a Web/App Development Coding program, but other than that I have no prior work experience/education in this field. I've had no significant gaps in employment, and have references from past employers waiting if I ever need them. Financially, I have enough saved up to focus on where I want to be in the next couple of months, but I want to act FAST.


My question(s) to my fellow redditors in the tech field is/are... Where do I start? Will I have any chance at applying for any entry level tech jobs or possibly internships? I'm willing to get my foot in the door for tech companies so any job offered, I will do. How/where do I look into startup companies? What type of entry level jobs are there that may open my eyes to exactly what part of the tech field I want to be in?"

I am looking for my first pure software related internship to gain experience and get a better feel for whether I wish to do pure software vs bioinformatics field. 

**Problem:** I have no referrals so I have just been applying online. However, I have been told by classmates that applying online should be my last option. Instead, I should first contact people through Linkedin from my undergraduate university who are working in software companies and ask for a referral. The problem is that I was a biology major before. Should I still try to contact these people I don't know? Furthermore, I have heard that some companies only accept referrals for full time positions and not for summer internships. 

What are my options for finding a summer internship? Should I continue applying online or should I look for another route? What other routes are there?

Yes, it is experience, but I found out most are only paying partial for relocation and that's somewhat inconvenient for me. 

I'm nervous that this is setting me back... while I landed SWE internships, I really don't think I'm that prepared. Most of my technical interviews were bs and I really, really tried to get them done. In addition, university is stressful, I took too much more than I could handle. I also have been put on financial aid probation and really cannot mess up or I'll have to pay for school out of pocket.

Plus, my school was small and there is little support for my major as far as opportunities go. 

I'm off in Korea doing the English teaching thing but I hate it. There's not much of a future in it, and my current work environment fosters almost no professional development in this field either.

I had somewhat of a rough start, however.  I did well enough in high school to land a scholarship at JHU, but tanked my first semester.  Something about the freedom and not being used to the rigor of the university got to me and I slacked off quite a bit.  We had ""covered grades"" our first semester which basically meant everything was pass/fail and GPA was not calculated until the spring semester.  I used this as a safety net (horrible idea) and thought, considering my high school track record, I should have no trouble slacking off and simply passing my courses.  I was wrong.

I was forced to take a semester off and go about my business and apply for ""readmission"" for the following fall semester.  This was a huge reality check, and put me in a weird place for a little bit.  I used the time off to work a job or two just to have spending money and also took classes at a SUNY school at home in New York.  While the courses were far, far easier than I found them to be at JHU, I still put effort in and did my best, finishing the 3 courses I took with As in each.  Long story short, I applied for readmission over the summer, was accepted, and here I am finishing up my second semester at Hopkins as a sophomore.

I just felt I should provide a little background before getting to the question/advice seeking.

I've been snooping around online and reading posts about students my age applying for internships at big companies and whatnot.  I'm starting to get worried that I'm a bit under-qualified for a lot as of now.  My transcript surely doesn't look too pretty with a first semester of significant failure and now only having one *real* semester at Hopkins under my belt.  I'm confident I can build it up, but I am definitely behind your average sophomore here.  

**I'm really just wondering if anybody here has any advice regarding moving forward from my situation.** Perhaps how I should be spending my time to try and improve how I look on paper or just some general tips/nudges in the right direction regarding some initial side projects of my own I can begin to work on to practice and enhance my programming skills.  I definitely want to try and get started with some projects of my own so I have something to show regarding my technical ability, but even then I feel that my programming ability is still pretty amateur having only taken 2 intro programming courses at home in Java and the C/C++ course here at Hopkins.  I'll be taking a data structures course here in Java come spring, so maybe that'll give me a bit of a confidence boost in my ability.  

Sorry this post was a bit long, but thanks in advance to anybody who reads through it and has anything to say!

EDIT: shortened the post a tad, and to clarify, question/advice to be given is right above this.

I will be having a technical interview the next month, what type of questions are they? boring CTCI or cool things about linux, languages or ml ? 
If anyone could give some information regarding this, it would be awesome. There doesn't seem to be much information about it online. Thanks !"

You know, the ""newbie"" questions... But I would be super appreciative if you decided to help me out.


1) Is Programming still a good career to get into? I once had an acquaintance who became a programmer in the early 2000's and he had his pick of places that wanted to hire him right out of college. He was nothing special in terms of grades or accomplishments, but jobs were so desperate for programmers that he was able to pick and choose. What is it like now? Is it difficult to find jobs?  Are there a lot of programmers out of work? How does the long-term job prospects look? I ask because I see a lot of programmers doing freelance work online.

2) I see a lot of interns on here. Do you have to become an intern before someone will hire you?


3) (Especially important if you're an employer) -- How do employers see people who learned to write code through self-learning and bootcamps, versus those who went to school for CS? Is it more difficult to find a job without the CS degree. (I have an associates in Business).

Thanks everyone. 

I do appreciate the feedack."

I am a 2nd year EE student, by the end of this semester i will be passing 49/164 credit hours with ~3.2 GPA, and in the university where i study i have to pass 100+/164 to do internships so they can equalize them for credit hours, so i have got about a year and a half ahead of me to work toward it.

I have a goal or u can say a short term dream which is to get internship at Telsa Motors but i've read through most of the internship requirements they require previous internships that's one obstacle the other one is that the university i study in is not a top engineering school or anything close to it, Also i dont live in the US.


So what i am thinking of that i should do 2 internships the first one is gonna be in a mediocre company which where i am gonna gain the experience and the other one hopefully at Tesla but i think that in the upcoming year i have to work hard but i do not know what should i improve on, what skills  should i develop i just dont want to be a student i were the previous years i really want to work hard but i feel kinda lost since the place i study is only about theoretical learning with 2 grad projects in the last year but the big companies do care a lot about what you have worked on: projects and other stuff like that, i know that i don't need someone to tell me to make a project to make so but i don't know where to start.

i really want to do something but don't know what to do, do i even stand a chance competing with the top engineering schools students to get that internship ? not sure but i guess it's worth trying.

I hope you guys have something for me that can help me.

thanks

5iq4s9,106,2016-12-16,"Why I Hate the Term ""Dream School""",VannaValkyrie,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5iq4s9/why_i_hate_the_term_dream_school/,"I’m applying RD to all of my schools. As I wait until March or April to receive my decisions, I rest in the sidelines watching some of my friends who ED’d scream in joy, while others inevitably get hit with disappointment.  

For my friends that are disappointed, it’s nearly always because they were caught up in the idea of a “dream school.” Until they received the ED verdict, they spent hours, days, weeks, conceiving that fantasy and “dream.” But with their deferral or rejection, it’s as if they can feel that dream slipping away from them. Don’t get me wrong—it’s completely natural to prefer some schools over others. It’s also fine to have a first choice. We all have our reasons for liking the schools we do, and I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t have my preferences. But I believe that the idea of “the dream school"" is extremely detrimental to the college application culture.

One might be able to envision the concept of ***a*** dream school”—a description of a school that caters to their individual educational and personal needs. It becomes harmful, though, when we become married to the idea of ***the*** dream school. The difference here is in the indefinite versus indefinite article: “a” versus “the.”

I’ve tried to combat this problem in my own college list by first thinking critically about what I desire in my college education. My list contains multiple “dream schools”: schools that offer robust study abroad and internship programs, a strong political science department, and are in or nearby larger cities, which are all things that I want. On a core level, these schools can give me the opportunities I seek. When it comes to choosing schools I prefer over others, that’s when I begin to consider each school’s idiosyncrasies and atmosphere. Some schools on my list offer more things I want than others. Some schools might be a slightly better complement to people with my personality type. But foundationally, I know that all of them will be able to provide me with a solid education.

Even still, I’m not a huge fan of the term “dream school.” The word “dream” implies that the conceptualized experience is artificial and too good to be true, and I’m convinced that this is usually the case. I’d imagine that many people are accepted into their ""dream school,” get there, and discover that it really isn’t *everything* they imagined. Maybe others have a “dream school” and get deferred/rejected, then feel the weight of the dreams they’ve spent months crafting crash to the ground. (I’ve seen this happen to some of my friends, and it truly makes me sad to see them in that state). Or maybe, you go to your “dream school” and it truly is everything you thought it’d be. If that’s the case, I’m genuinely happy for you. Everyone deserves happiness.

But if you’re rejected from your first choice, you may not get 100% of your “dream,” though you can surely get close, or find a place that is at least satisfactory. I don’t want to sugarcoat it by saying you’ll definitively end up somewhere where you’re just as happy, because each school is different and unique—but there are always other options, and there is always a way to make something positive from your situation.

However, I understand on a more meta level that the way the current system works is conducive to the concept of a “dream school.” I believe that universities are foremost businesses over educational institutions, and with so much competition, universities have to play up their business side to survive. Think about it—why is there an financial aid appeal process if one school offers you more money than the other? Why do universities spend so much money on advertising? Why do we get so many annoying emails in our inboxes? Colleges are selling us not just an educational experience, because, I mean, that’s what college is—but they like to send pretty pictures and highlight exceptional graduates and paint visions of a future and how you’ll grow as a learner if you attend their institution. Colleges aren’t just selling their school: they are selling their *dream.*

While we are stuck in a purgatory of deferrals, waiting for regular decisions, or maybe our dreams, it’s easy to forget the human parts of the process, the parts that *don’t* involve submissions or statistics. Remember, we are human! We have purposes other than spitting out correct answers to multiple-choice tests or regurgitating pseudo-self-reflective essays. Let’s use this process as an opportunity to aspire to be a better person for *ourselves*, not for the eyes of admissions officers. Enjoy the process as much as you can, even if it’s difficult at times. Be a supportive friend and console others who were rejected. Learn to accept your own rejections. Celebrate your acceptances. Seek improvement on your essays and garner multiple perspectives on your writing. You are more than letters on a transcript, scores on a test, or a 650-word essay. It’s ridiculous to think that a mere application will ever be an accurate representation of you. 

Lastly, some words of advice:

######**Colleges aren’t accepting or rejecting** ***you,*** **they’re accepting or rejecting your application. And remember: if at first you don’t succeed: apply, apply, again.**

I'm extremely hyped to have just found out that I got into UIUC's Computer Engineering program. I'm likely going to accept the offer, but before that I had a quick question. 

How much of Computer Engineering at UIUC is based on the software side? I want to become a software engineer in the future, and I come from an area where not that many people are into tech, so I applied to Computer Engineering without much knowledge thinking it would be a good mix of learning hardware and software. However, I was recently fortunate enough to have been selected for a local coding internship, and in the past few months I've found that CS and coding really click with me. If I end up liking CS more than CE, how hard is it to switch between the two at UIUC? Because I'm not yet a student, is it as trivial as emailing my admissions counselor? If not, how viable would a transition be during my freshman year?

Thanks for reading! I really appreciate the help. This is a somewhat confusing process and not many people from my school are into this kind of thing, so any guidance would be great. "

Any insight is appreciated!

1. I'm pretty sure that my interests lie in Computer Science, but I'm not 100%, so that is why I applied undeclared. So, in the likely event that I do end up going for CS, is there anything I should know in advance? I've heard that it is one of the most competitive majors available, so I know that I will need to perform highly to qualify for admission. So my question is, how well do I actually need to do? Will I need to maintain a 4.0? Is there any chance that a high test score I used for initial admission will help me when it comes to applying from Computer Science?

1. On-Campus Dorms vs. Off-Campus Dorms. When touring UT, I remember something about there being dorms available right on the edge of campus (They were near the admissions office). They apparently were not affiliated with UT, but were much nicer at not much extra cost. Is this true? If anyone knows what I'm referring to, could you comment a name/link?

1. This one is probably a long shot, but I figured that I might as well ask. I'm currently accepted to the Summer 2017 term which was my intention up until a week ago. I was offered an amazing internship opportunity but it conflicts with the early summer start. Has anyone ever heard of a student switching their term to Fall after they have been admitted?

Once I do that, I am done (hopefully, if my grades come back all passing) with my undergraduate studies. All it took was 6 and a half years and 4 majors to get there. 

I started off as a civil engineering major, taking calc 2 in my freshman semester. Well, I failed that class, along with other courses. I chickened out. I couldn't face math again, even though it was my favorite subject. I was just a terrible student who skipped classes to hang out and was overwhelmed with the freedom college has compared to High School. I chickened out and changed to philosophy. I was very excited. But my habits did not change. At the end of the first semester, I had a 0.94 GPA. And by the end of the second semester (my first year), I had a 1.4 GPA. I was constantly on academic probation for the next two years. Finally, after completing my second year in philosophy, I was at the crossroads. I realized my dream was to be good a computer geek, someone who codes, works and designs computers, and whatever else. I decided I will either be changing to computer science, or joining the military. I felt I had no other options. I HATED philosophy. It was the worst decision I ever made in my entire life. Not a day goes by, even now, that I dont regret changing to philosophy. I was depressed, gained weight, and felt like I was going nowhere in life. When i submitted the application to change to comp sci, I was scared. They said that because I was far into my degree and on academic probation, that I might get rejected. Luckily, they accepted the change. Things started looking up for me. I was enjoying my classes, re-took calc 2 and got an A. My GPA shot up from a 1.7 to a 2.5 in one semester (because calc 2 was a 5 credit course, and I retook a couple of other failed courses). 

However much I loved comp sci, I was still unfulfilled. I loved the idea of circuits in addition to coding, so I switch to computer engineering. BEST. DECISION. EVER. I love it so much. It was one of the toughest things I have ever had to do, but I did it. And I am so happy I did. This was my last semester, and my toughest one. I took 19 units, one of which was FPGA Design using VHDL  (SO MUCH WORK IN THIS CLASS). At the same time, I was working on both my individual and group Senior Design projects (my school gives two senior projects). At times during this semester, I really wanted to give up. But I made it through. And I think all my grades will be good when they come out. There is only one I am not sure about because my professor waits till the end of the semester to grade everything. Either way, I am proud of myself. My cumulative GPA may still be low because of philosophy, but my engineering GPA is a 3.3, which I am proud of.

Most posts talking about the inability to get a job tend to also mention getting only 2-3 interviews in a year. I'm in a different situation. I've read all the job interview tips online, even being field-specific. I have interviewed for retail sales, account management, nonprofit administration, paralegal, receptionist, office assistance, and case management. My biggest interests are in the last three although I'm open to a lot of things. Maybe these roles need certain personality traits I don't seem to have? I'm outgoing and talkative.

I do admit to having a very weak handshake though, so that might not help. As for following up, I've done that for *most* of the interviews unless I didn't have the interviewer's contact info (like their receptionist would be the one who initially contacted me). I always dress [business casual](http://bmodish.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/casual-business-style-bmodish.png) to interviews and have always turned out to be more formally dressed than most people everywhere I've interviewed at (I live in southern California, people dress very relaxed even at law firms). I wear flats instead of heels though.

I just followed up with a nonprofit office assistant position I applied for and they had changed their plans and were no longer hiring anyone, so maybe I just got unlucky...? It was located in a bad area anyway. There were probably 2 other jobs I interviewed for in which the employer posted the same ad a few days later, so they probably didn't hire anyone. I also don't make it past phone interviews very often.

So should I dress more formally? Be more demure? Work on nonverbal body language? Answer questions in a certain way? What do you suggest that worked for you? Or if you're in the same situation, what are you doing to improve?"

5ixt4u,10,2016-12-17,Career Advice - Options for Leaving A/R,throwawayAccountRec,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5ixt4u/career_advice_options_for_leaving_ar/,"Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Bottom-Line: How do I become more marketable so I am not stuck in A/R forever? MBA advisable? What skills can I pick up in my current role?

Interest: Corp Financial Analyst or Cost Accounting. I like dealing with spreadsheets, databases, and numbers. I like working with internal teams. I definitely do not like working with offshore teams that are supposed to do our most clerical work but have no oversight and terrible controls. 

Education Background:
-Finance and Economics major at mid-tier State U with a 3.8. No CFA, no CPA, no CMA

Career Background: 
-No Internship
-Random oddjobs
-Temp Job doing clerical work at F50
-F50 placed me permanently in A/R. 3 years go by getting steadily worse, 4th year becomes nightmare. ""Prioritize the prioritization of the priorities"" becomes management mantra. Corporate leaderships sends reminders to wear flair on Fridays. Fiscal year ends with our best performance ever by objective measure,  but I was told placed I would be placed on PIP. Decide to jump ship. Specific skills: generic low-level excel monkeying (pivot tables, lookups, little Access, little macro use), reserve analysis and recommendation, reconciliation for month-end, process improvement (wrote a few SOPs), and your generic receivable transcations like cash posting. 
-Moved to another F50, also at A/R. New place is much more low-key and they love me, but there are no higher-level functions like reserve analysis or month-end reporting. Surprisingly they pay me more to do less, but that's besides the point...


Problem: I can't transition? As my first A/R job turned into total hell, I tried jumping into a lot of FinAnalyst, some Price Analyst, and some other roles at nearby companies. Probably submitted 30-40 resumes, probably 4-5 phone screens, 2 in-persons scheduled, but one fell through with no follow-up. 

Started applying to A/R jobs just to escape ""You Must Wear Flair Fridays."" That gave me a high hit rate and I got out of dodge pretty quick. Probably 80-90% call-back rates which had 100% conversion to in-person. 

The current company likes me a lot, and I like the current company. My manager and the seniors are taking me up to the Director and have talked about moving me into a senior position PDQ (1 year) and management in a few years. So I am comfortable. For now. 

However, I do not want to stay in A/R forever, and would like skills to land another non-A/R job if for some reason I ever do have to leave. 

For that one in-person Financial Analyst interview I had: it was a Fortune 100, a lot of margin analysis and budget analysis and forecasting to support sales. The manager and the senior accountant loved me, but the director nixed me because I had no prior margin analysis experience. They left the position open 8 months and eventually hired someone who already had the experience they were looking for. 

This leaves me worried I am pigeon-holed in A/R forever.

In your experience/opinion, what can an A/R accountant learn to transition into something (anything) else in the corporate finance world? My eyes are on Financial Analyst roles specifically, but I might be entirely blind to a different position that would suit me just fine. 

Some suggestions people have told me: 
-Get very good at SQL and VBA.
-Get more facetime with director and higher level. They say presentations at higher levels are absolutely necessary.
-Get an MBA (I am skeptical about shelling out the cash for this). 
-Go all-in on becoming an actuary (A student in all the math and quantitative classes I took, but career transition scares the hell out of me).

Thoughts?

Thanks for anyone who took the time to read all this! I really appreciate the assistance. I graduated right in the recession and spent a lot of years with no gainful employment, and I saw a lot of people let go in their 50s with no ability to find new careers: I am terrified of falling into that position again.

5ixuri,5,2016-12-17,Please Review and Critique my SoP,ItsFrank11,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/5ixuri/please_review_and_critique_my_sop/,"At the beginning of my degree, I was mostly focused on a professional software career. To this end, I started working on my project portfolio, building applications and games using various technologies and languages. This strategy paid off in the end as I have managed to land three meaningful and interesting internships and have also been working part-time as a software developer for most of the past two years. 


However, I quickly noticed that the part I enjoyed the most of this journey was never the jobs I landed, but the learning process and especially sharing my projects with my peers. I am currently managing a reasonably successful open source project called XXXXXXXXXX that with roughly 500 monthly downloads sits in the top 20% of packages available on NPM, the largest JavaScript package manager. 


When I discovered digital systems design in my third year I instantly knew that my true interest did not lie in software but in hardware; I have been especially fascinated with field programmable gate arrays and application specific integrated circuits. The idea of designing a computer tailored to a specific problem is incredibly exciting and opens much room to innovation. With my passion for digital systems and my desire to share my work, it became glaringly obvious to me that a professional career was not what I longed for after all, but that an academic career would be much better suited for me. 


Today, my final project at XXXXXXXXXX consists of synthesizing hardware descriptions in Verilog and generate a circuit that exhibits the same behavior in the video game Minecraft. Minecraft has a feature which allows players to transmit and invert digital signals, this project is akin to a complete ASIC flow however our physical result is a circuit in Minecraft’s virtual world rather than on a chip. To accomplish our objective our team must learn and adapt known physical synthesis methods to the novel constraints imposed by this new physical space. From RTL synthesis to gate design, cell layouts and trace routing, we get to explore the ASIC synthesis flow from the inside and appreciate how fascinating IC design and synthesis really is.


My immediate goal in pursuing a master’s degree at XXXXXXXXXX is to hopefully focus my studies on some field related to FPGAs or ASIC design and produce a strong meaningful thesis on the subject.


In the long term, I hope to launch an academic career where I can contribute to the field in meaningful ways and be at the forefront of innovation in computer architecture and digital systems.

I was approached by someone at my school who made note that I seemed like I picked up on C++ the fastest out of the whole class. I showed him some code I was working for fun and he was impressed that I wrote hundreds of lines of code just for fun, saying that it showed I had a real passion for this stuff.

So he mentioned he's working towards an internship at this non-profit. He's doing some work for them now to work towards the paid internship, and as long as he does a good job, he'll get offered a position there. He told me I should email the boss, who he said is a laid-back and an all around good person, about the internship. 

So, I was just looking for any advice on how I can make my resume make me seem as marketable as possible. It would be amazing if I could get into the organization.

My biggest downfall is my lack of experience. I only know c++, and I've only taken the one class for it (I take data structures next semester though). So this might be perceived as inexperience. I do, however, legitimately pick up on this stuff fast. The professor explains it once in class and I almost immediately master it. The classwork itself was cumbersome, but I felt underwhelmed in the rate we were learning new material, but I understand why we didn't go at a faster pace because most of the other people in the class needed the time to practice the material before they got the hang of it.

Anyways. Thanks for the help guys!

Should I transfer to online college to pursue job opportunities?

Hello /r/college. Before I explain my issue, I should give a little background info about me.

Went to the military after high school and after my contract ended, I decided to pursue an education. I am in my 3rd/4th year of college. I have done in total 5 semesters of university. All of my tuition is now covered by federal financial aid and student loans. I have a family member that helps me with living expenses so I don't have to work as much. I've already gotten most of my general education requirements out of the way, so now I just need to focus on my Major classes. My main goal is to specialize in Applied Linguistics. However, My college doesn't offer linguistics as a major, so I figured the best thing to do is learn another language. I actually wanted to learn Russian, but the college doesn't offer that as a major either, so I ended up choosing German instead. I've been learning both Russian and German for the past six months now. This past summer I was able to get certified to teach English as a foreign language (T.E.S.O.L certification to be more specific) and was able to do an internship in Novosibirsk, Russia teaching English to children and teenagers. I am now in Germany doing an exchange program in order to improve my German. 

Here is my issue now. Because of the internship I did Russia, my boss there recommended me to some other language schools and they have presented to me some very good job offers as an English teacher where I can live comfortably and still have time to pursue an education. Some of these offers are better than those I can get back home in the U.S. One company offers free accommodation, a decent salary, company health insurance, etc. These are jobs that I can also make into a career as an English teacher now if I decide to change majors, which I wouldn't mind doing. I figured if I transferred to a college where I can get an English Bachelors degree online (This would allow me to keep all my federal financial aid) and go ahead and go to Russia to start building up a career there. I know that most of my credits I already obtained would transfer. I could finish my bachelor's in German by the end of Spring 2018, but it's honestly not a major I want to pursue and I would rather have a degree in either English or Russian. (I regret now not starting with English in the first place). I could find any type of work back in the U.S. while finishing my degree, but it would only be low level work like pizza delivery or student/work. Any English teaching jobs that I could get now based on my credentials would only be unpaid internships. (I'm done with unpaid internships. I've done two already)  My argument is, why should I go back to U.S. and finish my degree and know that I will have a difficult time finding work after graduating when I could to another country where I will always:

- have good job offers
- be able to learn another language that I enjoy learning and want to learn
- be able to develop my career now while studying and get paid to do it (this would mean that the family member who is supporting me could stop paying for my living expenses and use that money for other things.)

And also to be honest, I love Russia and I honestly wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life there (which sounds a bit nuts, I know)

I know that there is this certain stigma though where online degrees do not carry as much weight as an in person degree and does not look as good on a CV. However, I think that this stigma only applies if a person is pursuing their entire degree online. I think in my situation wouldn't matter as much because I've already done about two years of college, so any company would see that I had the dedication to stay in class and study the material. That is the main issue I'm having. Should I just finish my last year or so online and be done with it while working in Russia. Or should I go back to the U.S. and change majors to English? Or perhaps maybe there is another option I haven't though of? Any suggestions would be helpful because I'm kind of stuck at this point. Thanks in advance to those that can help."
5j2pw4,1,2016-12-18,"I could really use some advice right now, I'm a bit worried about something (somewhat tangentially related to ADHD, need general advice)",unconstrained1,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5j2pw4/i_could_really_use_some_advice_right_now_im_a_bit/,"Hi all,

So it's finals week at my school and I have been trying to study this entire weekend, but keep getting distracted by something on the back of my mind.

I will try to explain this as quickly as possible. This semester, I have been looking for an engineering internship to give me more experience while earning class credit and money. I was getting very irritated because I sent out so many applications, and places were not getting back to me. I wanted to secure a position for next semester so I can be sure that I had some form of income.

I did most of my applications at the beginning of November. Fast forward to around November 7, I received two interview offers.

One job I applied for was for an electrical engineering internship related to my major. The other job I applied simultaneously for was a sales position with commission as a backup just in case I did not receive the internship.

 I was desperate while applying: I am a bit broke right now as a college student, so I decided why not interview for both just in case one did not work out. I now realize that was a mistake.

Well, I got hired on the spot for the sales position, and had my interview for the other (better) internship position the day after. That interview also went well, but they did not reach out to me until a few weeks later (beginning of December) to confirm that I had received the job offer since there were other candidates involved.

 Since I was worried that I was not going to hear back from the internship, I decided to go through with training for the first sales job offer. Although I was hired on November 8, my training was not until December 9, which seemed a bit off to me but it's a smaller company so I wasn't too concerned. I found out literally the day after I finished training that I had received the internship position at the electrical engineering company for next semester.

After training, I realized that I am not too keen on this sales position I secured before the second internship. I only get $15 for each 30-45 min appointment I make, and if they buy the product I get $30 commission. For this position, I was told that I can make my own hours which is a plus. However next semester I have a full courseload, and junior year is generally the hardest year.

This product is a meal kit delivery service, which sounds nice and all but as a college kid, I don't know many people who cook on campus. They usually use a meal plan, and the service is $70 a week for 3 meals that feed 2 people so kind of expensive for people my age. After every appointment, I am required to have the person write down 10 or more people that I can sell the product to, which honestly makes me nervous as I don't want my family and friends to think I am using them. The company itself is reputable, but the way they are going about selling seems a bit abrasive to me. Furthermore, I am introverted and I have no clue what I was expecting when accepting this position.

Although they know that this is my finals week, they still expect me to check in with them by calling every morning between 8 to 10 am and tell them who I plan on selling to for that day. They have already requested that I book appointments, and to write down 45 friends and family members that I have to cold call and basically pressure them into seeing this product. The scripts for the call pretty much force the customer to book an appointment with you, and I'm not sure if I am comfortable doing that.

This already made me feel nervous since I have sleep problems and have trouble getting up that early anyways, I have been going to bed around 2 or 3 am and getting up around 10:30. I have already fallen behind on my assignments for this job, but I have no motivation to continue. They already did the training so I would feel horrible just leaving but I don't think I can do what they are asking.

I don't even have a car on campus, so they want me to use public transit to go and sell to people. Furthermore, they have weekly meetings on Mondays, and next semester I work Monday, Wednesday and Friday 9 to 5 for my new internship. They want me to come to these meetings every Monday, even though the office is an hour and a half away by public transit just one way. For fucks sake, they want me to come in next Tuesday after my final for that day and come to the office for additional training. What don't they get about me not having a car and having finals???

Overall, I feel overwhelmed because I took off more than I can chew only because I got nervous about not having any money for next semester. 

I have a pretty good GPA that I need to keep up for my honors scholarship, and I think that having 16 credits in engineering + an internship + a part time job is rather unreasonable for someone who has been dealing with increasingly bad ADHD throughout college. In previous semesters, I already had to reduce courseload due to anxiety/depression/concentration issues that I had been having. I have been improving on my ways to cope with school, but I do not want to regress into my former nervous self.

This sales position has very little with my future career goal of becoming a patent attorney. Overall, will it affect me badly if I were to quit the job? I feel so guilty for them taking the time to train me, and just bail like that.

it would not bother me if the company itself blacklisted me from working there again, but I am worried about my employment showing on a background check and having future employers ask questions. Furthermore, I don't know what to say if i do end up resigning. I have been having physical and mental health issues this semester, and I am finally seeing a doctor over break. Should I use my health as the reason I am leaving?

**
TL;DR started a sales position out of fear of having no money next semester while waiting for an internship to get back to me. Found out I got the internship the day after I completed training and onboarding. Turns out, I was so desperate that I picked a job that I absolutely cannot see myself doing. Is it too late for me to get out of this? Is it normal for someone to be so dreadful of running out of cash that I would be so impulsive to pick a position so adverse to my comfort zone?**

That interview also went well, but they did not reach out to me until a few weeks later (beginning of December) to confirm that I had received the job offer since there were other candidates involved.

Since I was worried that I was not going to hear back from the internship, I decided to go through with training for the first sales job offer. Although I was hired on November 8, my training was not until December 9, which seemed a bit off to me but it's a smaller company so I wasn't too concerned. I found out literally the day after I finished training that I had received the internship position at the electrical engineering company for next semester.

After training, I realized that I am not too keen on this sales position I secured before the second internship. I only get $15 for each 30-45 min appointment I make, and if they buy the product I get $30 commission. For this position, I was told that I can make my own hours which is a plus. However next semester I have a full courseload, and junior year is generally the hardest year.

This product is a meal kit delivery service, which sounds nice and all but as a college kid, I don't know many people who cook on campus. They usually use a meal plan, and the service is $70 a week for 3 meals that feed 2 people so kind of expensive for people my age. After every appointment, I am required to have the person write down 10 or more people that I can sell the product to, which honestly makes me nervous as I don't want my family and friends to think I am using them. 

The company itself is reputable, but the way they are going about selling seems a bit abrasive to me. Furthermore, I am introverted and I have no clue what I was expecting when accepting this position. I guess moreso a marketing/general office help position to help grow the company?

Although they know that this is my finals week, they still expect me to check in with them by calling every morning between 8 to 10 am and tell them who I plan on selling to for that day. They have already requested that I book appointments, and to write down 45 friends and family members that I have to cold call and basically pressure them into seeing this product. The scripts for the call pretty much force the customer to book an appointment with you, and I'm not sure if I am comfortable doing that.

This already made me feel nervous since I have sleep problems and have trouble getting up that early anyways, I have been going to bed around 2 or 3 am and getting up around 10:30. I have already fallen behind on my assignments for this job, but I have no motivation to continue. They already did the training so I would feel horrible just leaving but I don't think I can do what they are asking.

I don't even have a car on campus, so they want me to use public transit to go and sell to people. Furthermore, they have weekly meetings on Mondays, and next semester I work Monday, Wednesday and Friday 9 to 5 for my new internship. They want me to come to these meetings every Monday, even though the office is an hour and a half away by public transit just one way. For fucks sake, they want me to come in next Tuesday after my final for that day and come to the office for additional training. What don't they get about me not having a car and having finals???

Overall, I feel overwhelmed because I took off more than I can chew only because I got nervous about not having any money for next semester.
I have a pretty good GPA that I need to keep up for my honors scholarship, and I think that having 16 credits in engineering + an internship + a part time job is rather unreasonable for someone who has been dealing with increasingly bad ADHD throughout college. In previous semesters, I already had to reduce courseload due to anxiety/depression/concentration issues that I had been having. I have been improving on my ways to cope with school, but I do not want to regress into my former nervous self.

This sales position has very little with my future career goal of becoming a patent attorney. Overall, will it affect me badly if I were to quit the job? I feel so guilty for them taking the time to train me, and just bail like that.

it would not bother me if the company itself blacklisted me from working there again, but I am worried about my employment showing on a background check and having future employers ask questions. Furthermore, I don't know what to say if i do end up resigning. I have been having physical and mental health issues this semester, and I am finally seeing a doctor over break. Should I use my health as the reason I am leaving?

**TL;DR started a sales position out of fear of having no money next semester while waiting for an internship to get back to me. Found out I got the internship the day after I completed training and onboarding. Turns out, I was so desperate that I picked a job that I absolutely cannot see myself doing.

5j34u8,0,2016-12-18,Advice for someone with a CS minor.,Krung_Bungus,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5j34u8/advice_for_someone_with_a_cs_minor/,"Graduated last year with a degree in econ and a minor in applied cs. Originally on the track to a career in financial/business analysis and now thinking I may be looking at something in IT or as a developer. Is my minor going to count for anything when I am looking for an entry level job? My plan is to try and get some relevant certifications and possibly build a small portfolio of projects before I start searching. 

Overall I suppose my question is whether or not I will need extra schooling to break into the industry? I am worried that my minor + certifications won't pull enough weight and that I will need an extra 2 or 4 year degree in order to land a job.

EDIT: I just checked and I would only need around 2 more semesters to finish out a full major in CS so that is also an option. I'm thinking that might be a good bet because that would qualify me for an internship."

5j3lax,2,2016-12-18,To those studying robotics (including ME and EE),jetlife95,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5j3lax/to_those_studying_robotics_including_me_and_ee/,"Hey guys, so here's my situation:

I'm a 2nd year aerospace engineering student. I have recently gained a lot of interest in robotics through classes and several projects. I'd like to study robotics in greater depth (graduate school), and I'm worried that a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering won't prepare me to do so. I'm considering changing my major to either electrical or mechanical engineering. At my school (state university), all of the robotics classes are taught in the EE department, so I am also considering transferring elsewhere to do ME/robotics. Here is a summary of my academic achievements since coming to college: 

3.98 GPA (4.0 scale), 60 credit hours done 

Coursework done: calc 1-3, engineering physics 1, computing (matlab), statics, dynamics, solid mechanics/mechanics of materials, chemistry 

Projects/extracurricular: AIAA rocket competition, university mars rover team, autonomous VTOL drone project, racing drones (more for fun with other students), aerospace manufacturing internship 


I'd hope to transfer Carnegie Mellon, as I can do ME with a robotics minor there. It's also a great place for grad school with their robotics institute. My questions for all of you guys are:

1) what are my chances of getting into Carnegie? 
2) what other schools would you recommend me looking into that offer a robotics minor, emphasis, etc? 
3) can I stay in aerospace engineering now and do robotics later? 
4) any robotics schools that offer lots of merit based scholarships? I don't have need but don't see the point in paying $60k a year for a bachelor's degree. 

I'm also looking at applying to the university of Utah as well. I'd prefer to do a ME degree with either a minor in robotics or specializing in robotics and control with my tech electives because I'd still have a lot of flexibility when it came to work and/or grad school. 

Thanks in advance! "

5j3uzc,6,2016-12-18,The Christmas Party,Suspenny,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5j3uzc/the_christmas_party/,"I have read stories on here before as a guest but have never posted and can not talk to anyone about this at the party. I have only been at this company for a year and they will think I am insane. I do not have long now until it is my turn. I want to run or make an excuse but it is like I am being pulled in. I am writing this now as I wait in line for the light to turn green. 

I have worked for the same company for the past year and I am attending my first Christmas party. It is quite a large marketing company but I work for a smaller sub division. Our department works mainly on social media, reporting on injustices in the world. 

Anyway, this Christmas party started out at around midday in one of the larger offices on the top floor. We were told that the company had paid for everything to be planned, from the catering to the events. The desks had been removed and hired tables and chairs were put in place. There is 300 people in the company many of which I have never interacted with. I was sat on a table with many people from my department, which was perfect as I had made some great new friends in my department. 

There was a presentation at the beginning about how well we had all done and how we should be proud of our achievements. Then there was some more about upcoming projects etc. We all knew that this was a little contrived, as we had all heard the stories about the company struggling recently. Some of the longer standing employees were worried about being laid off. I do enjoy this job but I am still quite young and on a pretty basic salary with no real financial burdens, so although it would not be nice to be laid off I am not overly stressed.   

It was around 2pm that the presentation ended and lunch was to be served along with drinks. There was a Michelin star chef hired for the day to create the food and it was nothing short of astounding. I had forgotten to tick whether I wanted a Vegetarian, Meat or a Sea Food main course so I was given a Sea food main. I am not a fan of sea food so I was slightly frustrated but it was cooked so perfectly that I had forgotten I had an aversion to it at all. 

After the lunch had ended many people stayed at their own tables drinking and talking. There were so many people that did not know each other, that it felt more like a meal with friends than a company Christmas party. Then one of the founders of the company made a speech about how the planned exercises were about to start. We were told that to encourage bonding within the company we would be paired with people from other departments.  I was slightly frustrated by this as I was not really in the mood to meet new people as I had made some good friends in my department. I also hated the concept of forced fun. I was a few drinks down at this point though so was more willing to comply. 

  I was paired with a loud brunette lady from sales called Sarah, a rather quiet but kind looking man called Tim from accounting and Troy, an intern straight out of university. There were a few other people from other departments but will not name everyone as it is not relevant.  By this point it was around 5pm and people had started to fan out slightly but most people were still in attendance. It was mainly parents who needed to pick up kids who had left but also people with other plans or had just had too much wine with lunch. 

There seemed to be a few different events set up by the company with Anthony our team builder talking us through them quickly. There was a ping pong table and he said there would be some trust exercises. There was also a small green plastic tunnel going into a blacked out room which I guessed was a managers office. It was like one of those plastic tunnels you would see as a kid almost like an outstretched slinky big enough for an adult to fit through. Then next to this it had a set of traffic lights and then a sign that said, “Enter to meet Santa”.  He did not mention this but I figured it was just another fun event for later in the evening.  

  The first event involved Anthony asking us if we had any money on us. It ended rather abruptly when not one of us did. It was a paid for Christmas party after all and I only ever carried credit and debit cards on me. I think it was meant to be the “Who’s Got A Dollar” exercise which does not work as well without the dollar. The team builder laughed it off then said “Who has got a phone”. We all pulled our phones out and he took Sarah’s phone and handed it to Troy. He said to Sarah to whisper your passcode to Troy and visa versa and then asked Sarah &amp; Troy to walk off for 1 minute in to a corner out of view and choose whether or not to look at the contents.

It was quite a nail biting experience. Karen seemed quite calm so I assumed she did not have much to hide. She was an older lady with three children I had learnt so I imagined it was pretty mundane. Troy and Karen come back after the minute stating that they chose not to look at the contents. At this point people were becoming a little bit on edge, thinking what they had on their phones they did not want others to see.  The team builder then took another two phones from the group and said you have 3 minutes this time. I think it was to see if with more time available, would you change your mind and become more intrigued.  

It was not made completely clear how you would know if someone had looked at the others phone but I guess it was out of guilt. This was a trust exercise after all so you just had to believe that they did not.   It was then left to me and Tim as the final members of the group. I took Tim’s phone and he took mine and whispered our security pass codes to one another. 

I did have an urge to look at the phones contents but I also knew that if I looked everyone would know I did. I have always been a terrible liar ever since I was a kid. I was adamant I would not look so I put it in my pocket and stood in the corner sipping my drink.  A couple of minutes went by, then the phone buzzed. I ignored it at first but then it buzzed again and again. 

  I decided to look as no one from the group could see me I reached for it out of my pocket. I figured if it was just a message on the screen if would not show I unlocked it. The new messages would also still be there further reinforcing that. It showed a new message from my phone number. I was slightly confused at first but then obviously just realised it was Tim. I figured at first it was him apologising for looking at my phone. 

I looked at the messages and it was the same message 3 times “Can you see me?”.   I was slightly confused, I looked over to the corner that Tim had been assigned but he had his back to me. I could see him but I was not sure what he meant by all of this. Did he mean that could I see him looking through my phone? I just figured it was a joke or a way of him apologising for looking at my phone. 

Then all of a sudden the phone buzzed in my hand and the text read, “I can see you”. I turned around and Tim had his back to me in the same position. I looked at the clock on the phone and saw that 6 minutes had passed. I wanted to respond and was not sure what to say but I was intrigued. 

I swiped unlock and punched in the pass code ignoring any thoughts of being caught. I then replied with “Haha, did you look? I don’t really understand? I can see you!”. I waited a minute for a reply then with the final two minutes of the ten left the phone buzzed. 

I was slightly apprehensive to what the text could be but I was not particularly scared more confused than anything. The text read “No you can’t”. Then quickly followed up with, “But when the light turns green you will”. 

I stood there confused and now slightly terrified about what the was happening. It was surely just Tim playing a prank with me maybe people from his department did this every year whenever they played this trust building exercise. I was not sure if it had been done before but I had no idea what else to think. I then heard “Time is up, come back”.

  I quickly locked the phone and walked back. I handed the phone back to Tim staring at him trying to get some idea of what had just happened. He just stood there with the same kind expression as before with no hint of malice. “That is not my phone” he said. I felt a sense of dread through my entire body speechless at the remark. 

He then followed this up by saying,  “did you take a spare just in case you had to play this game? I am glad I didn’t look at yours as it’s probably an empty phone” laughing as he said it, which made the whole group laugh poking fun at me. 

I then put my hand in to my pocket and felt another phone in my pocket, it was Tim’s. I pulled the phone out of my pocket and placed it from my trembling hands to his not saying a word. 

I must have looked terrified at this point and I could feel my whole body tensing up as Anthony said jokingly “Is all okay Nathan? I hope there was nothing too terrible on Tim’s phone”. I quickly laughed said “Oh no, I didn’t look, sorry I think I am just feeling slightly under the weather”. He just shrugged it off then explained the point of the exercise to everyone, told us to change out pass codes and said that Beer Pong was up next which was met with a cheer from the group. 

I just stood there unable to move, it was a mixture of fear and confusion. I figured I just had a momentarily lapse in sanity but that does not explain the other phone. Where did it come from? Why is someone texting me? It was a new iPhone so it seemed strange for someone to play a prank like this. The passcode also worked how is this possible if it was not Tim’s phone, nothing made sense. 

The beer pong commenced and I was paired with another member of the group. I was struggling to keep it together but I just blocked it from my mind and told myself to enjoy the party. Then towards the end of the game the phone buzzed again but this time it was a phone call. 

I let it ring for a while before answering it. It played the beginning of a song, a well known Christmas song. It was like a child was singing it but it almost sounded robotic at the same time like it was a distorted recording. I am not sure how to explain it but it just sang the chorus over and over again. 

“You better watch out, You better not cry, You better not pout i’m telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town”. 

As I was listening the event planners shouted excitedly to every one that it is now time for the main event. We are all going to visit Santa.  

I am up next in line to go through the tunnel now. The light is red at the moment so someone is in there. It’s pretty quiet from the outside and there does not seem to be another exit but I am sure there is a door on the other side of the wall. I am sure this is all just in my head, it’s only a visit to Santa after all. The light just turned green I have to go now. "

**Please bear in mind I am pretty anxious right now amidst everything, so please let me know if I need to clarify anything.**

So it's finals week at my school and I have been trying to study this entire weekend, but keep getting distracted by something on the back of my mind.

I will try to explain this as quickly as possible. This semester, I have been looking for an engineering internship to give me more experience while earning class credit and money. I was getting very irritated because I sent out so many applications, and places were not getting back to me. I wanted to secure a position for next semester so I can be sure that I had some form of income.

I did most of my applications at the beginning of November. Fast forward to around November 7, I received two interview offers.

One job I applied for was for an electrical engineering internship related to my major. The other job I applied simultaneously for was a sales position with commission as a backup just in case I did not receive the internship.

I was desperate while applying: I am a bit broke right now as a college student, so I decided why not interview for both just in case one did not work out. I now realize that was a mistake.

Well, I got hired on the spot for the sales position, and had my interview for the other (better) internship position the day after. That interview also went well, but they did not reach out to me until a few weeks later (beginning of December) to confirm that I had received the job offer since there were other candidates involved.

Although I was hired on November 8, my training was not until December 9, which seemed a bit off to me but it's a smaller company so I wasn't too concerned. I found out literally the day after I finished training that I had received the internship position at the electrical engineering company for next semester.

This product is a meal kit delivery service, which sounds nice and all but as a college kid, I don't know many people who cook on campus. They usually use a meal plan, and the service is $70 a week for 3 meals that feed 2 people so kind of expensive for people my age. After every appointment, I am required to have the person write down 10 or more people that I can sell the product to, which honestly makes me nervous as I don't want my family and friends to think I am using them.

The company itself is reputable, but the way they are going about selling seems a bit abrasive to me. Furthermore, I am introverted and I have no clue what I was expecting when accepting this position. I guess moreso a marketing/general office help position to help grow the company?

Although they know that this is my finals week, they still expect me to check in with them by calling every morning between 8 to 10 am and tell them who I plan on selling to for that day. They have already requested that I book appointments, and to write down 45 friends and family members that I have to cold call and basically pressure them into seeing this product. The scripts for the call pretty much force the customer to book an appointment with you, and I'm not sure if I am comfortable doing that.

This already made me feel nervous since I have sleep problems and have trouble getting up that early anyways, I have been going to bed around 2 or 3 am and getting up around 10:30. I have already fallen behind on my assignments for this job, but I have no motivation to continue. They already did the training so I would feel horrible just leaving but I don't think I can do what they are asking.

I don't even have a car on campus, so they want me to use public transit to go and sell to people. Furthermore, they have weekly meetings on Mondays, and next semester I work Monday, Wednesday and Friday 9 to 5 for my new internship. They want me to come to these meetings every Monday, even though the office is an hour and a half away by public transit just one way. For fucks sake, they want me to come in next Tuesday after my final for that day and come to the office for additional training. What don't they get about me not having a car and having finals???

Overall, I feel overwhelmed because I took off more than I can chew only because I got nervous about not having any money for next semester. I have a pretty good GPA that I need to keep up for my honors scholarship, and I think that having 16 credits in engineering + an internship + a part time job is rather unreasonable for someone who has been dealing with increasingly bad ADHD throughout college. In previous semesters, I already had to reduce courseload due to anxiety/depression/concentration issues that I had been having. I have been improving on my ways to cope with school, but I do not want to regress into my former nervous self.

This sales position has very little with my future career goal of becoming a patent attorney. Overall, will it affect me badly if I were to quit the job? I feel so guilty for them taking the time to train me, and just bail like that.

it would not bother me if the company itself blacklisted me from working there again, but I am worried about my employment showing on a background check and having future employers ask questions. Furthermore, I don't know what to say if i do end up resigning. I have been having physical and mental health issues this semester, and I am finally seeing a doctor over break. Should I use my health as the reason I am leaving?

**TL;DR started a sales position out of fear of having no money next semester while waiting for an internship to get back to me. Found out I got the internship the day after I completed training and onboarding. Turns out, I was so desperate that I picked a job that I absolutely cannot see myself doing.

Please bear in mind that I am incredibly anxious right now, so let me know if I need to clarify anything on this post.

So it's finals week at my school and I have been trying to study this entire weekend, but keep getting distracted by something on the back of my mind.

I will try to explain this as quickly as possible. This semester, I have been looking for an engineering internship to give me more experience while earning class credit and money. I was getting very irritated because I sent out so many applications, and places were not getting back to me. I wanted to secure a position for next semester so I can be sure that I had some form of income.

I did most of my applications at the beginning of November. Fast forward to around November 7, I received two interview offers.
One job I applied for was for an electrical engineering internship related to my major. The other job I applied simultaneously for was a sales position with commission as a backup just in case I did not receive the internship.

I was desperate while applying: I am a bit broke right now as a college student, so I decided why not interview for both just in case one did not work out. I now realize that was a mistake.
Well, I got hired on the spot for the sales position, and had my interview for the other (better) internship position the day after. That interview also went well, but they did not reach out to me until a few weeks later (beginning of December) to confirm that I had received the job offer since there were other candidates involved.

Since I was worried that I was not going to hear back from the internship, I decided to go through with training for the first sales job offer. Although I was hired on November 8, my training was not until December 9, which seemed a bit off to me but it's a smaller company so I wasn't too concerned. I found out literally the day after I finished training that I had received the internship position at the electrical engineering company for next semester.

After training, I realized that I am not too keen on this sales position I secured before the second internship. I only get $15 for each 30-45 min appointment I make, and if they buy the product I get $30 commission. For this position, I was told that I can make my own hours which is a plus. However next semester I have a full courseload, and junior year is generally the hardest year.

This product is a meal kit delivery service, which sounds nice and all but as a college kid, I don't know many people who cook on campus. They usually use a meal plan, and the service is $70 a week for 3 meals that feed 2 people so kind of expensive for people my age. After every appointment, I am required to have the person write down 10 or more people that I can sell the product to, which honestly makes me nervous as I don't want my family and friends to think I am using them.

The company itself is reputable, but the way they are going about selling seems a bit abrasive to me. Furthermore, I am introverted and I have no clue what I was expecting when accepting this position. I guess moreso a marketing/general office help position to help grow the company?

&amp;nbsp;

My primary focus is C++, I'm currently reading Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup. Of course, after finishing that I'm planning to move on to more advanced books and keep learning. I'm also studying Data Warehousing since I might get an internship in a local company in my town very soon so I wanted to prepare well, I believe that experience might come in handy some day.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I had a pretty interesting conversation with my best friend and his girlfriend, they are planning to move to Canada in the future so I recommended for us to go together. They are in different fields of work but I figured it would be easier for us together, we could share rent and I think that it would overall be much easier for all of us. This would not happen very soon, we're planning to do this in 2 years. In that 2 years I would do my best to learn as much as I can in C++ and perhaps even another language so that I have something to offer to a potential employer.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the questions, finally. I'd like to know if it would be very hard to find or secure a job/internship in advance, before even going there, or would I have to move to Canada and then start searching for a job. I know that this will largely depend on my skills and knowledge but still, maybe someone had a similar experience. I'm not expecting a dream job from the very start, I'd be happy with almost anything to get going and go up from there, hopefully.  If anyone has some tips, advice, anything really, I'd be very happy to hear them. This would be a very big step for me and I'd like to do it right. 

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: I just realized that my title is ""How easy is to get a job/internship in Canada as a foreigner"", well, what I really meant was, ""How hard is it..."""

Hey guys, I've lurked here for a long time but never posted because I thought I had a pretty good path I'd take. School + learning on the side + side projects -&gt; Internships -&gt; Junior Dev job after graduation, etc. But circumstances have changed. I had some medical issues and took a break from school. While it was happening I had passed the drop date and there were some mess ups on my side and on the administration side, and I ended up getting all F's that semester because I wasn't there for the second half of the semester with the medical issue. Thankfully they let me appeal and I got retroactive withdrawals...good for my GPA but bad for my active hours. 

So now I've been there for 2.5 years and I'm only just now technically a sophomore. Also lost all my scholarships because of missing the semester after the medical issues. So I'm going all on student loans. Going to try paying the leftover with money I'm making from a part-time job but it's really hard. 

Also my CompSci classes are boring as fuck because I'm so much further along than my peers. Haven't gotten below a 95 on any assignment in CS since I started, it's just no challenge. And I've been working on a pretty significant side project (Android app) for the last 8 or 9 months that I'm spending a lot of time on. 

TLDR;

Basically right now I'm just wondering...is this college thing worth it? It feels like I'm wasting my time there because I'm learning so much more/so much faster on my own. And with the money issues I'm busting my ass with work just to go to school where I'm essentially doing busy work. Since my parents are down to let me live with them for a little rent it's very tempting to think about taking maybe a year to do some ""easy"" unrelated part-time work to pay rent while doing like 8 hour days just learning programming, and then going straight into internships and then jobs. What do yall think? Apologies for how long this thing got.."

I have accepted an offer from a company (Company A) that I came to love. After the interview process, I was really excited to accept with them.

However, I just got a completely unexpected offer from a Big 4 company (Company B). Even though I'm really excited about my current accepted job at Company A, I believe that it would be better for my career in the long run to renege and go to the big name company -- and it's not like I would be doing grunt work there. It would be as interesting as my accepted job (and probably with more room to grow, learn, etc).

This leads me to two big questions:

* Do you think it's worthwhile to renege? Am I right in thinking this is the better option, long-term (and probably short term too)?

* **If I am to renege, should I tell the recruiter from Company B that I already accepted with Company A?**

**EDIT:** Here's another piece of info that complicates my decision. The position I've accepted at Company A is full time. The position at Company B is a lower-level, transitional program (kinda like an internship) with a probably lower salary (at first). Would it be worth it to slow down my salary growth (and perhaps my career trajectory) in order to have a better shot at a full-time Company B job?"
5j7qxb,1,2016-12-19,Deciding between jobs,BajaJMac,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5j7qxb/deciding_between_jobs/,"Hello fellow Reddit people, 

I need some advice on what I should do here. So here is some background about the situation.

I am a full time college student with 3 more semesters to go before I obtain my bachelors. I currently also work full time in a position relevant to my field. 

I have been with my current company for about 2.5 years and started off as an intern, was promoted to part-time, and now finally promoted to full-time, have been for about 7 months now. 

I took over my coworkers position, as they left for another position at a larger company. We are great friends, and they wanted to me to join their team at this new company.

He referred me to their hiring team, they reached out to me, exchanged a couple of phone conversations and pre-screen stuff, and now they want a panel interview. Great. right? Here's the dilemma. 

While I know this isn't for sure guaranteed, as I still have to pass the panel interview, I am stuck figuring out what I should do. 

The new position would allow me to get a security clearance, it would allow me to obtain vasts amount of knowledge in cloud architecture, as well as allow me to absorb knowledge in my future career field. It has LOTS of growth for opportunity and once in, I can move around to different departments. It would also allow for benefits, higher salary increases, and even educational programs such as paying for my masters.

That being said, I'm afraid of leaving my current company simply for the fact that they have been so good to me and my schedules with school (as they can get pretty hectic). 

But I know this opportunity doesn't come up very often, and their interested in my talent...

What are every one's thoughts? I think I know what I should do... but at the same time I'm not sure!

Thanks for the replies!

OSU student,osucs_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5j8b5i/can_anyone_offer_some_advice_please_osu_student/,"Hi everyone - I could really use some advice at the moment. Not sure how much help this sub can be considering my unique situation but figured I’d give it a try. I graduated college with a finance degree this past May and am now pursuing a second bachelor’s degree at Oregon State University's online post-baccalaureate program. I'll be starting in the Winter while having a full-time job (in finance) and will hopefully graduate the program in two years.

My main concern is with internships and ultimately finding full-time job after the program - I'd ideally like to work for a large, multinational tech company. I don’t know much about this industry, and I could really use some advice. I’m really motivated and am a really good student but because this is an 'accelerated' degree (2 years) and because I'll be starting the program in the Winter it’s hard to follow the ‘typical’’ advice given here. Most college students are looking for summer internships and hope to find a job from the junior year summer internship. But I’ll only be in this program for two summers, 2017 and 2018. How can I be applying for internships for summer 2017 when I haven’t even started the program yet? I don’t have a GPA or anything. I’d be very willing to leave my current job for a full-time internship and, because of the flexibility of the program, it doesn’t have to be during the summer. But it seems like most companies have structured college internship programs designated for the summer.

Also, for the Summer of 2018 I suppose I can apply to internships like I would if I were a college junior looking for summer internship?  Would it be a problem though if I graduate in December as opposed to May when most college graduates graduate? 

My other concern is with personal projects and actually getting my foot into the door. Because I’ll be working full time (until I find a CS job/internship) and this is a 2-year program, my free time is extremely limited and aside for school projects I don’t know how many projects I’d have to demonstrate. How big of an issue is that? Also,  how important is networking in this industry? With finance , it was everything. Do you think it’s a good idea for me to reach out to alumni from my school at companies I’d like to work at?

Thank you very much! I know this was a handful to read, but I’m very lost at the moment. And yes, I am also in contact with a guidance counselor at the school about these questions, but I thought I’d ask her as well.

I started on a personal project at a hackathon a couple weeks ago since I'll be applying for internship positions next fall. The project initially seemed doable considering my skill level (aka beginner). But the more that I try to complete it, the harder it seems to get, AND furthermore I can tell that I am doing a total hack job (har har pardon the pun) -- like I was following some tutorials but as the project's complexity increased, I can see that somehow I should be breaking this up into different files, but I have no idea how. I've done a year's worth of programming classes, but I suppose a) those class assignments were much simpler, and b) for the more complex assignments, we got much more direction on how to structure the program. I feel lost on my own.

I learned basic OOP in Java, but I'm trying to do this project in Python (because overall I like Python better and we used that in my first course). I've never made a GUI in Python, so I followed some basic tutorials on wxPython, but now have no idea how to structure my project into something elegant and sensible that's easy to understand. (It shouldn't be this hard!! It's an easy project [I thought]!) I've got almost 300 lines of code in one file, it kind of looks like a mess, and I can sense that there are probably reasonable ways of splitting these up into different files and classes with intelligent inheritance going on, buuut I don't know how to approach it. It's like it's gotten out of my control now and I don't know where I'm going. I can't see the forest for the trees.

Anyway, I'm feeling lost and demotivated. Should I just try to plow through and finish the project even if it's not very well-organized and kind of garbage-y, so that I've at least got something on my resume? Got to start somewhere, right? Or should I abandon ship and do something else? Ooor...? 

I'm just kind of embarrassed by it at this point, but I don't know how to make it better and I don't know what potential employers' expectations are. Will they be happy I've got a working personal project at all, or will they be like ""ugh what a disastrously organized personal project, pass thanks""?

Advice?

TL;DR: Is it better to have a shitty but functional program on your portfolio, or better to restart and risk having nothing ready come hiring time?

I do get to fix computers, remove viruses, and help people through connection issues and software installations over the phone, but a lot of the job involves selling things to people, some necessary, some not so much. We're only allowed to work on Windows machines and generally not allowed to use the command line (a rule that my coworkers and I break frequently). 

Our state's government just opened a new 'IT Generalist Internship' three month position. It's around $11/hr, 28 hours a week. The position is described as a combination of a small corporate network position and an instructional technology position (which was my college major and my primary focus). The network is GNU/Linux based and they offer several projects in virtualization and Cisco networking. The facility works specifically with a branch of the government I've been looking into for years, but was unaware they had an IT department. 

I'm leaning heavily toward applying for the internship but it would mean taking a pay cut, working about ten hours less, and giving up things like my 401k (where I currently have almost a thousand dollars). Neither position offers insurance or benefits outside the 401k at my current job, but I have insurance outside of work that covers everything. 

In your opinion, which is the better position? I'm curious as to what you think. "

The problem is my long term interest is in software engineering -  getting the research internship was kind of a fluke, and the work i'll be doing there will basically be software development. I'll be a 'research intern' in name only. 

It seems like taking the research internship would make the most sense, but I hesitate because then the main internship that recruiters would see while reviewing my resume for a full time role would be ""XYZ company - research intern"". That might send the wrong signal, and there's only so much that I can do in the description section of the position to make clear that I was basically doing software dev. 

I also don't think it's okay to simply write ""software developer intern"" instead of ""research intern"" on my resume (even if i had manager approval, which I should be able to get). The positions just *sound* too different to do so. It also feels weird to do so. 

The software dev position is okay - the bank's a recognisable name, but obv there are a lot of (pejorative) assumptions that being a swe at a bank comes with. I don't know if they're true, but it’s safe to say I’d learn more at the research position.

Thoughts? Any help would be welcome. "
5jayef,1,2016-12-19,I need advice balancing my workload for my remaining Computer Science courses,Bat_002,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5jayef/i_need_advice_balancing_my_workload_for_my/,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/EVlgf) is a list of the remaining classes I need for my Computer Science Bachelors. I've been at community college until this next semester and I needed to catch up on my math prereqs, which is why so far I have mostly eliminated only general ed courses.

I was hoping to get advice on balancing these last classes out in this time period. I am a little concerned because I have to take all of my computer science courses at the same time. This makes me wonder: a) when will I be ready enough for a good internship? And b) how do I balance the workload to make sure I can handle getting As in my classes.

I don't have a job but I drive 30min to campus, and I plan on getting an internship at some point; Summer of 2018 or sooner. I have some family obligations that take a few hours of time each week.


I know everyone's workload capacity is different. My last semester, (Fall 2016 in the image) was the most difficult semester yet for me and I'm going to be retaking physics this next semester. It was my intro to programming class, calc-based physics and calc I that was difficult mainly because I fell behind and had to play catch-up the second half. I want to get all A's once I transfer to university and I am trying to develop a bulletproof strategy. If possible I would like to keep the workload around the same as this last semester and then go from there. Next semester is pretty much set and I'm registered for.

I have talked to my professors at community college and I've asked advisors at university but for the most part they are unsure. I know a lot of you guys on here have taken these courses already and may have even taught them so I would really appreciate any advice. My goal is to get a great internship (I currently live on $250 a month, no rent) and then segue into a great first job. :)

* I already have a BA in international studies.

* I have clearance due to an internship with government.

* I already owe $14,000 in student loan debt due to previous BA and one term at OSU for CS.

* I am 1/6 through the OSU post-bacc Computer Science BS. (i.e. I could finish in about 12 months)

* I took their Intro to CS (C++) and Discrete Mathematics for programmers.


I just realized halfway through my internship that being a diplomat (my ""dream job"" and main goal since middle school) was not for me. I want to be a developer. 


I am 25yo and don't want to live in my parent's basement anymore. I want to have a real job. My step-dad is abusive. 


I could finish this BS, but I don't want to be another $18,800 in debt (for a total of $32,800 debt) and stay here another 12 months.  I just want to take 6 months and do FCC, a lot of personal projects, and study CTCI / algorithms. I am extremely motivated.


Some of my OSU peers get halfway through the program and drop out. I could take another term. I don't want the debt, but if that would be better, I could. I decided to go with OSU because I wanted to be seen as ""legitimate"" and not a hack. After taking some classes there, I feel I confident I could self-teach.


I want your advice. In my circumstances (one BA, and some of a CS BS), can I drop out and still get a job?  Is the degree that much better, when I already have one?  If I do drop out, what should I focus on? Can I get a job somewhere right now, in something else, and self-teach and/or transition over? I just want your opinion, **What would you do?**

A little background. Going into my final semester for a Bachelors in Industrial and Systems Engineering. Currently I've been at my current internship for 14 months, the one before that was around the same time. So about 30 months of engineering experience. 

I started Appling for full time position, mainly because I have zero desire to work at my current company. I got a couple of phone interviews but most people wanted someone asap. Finally got a in person interview mid October. Interview went well and was interested in the company. A week later I got a call saying that they would like to bring me on ASAP to work part time during school, full time during breaks, and then eventually become a full time employee. This happened near the end of October, I was told I'd be getting a offer letter in the next couple of weeks. 

So one week goes by, nothing. Week 2, I email they respond saying they're still working on the paper work. Week 3, they tell me I should have some thing by the beginning of December and that they want me to start at the new year. Beginning of December rolls around, I email they respond that the guy taking care of it has been out of the country for work and has not been able to contact them. That response was around the 8th. I emailed yesterday and nothing so far. 

Besides the huge red flags that this shows me, we have not talk about money at all, benefits for when I go full time, drug testing (not worried about passing but worried about the processing time), and what my actual position is (only had the one interview, and they gave me a couple different options). 

I would need to give my current company a 2 weeks notice before I leave. Therefore starting at the new year isn't happening because I wasnt going to quit my current position without something in writing. 

So should I give up on this position and move on?"

I have a horrific self talk ""you are a loser, you never did anything right you will never amount of anything you are a failure a worthless human being, you are just a scum""...I am affraid of everything, full of fear, full of hate. 

I was once a joyful and loved guy. 

Any suggestion? 

I know, go see a shrink. I come to you for additional advices. I try to get help from as much places I can.

Is school right for me?",throwaway2147483,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5jgeva/constantly_failing_retains_math_courses_failing/,"I'm starting to feel extremely depressed and frustrated with my exam performance in school. I just found out I've received a D in my statistics course, which is a prerequisite for some future computer science courses. Doesn't sound too bad until you realize how common it is for me to have to retake a class.

This means I will fall behind another year for graduation. 

I started college 4 years ago and I'm still a junior in computer science because I always have to retake at least one course per semester. For example, I've failed calculus twice, passed it on the third time. Failed Physics twice, passed it on the third time. Failed discrete math twice, have to pass it next semester. Failed statistics for the first time, hoping I'll pass it next semester. I don't think I even passed my linear algebra class this semester.

But every computer science course I take I ace. With the help of a few friends, I had an unpaid internship over the summer and managed to build a lot of projects that data structure heavy. If I were to build a resume and portfolio, I feel like I can make an attractive one, except I can't include the fact that I have a 1.7 GPA and no computer science degree.

This is a partial vent and mostly me asking for advice. I enjoy computer science and programming, and if my classes only consisted of computer science, I know I could ace them all. But I'm always being held back by my test anxiety and failure to pass math classes. In college I'm not a good student even though I've tried my absolute best this semester. I feel like I understand the material, but I can't test well on it. 

I'm passionate towards computer science and I want to make a career off of it. Is college / getting a degree in computer science the path to success? Is it right for me?

I'm loving the new major so far and have aced all the course classes so far (discrete math and a CIS class).  I have my schedule planned out so that I'll graduate a year early (next year) but will be cramming all my upper division CIS courses into three terms.  If I do this, I doubt I will be able to do an internship since I am nowhere near qualified to do one this summer and will be graduated by the next summer.  

TLDR: Would it be better to graduate a year early with no internship (but get into the industry a year earlier) or pursue an internship and graduate later?"

When I was still attending college, it was mandatory to take a semester off for a paid internship, also known as a co-op. 

After interviewing at a neighboring college, I was offered an IT Specialist position at $14/hour. This was May 2015-August 2015, in Boston. I remember he left me a voicemail offering me the $14/hour for the position, however on the emails, there are no written proof. 

I found out about this because my current job uses ADP, which was what my internship used for time sheets and pay stubs.

Can I do anything about this? Was it my fault for never checking the pay stubs before? Should I email my former employer at the internship? Can I sue??

I'm just wondering what I should be doing. Recently I've started to learn some new languages and make Android apps. Do you guys think I have any chance of getting an internship for a real company? Or could I be hired on freelance sites? Do big silicon valley companies ever hire people my age (16)?

My parents moved across the country, and they informed me that I could no longer be under their health insurance plan as of 2016. I applied for insurance through healthcare.gov, and was lucky enough to qualify for Medicaid Expansion coverage.

Fast forward to October 2016, when I realized that I neglected to inform the Department of the income from my summer internship. I proceeded to report this extra income, and received a letter a couple weeks later stating that I was no longer eligible for Medicaid Expansion, and that I had already received several months of coverage which I would have to pay for. I was instructed to wait for more information regarding the amount that I owed.

Today, approximately two months later, I received another letter which says that I owe the North Dakota Department of Human Services $3952.80. The letter specifies that ""If the changes [in my income] would have been reported timely the Department would not have paid premiums on your behalf; therefore, you are responsible to repay the premium amounts to the Department.""

As a student who is many thousands of dollars in debt, there is no way that I will be able to pay this off within the 30 days that they specify. Additionally, I do not believe that $4000 is a fair trade for 4 months of health coverage, of which I did not use a cent. 
The letter which I received states that I have the right to appeal this decision; however, I am not sure it would be effective. I am the one who made the mistake, and their logic appears to be sound.

Are there any other moves that I can make at this point? 
Happy holidays, and thanks for reading!


**TLDR**: I forgot to notify the Department of Human Services of some income from a summer internship. Therefore, I lost my eligibility for Medicaid Expansion and received a $3952.80 bill for the 4 months of coverage that I received while ineligible.

I've had a job doing data management for two years now (summer job) and freaking loved it. Worked from home, was actively involved in getting results/managing real-world data and can't say enough how much I enjoyed my time and how much I learned.


Currently a freshman who just finished his first semester as a CSE major - and I'm actually just despondent. Failed Calc 1 (I've always been bad at math/really uninterested in the subject, and my shitty/small mistakes cost me the course - yes it was a requirement for my major) and my *""intro""* to programming class (how abjectly awful this course was is a story for another day), and passed my micro-econ and bio classes. Aside from me being 100% despondent currently, got me thinking about CS and if it's the right career path.


I loved my job. I loved the software (Dynamic CRM, VS) and the languages (VB, SQL) and really liked the concepts that my econ teacher went over this year. After this course, don't know how much I'm interested in ""true"" computer science (figuring the solutions out from scratch) rather than the information I'd rather be managing and making reports on that while using the code to assist in giving me the data I'd need. Projections, sales figures, just big data was a lot of fun to work with and analyze. If this is what I were to be doing everyday, I'd be more than satisfied. 


Might've just answered my own question in writing this, but I want some feedback on anyone who is/was a CS major, what internships within that field look like/jobs look like, and if I should be considering a switch to ITM (info tech management) from CSE if my career prospects align more with ITM.


If this is the wrong spot, let me know. Thanks for reading and I appreciate your feedback in advance. I'll clarify anything further in the comments that needs to be."

**COMPUTER SCIENCE IN 3 YEARS**

*This program offers me a computer science bachelor's degree concentrating in software development in 3 years, along with many services such as a summer internship experience.*

| Program Activities and Projects | Summer Internship (Big companies)     |                       |




 The option that caught my attention the most is the second one, digital web and art design, since I have a passion for game development. The problem is that I don't see any classes that will overall enhance my programming skills, like algoithims and calculus. Which option would be the best? Thank you so much.


I anticipated college as 4 years of partying and meeting new people, but came to a realization that I have to put in work to achieve the goals off success I aspire.

Other Application Highlights:
- Graphic Design Internship
- Leadership position at charity organization 

I applied to UW CSE department for Autumn 2016 but got rejected (advisor told me it was most likely because all of my credits were from outside of UW at the time). 

I'm wondering if I have a viable chance at the CSE department considering how competitive admissions are. My advisor stressed how much my first quarter would mean for my application into the major so I'm worried my CSE 154 grade will significantly hurt my chances even though it isn't a prerequisite. My time at UW at the moment is mostly just filler classes because I have all of my prerequisites done. I'm going to look to join some clubs during winter quarter in order to boost my application as much as I can. 

Anyway, I mainly have the following questions: 
1. Do I have a good chance at being admitted into CSE?
2. How similar of a career path can Informatics produce? Are my chances for admission into Informatics reasonable? 
3. What classes and activities would you recommend taking in order to help my application? 

Thank you in advance!"

I bought an FPGA about 1.5 years ago since I found that digital design was more interesting to me. While I've been diligent about doing personal projects on it, I still don't have that professional experience.

My question is, what employers have opportunities for digital hardware folks straight out of school? I know some of the defense companies do. For example, Northrop Grumman has positions for new college grads with 0-2 years of experience. What other places should I be looking at?

Should I contribute to open source projects on Github? Maybe write some libraries and get them out there? I'm more of a back-end type of person, if that matters. I don't particularly *enjoy* making websites but I figured I should make a personal 'about me' type of website featuring some of my work.

It was after I was randomly let go from my internship turned full time job (the guy I was replacing was coming back so they had no use for me).  I left on incredibly good terms and was able to use them as a reference for the job I just got.

Now being that I was let go and was pretty shaken by it, I needed to get a job ASAP, so I took the one that offered me the most money, and that let me start immediately.  

Since I started, the company has been fine, but the work I have been given is rather slow and boring.  I do not have any responsibility when it comes to doing my own work and most days I am just sitting around waiting for someone to let me do something.  I have gotten 2 red flags from employees by me that both told me to get out while I can, and that this job is a black hole (movement wise, there is no promotions, no incentives to do a good job and titles do not mean a thing, one guy has been a sys admin for 5 years and hasn't received a single raise).  Not to mention (my biggest concern) the commute to and from work is an hour every day and night.  It isn't the ideal dream job, but they pay me well and it is something, and everyone here has been extremely nice.

Since starting this job I have not stopped applying to others.  I recently went on an interview for a job with the same salary, that seems more relevant in what I would like to do as far as my career goes, and **significantly** closer.

It is a no brainer on which one I should choose, the biggest issue for me is that I would be starting as a 6 month to hire, and I would have to wait until then for certain perks.  Also the job I have now, seems a little more professional, while the other is a lot more laid back, the office does not seem as professional if that makes sense?

I guess what I want to really ask is how exactly do I quit this job?  I have only been here for a month and everyone *seems* to like me here.  I feel like no matter how I do it, it will seem pretty shitty. I thought about just not showing up, but obviously that would not be the most professional thing to do.  The thing is I am not sure if quitting in a month would even be professional, especially after building a pretty cool relationship with everyone here.

I understand at the end of the day its business and they are just going to have to understand, but what is the point in giving two weeks notice to a job that you really haven't been doing much for/and that you haven't been at for 2 months yet?"

Classes: All honors when I could except for AP's.

AP's: 
-AP world Sophomore year (only thing offered to sophomores) 

-AP Physics 1, AP Comp Sci, AP Lang, AP Psychology Junior year

-AP Calc BC, AP US Gov, AP comparative gov, AP Lit, AP Physics C Mechanics, AP Comp Sci AB (not sure how that's allowed since it's been discontinued but whatever) senior year

-4 in World and Psych, 5 in Lang, Physics and Comp Sci. Haven't gotten my senior year scores obviously. 

Awards: AP Scholar with distinction, National Merit Scholarship semi-finalist (I haven't been rejected as a finalist yet so wooo)

Extracurriculars: 

-Varsity rower 9th through 11th grade, which didn't give me time for other things because practice was every day and I'd get home at 7 every night.

-Founding member of community service club at my school, 11th grade

-Job at thrift shop, summer between 10th and 11th grade.

-Internship at cyber-security firm where I got to actually do a lot of coding, summer between 11th and 12th grade.

-Computer Science club, 12th grade.
 

Schools: The only ones I'm worried about are W&amp;M, Northeastern, and Villanova. 

Recs: Have one from my US History teacher and my AP Physics 1 teacher, as well as my counselor. They all like me and my counselor knows me well enough to say hi in the halls, which is more than I can say for some kids at an overcrowded school like this one.

I think my essays are solid, but not fantastic-I'm writing about me as a person, not just my accomplishments.

W&amp;M is in state for me, and state doesn't apply for the other two since they're private. 

I have a huge upward trend due to me not having ADD meds my first two years of high school, and I explain that much in my common app essay.

Additional Comments:  I'm not stupid. I'm well aware that given my grades, these are reach schools and that I probably have no chance. I've already been accepted into my ""target"" school and I'd just like to know if it's even worth applying. My primary reason for applying is, among other things, my friend flat out told me I wouldn't get in to W&amp;M and I'd like to tell him to suck it.  Please be brutally honest-the worst that'll happen is I get mildly hurt feelings and save a hundred bucks applying. 

Thanks so much-I really appreciate it!

5jll27,2,2016-12-21,Not sure how to list my education on resume,BasicUsername_,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/5jll27/not_sure_how_to_list_my_education_on_resume/,"Hey everyone! So I'm working on my resume for some summer internship applications and I'm not really sure how I should present my somewhat complicated education situation. So I started college as a freshman 3 years ago studying Mechanical Engineering and I didnt take my education serious at the time and failed out after freshman year. Completely sinking my GPA. I took a semester off to really evaluate what I wanted in life. I switched majors to Computer Science and attended a community college for a semester in order to get a good enough gpa and go back to the original school I was going to. Since switching majors (not including the year I failed out) my GPA has been about a 3.5 each semester and I am now 3 semesters into Computer Science. My overall gpa include the year I flunked is now a bit above 2.7. 

I want to impress recruiters but at the same time don't want to straight up lie on my resume and have them be really skeptical towards me if they request a transcript. I've worked really heard to adjust my thinking towards education and I love my field of study. So what do you think I should do? I was thinking about just including only the in-major GPA and not overall GPA from the first year engineering courses I took and did terrible in.

5jm3qa,2,2016-12-21,Why no internships for professionals?,eskarz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5jm3qa/why_no_internships_for_professionals/,"The way I see it is: an internship is an excellent way to see how a guy works (4 x 45 minutes interviews where you're asked how to reverse BSTs against a 2 months project? No fight at all).

Why aren't there internships for professionals? I tried to apply to 2 or 3 internships and they all required (even if they forgot to write it) to be in pursuing of a PhD or undergraduate.

Unfortunately I don't excel at interviews (I'm not terribly fast at thinking) but I repute myself logic and smart, so I'm searching for an alternative to join a big company.

Any advice/comment from someone in my same situation?"
5jm42p,6,2016-12-21,Sophomore year Internships,AquaAffinity,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5jm42p/sophomore_year_internships/,"So I'm currently a Sophomore in University, and I'm starting to feel a bit panicked about finding an internship this summer.  I'm a Computer Science major at NYU, and I've primarily been coding in Java since the start, having come in with coding experience from high school.  I have a lot of coursework, but not many personal projects (I'm going to work on it, but it discourages me). 

I'm nervous about not getting an internship this summer.  I've gotten no interviews so far, and honestly haven't even heard back from most places I've applied to.  So I wanted to know; how important do you think it is that I get an internship my sophomore year?  Would working on personal skills/projects be considered an acceptable summertime activity? 

Just as extra, I've never had a cs related career before, and I have a pretty good GPA.  I just don't know if my experience is enough to get me anything, and it's honestly stressing me out so much.

Thanks in advance.  I'd love to hear your opinions."
5jmeek,7,2016-12-21,Should I tell my former manager which company I reneged on my return offer for?,cvs333,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5jmeek/should_i_tell_my_former_manager_which_company_i/,"I was given and accepted return offer for an internship for next summer at a company located in the midwest. I recently reneged on that offer for a better internship at a company out on the west coast. I emailed my former manager and HR to let them know of my decision. The manager was a bit disappointed and then asked which company I decided to go to. I was intentionally vague in my original emails for fear of my previous company contacting the company where I accepted the offer. 

Now, I am wondering how I should proceed. The manager and HR rep do not seem to be really angry or anything, so I feel as though I may not have completely burnt my bridges with that company, and I would also like to think that they are not out to sabotage my future by contacting my new company and telling them that I reneged. However, I can't completely rule that out as a possibility in my mind.

How should I go about replying to this question while hopefully maintaining good standing with my previous company?"
5jmju0,88,2016-12-21,The Stranger in the Psych Ward (Part 10),McCainOffensive,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5jmju0/the_stranger_in_the_psych_ward_part_10/,"This will probably be the last post in the series. What happened after I was carried out was unimportant. I simply got a view of my new home for the next ten years, which is basically a prettied-up bunker. 

I won’t lie, it’s nicer than some places I’ve stayed at. If it were a hotel I’d give it three stars. The food isn’t even that terrible, better than what we served at school, but not by much. I can’t tell you where this is of course, but I will say it’s close to military airfield. Given how many of those there are in this country, that won’t do you a whole lot of good. The bunker doesn’t officially exist so you can’t find it in the records anyway. 

I have until the end of the year. Pestilence thinks it will be fitting to begin my period of service officially at the start of the new year. I’m using that time to put my affairs in order, and that 20 grand I got from 14 was helpful in paying for the repairs to the damage he caused. 

After buying Steven a new TV, much nicer than his old one so he can’t complain, I left my roommates a note explaining that I had been offered a long-term internship in the state capital. If there were any lingering repairs being done when someone got back, they were to be informed that everything had been paid for. 

I had also returned home for the holidays. I hadn’t been planning on it because I really didn’t want my family to deal with the shit I was, but it turns out some strange things have been happening to them. My dad told me the weird story about how his apartment building was the only one that hadn’t been damaged in the recent storm. This is even more unbelievable when you consider the fact that there was a tornado warning for the area.

It was very fortunate for my sister and my brothers, who were the only ones home at the time (Dad’s girlfriend couldn’t get there through the storm and he was working). My brothers were shaken by the experience, old enough and possessing enough experience to appreciate their own mortality. My little sister, precocious seven-year-old that she is, treated the whole thing like it wasn’t even worth mentioning. 

Rebecca and Bruce had always gotten along extremely well, even from the first moment they met. The only times Bruce wasn’t following me in the past was when he’d been following Rebecca.

The red haired little girl I still sometimes pictured her as had grown into such a fearless child, despite having encountered the same nightmares I had at the age of three. She’d probably been the most composed of any of us after that ordeal. 

I was sitting with her one night outside at my mom’s place, overlooking the pool and the view of the sunset in the distance. Rebecca was sitting quietly with Bruce curled around her protectively and petting him. I marveled at whatever let her continue as if nothing had happened to her. Maybe it was just that she had been too young to remember, or that the incident had been a dream. 

*Pestilence has a point,* my mind whispered. I really needed to start *analyzing* everything and anything I could. Maybe if I focused on the info I wanted, I can just scan for that. I looked at Rebecca, wondering how she could tolerate the knowledge of the supernatural. What I got back was, surprising to say the least.

*Age of mind makes it more pliable. Nature as demigod daughter of Set allows for a higher base tolerance to all things demonic or spiritual, but not cosmic. Identifies strongly with storms and discord.*

I blinked. Okay…couple things. The divorce makes a bit more sense now, or at least the bitterness and grievances on both sides do. The implications of that parentage are not comforting to me, but I shouldn’t look at Rebecca as a completely different person just because I know her dad is the god of storms and chaos and not a neurologist. She’s still my little half-sister at least. 

Rebecca turned to me, her expressive features screwed up in a frowny pout. “You did something to me.” It was less of an accusation and more a statement of fact with an implied desire for an explanation. 

“Because I was curious, that’s all,” I said placatingly. “I wondered why you were so strong, and now I know.” 

She squinted at me. “Assume I believe that. What did you do to me?”

“How could you tell?” 

“It felt like someone behind me was skimming the surface of my head with their fingers,” she said. Wind chimes began sound softly. “Someone directly behind me.”

Rebecca suddenly smiled, getting up and skipping to me. “But I still think it’s cool you can do stuff like that.” She hopped in my lap. “So, what did you do?”

“Exactly what I said,” I told her. “I found out the reason for your strength.”

“Is it ‘cuz dad’s not my dad?” she asked. My mouth hung open in shock, so she went on. “Jenny got silly one night at dinner and she told me. That’s why mom and dad got divorced.”

First, I was horrified. That’s one of the most terrible things you can say to a child, and a young one at that. Jenny was such a shitty drunk.

“Dad got really mad when she said that,” Rebecca said. “He told me he still loves me, but I’m not sure if I believe him.”

She said this so casually it worried me. “And that, doesn’t bother you?”

“Nah,” she said, sliding off me and onto the couch, pulling her knees up to her chest. “And that bothers me a little. I know I should feel bad about that, or hurt, but I’m not. I actually feel a little good thinking about it. Like I did them a favor, bringing everything to the surface instead of letting it just stay there. I don’t know. Feelings are confusing.”

*Yes, they are, * I thought. *Identifies strongly with discord? Even at seven she’s thriving off the chaos and dysfunction in our family.* 

Something else occurred to me. “You knew, didn’t you?”

Bruce shifted. He wasn’t responding for some reason. 

“Who are you talking to?” Rebecca asked, looking at me curiously.

“Someone who was supposed to tell me about all the weird stuff around me,” I said. “Well, Bruce? Do you get along with her so well because of her parentage?”

Bruce sighed. “As much as I personally dislike Set, his kids are generally all right. Only about 1 in 4 of them go bad, and the rest are just easier for me to communicate with. We do tend to get along because I am, essentially, a freakishly powerful storm spirit.”

I was about to chastise him when Rebecca whacked him with a pillow. “You lied!” I turned to her and saw she was tearing up. “You told me I was special and that only I could hear you!” She hit him again and again. 

“You are, little nimbus,” Bruce said. “Your brother is special too, in a different way. At the time I just didn’t realize that.”

“You’ve been talking to her too?” I asked. “For how long?”

“Pretty much since I got here,” Bruce said. “She was the reason I stayed after that whole thing. Didn’t feel right leaving a demigod that young behind, especially one so powerful as to attract demons at that age.” 

“So, you’ve been lying to me this whole time about why you’re here?” I asked. “It had nothing to do with me until the Stranger showed up?”

“Yep,” Bruce said. “And I’m about as happy as you are as to how that turned out. The fact that Pestilence knows about you is bad enough. I’d seriously put that invulnerability to the test if he found out about Rebecca.” 

“Don’t ignore me!” Rebecca shouted and a powerful gust of wind blew through the patio. “Don’t talk about me like I’m not here. I hate that!” 

The wind wasn’t gusting, but it was still blowing strongly. Rebecca looked thunderously at me and Bruce. As much as I hated to do this, I activated my magic. I *deconstructed* the air currents and *reconstructed* still air in a 20-foot ring around me.  The air was still swirling outside the ring, but Rebecca seemed stunned that I had done as much as I had. She tried to bring her winds inside but my *deconstruction* field was an absolute barrier. I had carved an eye onto her storm.

“I’m really sorry about this ‘Becca,” I said, using the nickname she only let me use. “I know you want to know just what’s going on, but I can’t tell you about that. I wish I could tell you, but I can’t let Pestilence know about you.”

“Unfortunately, he probably does,” Bruce said with resignation. “He was a frighteningly effective spook before he became a Horseman.”

“What’s stopping him then?” I asked, my concern entirely shifted to my little sister. 

“He plays a long game,” Bruce said. “Right now, Rebecca is too young for the law to apply to her. Demigods are always tricky cases. You’re more useful to him now, but as she gets more powerful she’ll become more desirable,” Bruce trailed off. 

“Another incentive for me to get better,” I said, sighing.

“Bruce, big brother,” Rebecca said, suddenly shaking. “Am I, going to get taken away?” 

“No,” Bruce said, convincingly. “Not if we can help it.” 

“Don’t worry about it,” I said, *reconstructing* a special edition 3DS-XL in front of her. Rebecca looked at the box with wonder as it spun itself into existence. She caught the box as it fell. I winked at her and pressed my fingers to my lips. She returned the gesture with a glimmer in her eye and ran off to enjoy her new toy.

I have until she’s twelve, about five years, before the law applies to her. Bruce says it’s safe to assume Pestilence knows everything, so I now have more reason to get better at magic.

I need to get good, fast. Rebecca is the most powerful child of Set Bruce has seen in a thousand years. I can’t even begin to think how Pestilence would use her.

He knows about all this. That’s the only reason he’s letting me say this much. Everything after here is classified. I can’t write about what I’m going to be doing, because apparently, a lot of it is highly illegal in addition to being highly classified. The government uses people like me in a lot of different ways, not always against the dark things in the night.

I won’t ever let him have my sister. That is my guide point. That’s how I’ll get by. Hopefully. 

Here’s to the madness of this world, hidden in the darkest corners.

A little information: 25, male, I have a bachelor degree in music education and a teaching licences, but came to that conclusion very quickly that teaching wasn't for me. A good segue for most in my field is to go to graduate school for music performance and hopefully to get on with a good orchestra or teach at the collegiate level, I tried this but the money just wasn't there for me to stay at that university and racking up $70k in debt for a music degree seemed insanely foolish so I had to leave and move back home where I've been for a full year as of today. It's not spectacular but I have a job at the front desk of a local hospital. Bills are thankfully paid and its a comfortable life, but I need to do something else. 


This past year has given me a lot of time to think about what I wanna do, my values, how I want my life to go and I've come up with 3 really good paths that are radically different but still hold my interest. 


interests: working with people,helping others, technology, video games, music, logic puzzles, fixing things, medicine. 


Jobs I've come up with that might suit me... 


1. Working in the hospital has given me a never before look into the medical field, and after finding out how interesting medicine can be I've been flirting with the idea of going to medical school but I'm not really sure how do go about looking into it? If I do decide to go into medicine I would like to specialize in infectious diseases, being able to help cure diseases and have that element of logic puzzles would be a welcomed challenge. This path takes the most amount of time, money, and resources in general but the reward is leaps and bounds higher and much more stable.

2.  instrument repair, I've always enjoyed working with my hands and have done all the repairs on my instrument and during my internship to be a teacher I spent my days fixing all the instruments of the high school they sent me to. I could see myself starting my own business. This path is only about a year long before I could start my own business which sounds lovely but would I be short changing myself?

TL;DR  Went to college to be a music teacher, hate teaching, and not sure if I should go into instrument repair which is quick and fun or go into medicine which takes alot more time and money? 

any suggestions, insight, or over all comments and comments are welcomed. Thanks for reading.

I've been looking for jobs and internships for a month or so, and I'm starting to feel like I don't know anything and my school was a shitty diploma mill. Most of these junior and entry level positions are requiring for 2-4 years experience with things I've never even heard of (Maven, Hibernate, Spring, etc.). My classes never taught or even mentioned any of it. I have applied to places that have more vague requirements for entry level positions (C++, Java, etc.), but I haven't gotten a single interview. I just don't understand how entry-level positions require 1-2 or sometimes 2-4 years of experience. It's so rare (or maybe it's just in my area) to find job listings that say 0-2 years experience. 


I'm just frustrated and hopeless now because I feel like I won't be able to get a job. I'm realizing now that my school was a complete joke. It just taught the bare minimum basics of OOP, algorithms, data structures, etc. It was never a challenge and I should have spent my spare time learning more (but instead, I chose to do tutoring for money). I've been learning more through websites and books like Cracking the Coding Interview, but I feel like it's just too little too late. It's going to take me at least a year to catch up. 


I know I don't really have a specific question. I just really don't know what to do for the future. Someone please give me some advice or guidance on how to get an entry-level job.

5joqzr,1,2016-12-21,"Wanting to be a professional game dev, 1 year of college courses, dont plan on going back. What is the best path?",Kybo10,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/5joqzr/wanting_to_be_a_professional_game_dev_1_year_of/,"**SCROLL BELOW FOR THE NEXT BOLD TEXT IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THE QUESTION NOT SOME BACKSTORY**

I had learned programming when I was 10-12 years old (21 now), wanted to make some games, got a few books and got stuck. This was about creating whole engines, and even when I got their source code it never compiled right, so I stopped.

I have done little coding here and there since, and I think it helped my critical thinking and problem solving as I got older, and I am giving it another shot. I wasnt old enough to know about premade game engines, and when I came across one I thought it was making your own games without code, which I didnt want to do.

I went to college for finance for 1.5 years, have 1 year of college credits, worked desktop support, and dropped out. Ill save you my life story but I am looking to get into it again, and since I dont have a career path, I had many dreams but unfortunately gave up on them for now, I cannot sit in my parents basement forever.

I only will want to make a career out of something I like enjoying though, and passionate about, and I kind of like game programming. I couldnt be passionate about software dev, even though I would like to try it some day, and its not my BIG dream, like that has a 1/bill chance of happening, so I decide I should go safe for a while, and I could always do something related to my dream if I want to later in life.

**HERE IS WHERE MY REAL QUESTION BEGINS**
So I have learned Unity, I am creating my first game in C# and everything is going well and I am learning quick. After I get a lot of the core features I want to clean up my code a bit, maybe find easier ways of doing stuff I was doing. It is a 2d incrimental game inspired by Adventure Capitalist. It has some unique features though, and when I am done I think I will throw some art on there, and see how it does on Kongregate and stuff like that. 

My main question is though, if I want to be a profession game dev, what is the best way to start with no college experience? I understand making a portfolio is key, but I want to start to try to learn Unity inside and out, then make a ton of different genres of games for a portfolio. I think creatively with games too so I think I make a good designer. Should my first job after my portfolio be like mobile games? Freelance? Would that be the easiest to get hired for? Is there a type of job or internship where I can get paid 1/3-1/2 as much and just learn, and train? I eventually want to do AAA games I think, be a part of a team to make something amazing that most people know to love, and I get to understand the back end of it also.

What is the best way to learn Unity inside and out? Should I switch to Unreal Engine to learn that inside and out too? What is the difference between them? Do I have to learn anything about making engines? I plan on doing some work on servers like Photon, as I have seen vids of it, and work with mysql too. 

I am just confused on what order I should be learning everything haha. Any help would be appreciated!"

I've struggled with some classes every semester thus far, but until now thought I could just power through and get the degree.  
Now though I feel like this just is not right for me, but have no idea what else to do; I still love engineering.  All I have going for me is 3 years of relevant internship experience and one lined up for the coming summer.  I still really want to get a degree in mechanical engineering, but I don't know if that will be possible.
I try to do things the ""right way"" (office hours etc as above) but when it comes down to it I suck at studying; even if I plan on doing something as soon as I sit down to do it I can't remain focused.  I want to talk to a counselor or something when I return to school because I feel like I might have ADD or something hindering my performance, because while I know I could have done some things better, I cannot understand how my grades are so abysmal.  
Has anyone else had a similar experience?  Is there any hope for me or should I just throw in the towel and find something else?"

5jq8k6,7,2016-12-22,Am I spending too much time on internship search? (Sorry for the rant),RauchyBear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5jq8k6/am_i_spending_too_much_time_on_internship_search/,"Hey sophomore student here. I have been applying to companies since October for summer internships. I have literally applied to hundreds of internships. I have had a good few interviews and a few online assessments that didn't lead to interviews. I even got to the final stage of an assessment day in a pretty good company. I currently still have zero offers. I keep applying and either don't hear or get rejected. I am still waiting on a response from two interviews at very big companies but it's been over 4 weeks and I am not too confident about one of them. What makes it worse is that I have put so much time into trying to get an internship. I have worked tirelessly on perfecting my resume (have multiple people review it). When I got an interview with google I worked my ass off for a whole week practicing interview technique and questions all day (planning to put aside a number of hours every week next semester to practice interview technique in prep for junior year) I feel that I am at a good level. After this I was constantly applying to internships as much as possible. My girlfriend has noticed how much I have been working on it and told me it might be a good idea to focus on my actual university course more (my grades dropped a little) or at least just put less focus on the internship search in general. 

It's now Christmas, I had so many plans for Christmas already. I had a list of things that I was going to spend all of my winter teaching myself. I also wanted to complete at least one personal project in machine learning as I have never tried that before and possibly improve my skills in other areas that I already have experience in with other personal projects. I wanted teach myself the new languages my university course requires next semester so that I was ahead of the class and had more time for personal learning, projects and work towards Junior year internships.
But unfortunately I'm stuck here applying to inter ships all day. It sucks, it's demoralising and it feels honestly like a waste of time currently. The part that really hit the nail in the coffin was that a close friend of mine was not too bothered about getting an internship this summer at first, but he decided to try eventually. He didn't spend much time on his resume and have much less personal achievement/experience than me (pretty much nothing compared to my 2 years OOP before university and attendance to multiple hackathons). He applied to some places, probably a good few but he did not spend too much time on it. I pointed him to the places that actually replied to me, he failed every coding assessment I passed. He did not prep much for technical interviews (did not even look at CTCI) either. He applied to a company that I had not applied to yet, they gave him an ""easy"" online assessment which he passed. He then got invited to an assessment day. Obviously I applied when he told me about it but I was given an extra initial test to do that he did not have to do. I was a hard maths test, I paused it and emailed the company asking if there had been a mistake. They said that they give that initial test to all applicants and that I would get an actually programming specific test after. So I will probably fail that based on my past internship experience. He has now been offered a job at the company (very large banking company). He put like a tenth of the work into internships that I did and it just makes me sad that I cannot land anything.

I want to grow my knowledge of computer science and do more of my own personal projects, I really do. But this endless internship search is stopping me and really just makes me sad. It took over my university work and stopped me doing sports. Yes I stopped attending my sport team practices as I found internship applications more of a priority (yes I am now dropped :( ). I even used to go to the gym religiously but I haven't been in 2 months. This internship search is literally affecting my whole life and I still haven't got anything, this sucks. 


Seriously. Seriously what should I do, should I keep searching or just give up and actually use my time on something useful and just wait until next year?

There will be so many typos in this post since I'm typing quickly, gotta go back to internship search :))"

How can I find out the truth about the work atmosphere, preferably by anonymously asking engineers?


I was extended a full-time conversion offer from a very large tech company last week, but my offer is for a different location and team than the one I interned for, thus I do not know much about this office (only the products they work on, which is appealing to me). I was able to tour the office, meet a few engineers and HR, and everything *seemed* great.

However, I now am finding ~10 bad reviews out of 20 reviews for this office on Glassdoor (company has many locations). Out of the 10 bad reviews, 6 of them mention a specific problem with a one or two managers harassing engineers and upper mgmt/HR not addressing these complaints.

I'm worried that anything I try to say to recruiter or my manager wouldn't prompt a truthful response about these issues simply because they want me to accept the offer. I **really** want to find a way to contact one of their engineers anonymously and try to better understand what the work atmosphere is truly like. A friend suggested trying to find an engineer on reddit, but I think the office might be too small for any engineers to regularly be on this sub. Any advice?"

Background:
Bachelor's in Finance upon graduation in May 2017.
University of Illinois in Chicago.
3.17 GPA.
Received straight A's for Fall 2016.
Will have 4 years experience in costumer service.
Will have 2 years experience in financial services from an internship.
I live in Chicago.

I am already utilizing university's career services and LinkedIn. I ran into a problem with my school's career services. They mostly offer minimum wage jobs, commission based internships or free internships. At this point I deserve better. I had interviews with higher quality employers, but didn't get accepted. LinkedIn is a lot better, but I am unqualified for the majority of those jobs. Therefore, please do not direct me to those sources.

I am looking for an entry level, full time job, upon graduation. I can do any office task and I am well rounded in Finance. My strengths are personal finance advising and equity management. I am not looking to prospect for clients or to be a salesman, but I could work well with existing clients. I am very good at executing a series of tasks that I am assigned to, so I am looking to receive hands-on training.

Please direct me to good job postings websites, especielly the ones that target fresh college graduates. You can also direct me to specific job offerings, related to my description, around the Chicagoland area. I am also accepting any advice or encouragement. I am really worried about being underemployed. I am capable of building a career, but I need to get my foot in the door. 

Thanks in advance for all your help!"
5jtgpn,6,2016-12-22,Failed out of my major senior year...desperately need advice on what comes next!,thepreventer_throwad,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5jtgpn/failed_out_of_my_major_senior_yeardesperately/,"I have been studying at a university with a great engineering program for the past 3.5 years. Over this course of time, I have failed a decent amount of classes from freshmen-sophomore year as a result of a) not studying hard enough nor smart enough and b) having a long term illness that really fucked with my head/hormones/emotions/ability to function properly (thyroid disease and thyroid tumor)

I appealed to be able to stay in the engineering school a year ago and had to wait a semester for it to go through, so i basically lost a semester right there. My first semester back in taking upper level courses I failed two of them, after working my ass off to pass both. Im bummed the fuck out as to how I went from a really smart kid in high school to just being a total failure in college. Needless to say, i can bitch about the past but i cant change it so im trying to focus on the future. I have a few options 1. Change my major within the school and try to graduate as soon as possible 2. Transfer schools to try and finish my engineering degree though the nearest school doesnt have electrical engineering (what im doing) but only computer engineering, and I would be set back 2 years. Also my shit performance in my classes this semester really turned me off to the subject. I love the information and knowledge that I have been learning and i genuinely liked the content but the rigor of the courses just fucked me. I want to continue with a STEM related major as I feel as if I give up with STEM and go to some liberal arts major or some shit that I will just fuck myself for the real world. I have always wanted to do the business side of engineering as I love business development specifically on the tech side. I know a few programming languages but im not to the level of a computer science major (not even close) and if i was to switch to computer science it would take another 2 years to even graduate assuming I pass all classes with flying colors.

I was thinking possibly economics with a math minor. If I was to switch to economics I would be still doing some math based business analyzation in conjunction with mathematics as a minor for which I would only need 4 classes to get the minor as I have done most of the other requirements as a part of engineering. Business consulting would be a top job for me as well as something along the lines of technical sales as I have extremely high quality intrapersonal skills and can communicate extremely well (great at public speaking). Im really just at a crossroads and I wanted to see what other people advise? CC isnt really an option as I am a senior and theres just no point, and if I was to transfer somewhere else I would lose next semester as it is too late to transfer for next semester. 

I am beyond fucking blessed that my parents help support me financially, and I work to aid in this process, but I just dont know if it is worth the burden to extend my education to nearly 6 years just to continue engineering, especially since its just too much money financially and I would like to get into the workforce as my lacking engineering grades havent let me get much real world experience. I have had numerous internships on the technical side in high school but I have only had one in college.

Any advice? Suggestions? Thoughts? Im at a crossroads and I really need some kind of advice for what to do to maximize future job security and minimize financial bleeding. "

Okay, to give you some backstory, I am 20 years old, very ambitious and in a bubble. 
I know I have 2 things to choose from. The 2 good things I'm good at naturally, since birth, which I also love are psychology and anything artistic. 
So I had decided to go to college and pursue getting my phd in clinical psychology until I realized getting paid 20 dollars an hour wouldn't be good enough to survive after going to school for so many years to get a phd, and went back to other roots which is art. 
Frankly, I'm tired of beating the same old horse, Ive thoughts about these 2 things for years, I'll continue explaining. 
The other option is pursuing my career in makeup artistry. 
I know a lot more than that, I know how to make and edit videos, photo shop, retouch, photograph, model, do various makeup looks, etc. 
All self taught since I was a kid, but that doesn't mean the entertainment industry isn't shit, nor does it mean that any artistic field and career revolves around who you know, instead of what you know. 
With any other career choice, you deal with competition, what you know or what degree or paper you have to ""prove"" you know something, but not in entertainment. 
I dont want to be around people whos only prerogative in life is becoming whatever definition of fame they seek, despite morality and ethics. 
I have a retail job now that pays over minimum wage, but the salary wont suffice forever and it really requires a lot out of me. 
I still have to save up for a car, etc. 
I left school before getting my associates because I decided college wasnt for me. 
I am licensed in skin care, Photoshop, etc, I just got the papers even though I learned nothing I didnt already know through the courses, if you can eve call them that. 
If I go back to school, and bust my ass saving for it, then I could end up in dept, miserable as I know college isnt for me, and working towards a goal that might not even make me feel fulfilled, because the chances of opening up a private practice inside clinical psychology to help people with mental illnesses, personality disorders, etc is very slim without the money, no matter what degree you have. Psychology barely ever is a major that allows us to even get anywhere near helping anyone or surviving financially, my mom being a  prime example of that. 
And ive been around enough abnormality and manipulation all my life to know these cases, and people, and help who i have been able to and walk away from the ones who wont change in order to keep myself sane. 
But going after art, anything artistic, means living paycheck to paycheck, inconsistent work/freelance, being around people who will want to make me their bitch if i wont under anyone while i do, and again not really doing what i want to do with my talents.knowledge/understanding to fulfill my purpose. 
I've been working on my brand, I have a great portfolio for the work I have in makeup artistry. 
But, again, its easy to get blacklisted in this field for anyone who has self respect and doesn't want to play the high school oriented games. 
I want to know I have a choice wherever I go. 
I want to be able to travel, be around people who are actually intriguing, and not feel like I'm the smartest person in the room. (Which I dont mean in a arrogant way, it is a phrase, but it is how I feel most of the time.)
I tried working on my brand but its difficult to not remains stagnant with the limited amount of resources I have 
Right now, I can keep the job I have which pays 11 an hour, save up for a car, and see what i do, or get a job at Mac (which is not something I want to do) simply because the name gives you credibility and be around people who are assholes who will inevitably make all my inspiration go to waste, but get paid 15 dollars an hour to save up faster for things I need to start on the short term goals with my content creation. 
Thing is, I just want to create, I want to make relationships with substance, but for that I need time I dont have. 
And, working at Mac will just mean Im another retail worker slave/puppet of theirs. 
Its also not easy to find a mentor as everyone has an ego in this field. 
And going back to school would have to make me choose between leaching off my parents and not expressing what I want artistically. It would just remove the toxic unnecessary bullshit of social and financial status, but still keep, me stressed from being around people who havent matured much either. And, what i wrote above. 
I thought about trying to study business but thats not something one studies, its what people learn from experience, which I have difficulty learning. 

Anyway, here are some of my questions. 

Is there a place I can go to learn about business or a way I can start teaching myself? Any websites, references, etc?

Should I seek the job at mac or stay where I am for now, and why?

Do you think I should pursue art or traditional schooling? Even though they can both look like dead ends, although I love them? 
Ps. I know a degree wont help for shit. That's why I wanted to create my brand with my meaning. 

Know any places that pay more than 11 dollars an hour, or websites I can check that are legitimate, that arent indeed, snagajob, etc?

Ever feel like this yourself?

Any alternate options you can think of to help me find a better job in the things I love?

Know any places I can get a job helping people with therapy? Not an internship.

If I could learn how to be an entrepreneur since it is a skill, and I know I have natural born leader qualities, I would go there, but I dont know where to start. Which is ironic and very unfortunate. Any resources?

Any tips on starting a brand? I dont want to hear the basic cookie cutter shit, like put yourself out there, you represent your brand, have a website, go to events. No shit. What specific events? Give me steps, and tell me why. 

Ill add more if i feel necessary. Please dont be an ass. Thank you. 

Ps. I was unemployed for 2 years before the job I have now. Its not easy to get a job. I just feel like I know so much and care for so much quality and its all going to waste by having no choice but to be around the wrong people and staying stagnant. I thought about going to trade school but nothing in the medical field, computers, or plumbing for example is what I want to dedicate my life to. I would go to nursing school but since I already have my skin care degree, the rest if history.

I'm familiar with Java and Python, I'm not too familiar with MVC architecture but I've done some MVT with flask/Django are these similar? 

My plan was to either do some of my data structures (originally done in Java) labs in c# to familiarize myself with the language syntax and structures. I plan on going over the assignments in relation to object oriented design as well as linked lists/stacks/queues/trees/bst/tables. 

Now I also have a C# book, and I'm wondering if I should just do assignments straight out of that instead, not sure if it goes into asp.net haven't had a chance to open it yet. 

Python and Java are my main go to languages, but I do know a bit of C as well from my programming languages course this semester. What would be the best way of preparing for my internship given the above options? 


The assignments weren't too difficult, it was figuring out the logic and which structures to use (we were given a week per) which is why I'm fairly confident I could tackle  multiple labs in a week. But I don't know if it's the best approach since again i need to familiarize myself with asp.net as well. 

tl;dr: best way to learn c#/asp.net, follow with c# book or redo Java data structures assignments in c#? Mix?

In addition, I believe the location of the job is in a much more appealing area to truly experience a tech-driven environment (hooray West coast!).

Now all that remains are the specifics of the job and working at such a company of this type. Reviews on glassdoor have pointed out that from a tech point of view, there can be various frustrating roadblocks to the sector as a whole, but I am not sure whether such issues would occur in a low level position such as mine. Nonetheless, I was hoping to get some insight as to what I might expect in terms of both the day-to-day work life to the general pros and cons of CS in this industry.

Bear in mind, I enjoy programming and working with computers- I get to keep myself occupied building something and the process is similar to playing a video game so I can transfer that obsessive rage with high portability.

While we watch his kids we heard through the grapevine that he no longer wants his children and he doesn't want to be tied down. The mother had a court date set one for custody and the other for the neglect charges, CPS is involved. The grandmother of the children, my fiancés mother isn't the best role model. Some background on her, she doesn't work and depends on us for a lot. As of right now we both live in the same town. We also heard that the only reason he got custody of the kids is because of the mother and her boyfriend pressuring him to do it and to step up and be a father. Now that he doesn't want the kids she is pressuring my fiancé to step up and take responsibility for the childern. She keeps telling us to take the kids but she will raise them, but we both know over time they will somehow fall back on us. My fiancé already had a breakdown from the stress of her school and the children, we already have a lot on our plate and now this. I told her if we can't handle it they can always go to a home or the mothers family. She told me she couldn't live with herself if something were to happen to the kids because she didn't step up, I'm concerned for her mental health and the stress. We have been together for over 6 years less then 10 and I have never seen her break down like that. I'm seriously about to snap and tell her family that she can't handle it and they need to back off, I hate seeing my better half that way. On top of that the youngest is absolutely terrified of dogs and our daughter got a puppy last year for Christmas from Santa, and the grandmother is making it seem like we have to give up the dog. I'm not doing that to our daughter it's simple both my fiancé and I have agreed on that. The grandma doesn't want the kids under her name because there is a lot of things she has to do and give up in order to look good in front of the courts and she is to selfish to do that. I feel like this whole situation isn't fair to my fiancé, our daughter and to myself. We are young we planned on having another child after we got married but now we have 2 more and my fiancé said she doesn't want to have another if we have to raise these other 2. My fiancé honestly wants to say no but she doesn't want her mom upset with her, I honestly don't think she can handle this. I honestly don't know what to do, do I speak up and tell everyone the way it is? I'm always going to support her regardless of her choice. Should I tell her mom the truth? Should we let the kids go? We are both under 24, we both don't have stable jobs and currently in school. Will the courts give us custody of the kids? I Googled this stuff and it says it's hard for a person to give up rights to there children to whom ever they want. I'm just at a loss I don't know what to do. Please forgive my Grammer I'm using my mobile."

Will studying abroad until the end of July of my senior year fk me over? How would mid-large SV level companies feel about this?

I am a computer science major and a Japanese minor, and I have always wanted to study abroad in Japan for a semester. The problem is that the Japanese university calender doesn't align with ours, (Fall is impossible) so Spring is my only option. The semester goes until LATE July.

I couldn't study abroad Spring of my Soph/Junior year because I've had two summer internships that couldn't be pushed back until August of course.

So this is my only option. My company goals are for medium-large silicon valley level companies.

My questions are:

What would I put for my anticipated date for graduation? Would this affect how employers see me?

Will employers still want to hire me in the Spring if I can't start until August?

How do you think employers will feel about this in general?"

I am a first year studying CS at an OK University. If things go well, I plan on going on to get a Masters from Imperial College. 

What options do I have to get my employer to sponsor a H1-B Visa?

I have thought of the following: 

* J1 Visa in my Second Year - not the best way as (from what I hear) there is more competition when applying to US Internships, when the UK equivalent (i.e. UK Amazon) would have the same value in terms of career-experience
* F1 Visa - getting an MSc in the US. Extremely expensive, as US Tutions are more costly and take two years instead of one. Likely the 'easiest' way of getting employed in the US though
* H1-B Visa - it's more of a literally and as a candidate I would have to adhere to higher standards for a company to go with the hassle of hiring me.
* Senior - get hired with a few years experience as a Senior engineer in the US. More likely than the graduate H1-B apparently.

I pretty have much no relations in the US. What other options should I consider? Is there anything I'm not seeing here?"

They eventually found out about it, and it almost resulted in me getting kicking out of the house and exiled from the family. My parents are VERY strict, and fairly religious. When they found out I had protected sex at 23 years old that almost got me kicked out as well. When i say drinking a bit to much I was trying to cope with being there. I was doing roughly 2-3 shots of vodka a night.

This may sound ridiculous, but it's true. basically I could stay I somewhat cleaned up my act. And I have, I made it through my toughest semester.

To the point, I drink occasionally now, and try not to get myself drunk. I do not party drink. And my dad recently found a bottle cap and confronted me about it...

I don't have a ton of money to move out, I'm in my last semester, and really should move out because situations like this are ridiculous. I'm trying to graduate debt free, and currently only have 5k in student loans.

With all this prep, is it possible to clear every single technical coding round? 

I'm really good at sweet talking recruiters and have a lot of sick side projects/big name internships/top 3 school, so getting interviews is not a problem for me. But looking at my past fall history, my success rate at getting offers for each company is hovering a little below 40%, while on a per-interview basis it's hovering a little above 70%. These numbers are from a pretty good sample size as well, since I interviewed at around 35 companies this fall for internships. How do I boost these numbers to 100%? I want to get as many offers as possible to have them all fight each other for a higher salary. This sounds really brutal, but I prioritize making as much money as possible."

5k722z,6,2016-12-25,Taking advantage of a “unique” background in MBA apps?,rpm10005,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/5k722z/taking_advantage_of_a_unique_background_in_mba/,"I did my undergrad studies at Columbia, where I debated between majoring in Economics or Writing—math and writing had always been my two strong points. I took the pre-reqs for both, then decided to major in Nonfiction Writing (both because I loved the program, and because outside mentors advised me to pursue my unique skills in undergrad and get an MBA later if I still wanted) as well as French, since I already spoke the language. I had a 3.5 cumulative GPA.

While in school, I got an internship at an iconic men’s magazine which turned into a part-time web editor/producer job there during my senior year and a full-time gig after graduation. I was excited by the work, doing things like launching their social media platforms and interviewing celebrities. But in spite of the fun nature of the gig, I realized that publishing articles on the internet and measuring success simply by the metric of unique visitors didn't feel that fulfilling to me, and I wanted to do something that I could see directly affecting the bottom line of whichever company I worked for. 

A year after graduation, I pivoted and went to work as a marketing copywriter at one of the first internet flash sale fashion companies. There, I was the only men’s copywriter and wrote everything from their daily sale copy to social media and blog posts. I sat in on weekly merchandising/buying meetings and partnered with creative, marketing, merch, tech, and design teams to develop and execute the editorial components of major site-wide programs.

A year into that job, my boss left to work at a legendary American fashion brand, and he brought me with him. Unfortunately, I ended up in a role that was much more limited in scope than my previous one. Promises of increased responsibility weren’t happening as quickly as I’d hoped, and it didn’t look like they would be anytime soon, so when an opportunity came up (once again, a year into the job) to work on a small team for a fashion brand I consider the holy grail of engaging marketing voices, I took it. 

This brings us to today: Currently, I handle every piece of this company’s men’s marketing collateral, from branding emails to the international catalog to social media and special print projects. I think my favorite thing there has been working on new product roll-outs from start to finish, from naming the product and concepting packaging to targeting industry influencers. I was promoted to senior copywriter after a little over a year and recently took on a direct report. 

But in spite of the promise of a good career, I have always felt limited to the “creative” side of the companies I’ve worked for, and want to continue gaining more ownership over projects and to direct strategy to a greater degree. Now seems like a good time to do an MBA, which I believe would give me the hard business skills that I don’t yet have, as well as exposure to new opportunities that I wouldn't have come across otherwise.

Since I live in NYC and my wife’s industry is located here, I’m planning on applying to NYU and Columbia this October (to take advantage of early/first-round deadlines) for fall 2018 entry. I'm currently studying for the GRE, which I believe will play more to my strengths than the GMAT.

I’m considering multiple directions post MBA—one would be to start my own marketing agency focused on new/emerging brands, and another would be strategy consulting. I’ll be open to other opportunities as well. 

My question: I’ve heard from current MBA students and read elsewhere that in many cases, having a distinct career path is actually an advantage in the admissions process—any suggestions on how I should take advantage of mine in my application? I’m sure many people who apply have worked in marketing, but I would imagine not too many have “copywriter” or “editor” in their titles. 

I think the key will be using my experience to craft a coherent narrative that addresses not only why I chose the path I did, but more importantly, why getting an MBA (at the respective institution) will further my career goals going forward. Any ideas, given the description of my career thus far and post-MBA goals detailed above, would be greatly appreciated—thanks!"

IF you do read all of this, I thank you in advance...just some thoughts that have been building over the past year since I started my degree, so yeah, thanks

This is my first post so I hope it won't turn into an essay like most of my posts do.
Basically, I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Western Sydney University (finished first year), and I have seen a few things around and on the net that seem to make me wonder and question what I am doing.

° **People's POV**:So I know for a fact that it is a very competitive industry and that landing a job seems like a giant feat, hell, every single person I have ever met has given the same pessimistic and sarcastic ""Good luck"" remark when I tell them that I am studying in the Engineering field, let alone the mechanical engineering major. 

°**What I have done so far**: But so far I have found myself a little internship at a performance shop in Sydney Australia and am working under the lead engineer, pretty much learning the engineering behind how to make race cars go as fast as they do and for as long as they do, particularly rotary engines.

But other than that one thing I have going for me, I feel as if I might be trapped if I am trying to find a job in this career path, let alone some sort of office jockey/ design based one as I quickly found out I am not for too much handy work :D.

°**What ive read**:  I have been reading over the past year and all I have seen is a pile of articles and such saying either the industry in my country has too many graduates, or that we are like 50,000 engineers short of how many the industry needs and are only producing like 7,000 a year, mixed with posts about not being able to find jobs after _YEARS_ of graduation (I understand..but damn thats daunting)

°**When I graduated**: Another thing that has me thinking about future of the industry is the type of skill sets been looked for. Upon graduation I was given an offer at the University of Technology Sydney for Software Engineering, but I took the second offer for Mechanical at WSU (which gets a bad rap for some reason) and I come from a mostly software based background (thus the application for it) but mechanical seemed like a more multi-tooled degree at the time, and I thought my previous knowledge of programming ( I do python, ruby and some C++, going on to 8 years of doing so now) will be a big help but now software engineering companies are popping up and they make me wonder if I did something wrong choosing what I liked.

Then there is the family point of view of me opting to go overseas looking for a job, especially the middle east due to my background and language skills (quad-lingual: English, Arabic, Kurdish, and Turkish) and that my apparently high interpersonal skills will make things easier in terms of a business point of view.

So I ask you; ( **tl;dr** )

**1**: What do you think?
**2**. Any advice you think would help me or any student around here?

**3**. How screwed am I?

**4**. Like really..how much?

(**just a question I thought about as I write this** )
**5**. (weird question) If I opt to go overseas, the economies are different, but my ultimate goal is to live in australia, how the hell am I supposed to land a job in a country like Germany or France or the US  (for the sake of argument...dont eat me please..I dont taste nice) where its like $40k a year or so, and be able to even cough up 10% for a house here? LOL

**6**. How was it for you when you were studying/graduating thinking of these things?

**Intended Major**: Computer Science

**Academics**: 

2100 SAT

College: 3.95 GPA

High school (boarding school): shitty transcript with bad grades and no APs due to medical situation (also reason I didn't go to a better school)... just tried to get by

BTW, taking 5 AP exams this semester to make up credits.

**Extracurriculars**:

High school: Poetry club founder, student body president, concert choir, plays and musicals, science club, misc community service, worked on a dairy and maple syrup farm, worked in a restaurant in the summers 

Gap year after high school ($$ reasons): moved out, supported myself, assistant manager at a restaurant

College: Co-founded CS club, a cappella group...

Took more time off after 2nd year due to $$ and also not great program breadth at my school. I got a SW engineer internship in CA, stayed for a year, converted to full time, still there. 

**Awards**: 

High school's work ethic prize for working on the maple syrup farm, college's CS division award

**Essays**:

UC application essays. Talked about how my internship and job prepared me for my major at Cal. Biggest challenge was medical difficulties in high school from being overmedicated for neurological disorder and getting all fucked up then getting out of it and realizing that looking weird forever (from this disorder) gives me ultimate license to be myself and chase my dreams etc. For creativity question I wrote about lifeskills i learn from ballet. For biggest talent, haven't written it yet but probably writing about my resourcefulness with finding a job and moving across the country alone and actually succeeding and how I'm not afraid of change. I'm a pretty good writer btw.

Now how do I deal with the anxiety?,AttainedAndDestroyed,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/5k7wzi/i_made_a_terrible_mistake_now_how_do_i_deal_with/,"A few years ago, after finishing an internship with flying colors, I got my dream job offer at a Big4 technology company which would take place when I graduated. 

While I was studying, I started working on a small startup which was growing at an amazing pace, and they expected me to keep working there after graduation. Unfortunately for them, as had my mind - and my plans - on the Big4 company, so a few months ago I told them I'll won't be working for them and started planning the rest of my career. 

However, they realized I was really needed in my company and started giving me good reasons to stay. They topped it off with a really good monetary offer (which was still worse than the Big4 one), and, for some stupid reason, I accepted. 

Now, I chose the startup because it was the best next step in my career without taking my time, and without realizing that what I *wanted* was to work for the Big4 company. Now I'm on a big quagmire - I can either keep working for the startup for some time and then maybe reapply for the Big4 (which was one of the reasons they convinced me to stay), or I can somehow find a way to graduate and leave for my original Big4 offer. Both options and hard, but even harder is managing the anxiety attacks I'm getting because of this. 

I was a stiff mess who wasn't able to concentrate for the last few weeks thanks to this, and I'm not able to do my job, to study, to sleep, or even to properly decide what I need to do. I am completely torn before the options after me, and I can't really function in society nor do anything like this. 

How can I deal with the anxiety of this big decision so I can think correctly? "

Hey there. I have been supervising a call center for the past couple years and I recently got the news that my department was being eliminated in the next sixty days as we are outsourcing calls and moving to more of an IVR setup. I was encouraged to seek employment in the company, which is what I have done. Through my reputation for hard work and minimal exposure to escalation of call center client help desk errors and issues as a team leader, I have landed an entry level position in our Network Operations Response Center. Basically, all training will be provided on the job. It will involve monitoring the servers and clients for possible issues, addressing those that I can, escalating those that I can't, and filling out the necessary incident reports while maintaining client communication. It is a more technical job than I have had here in the past, though when I moved up from analyst to team lead that position actually involved the most basic aspects of this job so I do have some familiarity. All that being said... 

I have no doubt that I'll be able to handle this position, but I want to do more than handle it. No certifications are required, but I'd like to turn myself into an asset and if possible use this position as a sort of paid internship for bigger and better things - here or elsewhere. It starts at about 35k a year (maybe 40k if they take my time into account) as opposed to the 50k I was making, but I can work from home and thus it doesn't cause transportation problems. My wife works for the same company (her position is safe) and this situation was going to cause big problems with our vehicle situation. Staying at the same employer will also make it much easier for us to buy a house sooner rather than later... 

Onto my questions... I think that the obvious choice for a first certification to pursue will be the CompTIA Network+ certification. With no real tech experience other than what I've detailed and basically just having a PC for the past, how much time should I give myself for studying the various guides and using the Professer Messer site before I actually try to take that test?

Sorry for the novel.

5ka4hm,10,2016-12-25,Advice Requested From Recruiters,AntSan813,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ka4hm/advice_requested_from_recruiters/,"Just some very little background, I am currently a Sophomore CS major looking for internships and ways to get myself out there.
 
My current University offers what I consider to be the bare bones of what an institution could offer to CS majors. Being that they also offer very little room for development outside of the classroom. So with that being said, I've taken the initiative to find my own ways of development outside the classroom. This usually just consists of doing coding programs and solving algorithmic problems. So needless to say, I have a bunch of programs that I've made and I decided to document these programs with a clusterfuck of comments in the code so that people who want to learn how I went about solving it, whether its for their own self-teaching or whatever, then they can figure it out easily. I was planning on posting these on my Github account and putting a link to the account on my resume for recruiters to see. 

So my question to you all is, is this something I should do/ keep up with? Or is it meaningless to recruiters?

Also, I'm sort of new to github and have been on it nonstop looking at other peoples codes. Is there any specific projects on github that would prove useful to someone at my skill level?"
5kab04,1,2016-12-25,[Request]How to get Out of Country Coverage health care from Ontario for Sports Hernia Surgery in USA? (rejected once already),SadHernia,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/5kab04/requesthow_to_get_out_of_country_coverage_health/,"Last edit: For all the pricks not believing me that Canadian surgeons are scamming ahtletic pubalgia patients with mesh repair ------&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/22ypdz/sick_of_worrying_about_my_health_lets_talk/

Many of you are claiming that I should not be covered by OHIP and take a mesh surgery for sports hernia with Canadian surgeons. Many of you are pretty much wanting me to be a suicidal mess. One day I will return to this thread fully recovered and tell everyone off here with a success story. 


2nd EDIT: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO REPLACE SPORTS HERNIA WITH ATHLETIC PUBALGIA
3rd EDIT: I am flabbergasted that people are downvoting me because I do not have confidence in OHIP groin surgeons. Dr. Meyers actually cut me, looked inside and discovered no inguinal hernia, despite the OHIP surgeons insistence. Thus proving my lack of confidence. Yet I am still getting downvoted. This makes absolutely no scientific sense. Inguinal hernias are very apparent and hard to miss once peering in the insides of a persons groin. I do not even have a bulge on the outside. Just flabbergasted by the ignorance towards all this evidence. 

Sports Hernia story found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/5ka35y/my_sports_hernia_story/

To keep it short (relatively), I was rejected from receiving health coverage for bilateral sports hernia surgery with Dr. William Meyers of Philadelphia around March 2015 by OHIP. They sent me a list of surgeons who supposedly could treat me in Toronto. These doctors cannot treat sports hernia despite falsely claiming to do so (That is why none of the Maple Leafs or (ex) Blue Jay Members like Edwin Encarnacion go to Canadian surgeons for sports hernia. Edwin went to Dr. Meyers)

Seeing that I was never going to receive coverage due to a misunderstanding of Sports Hernia in the medical realm, i took the money I made during my undergraduate internships in the oil sector and spent $25 000 CAD (awful Canadian to American conversion) in July 2016 to receive surgery. The good news is that currently it is no longer a bilateral issue (two-sided). The right side has fully recovered, however I believe I require a revision surgery on my left side.

After spending so much savings on this surgery, paying off $40 000 CAD of tuition completely (foolish I know) and not being able to find a post-graduate engineering job in oil (or anything at all to be honest), I am completely desperate for coverage. Even just to cover diagnosis.

Dr. Meyers does not accept MRI/Ultrasound reports and imaging done in Canada due to his belief that they are inferior to his own (they are in my opinion too).  

Overall OHIP refuses to cover the surgery and diagnosis for two reasons:
1) They believe Dr. Meyers surgery is experimental (despite all professional athletes going exclusively to him. If you ever hear of a pro ahtlete receiving sports hernia surgery, they went to Dr. Meyers guaranteed). 
2) They truly believe that Canadian surgeons are capable of providing me the help I need. This is false as Canadian surgeons cannot tell the difference between inguinal hernia and a pelvic floor injury. They want to insert mesh inside which does not fix sports hernias. There are vast amount of online stories of athletes receiving mesh for sports hernia, only to have to taken out.  

Please help, I am desperate and absolutely loss. Currently I am a concierge security guard making $14.00/hr (living at home with parents) and cannot find an engineering job to save up money. Furthermore, I will probably have to defer my RCMP application as a result of this ongoing injury. 

I have no other debt and do not pay rent. I am paying about $40.00/mopnth on a freedom mobile plan and couple hundreds each month for acupuncture. 

EDIT:

INGUINAL HERNIA (displaced intestines) IS NOT SPORTS HERNIA (soft tissue injury where lower abdonminal tissues rip off the pubic bone).
SPORTS HERNIA IS NOT A HERNIA AT ALL.
ONLY A HANDFUL OF DOCTORS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD CAN FIX IT WITHIN THE LAST 10 YEARS.
THIS SURGEON IS NOT A LUXURY, ITS A NECESSITY, HE IS THE PIONEER OF THE SURGERY.

I am dismayed by the answers here. It is no wonder many sports hernia sufferers are suicidal. To those who think I should not be covered, its a shame really. I paid off all my student debt, acquired an engineering degree and want to best serve the public by becoming a police officer. I am a hard working person who made a mistake lifting weights and volunteering his time in hard labour.

5kadjc,2,2016-12-25,Curious and Looking for Career Change [Looking for Advice from Researchers and Professionals Who Use Their Brain Everyday],fiskiligr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5kadjc/curious_and_looking_for_career_change_looking_for/,"Hello! 

**tl;dr** I am having a quarter-life crisis and find that what I am doing with most of my time is worthless, and I want to get into a different job in the industry that actually requires some thought and can satiate my desire to learn and feel like I am doing something interesting and worthwhile. 

If you want a longer exploration of how I ended up here, feel free to read this ungodly-long text. 


## Introduction

I have been working as a software engineer and web developer for a few years now at a big media company. I have an Applied Associates of Science in Information Tech. which I used to get an internship at that company, and I eventually landed a contract / hourly position that quickly led to a full-time salaried position. 

What I want to discuss is what to do next, and maybe talk with people in the positions I may consider myself a match for. I will try to lay out my story in easy to navigate paragraphs. Feel free to skip around, the point is that I want to talk and benefit from others' experiences. Maybe others will benefit from mine, so I will lay those out as well.

#### Getting Economic Stability

I pursued my degree and job out of poverty so as to get stability from which I can decide what I want to do with my life. I have so many interests, and have developed them so deeply that it's easy for me to have passion, but hard for me to know exactly what the best way to move forward with education or career is. I really enjoy aspects of my job - writing software can be a lot of fun, as can debugging and learning to think abstractly about systems. 

#### End of the Honeymoon

In the past year I have noticed the company culture has sunk. There were lay-offs, and a great deal of talent left. Many people without talent stayed and the overall disruption has landed people in positions they don't belong in, without any ability to do their jobs appropriately. My own job has become extremely boring, and generates a great deal of anxiety as it depends far more on my ability to network and get the people who know about the broken systems than it does my ability to learn the systems on my own. One colleague described it as having to do the simplest imaginable task but having to navigate an impossible maze to finish the task. I am sure many of us understand this - not being utilized properly, and your job being a joke.

#### What's Next?

Working at a media company means tech doesn't come first - so maybe one strategy is to find a job at an actual tech company. That would be a good first-step, I think. I want the flexibility of my current job (being able to work from home *or* come into the office as needed) and the comfortable salary, but I want something more mentally engaging. 

#### What is ""Mentally Engaging""?

In my free time, I like to read and learn. Once a year I attend American Philosophical Association conferences and soak in the philosophy. If you haven't ever had a philosophy course, the content there is incredibly technical and stimulating. One session might be making finer distinctions on the [problems of perception](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/), and another might argue points in philosophy of language. Another session discusses the phenomenology of children and what we can learn about our own perception, and the next is a session on the [nature of race](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/). Everywhere I turn, there is something interesting to dive into and learn. 

Getting away from philosophy (as maybe some of you are thinking ""hey, this is for computer science, what is this shit!?""), in my free time I enjoy reading books like *[Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/concepts-techniques-and-models-computer-programming)*, *[Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)*, or even easier reading like *Gödel, Escher, Bach*. I read books by Edward Tufte on the presentation of information. I enjoy thinking about the designs of documents and the written word (which can sometimes translate to writing better code and documentation). I know *SICP* is out of style, but I actually enjoyed reading that book and working through the problems. I also study foreign languages and keep up my working linguistic knowledge as I can.

I am not trying to boast, I just want to give you this picture of someone who is *curious* in the world, and wants to learn and make beautiful, functional things to help humanity. I want to make the world a better place. 

My idealism has suffered, and I am not deluded to think I can make the world a better place. Not in any big way. But I still want to be in a job that fits my interests and who I am. I still want the majority of my time to be spent as close as possible to that perhaps lofty goal. 

## Possible Solutions

I mentioned transitioning to a job at an actual tech company. I think this would help me in many ways - perhaps give me exposure to smarter, more technically minded colleagues working with more modern and relevant technology. 

#### More Education?

However, I don't necessarily want to spend the rest of my life as a code-monkey. This is where I start to think more formal education may be necessary. I have read quite a few of the links in the wiki of this subreddit, and it looks like most people are on the track of going to school, getting a B.S. and then deciding whether to go for a masters. Often people source the degree as helpful getting into the industry, but I would be returning to school *from* the industry and looking to use the education to land a job doing something more complex, like developing AI algorithms.

Education in this country is underfunded and value is more often placed on quantity and frequency of publishing rather than on the value of the research taking place. (And value is often determined by economic impact, not on the value of the research to the field or to human understanding). These problems to me indicate I would be happier in the tech *industry*, rather than seeking a position in academia or research at a university. This is one area I really hope some fellow redditors can help me with. If you are a teacher or researcher in the comp. sci. field, what is your life like? Do you enjoy what you do, and do you make a comfortable living with decent flexibility (i.e. you don't feel like a slave to your company / institution)?

I have also thought about going to school to get a Bachelors of Science degree in mathematics before determining what area of computer science I want to focus on. The intention is to give me stronger analytical skills and set me up for reasoning in any field better. Arguably philosophy would do this too, but there is such a stigma surrounding philosophy that I think it would harm my job prospects or future education in the sciences.

#### Areas of Industry

I wanted to talk through various options and see if anyone sees something here that I don't. If you know of a field I may enjoy, please reach out. I am open and want to learn. :-)

##### Artificial Intelligence

I love the problems of consciousness, and I think AI would be one of the most stimulating paths that combine my interests with economic value (so the possibility of a job is greatest). The problems in this field are complex and interesting, and the work I would be doing I think would satisfy my constant curiosity and maybe make me feel like I am doing something valuable with my life and not just wasting away. I really want to hear from people that develop AI algorithms, and hear what you have to say about doing this kind of work. Is it just like any other job? What is special about it that you enjoy? Any suggestions for someone interested in helping or becoming a researcher in that field?

##### Web

Most of my experience to-date has been with web technology (in some fashion or another). My concern is that staying in web may become a situation where I just labor away for various mis-guided companies and never do anything truly valuable for humanity. Web has grown and is full of challenges. Everything from styling and user interaction design, to database storage; it seems like web is so diverse and there is so much to learn. I really fit this field because I enjoy learning every aspect of the technologies and how they fit together.

There is also something to be said about sticking with what you know, and it will probably be easier for me to get a job immediately as a web developer than anything else.

If anyone is a web developer and really enjoys their work and finds it mentally stimulating (and not just ""I need to spend 40 hours to find out which one line of code I need to change because everyone likes to over-engineer the most simple things""), please reach out and share your experiences.

##### Non-Profit

I love Open Source Software (especially truly free projects that don't exist merely to help corporations). I think working for a non-profit like Freedom of the Press or the EFF would be another route I could take to find meaning. There is the same potential of becoming bored, but at least no matter what I am doing, it's likely in the interest of a cause I would care about. 

There is a similar strategy to just donating some time to open source projects I care about, but it takes a lot of time to do that, and the point is that I want to solve the problem of how I spend the majority of my time. Being employed at a non-profit probably also won't be as comfortable salary-wise, but again - trading economic security for doing meaningful work is nothing new and is a legitimate option. 

## Synopsis

This is getting rather long, unintentionally, and I do want to get some participation and not alienate everyone with a wall of text.

If you or anyone you know can offer advice, I am listening. Thank you for reading, and if you read this far - I hope you haven't lost any sanity trying to navigate my poorly outlined thoughts."

I'm a sophomore computer science major but have been mostly getting B's in my classes and feel unconfident on my ability, since there are so many people doing better than me. My GPA also isn't that great at a 2.9. Am I worrying too much? 

With decaf coming up, I'm especially worried about getting an internship especially since I have no personal projects under my belt. I am interested in computer science and I love it but don't know where to start. 

Sorry about the rant, but I figured it'd be nice to get advice from other students."

Some brief background about myself. I just started my second year in college majoring in Computer Engineering and I've taken some basic computer science courses. I am currently trying to learn Java, C and Javascript.


I really need to get an internship. But I am intimidated with all of the requirements that they usually ask for. I know for a fact that I do need to practice and learn more but to what extent for an internship? An example of said requirements are: 

-Experience with the following two or more frameworks or databases: .NET, MySQL, WFC, SQL Server, Visio, SGL, and Drupal.

-Have a clear understanding on Software Development Life Cycle

These are things that I'm confused with and want to learn. So how do I learn these things and what steps can I take towards getting an internship?"

Hope all is well and all of you are doing great. I know it gets hard finding a job during the holiday seasons, but hang on. 

Job search has sucked and I was going to start an internship next year that paid great money. Something I desperately need, but my academic advisor fucked up.... To make things worse, my dad lost his job and we are getting by on my substitute teacher salary. Basically, about 1.3k a month for a family of 5. Wrote a book and illegal downloads suck! I love that readers write to me, but the illegal download thing could have been a great source of income. I am way too old to be this broke financially, and too young to be this physically broken. Sucks I know!

However, I think things are turning up for the better. I might get a different CSET waiver so I can start another internship soon. If not I will test in Social Science which is were I hold my degrees. Also, I found great college professors job openings. I am sitting down with my brother and his wife, tomorrow. They are going to help me fill out the applications. Man, I really need a better job.

What have I learned so far:


*Keep going. I been searching for two years. It sucks and it gets harder every day, but I have hope things will improve!


*Reach out to people when you need someone to talk to. I am sure you can find free resources on REDDIT.


*apply to everything.


*Obviously, a job is better than no job. Unless that job is abusive towards you.

TL;DR
Thing really suck, specially this time of year. Been looking for a better job for over two years. Applying to some jobs, but don't want to get my hopes up. However, teaching credential will makes things better. Don't give up!"
5kcec2,2,2016-12-26,Should I Be Worried About My CIS Degree?,ICCON,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5kcec2/should_i_be_worried_about_my_cis_degree/,"Some of the stuff I have read on this site has really made me anxious about my CIS degree. I understand the qualms some people have with CIS, but I would like some insight into the usefulness of my school's CIS program specifically.

At my school, CIS is a BS with coursework almost identical to Software Engineering. CIS, however, does not require high level physics and stats or Calculus II. Instead, CIS has accounting and economics.

I have taken a lot of application-based classes and learned coding in C, C++ and Java. I've taken a lot of Java: intro, intermediate and advanced programming were all in Java. C was used in Algorithm &amp; Program Design as well as Data Structures &amp; Algorithms.

Additionally, I have taken more CS oriented topics such as data structures, algorithms, discreet structures, operations research, plus general computing theory as well as computer organization.

Besides all this there are the usual more CIS / general classes, like database stuff, server side programming, networks, as well as classes on the software design cycle.

Also, my school's CIS program has a capstone project; I've heard this is a good thing. I'm taking it next fall, which will be my last semester.
I enjoy coding and I have a GitHub with projects of mine, and I would like to intern but I may not be able to before I graduate (no car, will be living out of state for the summer).

It seems to me like not all CIS degrees are created equal and it can really depend on the curriculum (and the individual!). 

Career wise, I'm still not 100% sure what I want to get into. Development interests me, but so do most of the career opportunities that come with this degree. 

Will earning this CIS degree be the death knell to my career that some people make it out to be? I'd really like to dispell or confirm my anxieties."
5kcmrd,239,2016-12-26,Some tips for college freshmen and sophomores,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5kcmrd/some_tips_for_college_freshmen_and_sophomores/,"I will be graduating next semester and recently signed an offer. I made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot along the way. This subreddit was a big help. Looking back, here are some things I wish I knew sooner. These are specifically for people wanting to enter the industry after graduation. For those wanting to go to grad school, these may not apply.


- Your GPA is not that important. Don't stress over it (but try to keep it above a 3.0). Optimize for learning and not for grades. This means take more and harder classes. Try to get the most out of homeworks and projects. 
- Take Data Structures, Algorithms and Operating Systems as soon as you can. Ideally by the end of your sophomore year.
- Try to get a lot of coding experience under your belt during your school year. Get involved with projects, research, working for Non-profits, any opportunity you get. Get in the habit of using good coding practices and design principles even on personal projects.
- Maintain a Github account. Work on some personal projects and put them up. The easiest way to get personal projects is to go to hackathons.
- Work on your soft skills. This is what companies mean when they say they are looking for a cultural fit. It is as simple as doing things where you interact with strangers. Don't be a snob. If you are a non-native speaker, see if native speakers can understand you. Have some dressing sense.
- Get at least one real internship in your first or second year. Doesn't need to be a Big 4, but a company that pays you is ideal. Even better if its a name people recognize. Don't bother with cover letters. Get your resume critiqued by seniors/career center. I have gotten all my interviews either through applying online or career fairs.
- If you follow above steps, you should be getting interviews. There are a ton of resources on how to prep for those, but generally, if you can do every question in CTCI, you are ahead of most of the applicant pool. Looking up previous interview questions on Glassdoor is another gem that isn't talked about enough.
- Use your first internship to get a sense of what you like/dislike. Are you a frontend or a backend person? What kind of engineering problems do you like working on? What is the kind of company culture you are looking for? Is this your ideal company size or would you want to work for something bigger/smaller?
- The junior year internship is your best bet at finding a job. Treat it as such. 90% of my classmates ended up accepting full-time offers from the place they interned at junior year. You know that company that you want to work for full-time? They are gonna be way more selective interviewing full-time than for internships. So go all out applying and interview prepping.
- Following up on the previous point, before you accept your junior year internship, make sure it is a place you would be comfortable working full-time (even if its not your dream company). Your previous internship should have given you an idea of the kind of place you want to work at. Try to make sure that they give return offers and you are happy with what they pay full-time. Imo, your junior year internship is NOT a good time to take risks.
- If you do end up recruiting full-time, follow the same steps as above. 
- Discuss offers! Talking salaries with your friends should not be awkward. This subreddit is skewed towards bigger offers, but getting an idea of what your colleagues, who are likely just as qualified as you, are making is a good way to know if you are being short changed. 


I am no expert so feel free to comment/critique. I will update the list if I think of anything else. Good luck!

EDIT: I see a lot of questions regarding getting an internship in freshman/sophomore years. If you are unable to, there are other ways to compensate. You could offer to build the webapp for your uncle's startup. You can volunteer/freelance. You can also do personal projects and contribute to open source but iirc, once I had work experience, interviewers stopped asking me about my personal projects. But my personal projects were pretty basic so it might be because of that.

I sort of just randomly applied and didn't really have much time at all to thoroughly prepare once I had (unexpectedly) gotten offered interviews.

Not surprisingly I totally fucked up on both technical interviews, like really badly, partly because of nerves too. I've heard firms like these blacklist you and don't even bother to interview you again if you fail an interview, and sometimes even tell people at other firms that you sucked.

Are my prospects for getting an internship in these (and other firms) next year doomed?

I am from the US and finishing my bachelor's degree this spring during a study abroad in Argentina next semester. I haven't really taken care of my mental health while being in school but I finally found a doctor about a year and a half ago who got me back onto Adderall. I stopped going to him in May though because he's an awful doctor, but he was the only one I could see in a short time (without having to wait months as a new patient)

So I haven't been taking medicine since May. And lately I've been feeling the price of that and I really need to get back on some medication, or preferably find a doctor that actually gives a shit and will work with me to find something that works for me. But I can't find ANYONE without a 6-8 month wait. I'm going to Argentina in February and I have no idea what I'm going to do.

5kfdju,12,2016-12-26,Am I smart to pursue a Comp Sci Masters degree with a Finance undergrad or should I stay in my lane?,cbo92,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5kfdju/am_i_smart_to_pursue_a_comp_sci_masters_degree/,"I am exploring options to go back to school for a masters degree right now. I have pretty much ruled out going for the generic MBA because I don't think it is the right route for me. Currently I'm trying to decide between a Masters in Statistics or a Masters in Comp Sci.

I am leaning heavily towards the comp sci degree. While I don't have any formal background in the field (either education or work experience), I have taught myself a fair bit about programming and networking and I know it is something I enjoy and want to learn more about at a more intense level. I know it would probably be difficult to jump straight into a masters program without the undergrad experience, but I've been assured by my local Uni advisors that plenty of people have done it and succeeded. Another huge plus of the comp sci degree over the statistics degree is that if I decide in the future that I would like to leave the finance industry and pursue something besides an analyst/fin-tech position, it would leave the door open for me to pursue other projects.

My only worry is that I will spend the money to get this degree and I may seem like someone who doesn't know what they want to do to potential employers. I have about 5 years of experience in the financial industry as an insurance broker and now as a junior financial advisor (no real analyst experience besides on internship). Personally, drawing the line between quant/data analyst and computer science is very easy to me but in most people's opinion that I've talked to getting the comp sci degree would be really out of left field and for someone in my position. I am afraid if I graduate with the comp sci masters I may still have trouble landing quality analyst/fin-tech jobs.

Is my anxiety unfounded and will I most likely be able to find good jobs or should I consider the statistics degree since its more in line with what I graduated as an undergrad? I should also mention that I am more than willing to re-locate as well.


Thank you so much for any and all help."
5kfn6j,3,2016-12-26,My thoughts on gaming on a 4K TV,xpistolxwhipper,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5kfn6j/my_thoughts_on_gaming_on_a_4k_tv/,"I picked up a 4K TV on Black Friday, a 40"" Samsung UHD TV.  I'm using it as a computer monitor, and doing my gaming from a desk, not couch.  I have an i5 4590 and GTX 1080 running this thing.  Here are my thoughts on it, vs. the 1440p 120Hz 27"" monitor I was using.

Immersiveness:
Holy cow, this thing is huge when you're sitting right in front of it.  Text is sharp, and there is a BUNCH of screen real estate.  But when gaming, this thing really sucks you in.  The level of detail is great, even with settings turned slightly down to maintain 60 FPS.  No need for anti-aliasing at 4K.  Games like The Witcher, Rise of the Tomb Raider, BLOPS3, and Battlefield 1 all look incredible and gigantic and beautiful.

Brightness:
Maybe a little too bright, honestly, but it can be turned down! Colors are great, especially compared to my QNIX 1440p monitor.  Blacks are darker, whites are much brighter.  The TV I got is NOT HDR, so I can't even imagine how impressive that must be.

Refresh Rate:
This was a little harder to get used to...  Coming from 120Hz down to 60, it truly is noticeable.  But you get very used to it, and for a screen this big and sharp I personally believe it's worth it.  At least for the games that I play! If you're playing some intense, competitive shooters, you'll want the higher refresh rate.  But if you're like me, and you enjoy gaming for fun and don't play CSGO, who cares?

Input lag:
Turned the TV to Samsung's ""Gaming Mode"".  Minimizes input lag - think I read it's somewhere around 30 ms? It's completely playable.  The QNIX monitor hardly had any, but I found that it isn't effecting my gameplay in BLOPS at all.

Gaming Settings:
I have a pretty high-end PC.  I'm in school, and was fortunate enough to get a well-paying internship over the summer, which let me upgrade to my 1080.  With an i5 4590 and GTX 1080, do not expect to max settings on most games and maintain 60FPS.  You can look up benchmarks yourself, and you'll see results sitting around 40-50fps for many games.  Well goodness gracious people, turn a couple settings down strategically, and all of a sudden the game runs at a smooth 60fps and hardly looks any different!

Cost:
Based on all the great things I listed above, this TV would justifiable to purchase at a greater cost than I did. Yeah, I know I got it on Black Friday, but $350 for this monster is a fantastic deal! I believe it was only $100 off list price anyways.  Compared to some of the curved ultrawides and GSync monitors, this is an incredible monitor for the price.  Again, I just came from using an incredible 1440p 120Hz 27"" monitor.  I think a 40 inch UHD TV beats it. For those of you with multimonitor setups for productivity, this takes up less space on the desk, and has just as much screen real estate as 4 1080p monitors.  It's awesome.

Anybody else here game on a TV? Let me know what you think!"

I know I should probably try applying for internships, but I don't know how qualified I will be. So far I only know Java, Python, and Data Structures.

College vs. bootcamps?,Athaway13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5kg58f/definitely_interested_in_cs_but_somewhat_lost_on/,"Brief history of me: Took a few CS classes in high school.  Majored in Philosophy because I was naive about the job market.  Spent the last few months learning basic Ruby and Javascript, and want to turn it into a career change.

I've applied to two bootcamps (App Academy and Hack Reactor), and they seem like strong programs, for all that 3 months of training can possibly do.  But I also see the benefits of seeking a degree in CS - I want to learn more fundamentals, rather than just web development, and get the connections, internships and degree that would give me a more secure future.  The problem with this is, college is ridiculously expensive, and I don't see how I could possibly get into a decent program with no official CS experience, nobody to write relevant letters of rec for me, and a 3.5 GPA from an irrelevant degree.  

So, with all this in mind, I'm thinking my best option would be to attend a bootcamp, work in web development for a while, and use my connections and experience to seek further education thereafter.  Does this seem like a reasonable plan?  I'd appreciate input from anyone here.  Thanks in advance!"

I applied to close to the entirety of the UC system this past November for either Economics or Statistics, with near guaranteed admission (TAG) to Irvine for Computer Science. I am currently looking into the field of Data Science as a career, but have only taken one semester of C++.

I'm fairly confident that I will receive a C in Calculus 2--which, while not disqualifying me from the system altogether, will make it basically impossible to be competitive for schools like Berkeley or LA. Because of this, my Calculus professor has given me the option to take a failing grade instead, which would allow me to take the class again in the spring--but would definitely disqualify me from admissions this year. 

That grade notwithstanding, I have a fairly extensive history of campus involvement and community service; am beginning an upward grade trend; and would likely add some form of employment or internship before applying again next year. Is the chance of attending these schools better than just going to Irvine for CS (for which I am under-prepared)?"

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

PC for after I finish school in May. I'm an IT major with a focus in networking, I'm planning on using it for VM configs and some coding, maybe gaming on the side. Want to setup mainly test environments for self hosted projects and CCNA practice.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

Would ideally like to get 1920x1080p screen resolution, (2 monitors would be awesome for better productivity, hoping to spend around $110 per monitor) at least 30fps for particularly gtaV but wouldn't complain with more. Gaming isn't the priority but would consider spending the extra money for the ability to at least enjoy PC gaming if i choose to do so.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$700-$800 is preferred but haven't quite been able to cut costs lower than about $850-$900

I'll try to make this brief but likely won't since there are many facets to cover. TLDR at the end:

Background: About to graduate college with a degree in marketing (minor in music) was honors my last two semester and a cumulative GPA of 3.26. I have one more semester and I have no doubts I'll graduate. That being said, I would like assistance on how to spend this coming semester wisely. I have a friend who didn't do this and he's working a shit job with massive monthly bills from college (our college wasn't cheap). 

I am a professional photographer, taking a graphic design course to further enhance my skills in Photoshop in the spring. I'm quite good with computers, don't mind working 50 hour work weeks, understood and was proficient at everything in all of my classes except accounting (struggled a bit there). I've been working at Jimmy Johns for a year now, also working for my school as a photographer...and I also work at IT on campus. So I tend to keep myself extremely busy with a full load of classes, 3 jobs and I had an internship last semester...I'm no lazy boy :P

I need assistance with the following: 

Resume building - it's already built and decent (got me some good interviews when looking for an internship) but I'm no pro and have TONS of past jobs and don't know what important and what's not. Is there anywhere I can go with this to REALLY get it hammered down pat. I read somewhere that I can pay someone to do it, but then someone said it was stupid to pay. 

Cover letter - I don't even know where to start here. I have one, but it seems pretty generic and just brags about myself and my past work, is this even right? 

Applying - How do I apply efficiently? I'm looking to apply anywhere CONUS in almost any position. Ideally, since I'm applying 6 months prior to graduation, I can almost pick and choose a position I want with good pay and location, but I have nothing right now and understand the difficulties of applying in general. I would like a spot in advertising, PR, online marketing or anything graphic/artistic related, but don't mind working on other things. The only thing I don't want to do (unless it's just a year or two to get it in my resume) is data entry. I wanted to kill myself while at my internship. So who has some ideas on this? 

In a perfect world, I graduate and have a job lined up where I could possibly make $50,000 a year in a relatively inexpensive area. I live central US now and couldn't care less if I have to move. I'll make anything work if it means I'm successful and happy. 

Any help is terrifically appreciated and I may end up posting this multiple times in multiple places


TLDR: 

Would love help with:

Resume building - where and how or should I pay someone?
Cover letter - same as resume I guess
Applying - any websites, recommendations, leads...hell, how should I use Linkdin to apply even?

Thank you everyone!

I've known the 20-year-old since fourth grade, and the 21-year-old since seventh. The three of us were all really good friends throughout middle school and high school.

After we graduated high school in 2014, I noticed the two of them would post stuff on social media of them hanging out together and I never got invited. I didn't get offended because the two of them didn't go to college and stayed in our hometown. I moved to a college about half an hour away and had a really tough major that had night classes and required me to study a lot. However we all still maintained contact (text/snapchat/Facebook), but for the three of us to hang out I always initated it. 

The last time I hung out with them was 4th of July weekend of 2015 when I came back home to visit (I have been away for the summers of 2015 and 2016 for an out-of-state internship). After I got back home in August, they said they really wanted to see my new apartment, but between their work and my school schedule they never came over that fall semester. 

December 2015 I messaged them asking them to hang out while I was home for break. 20F didn't have a phone at the time, so I asked 21F to ask her the next time they talk/see each other. She said sure, and then I asked what her work schedule was (she sleeps in the day due to midnight shift) trying to figure out a day to do something. I never got a response. 

i don't understand what I did to make them not want to hang out with me, and I understand with what little information I've presented here neither can you. All I know is there was never any bad blood between us, our friendship didn't end in any fights, and I never got a vibe that they were unhappy with me. I'm not the type of person to cause problems, I've always been very quiet, had few enemies, and have had a good reputation behind me. 

 I miss my friends. I see them post on Facebook or Snapchat of things that I want to comment on or like. When I see a band coming into town for a concert, my first instinct still is to ask them if they want to go. I said happy birthday on Facebook to both of them recently and they both liked it and replied thanks! so I know they don't hate me or something. 

 If you've made ithould I try to reconnect with my old friends, and if so how? What should I say and how should I do it? Or should I quit being emotional and just try to get over it and move on with my life?

**TL;DR: High school friends ghosted me about a year ago, but there isn't any bad blood between us so I'm wondering if I should try to reconnect to them**"
5kiuva,1,2016-12-27,(24/M)Transitioning Out of Sales AND the Automotive Industry...,WatchesAccount,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/5kiuva/24mtransitioning_out_of_sales_and_the_automotive/,"Hello r/findapath!


Expanding on my title a bit and a tl;dr up front:

-Twenty-four years old, B.S. Business Admin

-Experience mainly focused in B2B sales within automotive industry (the ""big three"")

-Looking to transition not only out of sales, but the automotive industry as well

-Very much a self starter, and love to be challenged


**SO**, that being said...I am still very early on in my career, but have held a job since I was in eighth grade. I am realizing that sales is not something I would like to continue to do and am at a loss on where to go from here. 

A bit of background on myself - My ""career"" started my freshman year of college, when I was working in sales at a local sign shop (franchised). Prior to this position I had worked at a private country club in the bag room as an attendant since eighth grade. Sales at the sign shop were mostly B2B, however we did have a few retail clients that would come in for events they were hosting (birthdays, reunions, etc). I was given a book of business, which consisted of their ""dead"" clients. These leads ranged from six months of inactivity to 4 years. Ultimately, I did turn some business out of this, but it was more of a ""test."" Once I had worked through this list I was given the opportunity to generate new leads and call on local prospects. I worked at this sign shop until I was afforded a management internship with a large automotive repair company (whatever you drive, drive a ______). 


My internship was to last three months (over the summer), however my DSM requested to keep me on after it concluded. I was all set to get into the actual management program, but after much debate I decided that this was not the career path I was going to pursue. *That being said, I think that everyone should work at least one year in retail because it gives you an appreciation for everything that these employees do.* I still get a call from that DSM every six months to see if I am still interested in coming back, I politely decline, but I contemplate it every few times he calls. I learned a lot during this internship, and was very appreciative that I was paired up with a great manager and a DSM who was a top performer for the region. After deciding that it was ultimately not a career path I'd like to pursue further, I reached out to the sign shop owner to see if they had any positions available just to stave me over until I could get my path figured out (this was a family owned franchise store and the owner was a very good man). Luckily they had re-branded and were in need of a client experience manager. I was offered the position on the spot and took it. 


The client experience manager position consisted of working with our internal departments (sales, design, production, installation) to ensure that our clients were 100% satisfied from start to finish of their project. I handled most of the complaints (unless the client asked for the owners), and also worked with the general manager on our social media presence. It was a great opportunity to get my feet wet in something outside of sales, and I enjoyed making sure that our clients were always happy. About a year and a half after taking this position I was recruited by a company I had met at SEMA for a sales position. I took this opportunity since I had always wanted to work in the automotive industry, or so I thought. 


That brings me to right now...After two years with this company I had to call it quits because of a *regime* change with ownership (father to son; son is a loose cannon with no acumen whatsoever), my overall dissatisfaction with my career path, and this loony idea that I could ""figure it out"" faster if I was not working...I digress. This company worked directly with the ""big three"" in the automotive industry, and I was responsible for earning the business of a particular blue oval company. This was a major addition to our book of business, since they had been trying to earn their business for ~10 years prior. I got in with new contacts, persistence, and a willingness to work with them on their projects. As a sales rep with this company I was responsible for generating new leads, qualifying prospects, project management pre/post production. Quoting and production management was executed by the owner of the business. I learned a lot about sales as well as myself in those two years...my major takeaway was that I do not want to continue a path in sales. I do not have an aggressive personality, and ultimately this lead to my decision to pursue something else. 


I have been searching/applying/interviewing prior to leaving the company in the hopes of having something lined up, however after getting to several interviews I was turned off by different things. I've had some of the most unprofessional interviews in my career, as well as some very productive ones. However, after doing a bit more research after the interview I would find that the company has bad rapport with clients/employees/etc. While a vast majority of my experience is in sales, I did enjoy managing the project from start to finish both at the sign shop as well as this most recent company. This has lead me to search for project management positions, but I don't have the qualifications that most of the companies I am looking at require. I'm kind of at a loss on what other routes might be a good avenue given my experience. 


I am very interested in watches and have applied with manufacturers, but I would hate to turn a hobby into a job and then hate the hobby. So I've nixed the search for that. I'm also toying around with the idea of just venturing into my own business with an Etsy store or something along those lines. I've written a few business plans before while in school and actually won a ""shark tank"" style competition with one. 

Sorry for the freakin' novel and that this is probably haphazardly put together. I just can't sleep and figured I'd stop lurking on here and post.

Thank you in advance for any insight or advice you might be able to offer. I genuinely appreciate it.

5kj4ud,2,2016-12-27,Severe lack of motivation: Is there something wrong with me? Do I possibly have mild depression?,blueblooblu,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5kj4ud/severe_lack_of_motivation_is_there_something/,"I'm in my third year of college. Ever since around the end of 5th grade I've gradually lost my motivation to do schoolwork and take life seriously and I don't know why, but here is a (somewhat disorganized b/c I'm typing on mobile) list of key thoughts surrounding my concern.

I did a little above average in high school and people who don't know me well probably think I'm still at the top of my game. I've had a few spurts of motivation, though. For example, in my senior year of high school my mom advised me to channel my anger and hurt from a breakup into my schoolwork and I ended with a 4.0 both semesters. I thought I could bring that effort into college, but my anger and hurt subsided and I did terribly the first and second years of college. This year I'm doing well, but I'm burnt out and feeling miserable already. I'm scared for the next quarter. I should be applying to internships but my skill level doesn't even compare to others applying. I feel like everyone around me is a genius.

I should also mention that I have a perfectionist personality, and I have the worser end of it. I get scared of not doing something perfectly and end up abandoning it and it snowballs into other things when I procrastinate more and more and more. I've tried methods to avoid procrastinating like talking to people about my goals or going online and trying methods that others have found successful, but all of that just made my thoughts worse and gave me slight paranoia. However, I've recently found that not telling anyone my goals and seriously thinking about and acting upon them myself has helped immensely.

I don't have any hobbies, although I've been paying more attention to art lately, which I think is a good thing. But then I feel like I don't have time because I'm either procrastinating or doing schoolwork. Which I now suppose I could do art instead of procrastinate.

I am a very laid back person, and there's little that makes me urgent. When I was little, my mom used to ask me what I preferred and I would respond with ""I don't care."" I used to not care about decisions and let others make the decisions (still do sometimes). Since realizing these things, I've opened my mind up a lot more these past 3 years and I've sort of trained myself to feel a little more than before.

My mom is the most generous and loving person I know, and she has given all to support my education. But she's in a marriage where she doesn't get any support from a lazy, detached, and also laid back husband, and her only child is unbearably disappointing. She's always had a temper and really gives it to us because of those reasons. She's also one of those people who don't ""believe"" their children have depression, but I'm positive there's at least something wrong in me. 

I'm not ruling out going to a therapy session, but I know I'd just like to ask Reddit for some advice right now.

5kjtdq,1,2016-12-27,A friend I dated cut contact with me.,boager95,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5kjtdq/a_friend_i_dated_cut_contact_with_me/,"Hello everyone
I apologize about the long text, I will try to include every relevant detail in my case. I am a college senior who met a girl in one of my classes when the fall semester started. She took a lot of interest in me, however, I did not initially show her the same affection towards her. I was sort of weirded out by her needy nature (always asking me to come to her and text her). She had an emotional breakdown one day, telling me how I did not make an effort to show her affection when she clearly liked me. I told her I was very busy with school and liked her, but did not always have time to be with her. She gets angry and stops talking to me. The next week she sees me and acts like nothing happened, we eventually have sex and start a ""relationship"".
The semester had been a wild one for me, both academically and emotionally. On one hand she is a wonderful girl. She's incredibly beautiful, studious, caring, and fun. On the other hand she is very needy and emotional. She went to college from home (her parents are really strict, she cannot go out much unless its for school) and would usually act strange when she was at home for too long. She would randomly get emotional, and at times, would say she didn't want to be in a relationship. The minute she came to school to see me everything would change, she would act her normal happy self. I have been really patient with her and have gone out of my way to be there for her on throughout the semester. When she got sick I took her to the doctor and paid her bills, I have stayed up late on many occasions to help her with school, and have tried my best to give her emotional support (issues related to her family life and her previous relationship).
Here is what I found out about her life and her past. She dated a heroin addict for about two years (he was in rehab during the fall semester) and her parents were pretty harsh on her. Her and her ex boyfriend split about five months ago when he was sent to rehab. Her parents almost never let her get out of the house, and she is frequently criticized by her parents. She told me about her troubles at home and her ex boyfriend. Her past relationship was toxic, she always worried about him and had to call 911 on multiple occasions due to him overdosing on heroin. He was possessive, jealous, emotionally brittle, and was prone to anger. She wanted to marry this guy, but was hurt by the issues he had with drugs and his behavior.
Fast forward to the end of November. Her ex boyfriend gets out of rehab and contacts her. She initially tells me she does not want to be in contact with him, however, he persists. They start talking like old friends. She then agrees to eat lunch with him, and finally, allows him to come to her graduation (extremely awkward for me). She also breaks up with me at this point, but still wants to maintain a romantic relationship. She says she loves me, but still cares for her ex boyfriend and sees a future with him, if he can clean up. I tell her how I feel and how hurt I am, but she tells me she only wants to remain friends. We still continue to act like boyfriend and girlfriend however, we still talk, kiss, and sleep with each other. Her sleeping with me causes tension between her and her ex. Gradually we fall into the ""friends"" category. 
Winter break has started and we have not really seen each other or talked much. She seems very distant and depressed. Last night I asked her what was wrong and why she was distant, she says she has a lot on her mind, but did not want to talk about it (it has to do with her ex boyfriend and she would like to keep it to herself). It was late, I was tired, so I went to sleep, but told her to call me if she wanted to talk.
She texts me today and tells me how she has always been there for me and how inconsiderate I am for not calling, and how she is always the one who has to call me. I told her I was extremely worried about her and wanted to talk, however, I did not want to be pushy or nosy. She refuses to talk and cuts contact with me, she wishes me luck in the future ( I am moving out of town in January for an internship) and stops talking and texting me.
I understand she has her issues that she needs to get over, and I can understand why she is angry at me. But her reacting like this is completely unwarranted after all we've been through and after all I have provided her. I know I do not have a future with this girl but I deeply care about her well being and do not want to be cut out of her life. I feel lost and depressed about the whole situation and I honestly do not know what to do next, we cannot really see each other or meet up since she is out of school. What can I do to mend relations with her? I don't want this relationship to end on a bad note.
Thank you for reading

5kkd75,13,2016-12-27,How to go from penetration testing to software engineering?,anonymous3834,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5kkd75/how_to_go_from_penetration_testing_to_software/,"I have 6 years of profesionnal experience in infosec, mostly penetration testing, but I would like to switch to software engineering.

Penetration testing is fun at the beginning (you're paid to legally hack computers), but becomes repetitive after a few years.
I miss building stuff, doing a real engineering job, and programming.

Here is a link to my resume: http://imgur.com/a/zpz10

I would love to work on subjects like operating systems, low level programming, distributed systems, and to program in C, Go, Rust, or Java, as long as it's not just gluing some libraries together. For example, I actually enjoy the kind of algorithmic problems available on LeetCode. However, I suppose the competition is very high to work on this kind of subjects, even for senior software engineers. I would just like a first real experience, interesting enough to approach these subjects.

I suppose the best advice would be to build some side projects.

However, I'm already working crazy hours as a security consultant, even if it's not really exciting things to put on my resume, and I'm away from home (traveling for business) half of the time.
So, while I will do my best to build some side projects and follow some other MOOCs, I also promised myself that I should get a life outside work.
Consequently, I suppose it will take a long time before I get a good enough portfolio, and I was considering some other solutions:

1) Quit my current job and go back to graduate school, for instance to learn about distributed systems.
If I manage to go to a good university, I suppose it would be the best solution from a recruiter point of view.
I saved enough money to pay for the school. Nevertheless, I wouldn't have any money left after renting an apartment and buying food for one year without any income.

2) Quit my job and go to a bootcamp, like the Recurse Center. A good option to get some projects to expose on GitHub I suppose? I could also simply
quit my job and work by myself, but I know myself, and while I love computer science, the obligation of regular working hours will provide much better results.
However, I already have a Computer Science degree and I'm kind of worried about the negative impact a bootcamp might have on my resume.

3) Get an internship. I already sent a few resumes, but didn't get any response. Maybe because recruiters in France have a strong risk aversion.
Or is my profile simply to weak for the kind of jobs I'm targeting? Let me be clear, I'm not hoping to work at a Big 4 or on the Linux scheduler right
away, but I would like a first good and interesting experience.

Any advice?"
5kkkds,3,2016-12-27,Help with college pros and cons,sushithoughts,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/5kkkds/help_with_college_pros_and_cons/,"I'm a senior in high school, and I'm coming to the dreaded time of the year where I'm forced to make a decision about the next 4 years of my life. I know this is a decision I need to make but I'm really struggling with getting unbiased advice on this. Also I apologize if this gets long.

I've applied to 5 colleges and narrowed the list down to 2. For the sake of clarity I'll name them college A and college B in this post. 

To preface, the major I've technically applied to is a very specific and selective major. The first 3 years of college is spent fulfilling the prerequisites and whatnot, while the 4th year is the ""professional"" year where I would attend the work site and go through clinical rotations, sort of like an internship.

In my state, there's only one college with that 4th ""professional"" year, let's call it college A. College A is about 25 minutes away from my (parents') house, so if I chose to apply there for all 4 years, I would likely live with my parents for at least 3 more years. However, the commute sucks and it's not a traditional college, it's a commuter school and basically just a large building with many classrooms in it. I'm not the type of person that really feels the need to have that traditional college experience though, so that's not much of a con for me.

College B is about 90 minutes away from my house and is more of a traditional college. I would live in a dorm freshman year which would allow me independence (I think this is pretty important) from my parents. However, I would only be attending college B for the first 3 years since I would be transferred to college A for the 4th ""professional"" year. 

The reason I'm having such a hard time deciding is because if I attended college A, I wouldn't have to go through the whole application/interview process for the 4th year since I would automatically be accepted (assuming I kept a good GPA during the completion of my 3 years of prerequisites). If I went to college B, I would have to fill out an application, find teacher recommendations, as well as write an essay, get interviewed, etc. And even then, I'm not guaranteed acceptance to the program. 

As someone who gets stressed and anxious extremely easily, college B seems like a recipe for anxiety for me. I'll be stressed about having time to myself considering I'll likely have a roomate, I'll be stressed about figuring out a way to get to work and to home considering I won't have a car, and I'll be stressed about possibly not being accepted to the 4th year of the program, in which case I'll be stuck. My parents think college B would be best for me since I'd be getting that traditional college experience, but I don't see a need for that if all it's going to bring me is stress.  

As far as cost goes, college B is going to be more expensive since I'll be living on campus. However, if I attend college A, I'll have a car since I'll have to commute there, so that would add to the cost a little bit. 

That last factor that's making this decision really difficult is the friendships I may or may not make. I feel like it would be almost impossible to make friends at college A since I'll only be there to go to class. Once class is over, I'll be heading home. College B, being a stereotypical school, would be so much easier to make friends since I'll be surrounded by people. That fact also worries me, though, since I'm very introverted and need a lot of time to myself.

I know this post is a mess but that's where my brain is at right now. I would love any bit of advice/wisdom on what you guys think would be a better choice. I just need some strangers to help me out. 

Thank you! :)"

Or did you give a straightforward answer?,RedAndNegroTrees,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/5klett/why_cmu_essay_anyone_wrote_down_a_narrative_and/,"Edit: This is not my essay, but is this form/structure/organization fine for CMU essays? Or is it too weak? 

To me, the real hero of the James Bond movies isn’t James Bond - it’s Q, the genius hacker who engineers Bond’s gadgets, cracks his codes, and makes all of his missions possible. When I was fourteen, I watched a real-life Q demonstrate ethical hacking at a presentation hosted by my summer camp. The smiling, charismatic man invited a girl in the front to create a password on his laptop. He then tapped a few keys, launched a projector screen, and announced that he would crack the password in less than three minutes. I didn’t believe him, but then I watched, breathless, as the phrase “wheat_thins” crawled across the screen, letter by letter. I was awestruck. I later decided to find out more about hacking by applying to the Cyber Technologies Academy, an after-school cybersecurity training program offered by Sandia National Laboratories.

Arriving to my first class, I felt insecure about my abilities because I had little experience with cybersecurity. However, as soon as the class started, my insecurity dissolved into a pool of bubbly excitement. Through challenging lessons, I was learning how to hack. My favorite exercise was called “Infiltrate the Death Star.” When I launched the exercise, my screen went black, and bright green text popped up every five seconds to remind me that the Death Star was secure, meaning that the firewall was still up. I rapidly typed phrases like “sudo ifconfig” and “netcat 1148,” commands I’d learned only a few days earlier, to navigate through the computer networks like Luke Skywalker zooming through space. Typing the commands felt like speaking a new language - confusing, off-balance, but electric with excitement. When I finally won the game, I didn’t stop grinning for hours.

One of the instructors noticed my enthusiasm, and asked me to apply for an internship at the Academy for the summer. Several weeks later, I found myself standing in front of the room as a teaching assistant for the same class that had triggered such anxiety when I first took the course. I helped guide the new students through the exercises, and I often got the chance to lecture when the instructor was busy. I’ve always been an impatient learner, but presenting new and complex material such as the architecture of web servers to teenagers required me to slow down and consider how best to teach a class of diverse thinkers. I was also hired as a developer, writing new code to help make the course accessible to people outside of Sandia, such as local high school students and teachers. My work contributed to the U.S. government’s interest in expanding cybersecurity education to strengthen the technical workforce and bolster national security.

Cybersecurity is a fascinating intersection of two of my passions: computer science and political science. It is powerfully relevant to every aspect of society today, from the military to the medical sector. To explore such a complex topic, I look to Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science. The requirements to earn a B.S. in Computer Science include a required minor or double major in a second subject, meaning that I will have the chance to investigate cybersecurity outside of its purely technical characteristics. At Carnegie Mellon, I will have a multitude of opportunities to participate in world-changing cybersecurity research, even as a freshman, at places such as the CyLab Mobility Research Center. I am also intrigued by the fact that Carnegie Mellon’s core Computer Science curriculum includes an in-depth study of topics such as cultural analysis and economic, political, and social institutions. I believe that looking at critical issues in technology with an open mind and a mature grasp of the humanities is extremely important to being a computer scientist. For example, I could not imagine exploring the future of cybersecurity without considering the political ripple effects of Edward Snowden, the moral ramifications of the quantum encryption revolution, and the relationship between technology and income inequality. Curious and excited to engage in a multifaceted study of computer science, I am confident that I will find a home at Carnegie Mellon."

I graduated ~2 years ago with a BA in Communication Studies and minor in Marketing. After taking a summer marketing internship, I realized that a marketing career was just not what I had hoped it would be. Unfortunately, I only had a semester left before completing my degree program when I came to this realization, so it was too late to switch gears and change majors. Long story short, since graduating, I took a marketing job and, in my spare time, have learned - or in some cases tried to learn - various data science tools, like: Tableau, R, SQL, advanced Excel, basic Python, etc. I'm even leading a Tableau User Group meeting in my community and trying to stay up to date with a Data Science meetup in the area.


I'm trying to get a job as a data analyst of some sort, but am having a hard time quantifying my self-paced learnings (I also have a Tableau Public portfolio that I share in my resume/applications). Because of this experience, I've actually considered going back to school part-time for a BS in computer science, but I'm wondering if it is a waste of time/money/effort to do so, since I already have a Bachelors degree. 


In your opinion, should I take the two years to complete a BS in computer science or would I be better off trying to get into a graduate program? When looking for jobs in data science, is a degree important? Has not having a relevant degree kept you from getting jobs in the data science field? Thank you! :)"

I am currently a third year at University of California Berkeley looking for a summer internship. I am a double major in Computer Science and Pure Math, and am graduating next fall. My interests mainly concern data science and low dimensional topology. I have a lot of experience with big data and machine learning, having served as a consultant in a data lab on campus. Currently, I am working on a research project which hopes to apply machine learning to grey-box fuzzing techniques used to help validate general programs. I am located in Berkeley, CA but am open to positions elsewhere. If anyone is interested, please PM me and I can provide more information as well as my resume. Thanks!"

Consider looking for programming oriented lab opportunities.,Ireallycantremember1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5kn404/for_those_still_in_school_in_a_noncs_major/,"This is probably easier for those in stem programs, but probably not strictly limited to those majors. 

On more than one occasion I was told by interviewers that the work I did as an undergraduate researcher caught their eye (the only software experience I had at the time). The barrier to entry is much easier than a software internship, especially if you can find programming oriented roles (including matlab) in a lab in your field (abundant in most stem fields). I didn't even do much in the lab, but it gave me the ability to talk about a tangible project and the fact that I contributed to it in a team environment."

So, with New Years around the corner, I've decided to start a little early and work on one of my resolutions, which is to successfully find a job or internship. However, **I've had some difficulty landing any in the past for a variety of reasons.**

For one, **I'm 21 years old** and, though I'm definately not proud of it whatsoever, I will admit that **I've never had a job in my entire life.** I absolutely hate blaming my ADD for it, but due to the;

* inconsistency of applying
* constantly forgetting about me applying in the first place
* less than decent grades during my high school career

...It's definately kept me from getting one. **And due to the fact that I have no experience, my resume has looked less desirable for employers.** 

**I've decided that this can't go on forever and I REALLY need to find a job or internship.** I've gone to the career center department on campus and though they've helped me tremendously in so many other ways, **I still have no luck finding anything.** 

**Do you guys have any tips on landing one, or even success stories on how you guys have managed to find a job/internship?**  

Thanks so much! "

I have a $9 an hour IT job (internship) that I've had for 6 months. Being a full time student, it's hard to do even 20 hours  a week, as they are closed on weekends. 

Everyone who lives in this house seems to be continually depressed/angry, and I think it's played a major role in my own depression. This is mostly because of financial issues on my parent's side. 

My parents are both severely in debt, most likely will not have money to retire. On top of this, my mother has a victim mentality and places blame on others for her own shortcomings. I have tried to help my mother get more clients for her cleaning business (I know a bit about marketing), but she has continuously denied me. I think that she just doesn't want to work more than 12 hours a week, despite their financial issues. 

My parents also have alcohol/marijuana problems. I come home from work or school most days to see either one or both of them drunk/high, and it makes me super uncomfortable. I feel like I'm watching them go down a shitty path, and it makes me feel horrible. I've tried to help them stop, but they continue none-the-less. 

I can't afford an apartment and I have no friends so I cannot room with anyone. Should I move into my truck to avoid all of the conflict that comes with living at my parent's home? Could I afford to live like that with my job? I just can't seem to make that decision myself, as I don't know whether it would make me feel better or worse about my life. 

Please feel free to give advice in the comments. If you need more information about my situation, let me know and I'll provide it. If I'm being irrational, please tell me. I'm tired of not knowing if I am wrong or right.

Part 3",Torakaa,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5ko3ak/tales_from_testing_test_it_all_what_how_i_have_no/,"Oh, the go for testing the merge. How much I dreaded that Monday in writing as in life. That being said, this is only part of a longer story, except now with 100% less tense switches. See [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5kbok2/tales_from_testing_test_it_all_what_how_i_have_no/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5kgfps/tales_from_testing_test_it_all_what_how_i_have_no/) for context.

Refresher on characters involved:

$Me: Duh.  
$Vet: One of the most senior testers in the team. Since our company's chain of command is as flat as the paper you'd write it on, she'd be in charge of the subteam as far as that goes. However, she was also very busy due to her experience.  
$Sec: Once something of a secretary with more responsibility, asked to be transferred to testing to get a more in-depth look at code and stuff. I couldn't get the idea of having my own secretary out of my head, but avoided treating her like one.  
$New: Our newest arrival, straight out of school, very shy, took a two-week vacation not far into the job.  
$Rel: A relative of one of our devs. Had a habit of finding his wallpapers changed to various ponies (i.e. leaving his PC unlocked.)  
$Tester1: My original trainer. Somehow significantly more knowledgeable on the systems than any other tester despite being my senior by only two months.  
$Dev1-3: Various devs working on our project. None exactly worthy of note.  
$PDev1-3: Devs working on the product that was merged into ours.

Summer has hardly calmed, but a dribble of rain covered the land. At least the heat would not be as awful as other days. It also woke me early. I grapple an impulse to stay in bed. Perhaps if I amputate a muscle or two they'll let me off? Which ones, though? Could I live without those? You don't need all that stuff in your foot anyway, right?

I am eventually won over by ~~reason~~ knowing that I have to work to get paid. And I won't be accepted into school without work experience to show. So really I'm getting paid to get into my favorite school!

Testing go isn't scheduled for approximately another two hours. I shred through our documentation once more, in hopes to see it filled out. Nope. None of it has been changed what-so-frickin-ever. Most are still short pages with nothing more than ""verify feature works"" without any descriptions of how to even find the feature. At least they filled in responsible devs even if not Pdevs. Their time is worth about five times more than ours, but who am I to care. I'm just a dumb little drone doing my assigned job.

I'm already slightly sour at ""them"" since I noticed testers don't appear in the employee book or gain many of the marketed employee benefits, both of which even the straight-from-middle-school interns get. They're liars, the bunch of them. But I suppose none of that was in my contract, so I'm just a rat in a cage. The daily standup rolls around and I can already see everyone is on edge.

&gt; $Tester1: ""We'll just skip the daily prediction today as we will all be doing the same thing. 1 should be about ready, hop in there. Fill in your progress, come to me if there are problems.""

Everyone disperses to join their respective devs' standups. I stay behind for a moment.

&gt; $Me: ""Question. I assume I am missing something, because there's nothing useful in these test cases. Any material besides what you showed us?""

&gt; $Tester1: ""The actual cases are linked in the ID, you saw those?""

&gt; $Me: ""Yup. But there's practically nothing.""

&gt; $Tester1: ""Well, that's all there is. Ask the listed devs, you don't have to be particularly in-depth, just find the most obvious so the presentation won't randomly encounter a bug. They'll be testing their specific scenarios, anyway.""

Alright. That's work that should have been done weeks ago by the test cases' original authors, but alright. I suppose working out what a feature is and isn't supposed to do could be classified as exploratory testing? I should be able to manage that without too much additional effort, but $Sec lacks experience in the overall systems. Just to be safe, I toss another five hours onto the estimate. Now sixty-five hours not including ticketing and retests, to be fit into the remaining ninety-two person hours. Everything is fine. Everything is awesome.

While our docs (what docs?) don't mention it, I can make a pretty good guess from context where the new features are meant to be. Except, when I dig into the client, they are not there. Odd. Perhaps that one only shows on the right orders? It is meant for a special product that I spent days studying, after all. Or it's in here? Does it have its own window?

You can guess where this is headed. Worse yet than not functioning, the features are simply nowhere to be found. I check with $Sec and she is facing a similiar problem. But that's why we have devs, after all! To the IM, Robin!

&gt; $Me: ""Hey, we're meant to be testing these and those features but we aren't really making progress. As in, we can't find the buttons the test cases talk about. Any insight?""

&gt; $Dev1: ""I know that it's meant to be there. Come over and let's have a look at it.""

Building plan says $Dev1 sits all of thirty feet away from us. Could've saved the effort of IM, really. But at least he knows more!

&gt; $Dev1: ""So, you're saying you can't find it? What server are you testing on?""

&gt; $Me: ""1. The way I'm reading the cases, it should be in that tab.""

He opens the client and connects. Through the murmuring of dev things I wouldn't understand (or perhaps cursing the VM's speed) some things come clear.

&gt; $Dev1: ""So, from here, drop down menu and... not there. You're right. That other one you mentioned... find order, right click, also not there. Hmm. $Dev3 is the actual supporting dev for this, but she's on vacation. I have an idea, though.""

He jumps into the network with the speed of a ravenous shark, using hotkeys and mouse in tandem to dig through countless pages that I really wouldn't understand. He scans some odd diagram for a few moments, then turns back to me.

&gt; $Dev1: ""If this is correct, the changes were never merged into our actual branch. You should see $Pdev1 about that, though.""

I'm not exactly shy. You can't be in this kind of job. Still there are dozens of solutions I'd want to try before disturbing the Pdevs when they are busy doing *something important*, I'm sure. Probably developing $Product, I'd guess. On the other hand, these are once again my last weeks and the writing on the wall is pretty clear. Screw IM, let's just head for his office.

Between breaks and various nonsense, it has already become quite afternoon-ish. Energy is dropping. Doesn't help that the Pdevs are on the second floor (that's second above the ground floor) either. I'm sure he is just as excited to see me and $Sec as I am to see him.

&gt; $Me: ""Hi, we're working on the merge test, specifically these features. $Dev1 says they're not in. Two questions: Can you fix that, and can you tell us what the feature is meant to do?""

&gt; $PDev1: ""Let's see. That is in fact not committed, I'll just toss it in [So it had been reviewed but not committed?] and you can start working when you get a redeploy. As for the functionality, let me just pull up $Product. You see, it does this, and that, if you do this...""

He had a box of candies on his desk. Bright red. We were allowed to take some once the lecture was finished. That raises morale but not my mood. On the way to our office, we discuss options:

&gt; $Sec: ""What's next?""

&gt; $Me: ""Unless you feel like two hours of overtime, there's no sense to bother redeploying a server. It will not be online in time to allow much testing, and remember the index rebuild takes most of its performance afterwards. We're better off waiting for the daily redeploy. Until then I'd recommend we check other features for existence.""

Short version, we ran through the list of our assigned features and found similiar results on every single one. Followed by raising hell with a dev, followed by seeing a pdev to commit the changes, then followed by mild swearing. At least it is over, I figured, and it will be fixed by tomorrow. I copied down what I could remember, which was still more than the docs we had. Those written by the designers themselves. But we could finally begin actual testing and make progress. The thing that we should have made from the start. You'd really think, considering all the hype they built around it, they'd bother to include the stuff in the code! It's like selling a house, but only during the sale process is it revealed that you never bothered to actually build it!

Usually means all kinds of issues, that, but I suppose we don't get paid for succeeding as mcuh as trying. Everything was set and ready for testing.

Join us next time, where 1/25 is reliable and upper management yells at slightly less upper management."

Please take in mind that to me, besides work itself and compensation, living alone and close to work is extremely important to me. I'd really appreciate any input!

The first option is the Big Company- I previously interned here in Sunnyvale. I found the experience pretty enjoyable, because I was placed with an OK team and great manager. On the other hand, I could tell that there was generally a pretty cutthroat and bureaucratic atmosphere. The work was pretty interesting, and I learned a lot. Rumors generally do hold true, and getting placed with a good team makes all the difference. Suffice to say, I would not be returning to this team, because I hated the location. I would be moving to an unknown team in Seattle if I accepted this offer.

The second option is a Startup Unicorn in SF. I definitely enjoyed working here more as an intern, mostly because of the smaller size and because I had a great mentor and did some really meaningful work. I did not however click as much with my manager as I did with the one in Amazon, though he was pretty good. I would be returning to the same team.

All in all, I think there is a high probability I would enjoy the actual work at the startup much more. On the other hand, I would most certainly enjoy living under the big company's compensation a lot more, because living close to work is so damn important to me (call me spoiled, but I think the happiness cut down from commuting is invaluable). If I lived close to work in a single in SF I'd probably have to put in 2.5-3k for a single, which would be doable but would result in more budgeting than I'd like. Still, despite weighing the pros and cons, I really don't know what choice I prefer. Below I list the pros and cons:

Big Company Pros:

* Love living in Seattle (love the gloomy weather + decent nightlife)
* Much higher total compensation (~140k for Seattle offer)
* Lower COL in Seattle + no state income tax (so comp way better)
* Easily afford a nice place within a walkable distance to work
* Good brand name
* 401k matching
* Would learn best coding practices

Big Company Cons:

* I don't like the bureaucratic and overly-frugal culture
* Most of my close friends are in the bay area so I'd start off lonely
* Not returning to my original team so this could be a hit or miss
* I don't like the cubicle lifestyle
* Probably more potential for career growth in the bay area
* I don't like how big the company is
* Crappy PTO (like two weeks, and they're really strict about it)

Startup Pros:

* The work I will be doing will definitely be very interesting
* The people I would work with are all very knowledgable
* I would like my team and coworkers
* Free lunch most days and ability to WFH once/week
* Pre-IPO- at a perfect stage to learn a shit ton
* I already have a lot of friends in the bay area and know it well

Startup Cons:

* Located in expensive part of SF: Since one of my requirements is living close to work I'd probably have to pay 2.5-3k in rent
* Lower total compensation (~120k salary and nothing but options)
* SF = High COL + insane tax (probably 66% goes to take-home)
* No 401k matching
* Joining during series-F funding so stock won't amount to much
* If I do choose to take the 40 min commute life I will be miserable

I can send more information in a PM (company name/who I am/etc) if any of you have any interest, but first I thought I would just get a feel what you guys think. 

I work at a small (1.3 million in net sales last year) IT/Software Development company in the Greater Houston area. It is a family owned business with about 10 employees and we are looking to expand and build our business and I would like to extend the offer to my alma mater first! 

There are 3 main positions/areas that we are trying to fill. The first and most essential is an experienced Ruby on Rails developer, we have several apps that we are working on, we currently have 2 full time developers and are contracting out the rest of the work out, but we would like to get another full time developer in house. The other part of our business is System Management and VOIP management so an asterisk guru with computer skills would be needed. Most of our employees are mobile and can hop between different parts of the business so if you have some asterisk expierence and also know Ruby on Rails that could be a good fit! The last position we are looking for is a Financial Analyst. In a sense you could be the CFO of the company and would have a bookkeeaper, working under you. You would be in charge of making and managing the forecasts, cash flow statements, and other financial reports. 

The thing about working at this company is there is more work than you can poke a stick at, but don't expect a clear set of instructions or how to steps on what you need to do. Of course we will help you get started and be there for you every step along the way, but you have to be committed to making a difference. We are a small company like I said, but as our company grows your salary grows too. 

The office atmosphere is pretty relaxed, on Fridays some employees bring their dogs to the office and in the afternoon, if we have a good week, we'll have a few beers to end the day. It's a typical 40 hour work week, but if you value your morning time more, that's fine, we have some employees who come in around 10, and leave at 630 daily. If you are getting your work done, we are very flexible with how you work to get it done. 

We could possibly be open to internships as well, but I would really like to get some full time employees in here too. 

Let me know if you any of you would like to talk further! "

I come from a very poor family and ended up majoring in engineering. I worked 5 engineering internships doing everything from aerospace, electrical engineering, mechanical, and software development. I also managed to maintain a nearly 4.0 GPA in the process. But, I'm starting to second guess what is going to make me fulfilled in a career. The reason I worked so many internships in engineering was because, although some kept me busy with interesting projects and cultures in tech, they always felt like something was missing and  kept me from fully feeling fulfilled.

Aside from engineering, I love talking to people, painting, writing, and also have wished I could travel more too. Don't get me wrong, I still love tech, but feel like my engineering jobs have stripped away that feeling I would always get when I was working on MY projects in MY time. Every time I get a software project, I find myself drifting off thinking of other things while I code.

And it may be just me feeling burnt out due to not recharging or making sure I stayed a balanced person. But I also feel that type of sacrifice is what is expected in engineering culture, which is not making my situation better.

What makes this tougher is I'm about to graduate, and have actually turned down several good engineering job offers. I know how concrete it is to have a career in STEM, and I have friends asking for counter offers even when offered $80,000 a year FOR THEIR FIRST JOB. But I'm also worried that the personal growth I've needed, the time to recharge a little, and the time needed to evaluate what makes me the most fulfilled will be much harder to have.

What would you do in this situation? What advice would you have for someone like me?"

From the context of the posting, it seems like the company will read over all resumes and choose however many for interviews by January 13th or so. I submitted my resume through the board and also through the company's external website, so I'm just waiting to hear back.

My question is this: I found someone on LinkedIn who is probably the right recruiter to talk to for this position, but I'm not sure if/how to email this person. Should I bother sending a follow up email to this University Recruiter expressing my interest and qualifications for the position? If so, what else should I say/how should I write it?

I'm concerned that the recruiter will get annoyed or think that I am a suck-up, but on the flip side I haven't ever gotten an interview, and I have a feeling this may be the thing I've been missing that could help me out. What do you all think?"

I have a pretty average, possibly even mediocre resume, but I guess I'm not really one to judge those things.

I go to a university with a well regarded CS program (not MIT/CMU/Stanford tier, maybe 1 notch below), with an average GPA around 3.0, one summer internship involving database stuff, a few personal projects (respectable but nothing crazy), and that's about it. I'm in an area that's considered a pretty large tech hub.

This semester I've had 7 companies ask me to apply who found me through my resume online and I've gotten through the interview process with a few who seem very interested in me. I have multiple very competitive offers in a short span of time (after technical phone screens and then in person technical interviews). These are not well known multinational companies but they seem to be real given that I've had interviews and met with the people. Still, I am slightly suspicious. I know CS is an in demand field but I see so many posts here of people struggling to just land one interview, some people applying to dozens of places with no success. I'm a thoroughly average candidate. I am no overachiever when it comes to academics and have always winged most of my exams. It just makes me skeptical as to why so many places are reaching out to me. Almost too good to be true, you know?

The one thing that could set me apart and give me an edge is that I am a more gifted programmer than test taker, which means my GPA could be signaling a lower ability than I really have. I tend to do well in technical interviews, and my project grades are always way higher than my test grades. I never find myself needing to go to a TA for help with a coding assignment.

But I'm still baffled as to why these places are contacting me based on my resume alone and then giving such handsome offers after a few technical interviews with mostly no brainer coding problems. The hardest problem I've been given was to implement basically a variation of a linked list, along with a few simple iterative and recursive function problems + easy textbook questions on OO design, data structures, and my personal projects."

Been self-teaching for about a year now.

I had originally planned on doing OSU's online post-bacc program. It seemed perfect for me - finish in a year or 1.5 years, all online, and ready to embark in this industry. Well, I got rejected (not sure why...the results seemed sort of random) from OSU so I decided to instead attend ASU in person.

I met with my academic adviser today and learned that the program was going to take me 2.5 years IF I take a full load every semester and in the summers simply because of how they laid out the program.

Now I'm not sure what to do. I could re-apply for OSU and hopefully get in for the Spring start. It would be easier (no math courses), shorter, and the cost is about the same. However, ASU is probably more well known, I'm sure has more connections, and might provide me with better opportunities for internships while I am there.

What would you do in my situation?"

Implementing voice recognition on IoT devices, like alexa voice and raspberry pi type stuff, in Java and some node, this job is in Toronto, my home city and I'd live at home. Another offer I had in SF, which was data engineering of their analytics data, SQL, redshift and ETL pipelines. The first job also involves remote work as well, and it's a flexible combination of in office and home (mostly remote though). It's a small team and only other person at the office is the CEO himself. The job is nice and I get paid very well (&gt;$40/hr) and I live at home. Although, the california job would pay me $9k/month and while I would save more in california (especially considering USD-&gt;CAD exchange rate) I ended up taking the one closer to home (the first job) and not california. I'm in my second year in CS and this is my second internship (first was web dev). I'm having second thoughts now, I'm thinking about how awesome the california job would've been, with a lot more coworkers and a different city. Instead I took the one closer to home, because I was scared of the unknown and going to a new place. I don't know if I made the right decision. I could always go to the california job next internship term, but I wanna aim for a larger company then (big 4) and I feel like I wasted a perfectly good opportunity because I thought I wasn't ready, when really thinking back at it, the california job would've been great. Is the IoT experience gonna be helpful to me (I do find both fields interesting, IoT and data engineering) going forward? It is a lot more unique and more low level than data engineering. Did I really waste an opportunity or is it good that I'm working in a different area than last internship (I did ETL pipelines in RoR, but nothing in redshift)?  I'm interested in ML as well and I'm working on some projects on my own to help me out for next term. Sometimes I think at the prospect of the california job and feel regretful, it's been on my mind for a while now.

5ktlk0,1,2016-12-28,New Grad. Could use some guidance.,slashemup,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ktlk0/new_grad_could_use_some_guidance/,"Hi All,

I just graduated from a local, but decently well known college with a BS in CS. My GPA has not been finalized, but I expect it to be around my previous cumulative GPA of 3.77. (Don't let the GPA fool you; I was able to breeze by a lot of classes, especially some CS classes due to lackluster professors)

I've had a job the past three summers, though only 1 of them (most recent, Summer 2016) was actually an ""internship"", one was a Junior Developer role and the other was a Tech Support role. Two of those 3 were at Fortune 500 companies (not sure if that makes a difference).

I've got a couple projects under my belt, but they are entirely academic. Both were an Android app, but the second was part of a larger senior capstone project. I also have a side project (another Android app) I'm working on for fun/learning, that I could publish on GitHub if need be. 

I didn't apply to any positions during the semester, but I did do some cursory searching for positions. I figured I would spend a little time after the semester to work on projects and the like to get prepared for interviews at the least.

After looking at this sub (cardinal sin, I know), I can't but feel woefully unprepared. I know it's common question among new grads. I've also looked at Glassdoor for interview questions for the roles I was looking at, and again, felt unprepared.

To combat this, I started delving into HackerRank yesterday to brush up on some interview prep. I'm going to stick with it for a bit to get some decent practice in. 

That being said, there are a couple of looming concerns I have, namely:

1) Coding Interview questions. How difficult can I expect these questions to be? I'm able to figure out a good amount of the questions on HackerRank, but I'm worried when I fail at a seemingly ""easy"" question. I know the saying is ""practice, practice, practice"", but I can't feel like I should be able to bang out these problems with ease if I expect to get anywhere in the interview process.

2) Should I spend all this free time doing interview prep as I've been doing, or should I send out applications regardless of the aforementioned point? I feel like I should wait and do some practice before even bothering to apply, but I keep seeing the contrary. 

Thanks for any advice in advance.

P.S. I know these type of questions get asked a lot. However, I couldn't find specific answers to my questions given the circumstances.

I've been programming for a little over three years now, though most of it was high school courses so it's not like I have a solid three years of experience. Java is easily my strongest language and backend work is what I like the most.

Now for my situation. I'm applied to quite a lot of places over the past few months and haven't had a ton of luck hearing back. I've gotten four interviews so far. I'm waiting to move on in the interview process with Company A, and although I applied second to Company B, they offered me a job only a few days after I finished the interview process.

Company A is in a better location, likely pays better, and I think I would be doing work that I'm more interested in (with Java and such).

However, Company B still pays quite well (more than I expected for a freshman) and is in a pretty decent location too. I would likely be working with JS and other front end languages, which they said they understood I didn't know well and would easily help me catch up on the learning curve. I don't want to downplay the work for Company B though, I wouldn't be designing Wordpress sites, I would be working as a SWE intern on a team of other actual SWEs and making changes, adding features, fixing bugs, etc. on a product used by a couple million active users.

**Finally to get to the point**, I have a deadline for Company B that is coming up pretty soon. I don't think Company A will be done interviewing me by then and am tempted to ask for an extension of 1-2 weeks. It's not that I definitely want company A over company B, I just would like to be able to compare the offers. I know asking for an extension is semi common practice and shouldn't be taken as rude, but I can't help worrying that as a freshman they'll see me in a bad light and potentially even rescind my offer. I understand I could accept the offer and then potentially renege, but I would rather not burn bridges so early in. I would just feel bad, as the second company does look like a great time and do seem really interested in me.

**TL;DR:** Got an offer from a company which looks quite interesting, but waiting on results from another company which I find equally interesting. Unsure if out of line to ask for an extension as a freshman and if I should just accept the offer and move on. "

I am a high school senior going to school in central Texas. I love computer science and software development and want to pursue it full time after going to college. Development for Web, iOS, and VR is where I have really maintained my focus. 

However, I am having a difficult time choosing which college I want to attend for CS. Essentially, my first choice is UT in Austin which has a beautiful campus, computer science department, and city in general. I toured their facilities and sat in on a class and loved every minute of it. The people are nice and I really like the culture in Austin (besides the traffic.) However, I would come out of UT around 100k in debt, something I would like to avoid if at all possible. 

My other option is to go to Texas State which is smaller and less prestigious but I would receive around $64,000 or more in scholarship money. They have an accomplished CS department as well, but not at the level of UT. I could come out of school there practically debt free if I worked some during the time there and I have some in savings. You see my dilemma. 

I don’t know if this helps at all but I have had some internship experience already doing iOS development for a small company in the Austin area my freshman year of high school. I was also accepted to another internship for college students my junior year but that fell through. My main focus in college would be software development: mobile and VR are where I would love to get my foot in the door.

So I would ask for any advice you guys have to offer. should I go to the high quality but more expensive college, get a better education, and make good connections in the Austin area or go the smaller school but pay far less in tuition and board and possibly transfer to UT after for my graduate degree?

My college experience was studying, internships, more studying, stressing out about exams, having to wonder why my classes are so tough, and a lot more studying. I missed out, plain and simple.

Now when I hit ""the real world"" I hear that now is the time for me to ""grow up"" and get over all of the ""silliness"" that I never had a chance to take part in in the first place. In fact just looking back at it, I found it was the spoiled kids in Greek Life who were having the ""college experience"" at most schools in my area anyways as well as the college I ended graduating from.

Seeing those large social gatherings, college kids doing fun stuff together in large groups, parties, and all of that. I didn't get that and I aspired to get it after college in my 20s when I had money but now I hear that isn't realistic because I am supposed to be a ""grown up"" now. Now, everyone my age is supposedly too good for parties, social gatherings, making new friends, and having fun which they had in college, something I didn't have.

In a way, I can understand why some college kids have the evil thoughts they do. I find myself turning bitter, hating humanity, hating society, and almost taking pleasure in college kids and even others my age (20s) suffering like hell because of what I missed out on in college. Yet at the same time I keep this small glimmer of hope that maybe there is something out there to where I can get what I want out of social life despite not being in college. Maybe I don't have to die and go to heaven in order to get the kind of social life I want.

This summer, I am planning to work in a physics labs to code some sorts of artificial intelligence. Last summer, I worked in Japan as a SWE Intern in a robotics company. 

I realized I love learning physics, but I do not want to continue doing Ph.D. and work in academia. I am thinking of applying to CS coterm, and I had a few questions that I really want to ask to all of you.

1. I am attending one of the top3 CS schools; would this help me in terms of getting a job after getting master's degree in CS?

2. I already committed to a research lab at my university's physics department, so I don't think I would be able to do software engineering internship this year (I am a sophomore). What could I do during summer to increase the chance to get an internship position in my junior summer while doing my best to contribute in the research lab?

3. I love data analysis, machine learning, and data mining more than HCI. Would I be able to work on these after getting the master's degree in CS with bachelor's in Physics?

4. I am an international student from Japan. Would this be a big disadvantage in terms of getting a job in CS?

Sorry for the long question. I appreciate your help in advance. Thank you so much for spending time for me."
5l485l,9,2016-12-30,I will be graduating from college in April with a Computer Information Systems degree and have a question about experience and jobs.,james499112,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5l485l/i_will_be_graduating_from_college_in_april_with_a/,"As the title says, I will be graduating in April with a CIS degree with a concentration in Security and a minor in Business Administration. I am pretty nervous about getting a job right out of college. I have worked the past 3 years at Publix and would love to work for corporate doing some kind of IT work, but I am not too hopeful about getting something there because it is very competitive and they don't hire a ton of people. 
Anyways, Every job listing I look at requires at least 5 years of experience, which I obviously will not have right out of college. I would love to get some experience doing something IT related right now, such as an internship, but I live in bumfuck Alabama and there are hardly any kind of IT jobs around here. I live in Atlanta, so that is the area I will be looking for jobs in.
So now here is my question...what are some projects I could do at home to give me some useful, hands on, experience? I am willing to buy any kind of equipment that I don't already have (I have a couple routers, a raspberry pi, a switch, a desktop, and a laptop) if you have any suggestions for projects.
In the courses I have taken, I have learned mostly theory. I have done some applied stuff in my programming, networking and computer security courses, but I feel as if the assignments my professors had me doing were pretty trivial and not very useful. I want to complete some cool projects in my spare time that I may be able to put on a resume or tell an employer about.

Thanks!

Lived abroad for about  3.5 years, was on a visa that didn't allow me to work, then when I had a work visa found out the only job I could get were teaching English (for which I had no desire or background or willingness to be a part of an insanely exploitative system). Briefly had a non-teaching job but quit after surmounting sexism/harassment and bigotry that the company refused to do anything about. SO's income was enough to support us, so I didn't have to work. He didn't want kids, so I was a stay at home sans the kidlets. 

Background is a mix of HR (~3 years) and social work (volunteer, internships in college/graduate school, one year paid employment), master's degree in social work, but I'm only 29 so work history is brief (due to time in school, time abroad/unemployed). 

Moving back in May/June to the states. Terrified that I'm basically unemployable at this point. 

*staying as a (childless) housewife is not an option. I sank into deep depression while abroad due to not working/reliance on SO. I love working, being productive, having my own life and income, etc.

**while abroad and interviewing in the host country the minute my ""reason for being there"" came up, I  was immediately refused employment (""oh, a spouse...clearly you won't be staying..."" ""oh, you're married so clearly as a woman, you're going to have kids, you won't be staying.."" etc.) so I've got some interview trauma I'm working to combat as well (haha) 


Any suggestions? 
Would recruiting agencies be a better idea than trying directly hire?
Best practice to account for gap due to SO's moving us abroad for his job/his contract and the visa more or
Less barring me from working?
Things to note in CL or things to leave out?

I'm not sure if I should continue down the CS route. I'm not experienced with coding, and I find that I shy away from applying to software engineering internships...

I wanted to do really well in this major, but I've heard CS classes only get harder, and I barely understood the material in CS31 even after long nights of studying. I feel like if I continue, I will barely scrape by in CS classes.

So I suppose my question is: How do I know if I should keep trying with this major? What are signs that I should switch?"

Some concerns I have:

* I have no problem with HTML, but my CSS skills are lacking as I tend to rely on CSS frameworks such as bootstrap or copying and pasting from stack overflow. I am assuming this is a problem.

* I am fairly comfortable with JavaScript from all the HTML5 games that I have made. However, I have some considerable knowledge gaps in jQuery, angularJS, and JavaScript frameworks in general. 

Here are the questions I have for you all: 

* What skills are absolute must have's for a recent college grad for a front-end dev job?

* Is it more difficult to get a front-end position as opposed to other development roles?

* If I want to be at a huge silicon valley company, should I be spending more time on coding interview questions over learning new front-end skills?

* What attracts me to this kind of role is the creative side of it. Does that mean I would be better suited as a UX designer? What's the difference?

My GPA is around 2.82 after a bad grade on this last semester. Next semester I'm transferring to university and should be around a 3.25 overall with a relatively high gpa at university alone. I have 58 credits towards by CS degree. Most of those credits are gen ed. credits and I've only taken my intro class so far. Next semester I'll take intermediate programming and math foundations for CS.

Basically, I need an internship that pays well enough so that I can pay for my rent over this coming summer as my parents are giving me the boot. I know of a place that pays $20-25 an hour for technical interns and they have a 3.25 gpa requirement. I don't know of any other places but I thought I would be able to ask my career services department at university.

I have about 5 months alongside school to work on some side projects. I've been making a video game in Unity and writing C# scripts with it. What else can I do that will guarantee me a good chance at a job? I don't feel like I'm a very good programmer at the moment.

Prior to starting my current job, I had about 1.5 years of combined internship experience from my time in college.

A few months ago, I asked my boss for a promotion from my current level (the lowest entry-level engineer) to the next one up. Pre-promotion, I was making a reasonable salary for my job level. From the first mention of my desire to be promoted, I checked in about the status every month or so, and my boss mentioned that he would get it through as soon as possible.

Last week, I broke a bone and had to miss work for a few days to be in the hospital. While in the hospital, I checked my electronic paystub and saw, to my surprise, that I had been promoted. However, the salary increase is less than half of what I would have expected.

My questions:

* Should I have discussed my salary expectation with my boss at the very beginning? I had (possibly wrongly) assumed that he would speak with me about this as the time of the promotion rolled around, but obviously this did not happen.
* My plan going forward is to schedule a meeting with my boss and let him know that I think that the company should adjust my salary. Does this sound reasonable, and if so, what is the best way to go about this?"

Imma keep it short and quick. I live with my mom and two brothers (one is severely autistic). Our household income is less than $35k/year. There is no way I can afford tuition (the tuition is more than my fam's income for god's sake) and as an international, most admissions are need-aware. I don't think I'm HYPM/Penn material either so I wouldn't be able to get in need-blind. What do I do? Do I just stick to Canadian unis? It's always been my dream to study at a t20 in the States but it seems that this dream is way too far-fetched at this point. If it matters, my top three universities would be UPenn/NYU/UMich. Honestly I think I'm pretty qualified for NYU and Mich (finance) but UPenn is just too hard to get into. 

I had someone suggest a GoFundMe but funding an NYU education through GoFundMe is just plain unrealistic. I've also been told that I can try taking out a loan (I know RBC can give up to $270k) but is that really wise? Idk any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

If relevant, stats:

GPA: 3.84

SAT: 1520

EC's: Focused on finance/investing and cs. I'd say they're really good and full of leadership and experience (including internship at Raymond James and cofounding an investing nonprofit within my city).

Recs: I already approached two teachers and they said they'll write me solid recs when the time comes

Essays: I'm pretty good I guess

Cheers :)"
